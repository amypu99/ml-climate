Appendix\nINTRODUCTION\nIn 2022, Delta soared out of the pandemic era and into stabilization and recovery. We returned to the skies and found that, once again, the world is a better place thanks to the miracle of safe, efficient and comfortable air travel that connects people and communities worldwide.\n\nAll of this is possible thanks to the dedication, passion and hard work of the 90,000+ people of Delta Air Lines. Because of their efforts, Delta was the most awarded airline in the country in 2022, earning recognition from Fortune as the World\u2019s Most Admired Airline for the 10th year; being honored as the most reliable airline by the Wall Street Journal; and being awarded for outstanding customer service and innovation by The Points Guy, Popular Science, The Beat and more.\n\nAs we look ahead, 2023 is a year in which we continue to transform travel with bold new initiatives like free in-flight Wi-Fi and Delta Sync, a platform to further enhance and personalize the travel experience at all points of the journey. Amid our progress, we will always stay true to our people-oriented values that drive everything we do. To that end, we will continue to focus on the following:\n\n**Making Safety Our No. 1 Priority, Always**\nSafety is in our DNA. In 2022, we continued to put our safety culture front and center as we onboarded thousands of new Delta employees. Our long-standing commitment to our \u201cJust Culture\u201d initiative instills in new employees the mindset that every mistake is an opportunity to learn and that transparency without fear or punishment is essential to keeping our people and customers safe. Just Culture uses collaboration, observation and conversations to review and investigate safety issues and prevent them in the future \u2013 teaching by showing, not telling.\n\nThe program is one of many tools we utilize daily to ensure that safety always comes first.\n\n**Powered by People and Culture**\nOur people have always been at the heart of our success, which is why investing in them was a primary focus of 2022. Despite the lingering financial challenges of the pandemic, we recognized our people\u2019s excellence with a special profit-sharing payment totaling $100 million in February 2022. Three months later, we announced a 4% pay increase for eligible employees worldwide. Finally, in February 2023, we were happy to pay $563 million in 2022 profit-sharing checks to our employees.\n\nDelta\u2019s commitment to our employees\u2019 financial well-being isn\u2019t solely about pay \u2013 it\u2019s about the ability to manage personal finances and save for emergencies as well as retirement. Research shows that one-third of U.S. households cannot come up with $400 cash to cover an emergency expense. To address this problem, we developed a program in partnership with Operation HOPE and Fidelity Investments to give every Delta employee access to a $1,000 emergency savings account and an online financial education and coaching program. In addition, we continue to offer our leading 401(k) program in which over 90% of our employees participated in 2022, featuring a 3% automatic contribution with another 6% company match.\nBuilding a More Equitable World\nDelta is committed to pushing toward a more just and equitable world for all. That includes a commitment to improving the diversity of our people at all levels of the company, with measurable goals and transparency that we outline in our annual \u201cClose the Gap\u201d report. While we still have a long journey ahead, we are heartened to report that Delta increased the representation of women, Black talent and other underrepresented racial and ethnic groups in roles across the company in 2022.\n\nAdditionally, Delta accelerated an essential partnership with OneTen, an organization that aims to hire, promote and advance one million Black individuals into family-sustaining careers over ten years. Our intentional Skills-First approach to identifying talent removes unnecessary barriers to higher-earning jobs and careers, such as eliminating four-year college degree requirements for most roles and establishing a Skills-First Apprenticeship Program and occupation-specific academies \u2013 like our Propel program for pilot talent.\n\nFlying Toward a Sustainable Future\nIn 2022, focus on climate and the environment took on a larger role within Delta as we expanded our leadership oversight to cement sustainability as a core business imperative. We promoted Peter Carter to Executive Vice President of External Affairs, expanding his role leading Delta\u2019s legal, regulatory and government affairs functions to also oversee the airline\u2019s international, innovation and sustainability strategy. We also welcomed Chief Sustainability Officer, Pam Fletcher, to lead our journey to net-zero emissions by 2050, focusing on short-, medium- and long-term initiatives. In the short term, the Delta team is having an immediate impact by reducing single-use plastic consumption on board, electrifying our ground operations and integrating a sustainable mindset across our supply chain. We are building partnerships now to help create an economically viable market for sustainable aviation fuel in the years ahead as innovation and technology expand the nascent industry.\n\nOur fleet continues to improve its efficiency, and last year we ordered 100 Boeing 737-10 aircraft that will be 20\u201330% more fuel efficient than the planes they will replace. Delta\u2019s Carbon Council, which scours our operation for improvements to fuel efficiency, saved over 10 million gallons last year thanks to enhanced winglet installations for drag reduction, weight reduction initiatives and flight routing and speed optimizations.\n\nAnd we\u2019re investing now in technology that carries the potential to have a significant impact over the long term, such as our partnership with Joby Aviation, which will revolutionize the customer journey by offering sustainable home-to-airport travel utilizing electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft.\n\nServing Our Communities\nDelta has long been committed to the communities where we live, work and serve. We focus our giving on the environment, equity, education and wellness while supporting our armed forces and veterans and anti-human trafficking programs, partnering with organizations like American Red Cross, Captain Planet, Junior Achievement and UNCF, among others. As we return to profitability, we continue our commitment to contributing 1% of the company\u2019s profits to communities worldwide. While funding nonprofit partners is critical, the thousands of Delta people who step up and volunteer every year drive our spirit of service. In 2022, their work included assembling nearly 1,500 bikes for Marine Toys for Tots at Delta TechOps, volunteering to provide meals at Hosea Helps on Martin Luther King Jr. Day to celebrate his life and work and donating 14,743 units of life-saving blood to the American Red Cross, making Delta its No. 1 corporate blood drive sponsor for 2022. That dedication is why Delta was again recognized on the Civic 50 as one of the 50 most community-minded companies in the U.S. last year by Points of Light, the world\u2019s largest organization dedicated to volunteer service.\n\nWe are excited about the years ahead and humbled by the experiences of the global pandemic. As we return to the skies, the lessons of recent years will always remain with us \u2013 a reminder of the power of human connection and the clarity that helps us embrace what is really important in our lives.\n\nI welcome all our customers, employees, investors and community partners to join us on this ongoing journey.\n\nEd Bastian\nChief Executive Officer\nDelta Air Lines, Inc.\n2022 HIGHLIGHTS\n\nSAFETY IS OUR TOP PRIORITY\n\nProactively reduce risks by identifying, assessing, mitigating and/or eliminating hazards that may cause incidents, accidents or injuries to customers and employees\n\nZero serious customer injuries in 2022\n\nPEOPLE\n\nDouble spend with Black-owned businesses to $690M by 2025\nSpent nearly $493M with Black-owned businesses in 2022\n\nIncrease diversity of qualified candidates and new hires\n- Black external candidates now represent 22.2% of our new hires for General Manager, Director and Managing Director roles, up from 15.6% in 2020\n- 82.0% of non-executive positions filled by external hires in 2022 did not require a college degree\n\nClose diversity gaps in senior leadership positions\n- Increased the percentage of Black officers and director-level employees to 8.5% from 5.8% in 2020\n- Increased \u2018Vice President and above\u2019 category for women talent from 30.0% to 34.3% from 2021 to 2022\n\nEnhance employee wellness\nAnnounced and launched financial education and literacy program with incentives rewarded in 2023 based on completed actions\n\nCONNECTING WITH OUR COMMUNITIES\n\n$50.5 million in charitable giving\nPlanted over 650 trees in 9 markets nationwide\nRanked the No. 1 corporate blood drive sponsor with the American Red Cross for blood donations for the 5th year in a row\n\nFunded over 600 scholarships to the National Flight Academy (NFA) to inspire students in future STEM careers by providing 6-day, 5-night immersive programs onboard a virtual aircraft carrier\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nMaintain a corporate governance program aligned with evolving best practices\n- Appointed Greg Creed and Leslie Hale to the Board of Directors\n- Board Committee Charters updated to clarify the allocation of ESG oversight in line with existing responsibilities\n\nSAFETY IS OUR TOP PRIORITY\n\nProactively reduce risks by identifying, assessing, mitigating and/or eliminating hazards that may cause incidents, accidents or injuries to customers and employees\n\nZero serious customer injuries in 2022\nCLIMATE AND THE ENVIRONMENT\n\nOUR FOCUS PILLARS\n\nPATH TO NET-ZERO\nEliminate Our Climate Impact from Flying\n\nIN OUR CONTROL TODAY\nEmbed Sustainability in Everything We Do\n\nDELTA\u2019S PATH TO NET-ZERO 2050\nShare of carbon footprint abated by solution (v. 2019 baseline) tCO\u2082e\n\nEnhance oversight to support sustainability in the supply chain\nMore than 50% of our top 200 Supply Chain vendors (based on spend) were integrated into the EcoVadis ESG ratings platform\n\nAchieve net-zero by 2050\nSecured Science-based Targets initiative (SBTi) validation of our medium-term science-based target to improve emissions intensity no later than 2035 compared to a 2019 baseline\n\nIn 2022 carbon emissions intensity improved 0.56% compared to 2019 on a revenue ton kilometer basis.

(Delta) since January 1, 2022, with a focus on the period from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022, unless otherwise stated. All references to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d and \u201cours\u201d are references to Delta. We continually seek to advance our ESG goals. Therefore, progress toward some of our short-, medium- and long-term strategies and initiatives during the first quarter of 2023 is included in this report as well.\n\nWe believe in transparency and structure in our reporting principles. This report is created by following the reporting standards of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\nOur report reflects information regarding our airline operations, which is our core business. Information about Monroe Energy, LLC (Monroe), a wholly owned subsidiary of ours that operates the Trainer Refinery and related pipelines and terminal assets that supply jet fuel to our airline operations in the Northeastern United States, is operated separately and is not reflected in this report. Consistent with the GHG Protocol, this report includes GHG emissions from business activity under Delta\u2019s operational control. Monroe files GHG emissions reports annually with the United States Environmental Protection Agency, which are publicly available. The latest can be viewed here.\n\nIn addition, this report includes a discussion of climate lobbying activities by or on behalf of Monroe in the Climate Lobbying section of this report. Additional information about Monroe can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nESG Materiality Assessment\nAt Delta, we seek to transparently communicate how we view, prioritize and approach the ESG topics most relevant to our business, our customers and our investors. We determine these topics based on both a biennial ESG materiality assessment with internal and external stakeholders as well as through informal dialogue and regular engagement with key stakeholder groups. These methods enable us to proactively address emerging ESG opportunities and risks.\n\nWe use this stakeholder input to identify the most relevant or material issues from an ESG perspective, which is a different standard than that used in our financial disclosures and distinct from the concept of materiality as defined under the rules and regulations of the SEC and related case law. As a result, the information described as material for purposes of this report, our strategies and milestones may not be material for other purposes, including in connection with our SEC filings.\n\nFor our 2021 ESG materiality assessment, we surveyed 10 stakeholder groups and interviewed several representative members. The assessment is found in our 2021 ESG Report. Our next ESG materiality assessment is scheduled to take place in 2023 and will be reflected in our ESG report for 2023.\n\n1 The GHG Protocol establishes comprehensive global standardized frameworks to measure and manage greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from private and public sector operations, value chains and mitigation actions.\nSAFETY\nSafety is our number one priority. As an airline, health, safety and security are non-negotiable and operating a safe and reliable airline is the underpinning of our success. We are grateful and privileged that our customers, colleagues and communities entrust us with their transportation needs. Safety for our employees and customers is a foundational commitment that permeates our culture.\n\nIn conjunction with our organization-wide safety policy, we designed the SMS to be proactive, predictive and data-driven in nature. Delta was an early adopter of SMS principles, and in 2017, we were one of the first airlines to receive validation from the FAA several months before the requirement to do so.\n\nAs our SMS Accountable Executive (AE), Delta\u2019s CEO retains ultimate responsibility for the SMS and has final authority for Delta\u2019s safety performance. The AE and Delta Leadership Committee (DLC) are committed to providing the necessary resources to ensure our SMS remains healthy and effective. They are briefed regularly on our safety performance.\n\nFor the SMS to remain effective, we rely on continuous, open reporting from our employees. We investigate all safety reports fairly and fully. We will not take disciplinary action against an employee for reporting safety hazards, concerns or incidents, including when an error occurs while the employee acts in good faith. Delta is committed to a positive, just safety culture where every employee is empowered to stop the operation at any time to address safety concerns impacting our customers, people or equipment.\n\nWe apply Safety Risk Management (SRM) to identify hazards that could lead to an accident or incident. For example:\n\n- Implementation of new systems, such as a new aircraft type\n- Revision of existing systems, such as procedural or manual changes\n- Development of new procedures, such as adding new airports to our network\n- Identification of new hazards or ineffective risk controls through our safety assurance processes\n\nDelta\u2019s Safety Management System (SMS) is a leader-driven, process-oriented approach to ensuring occupational and operational safety through identifying hazards, assessing and mitigating risk, monitoring our safety performance and promoting a positive safety culture.\nSAFETY AND SECURITY\n\nSafety is fundamental to connecting our global workforce with our customers and will always remain the top priority.\n\nWe continually aim to provide safe and clean transport for customers and a safe workplace for employees. We proudly transported more than 177 million customers safely in 2022. Our ability to serve our large customer base is only possible with the reliability demonstrated daily through the unwavering commitment of our flight attendants, pilots, maintenance technicians and ground agents.\n\nIt is critical for Delta and the broader airline industry to utilize all the tools available to mitigate in-flight misconduct and maintain safe flight experiences for our customers. Delta maintains a zero-tolerance policy toward workplace violence. We provide de-escalation and self-defense training for flight attendants and other frontline employees and continue to partner with law enforcement to increase security at dozens of airports to protect our passengers and employees. We will continue collaborating industry-wide on solutions, including maintaining a no-fly list and cooperating with local, state and federal authorities on the prosecution of disruptive passengers.\n\nAdditional information can be found on our website at The-Way-We-Fly.pdf (delta.com)\nSafety Through Global Cleanliness\n\nAs travel continues to pick up, cleanliness remains a fundamental element of Delta brand expectations. We are committed to delivering a world-class customer experience through the Delta CareStandard\u2122, our science-backed approach to health and safety. Global Cleanliness supports the Delta Brand Promise, as we move forward on our commitment to clean travel experiences.\n\n- The Delta CareStandard\u2122 organizes a team of Clean Ambassadors dedicated to overseeing consistent cleaning quality by Delta employees, cabin service cleaners and janitorial partners.\n\n- Delta partners with Lysol\u00ae Pro Solutions and the PURELL\u00ae brand to implement science-backed cleaning technologies and protocols designed to ensure surfaces have been disinfected using methods approved by trusted experts.\n\n- Delta continues to use air filtration systems on jet bridges and focuses on air quality onboard through continuous filtering and refreshing cabin air.\n\nOur Clean Ambassadors domestically serve 40 airports as cleanliness champions. These champions support cleaning team members across our areas and aircraft, ensuring we follow end-to-end cleanliness protocols and provide customers with a first-class Delta experience. We use trusted partnerships and a commitment to continuous improvement to prioritize health and wellness.\n\nEMPLOYEE SAFETY\n\nThe safety of our employees in delivering operations is an enterprise-wide responsibility and is deeply embedded in our culture.\n\nWe empower our employees to slow down or stop any operation if they feel it is necessary to maintain a safe work environment for our personnel and a safe travel experience for our customers. We operate several cross-divisional and division-specific employee safety programs that help to achieve our safety objectives. These programs are critical to preventing serious injuries by proactively approaching and encouraging safety dialogue across the company. We have regular safety time-out reminders and exercises across our entire operation.\n\nIn 2022, Delta hired a record number of new full-time employees, approximately 25,000, to support the rising demand for post-pandemic travel. To successfully integrate this significant influx of new employees, investments were made to adapt and improve our many safety training and management programs and to account for the rise in travel demand.\nSAFETY PROGRAMS\n\nDelta provides a suite of safety training that includes compliance requirements as well as tailored information relevant to an employee\u2019s role:\n\nJust Culture \u2013 one of our long-established safety initiatives \u2013 is at the forefront to emphasize its importance to new employees within Delta. Just Culture uses collaboration, observations and conversations, such as peer-to-peer or manager-to-employee, to investigate safety incidents and to prevent them in the future, teaching by showing rather than by telling. Just Culture is a mindset that focuses on learning from good faith mistakes rather than punishment or blaming.\n\nSafety Culture \u2013 In late 2021, we completed safety culture assessments at three of our larger U.S. airports \u2013 LAX, SLC and DEN. The results were validated by an external airport leadership team. Following the validation, grassroots teams representing frontline and mid-level leadership employees were established to address challenges identified in the assessment.\n\nProjects addressed \u201ccultural norms\u201d with teams applying simple culture-based tools to develop an understanding of the beliefs, perceptions and assumptions that support those norms. During 2022, this approach was used for projects such as safety time-outs, vehicle use and care, leaders setting the tone for safety, ergonomic behaviors and team lifts and sharing safety concerns and mistakes. Having those individuals closest to the work drive change in their areas and engage with peers in the development of solutions created shared success.\n\nThe Ground Safety Advocate (GSA) program launched, bringing to life the Just Culture concept by assisting new employees in practicing their peer-to-peer communication skills about safety concerns to promote best safety practices.\n\nWe expanded the network of Health Centrals (onsite health and well-being centers within airports) to provide immediate physical therapy, proactive treatments and exercise routines and, in many cases, access to gym equipment.\n\nInvestments in ground handling equipment were made, such as Powerstows (i.e., advanced belt loaders that can transport bags inside aircraft cargo bins), and other significant, continued investment in our eligible GSE fleet, including electrification.\n\nL365 Leading Safety \u2013 a unified, cross-divisional learning program for safety leaders \u2013 was launched to enhance leadership skills and hear advice and lessons learned from other leaders across the company.\n\nA back-to-basics course in Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requirements and injury case management is in place to better position frontline leadership personnel to conduct more accurate, timely and complete injury investigations.\n\nFlight Safety \u2013 We have made further enhancements to our safety assurance process through proactive key safety performance indicators directly related to the operation of an aircraft. These precursors allow better insights within an evolving environment and deliver risks to appropriate stakeholders before they become larger concerns.\n\nDelta held its first annual Safety and Environmental Summit in late 2022, bringing together the frontline safety and environmental leaders across the company. This two-day event included messages from Delta\u2019s divisional and corporate leaders, keynote speakers and breakout sessions to deliver more detailed information on specific topics.\n\nWe communicated the importance of safety through weekly videos, internal posts, town halls, daily interactions with leaders and within workspaces to supplement training and embed a culture of safety.\n\nRegular quality assurance audits and employee interviews are performed at domestic and international airports to evaluate the implementation and success of these initiatives and programs. The audit findings and interview results are shared with leaders to proactively identify opportunity areas and best practices.\n\n2022 SAFETY AT A GLANCE\n\n| TRIR1 | 4.28 |\n| DART2 | 3.21 |\n| FATALITIES | ZERO |\n\n1 TRIR, the number of recordable incidents per 100 workers in our airline operation over one year, increased from 3.83 to 4.28 due primarily to the increase in operations post-COVID.\n\n2 DART, the number of recordable incidents with lost time or restrictions per 100 workers in our airline operation over one year decreased from the 2021 rate 3.46 to 3.21. The decrease indicates the rate of injuries are less severe, resulting in less time off work or on transitional duty.\nOUR PEOPLE ARE OUR STRONGEST COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. THE DEDICATION, EFFICIENCY AND HIGH-QUALITY SERVICE THEY PROVIDE SETS US APART. WE INVEST HEAVILY IN OUR EMPLOYEES\u2019 WELL-BEING AND CONSCIOUSLY STRIVE TO FOSTER A DIVERSE, EQUITABLE AND INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENT.\n\nOUR PEOPLE\n\nThe Delta Difference is our people and our shared commitment to living our values through caring for each other, and through teamwork, our people drive our success. Our values of Care, Integrity, Teamwork, Resilience and Servant Leadership guide us every day in everything we do.\n\nOur principal human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop people who understand and are committed to delivering the \u201cDelta Difference\u201d that is core to our brand.\n\nTo support these objectives, we have put in place programs that seek to:\n\n- Reward our people through highly competitive total compensation designed to share Delta\u2019s success with our employees, who make it possible and promote teamwork and collaboration across the business.\n- Drive high performance by fostering our people\u2019s holistic wellness, including physical, emotional, social and financial wellness.\n- Enhance our culture by continually making our workplace more engaging, equitable and inclusive of all.\n- Develop our employees for pivotal roles and future leadership positions through various training and development programs.\n- Encourage and motivate employees\u2019 professional and community engagement.\nEMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT\n\nEmployee connection and feedback improve our culture and performance.\n\nWe have 10 employee Business Resource Groups, with participation from one-third of our employees, that are regularly tapped for feedback and leveraged for their unique knowledge and perspective. Our large divisions also support Employee Involvement Groups that focus on everything from improving the customer experience to enhancing work-life balance.\n\nWe regularly hold executive-led, company-wide town hall discussions, communicating our ongoing commitment to our people and culture. In line with our open-door policy, our in-person and accessible online events with senior management team members facilitate communication across the company.\n\nOur executive leaders and the Board of Directors also hear employee voices through the engagement of the Delta Board Council. This group comprises employee representatives from every major noncontract operating division, providing a direct voice for employee feedback, interests and perspectives.\n\nListening, engaging and connecting with employees strengthens our organization. We target to provide over 6,000 frontline employees each year the opportunity to come together face-to-face with our CEO and executive leadership team to learn about the direction of the business and to directly share feedback.\n\nAnother key mechanism for gathering critical input is our company-wide employee surveys.\n\nIn 2022, we conducted two pulse check-in surveys. More than 45,000 Delta employees responded to these surveys, representing roughly half of the eligible employee population at the time.\n\nThe average overall response rate for 2022 was 47% women and 43% men, with an average engagement score of 79, three points higher than the U.S. industry benchmark.\n\nOf the total participants, 79% of our employees gave Delta a positive engagement rating.\n\nWe measure engagement as a composite of being happy working at Delta, being proud to tell others you work at Delta and being willing to recommend Delta to family and friends.\n\n\u201cOur people are the heart and soul of Delta and the reason we are the most awarded airline. We are committed to listening, caring and advocating for our people. Fueled by their feedback, our goal is to create a great place to work where all Delta people can be at their best for our customers.\u201d\n\n- Joanne Smith, EVP and Chief People Officer\nCOMPENSATION AND BENEFITS\n\nDelta\u2019s Comprehensive Total Rewards Package\nAt Delta, our people drive our success. Together with training and development, our comprehensive total rewards package underscores our commitment and appreciation to the biggest contributor to our success \u2013 our team. Our overarching compensation philosophy is to provide industry-leading total compensation for industry-leading performance across all workgroups.\n\nBASE PAY\nDelta pays frontline employees highly competitive hourly pay rates based on fixed pay scales by role. We aim to pay rates greater than the industry average on an ongoing basis. A mix of three elements \u2013 individual performance, market competitiveness and internal equity \u2013 influences base pay for our merit employees.\n\nEffective April 1, 2023, we recognized and honored the incredible work and commitment of the Delta people with a 5% base pay increase for ground and flight attendant employees worldwide at all steps of the pay scale and a 5% pool for eligible merit employees worldwide, below the Officer level. This is the second pay increase in 12 months following the 4% across-the-board increase provided on May 1, 2022.\n\nPROFIT SHARING\nFor all employees, competitive base pay is just one piece of our larger compensation. Our Profit Sharing Program is industry leading and recognizes our employees\u2019 contributions to meeting our financial targets. Each year that Delta earns a full-year profit, 10% of adjusted profits up to $2.5B and 20% of adjusted profits over $2.5B are paid out as profit sharing to eligible employees worldwide. In February 2023, a total of $563M in profit sharing was paid from 2022 profits (inclusive of 401(k) contributions and payroll taxes), equivalent to 5.57% of eligible earnings per employee. This comes on the heels of a special payout of $1,250 per employee in early 2022 to recognize a return to profitability in the second half of 2021.\n\n401(k)\nWe make an automatic contribution equal to 3% of eligible earnings for our primary plan, which includes most domestic employees. We also match 100% of up to 6% of eligible earnings contributed to the plan by the employee, resulting in a combined contribution of 15% when employees contribute 6%. We proudly report that in 2022, 92% of our employees contributed to their 401(k) accounts, and 86% received the full matching contribution of 6%. We attribute a significant portion of this success to the automatic features of the plan, including auto-enrollment at 6% and auto-escalation up to 10%.\n\nPARENTAL LEAVE\nIn 2022, we announced that effective for 2023, we were expanding our maternity and parental leave. Our new industry-leading program provides 10 weeks of 100% employer-paid maternity leave for all U.S.-based expectant mothers. In addition, all parents will be eligible for two weeks of fully paid parental leave and unpaid leave until the child reaches their first birthday.\n\nSHARED REWARDS PAYOUT\nIn 2022, a total of $61 million was paid out to employees under this program as a result of meeting corporate-wide operational goals related to baggage handling, completion factor, on-time arrivals and domestic Net Promoter Score.\n\nBEYOND COMPENSATION\nWe offer a comprehensive benefits program beyond compensation that ranges from healthcare to retirement planning to other perks and discounts. More details about our health and wellness programs can be found in this report\u2019s Health and Wellness section on the next page.\n\nCompensation Governance\nWe are in the business of connecting the world. As a global company that aspires to employ a workforce that is as diverse as the customers we serve, it is essential that our employees are paid equitably. Our frontline employees are paid an hourly rate based on the length of service in their respective positions. For merit positions, we are committed to a yearly review of employee compensation to maintain equitable pay for comparable duties, responsibilities, skills and experience regardless of protected categories.\n\nCollective Bargaining\nWe respect all employees\u2019 legal rights, including the right to collective bargaining. This includes the right to decide whether to be represented by a union or remain union-free. Our U.S.-based employees are covered by the Railway Labor Act (RLA), the federal law governing labor relations between air carriers and their employees. Under the RLA, employees have the right to decide whether they wish to be represented by a union or to reject union representation.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, 20% of our 90,000+ full-time equivalent employees were represented by unions. This included approximately 15,040 Delta pilots and 450 dispatchers, as well as approximately 1,750 pilots and 1,800 flight attendants at Endeavor Air, our wholly owned subsidiary. Certain employees outside the U.S. are also represented by unions, work councils or other local representative groups.\nEMPLOYEE HEALTH AND WELLNESS\n\nDelta Wellness aims to enhance our people\u2019s health and wellness by creating more positive outcomes for our employees, customers, communities and partners and becoming a force for good for our environment and society.\n\nThe initiative is a combined effort across our organization to deliver programs that provide a holistic approach to overall wellness through physical, emotional, social and financial pillars.\n\nOver the past two years, we enhanced our employee health and wellness program, which is unique to the industry. Dr. Henry Ting, a physician and former Mayo Clinic executive, leads this program as the industry\u2019s first Chief Health and Wellness Officer elevating wellness for all employees.\n\nOur talent, ingenuity and resilience are what make us unstoppable. In 2022, Delta made the most significant changes to our wellness offerings in recent history, focusing on areas from mental health to financial literacy. To inform these changes, our human resources and wellness teams diligently gathered valuable feedback through our employee engagement surveys and countless conversations with our people.\n\nWe stand by our employees during the highs and the lows. We believe all moments matter \u2013 from exciting life-changing moments like starting a family to stressful moments like an unexpected illness. Everyone has different needs, and we anticipate those needs with an equity lens focused on our diverse employees.\n\nDelta Wellness Mission\n\nWE ARE WITH YOU ON THE JOURNEY OF YOUR LIFETIME.\n\nDelta Wellness Areas of Focus\n\n- **INSIGHTS AND INNOVATION**\n  Data-driven insights from listening to our people to inform our investments\n\n- **GLOBAL BENEFITS**\n  Transform employer-led health care with best-in-class benefit design\n\n- **CLINICAL CARE**\n  Help our people find timely access to medical & mental health care with the highest quality & experience\n\n- **LIVE WELL**\n  Transform the first mile of health & enable our people to live well, work well & travel well\nThese programs are voluntary, incentive-based reward programs focused on supporting our employees to improve their overall wellness.\n\nIn 2022, we began measuring total employee well-being through the Flourishing Index to guide equitable, effective program enhancements. Our wellness team uses key insights from the Flourishing Index to shape the program\u2019s approach, producing the benefits listed in this section.\n\nThe Flourishing Index involves a 12-question survey developed by researchers at Harvard University. It provides baseline data on how our people are doing in areas spanning mental and physical health, close social relationships and financial and material stability. Additional one-on-one qualitative interviews contextualize insights by providing real-world examples and perspectives.\n\nOur Delta Wellness program has expanded to offer:\n\n- 12 free mental health counseling sessions per issue per year through Delta\u2019s employee assistance program\n- Family planning benefits, such as fertility, adoption and surrogacy assistance\n- Expanded financial education and coaching programs incentivized by Delta contributions to employee emergency savings accounts\n- A healthcare concierge service to navigate the complex healthcare system\n- A co-pay option under Delta medical benefits that provides more predictable costs\n\n\u201cWellness is a personal journey \u2013 whether that means finding mindful moments throughout the day, a sense of balance with work and home, or personalized health benefits to support all of life\u2019s difficult moments. Delta takes a holistic approach to health and wellness to empower our employees\u2019 well-being, no matter their starting point.\n\nDelta Wellness has a broad impact that reaches far beyond our 90,000+ person workforce. We believe that when our people thrive, our customers, their families and the communities we serve do, too. In 2022 alone, with our alliance partners, we served as many as 177 million customers in over 800 destinations in over 130 countries. This gives us incredible reach.\u201d\n\n- Dr. Henry Ting, Chief Health and Wellness Officer\nTraining\nOur objective accelerated in 2022, as we increased our employee base, hiring and training approximately 25,000 new employees. Attrition remains low at 7.8%, though slightly elevated from our historical average.\n\nA key piece to improving our employee experience was modernizing our human resources tools and technology by increasing the use of iGrow, our online learning portal. Launched in 2021, iGrow offers career and professional development and an array of skill-building options. The tool is delivered in partnership with core content providers such as Harvard Business Publishing, enabling Delta to offer curated, self-paced growth paths, and is accessible globally to all Delta employees.\n\nThese growth paths allow our employees to follow a guided learning journey based on their career track and focus on developing specific skills and competencies aligned with their performance goals. Coupled with iGrow are our other synchronous and asynchronous career and skills training offerings that give our employees access to additional resources.\n\nThe table to the right, illustrates the average computer-based training hours logged by employees per division by merit and scale in 2022. These numbers do not include in-person or hands-on qualification training and testing hours, simulator time, etc.\n\n|                  | ACS | CGO | FOP | IFS | RES | TOP | CORP |\n|------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|\n| Merit1           | 17  | 21  | 8   | 9   | 102 | 34  | 5    |\n| Scale1           | 11  | 22  | 53  | 37  | 201 | 72  | 8    |\n| Flight Attendants|     |     |     |     |     |     | 9    |\n| Pilots           |     |     |     |     |     |     | 12   |\n\n1 Attrition rate includes domestic and international employees of Delta Air Lines, excluding seasonal employees and those who worked less than two days.\n2 Merit contributors are paid a salary based on benchmark data from their peers at Delta and across multiple industries and are evaluated on categories spanning skill and experience to innovation and leadership.\n3 Scale employees are paid an hourly wage while also receiving competitive pay offerings and flexible benefits driven by performance, and include pilots, flight attendants, maintenance technicians, customer service and reservation agents, baggage handlers and more.\nTALENT MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)\n\nWe aim to fill at least 25% of our internal professional-level positions with diverse frontline talent, enabling transition into corporate career roles including business support or management positions.\n\nSkills-First\n\nOur equity-focused career development model emphasizes the value of skills and competencies over job histories and traditional degrees. Expanding our commitment to the OneTen coalition, in January 2022, we dropped our degree requirement for pilots following similar work we did in 2021 for our merit roles. While we work to catalog unique skills associated with specific roles, we have taken a more critical lens with job postings to ensure job requirements are clearer. Additionally, we expanded the usage of our internal \u201ccareer talent profile\u201d allowing our recruiters to search internal candidates by their experience and listed skills.\n\nTo complement our strategy, we launched our Skills-First Apprenticeship Program, which centers on hiring, developing and promoting people with relevant skills and experience for open roles within the company. Under the program, apprentices work full-time in an immersive \u201cearn while you learn\u201d experience, which concludes with a formal transition into a role on that team. Apprentices receive access to leadership support, mentor sessions and engagements to expand their knowledge while developing a personal brand.\n\nWe started the Delta Analytics Academy to address the demand for data analytics expertise. Together with Georgia State University (GSU), we offer a three-semester program for Delta Analytics Academy participants. Our inaugural class of Atlanta-based Delta employees will acquire the tools to enter the analytics field without traditional education or cost barriers. The academy begins with a virtual learning environment that allows students to remain in their current positions at Delta. Upon completion, graduates receive a co-branded certificate from GSU and Delta and a guaranteed interview for a full-time role in analytics within our enterprise. We offer several other programs tailored to specific skill sets and workgroups in conjunction with the apprenticeship program.\n\nThrough our Propel program, launched in 2018, Delta offers multiple pathways for qualified talent to enter the pilot profession. To date, over 100 participants have completed a pathway and are now flying for Delta, while another 700 pilots are currently enrolled in the program and working toward the same goal.\n\nIn early 2022, Delta announced that Hampton University would join the Propel Collegiate Pilot Career Path Program, the airline\u2019s first such partnership with a historically Black university, and we added Elizabeth City State University to that effort in 2023.\n\nDelta also announced in 2023 that through our Propel Pilot Career Path Program, we would launch our fourth pathway for aspiring pilots: a dedicated pilot training academy in partnership with Skyborne Airline Academy. Student pilots will be eligible to receive up to $20,000 from Delta in financial support. Delta will also cover the cost of interest on student loans from select lenders.\n\nIn 2022, we held the first class of our Delta Dispatch Academy, open to Delta employees interested in furthering their careers as Flight Superintendents (Flight Dispatchers). Delta is the only airline accredited by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to conduct Aircraft Dispatch Certification. Upon completing the 200+ required hours of instruction and certification, we guarantee employees an interview for a Delta Flight Superintendent position.\nSKILLS-FIRST INCREASES EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT AND DRIVES HIGH PERFORMANCE\n\nSkills-First connects all the critical talent areas of impact to enrich the careers at the moments that matter throughout the employee experience ribbon.\n\nBy providing clear and well-defined career pathways, our employees gain greater access to internal opportunities and agency in their career decision-making. We provide targeted development, upskilling and resources to help our employees grow and mature in their new roles.\n\n**ATTRACT & MOBILIZE TALENT**\n- Expand recruitment outreach to build a diverse, skilled pipeline\n  - Expand talent pipeline through strategic diversity recruitment\n  - Leverage job data and talent profiles to direct-source applicants for open roles\n  - Fill 25% of merit roles by prioritizing internal mobility\n\n**ENGAGE & GROW TALENT**\n- Targeted development & career enrichment\n  - Ensure a foundation of success through enhanced onboarding\n  - Develop leaders at every level to be strong coaches and culture carriers who lead high-performing teams\n  - Cultivate a diverse workforce of skilled, and job-ready talent through targeted development and career-enriching programs\n\n**TRANSPARENT & EQUITABLE PROCESSES**\n- Remove bias and ensure consistent practices embodied in our culture\n  - Integrate skills-based best practices throughout talent life cycle\n  - Ensure operating processes are anti-bias and they increase equity in the talent selection and planning processes\n  - Provide viable feedback loops to candidates to support continued growth\n  - Align equity and Skills-First practices with total rewards\n\n**INFRASTRUCTURE & TECHNOLOGY**\n- Tools and technology to enable skills-centered dialogues\n  - Connect our systems and increase reliability of our data through Skills-First modernization of talent systems such as:\n    - A structure to inventory skills and link the skills to jobs\n    - Implementation of a solution that provides visibility of the required skills by job and with links to learning opportunities\n    - Enhance iGrow to make it a centralized portal with resources for learning in the flow of work and for what you need to learn\n\n**AREAS OF IMPACT**\n- Employee Engagement\n- Recognition\n- Compensation\n- Performance\n- Recruiting\n- Learning\n- Development\n- Assessments\nINVESTMENTS IN OUR PEOPLE\n\nFamily Leave and Caregiving Benefits\nWe support our team\u2019s family moments \u2013 that means enhancing or adding new benefits so they can spend time with their new baby and have backup care when their regular sitter falls through.\n\nWe announced in 2022 that for 2023 we were expanding maternity, parental and bonding leave, now including non-birthing, adoptive and surrogate parents, giving employees more time to focus on new family members. Birthing parents will receive 10 weeks maternity plus two weeks parental leave (12 paid weeks total) paid at 100%, regardless of delivery type. This increases from 6-8 weeks of paid leave, depending on delivery type. We also provide two weeks of parental leave paid 100% for non-birthing, adoptive and surrogate parents. Finally, we have offered an all-new benefit of a 30-day unpaid leave.\n\nEligible new parents may also take an extended bonding leave of absence up to the child\u2019s first birthday or for adopted children up to the child\u2019s first year in the home. While this leave is unpaid, employees maintain their active employee rates on benefit premiums and keep their pass-travel privileges while on inactive status.\n\nWe have also extended the backup care subsidies we provided. Our backup care programs give our employees peace of mind should their regular care providers be unavailable when they need to get to work. Starting in 2023, up to 25 days of backup care per year is highly subsidized by Delta, up from the 15 days offered currently. Care.com connects our team to vetted, qualified caregivers for your children, adult family members and pets. They can also use backup care days to provide reimbursement to caregivers they hire.\n\nFamily Building Benefits:\nDomestic employees and their spouses who enroll in Delta\u2019s health plans are eligible to receive fertility support provided by Progyny, a leading fertility benefits provider offering 900 fertility specialists at 650 locations, a 24/7 integrated pharmacy and lower out-of-pocket costs for comprehensive treatments such as:\n\n- Comprehensive consultations\n- Diagnostic tests\n- IUI (artificial insemination)\n- IVF (in vitro fertilization)\n- Preimplantation genetic testing\n- Fertility preservation\n- Donor tissue purchase\n- Tissue transportation\n- Medications for fertility treatments\n- Concierge patient care coordination\n\nCustomized treatment plan, bundled into a \u201csmart cycle\u201d\nLifetime benefit of one \u201csmart cycle,\u201d meaning plan members do not have to track the cost of services or worry about running out of coverage in the middle of treatment\nPatient Care Advocate providing education, digital support and emotional support\nLactation support, storing and shipping services for nursing parents returning to work\nINVESTMENTS IN OUR PEOPLE (CONTINUED)\n\nQuantum Health Advocacy\nQuantum Health, a best-in-class concierge advocacy provider responsible for services previously provided by Delta Health Direct. Nurses, benefits experts and claims specialists who know Delta\u2019s benefits are there to help our employees save time, money and to serve as an advocate.\n\nUnstoppable Together\nWe launched Unstoppable Together, an employee recognition platform that provides managers and leaders \u201cDelta Difference\u201d points that can be redeemed for miles in the SkyMiles Program, cash gift cards, retail gift cards and more.\n\nFinancial Well-being\n\nEmergency Savings: We announced in late 2022 a program launching in 2023 intended to help Delta people be more prepared for life\u2019s unexpected moments. Beginning January 1, 2023, eligible employees can earn up to $1,000 from Delta to fuel their Emergency Savings when they complete a financial education and coaching program and contribute to an emergency savings account.\n\nFinancial Education: A new financial education and coaching program is available to eligible domestic employees at no cost through our partnerships with Operation Hope and Fidelity Investments. Both organizations are focused on helping individuals improve their financial situation, while supporting them on the pathway to achieving their personal financial goals and aspirations. Employees can choose from three coaching paths based on their individual needs: (1) managing day-to-day savings and spending, (2) strengthening financial foundations and (3) focusing on future goals.\n\nPath to Retirement: We make an automatic contribution equal to 3% of eligible earnings for our primary plan that includes most domestic employees. We also match 100% of up to 6% of eligible earnings contributed to the plan by the employee, resulting in a combined contribution of 15% when employees contribute 6%.\nDIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION\n\nDelta is committed to actively seeking diversity, boldly pursuing equity, consciously promoting inclusion and fostering a sense of belonging among employees.\n\nIn 2022, we continued to progress on our commitments to being an anti-racist, anti-discrimination organization while transparently sharing our results. As part of our commitment to transparency and based on feedback from internal and external stakeholders, we publish on our website our latest EEO-1 Report as submitted to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\nWORKFORCE DIVERSITY\n\nAs of December 2022, 27.4% of hourly-wage employees identify as Black, 23.1% as another underrepresented racial and ethnic group and 41.8% as women.\n\nWe have seen the most progress in the category of \u2018Vice President and above\u2019 for women talent. This category increased from 30.0% to 34.3% from 2021 to 2022.\n\nFor Black talent, we saw a decrease at the Managing Director level from 6.8% to 6.3%; while the Vice President level changed from 6.0% to 5.6%.\n\nFor other underrepresented racial and ethnic group talents, the Managing Director level increased to 17.7% from 16.3% and the Vice President level increased to 16.7% from 15.0%.\n\n1 Reflects diversity characteristics of our active, domestic employees, expats, employees in U.S. territories and employees on Voluntary Unpaid Leave of Absence as of December 31, 2022.\n2 Totals may not sum due to rounding.\n3 All values are as of December 31, 2022 and based on self-identification.\nOur focus is on the three areas where the gaps between frontline and scale representation and leadership are the largest: women, Black talent and other underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. We intend to direct our efforts to other diversity areas, though we have found that these three are the most underrepresented and contain the most significant gaps.\n\nIn 2022, we made meaningful progress toward this goal by increasing the percentage of Black officers and director-level employees to 8.5% from 5.8% in 2020. Additional work remains to provide equitable internal and external career pathways to senior leadership roles.\n\nOur Close the Gap report builds off commitments made in 2020 to accelerate the closure of diversity representation gaps between the frontline and leadership.\n\nCLOSE THE GAP PROGRESS\nA snapshot of each representative group percentage, by Delta\u2019s office employees/professional roles, frontline hourly and from 2020 to 2022.1\n\n1 As of December 31, 2022 based on self-identification.\n2 The demographics present in UREG: Asian, Latin/Hispanic, Native American, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander and Two or More races/ethnicities.\nNumerous factors contributed to our early and mid-career diverse talent growth, particularly among frontline leaders, including strengthening diversity metrics, capabilities and transparency, introducing a Skills-First talent approach, having more diverse hiring panels and creating apprenticeship opportunities. Highlights from these initiatives include:\n\n- Our DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) Council evolved into a two-tiered Council and DEI Executive Committee - resulting in greater cross-divisional accountability focused on accelerating Manager-level (Grade 10) Black talent\n- Our multi-faceted retention and career growth plans for top internal Black talent resulted in increased intentionality in retaining senior Black talent\n- Our targeted recruitment strategies for external Black talent led to an uptick in Black applicants\n- We enforced a diverse hiring panel and slate requirements for internal and external candidates\n- Hiring managers received developing additional bias mitigation tips through a new \u201cPassport to Lead\u201d training program\n\nWe are progressing in closing representation gaps at many levels across our organization. The most progress is taking place in Women talent.\n\n| Percentage of officers from each racial/ethnic denomination. | As of December 2022 based on self-identification: |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| White | 77.9% |\n| Asian | 12.0% |\n| Black or African American | 5.6% |\n| Latin/Hispanic | 3.7% |\n| Other | 0.9% |\n\n- 2022 saw an increased representation of women, Black talent and other underrepresented racial and ethnic groups in many roles across the company. This is an important step toward increasing diversity at senior levels (VP+)\n- We established the Senior Executive and Executive Talent Councils to focus on diversity gap closures - resulting in a \u201ccreate-don\u2019t-wait\u201d model yielding 30 GM+ promotions of high-potential Black internal talent\n\nDelta and Adobe teamed up with creative company Kin and photographer Seo Ju Park to create Faces of Travel, a 100-image library that reflects a more inclusive - and accurate - view of diverse travelers out in the world enjoying travel in extraordinary ways. Faces of Travel aims to champion a more accurate and authentic representation of travelers to inspire positive, lasting change within the travel industry and beyond. The Faces of Travel library is available for the public via Adobe Stock at no cost for social media, advertising and other content creators.\nGoal: Create More Equitable Opportunities\n\nIntroduction of a new equity-focused component of community engagement activities\n\nAllocate annual charitable contributions and giving toward equity-focused organizations and initiatives\n\nWe have forged and expanded partnerships with equity-focused partners, including:\n\n1. 100 Black Men of America\n2. 100 Black Men of Atlanta/Emerging 100\n3. Atlanta Business League - Super Tuesday Conference\n4. Atlanta Global Research & Education Collaborative (AGREC)\n5. City of Refuge\n6.

Urban League of Greater Atlanta\n\nGoal: Promoting Understanding and Inclusion\n\nContinuing education on justice, equality and equity\n\n- Our officers and other senior leaders completed a Racial Equity Workshop to gain further understanding of systemic issues and inequities and means of disrupting them\n- Our DEI-focused managers now report to the Global Office of DEI, increasing divisional connection to corporate strategy and DEI engagement\n- We promoted dialogue and understanding through our \u201cLet\u2019s Talk About It\u201d and \u201cGaining Altitude\u201d series\n- Our internally curated and researched Perspective Paper library aided in knowledge building and DEI conversation acumen\n- We partnered with Equal Justice Initiative to increase DEI education, strengthening DEI strategy alignment across our team\n- We are utilizing technology via a commitment with IBM to identify unconscious bias in our advertising\n\nGoal: Step Up Inclusion Training\n\nAt least one of four enhanced inclusion training courses completed by all employees by 2022\n\n- We launched our enhanced inclusion training experience, which explores conscious and unconscious bias, learning how these biases impact behaviors and understanding the way our actions impact others: 42,000+ employees completed at least one of four DEI trainings\n- We committed to ensuring that all officers participate in a two-day Racial Equity Leadership Workshop\n\n\u201cOur concentrated efforts are building a strong pipeline as we work toward our long-term goals.\n\nThe deliberate steps we\u2019ve taken, like introducing a Skills-First hiring approach, reinforcing the importance of diverse hiring panels and creating apprenticeship opportunities, are components that continue delivering results. We know that the path to a more equitable business is a journey, but years later, these results are showing we are moving in the right direction.\u201d\n\n- Keyra Lynn Johnson, VP and Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer\nSEEKING DIVERSITY WITHIN OUR SUPPLIERS\n\nFor more than 20 years, Delta has been committed to creating a world-class, inclusive supply chain that reflects the diversity of our global customer base. The foundation of our Supplier Diversity & Inclusion is partnerships with advocacy organizations.\n\nWe proudly build relationships with high-quality small businesses or enterprises owned by women, veterans, members of the LGBTQ+ community, individuals with disabilities or individuals who are part of underrepresented racial and ethnic groups.\n\nIn 2022, Delta increased its diverse suppliers within our supply chain network by 24% to 1,400 suppliers. To further draw awareness to our diverse suppliers, we launched the Diverse Supplier Network, which drove an increased year-over-year growth in diverse supplier count to over 20% of Delta\u2019s total count of suppliers with over $1 of spend in 2022.\n\nWe assess the diversity of our supply chain using Supplier.IO, a third-party supplier diversity platform, to maintain clear diversity credentials. As an additional value of onboarding Supplier.IO, we launched the Tier II program in October 2022, which measured the diverse spend with suppliers or subcontractors of our Tier I suppliers who directly supply a final product. This program reported an additional $89M of diverse spend in our supply chain by measuring Tier II suppliers.\n\nAdditionally, we created the Supplier Diversity Playbook to train on compliance standards and best practices for sourcing professionals in partnership with SCMLA Academy. To continue strategically sourcing from diverse suppliers to support business needs, we belong to six leading supplier diversity organizations that certify small and diverse-owned businesses nationally and around the world: National Minority Supplier Development Council, Women\u2019s Business Enterprise National Council, National Veteran Business Development Council, National LGBT Chamber of Commerce, Disability:IN and WEConnect International. In 2022, we attended 20+ national and local events and spurred new community activity. Delta became the official airline of the 2022 Women\u2019s Business Enterprise National Council\u2019s National Conference held in Atlanta, GA.\nIn the fall of 2022, we collaborated with the Women\u2019s Business Enterprise National Council to assist over 125 women entrepreneurs with crafting and refining their strategic business plans. We actively participated in Disability:IN\u2019s certification committee to help train and certify disabled and veteran disabled entrepreneurs.\n\nWe also partner with the U.S. Small Business Administration to help ensure that small business enterprises have an equitable opportunity to participate in our requests for proposals. We work with these partners to deliver value throughout our supply chain and enable us to create an exceptional experience for our customers.\n\nLaunched in August 2022, Delta customers departing Atlanta were treated to Southern-inspired meals designed by Chef Mashama Bailey, winner of the 2022 James Beard Foundation\u2019s \u201cOutstanding American Chef\u201d award and Executive Chef and co-founder of The Grey, an award-winning Southern restaurant in historic downtown Savannah, Ga. Chef Bailey and Johno Morisano both serve on our newly formed Delta Culinary Council, where they help guide our culinary strategy alongside a collective of chefs and industry experts. Additionally, Chef Bailey is featured on Delta Studio, the industry-leading seatback entertainment platform, as part of the airline\u2019s partnership with MasterClass. In the 10-lesson class, she dives into the rich layers of cooking Southern food \u2013 its history, flavors, dishes and techniques \u2013 and shares her approach to preserving traditions while reinventing classic recipes.\n\nGoal: Double spending with Black-owned businesses by 2025 to $690M from a 2020 baseline of $345M.\n\nSpent nearly $493M with Black-owned businesses in 2022\n\nDelta established a partnership with Du Nord Social Spirits, the first U.S. Black-owned distillery, to bring its craft vodka onboard all domestic flights beginning October 2021. In 2022, Delta expanded our partnership with Du Nord and is building the capacity to expand to all global flights.\nCLIMATE AND THE ENVIRONMENT\nBy the time this is published, we will have shared broadly Delta\u2019s go-forward sustainability strategy that is rooted in two pillars: Embedding Sustainability In Everything We Do; and Eliminating Our Climate Impact From Flying. Within these pillars, all of our work \u2013 ongoing and ahead of us \u2013 will be organized under these focus areas: the travel experience, supply chain, ground operations, efficient aircraft operations, clean fuel and revolutionary fleet. Work is already well underway in all these areas.\n\nI\u2019m more optimistic than ever about our future because of the progress we\u2019ve made and the foundation we\u2019ve laid to accelerate. All of this work is as important to our business as it is to our planet, and I\u2019m excited about the journey because there\u2019s no team on the planet better at blazing new trails.\n\nPam Fletcher\nChief Sustainability Officer & Corporate Innovation\nDelta Air Lines, Inc.\n\nWhen I joined Delta on February 1, 2022, the power and passion of Delta people was palpable. Our Green Up business resource group of more than 4,300 employees was spearheading tree plantings and waterway cleanups in various Delta hub communities, while pitching solutions for reducing single-use plastics and more. Likewise, fuel efficiency programs that teams across Delta accelerated during the pandemic \u2013 from what we fly, how we fly and the fuel we use \u2013 were blossoming.\n\nI\u2019m excited to share this section of our ESG report because it illustrates the strong progress and momentum we collectively built throughout 2022 on our journey to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, while delivering a sustainable, elevated travel experience.\n\nNone of what we do or what needs to be done can be accomplished alone. Being part of what\u2019s classified as a hard-to-decarbonize sector means it\u2019s going to take all stakeholders \u2013 Delta people, partners, regulators, customers, communities, innovators, other airlines and others \u2013 doing more than our part to meet Delta\u2019s and our industry\u2019s ambitious goals.\n\nBy the time this is published, we will have shared broadly Delta\u2019s go-forward sustainability strategy that is rooted in two pillars: Embedding Sustainability In Everything We Do; and Eliminating Our Climate Impact From Flying. Within these pillars, all of our work \u2013 ongoing and ahead of us \u2013 will be organized under these focus areas: the travel experience, supply chain, ground operations, efficient aircraft operations, clean fuel and revolutionary fleet. Work is already well underway in all these areas.\n\nI\u2019m more optimistic than ever about our future because of the progress we\u2019ve made and the foundation we\u2019ve laid to accelerate. All of this work is as important to our business as it is to our planet, and I\u2019m excited about the journey because there\u2019s no team on the planet better at blazing new trails.\n\nPam Fletcher\nChief Sustainability Officer & Corporate Innovation\nDelta Air Lines, Inc.\n\nA few highlights include:\n\nCreating greater demand signals for the grossly under-supplied sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market \u2013 SAF is the single greatest lever we have today to drastically cut aviation\u2019s emissions, but there\u2019s not enough supply produced annually to fuel commercial airlines globally for a single day;\n\nReducing fuel consumption by over 10 million gallons in 2022 through the work of the Delta Carbon Council;\n\nIntroducing new aircraft to our fleet and placing orders for additional aircraft that operate significantly more efficiently than aircraft they\u2019re replacing;\n\nEliminating approximately 4.9 million pounds of single-use plastics while elevating the onboard experience with sustainable options like bamboo cutlery and canned premium beverages;\n\nElectrifying nearly 100% of Delta\u2019s core fleet of ground service equipment at our hubs in Boston and Salt Lake City on our way to electrifying 50% of the entire fleet by 2025; and\n\nAnnouncing partnerships with Joby Aviation to deliver a wholly new mode of emissions-free transportation, EcoVadis to bring greater transparency to environmental and social practices of vendors across Delta\u2019s supply chain and MIT to study the generation and mitigation of persistent contrails.\nImproving Emissions Intensity\n\nIn July 2022, SBTi approved our medium-term goal to reduce well-to-wake Scopes 1 and 3 jet fuel greenhouse gas emissions by 45% per revenue ton kilometer by 2035 from a 2019 base year.1 This approval indicates that our Scope 1 and 3 target ambitions align with the Paris Agreement\u2019s goal of limiting global warming to well below 2.0\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nIn 2022 carbon emissions intensity improved 0.56% compared to 2019 on a revenue ton kilometer basis. From 2021 to 2022 emissions intensity improved 12.7%.2\n\nNet-Zero by 2050:\n\nWe believe that nobody better connects the world than Delta. Our mission to do so in a sustainable manner is as essential to the success of our business as it is to the health of our environment and the people within it. In 2021 we set out to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions for our airline operations and its value chain (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) by 2050, and we joined the United Nations Race to Zero \u2013 Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C campaign as set forth in the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\nIn 2022 we received SBTi validation of Delta\u2019s medium-term emissions reduction target, a significant milestone on our sustainability journey which establishes a strong foundational plan to guide our path towards 2050. Our long-term 2050 target along with our glide path to net-zero is still pending SBTi approval. In February 2023, SBTi issued a technical report detailing an interim pathway for aviation companies to set 1.5\u00b0C-aligned targets and announced plans to launch a formal update to target-setting guidance for the aviation sector consistent with limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C. Given the rapidly evolving landscape, Delta plans to monitor further SBTi guidance, working with our counterparts and A4A to align as an industry on a unified approach that commits to ambitious targets, which will drive meaningful change.\n\nOur ability to achieve our ambitious climate goals depends on a combination of science, technology, innovation, government policy and partnerships. Achievement will require, among other things, significant capital investment (including from third parties), research and development from manufacturers and other stakeholders and progression of government policies and incentives. These actions are critical to reduce the cost and increase production of SAF and other technologies that are not presently in existence or available at scale.\n\nWe need technology enhancements to reach our goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. To promote progress, we launched the Delta Sustainable Skies Lab, a first-of-its-kind airline innovation lab to accelerate research, design and testing for a more sustainable future of air travel. The Lab serves as a platform to advance internal collaboration and innovative partnerships. Additionally, in the future, the Lab will include an Engagement Studio intended to showcase Delta\u2019s evolving sustainability efforts in a single place.\n\nIn this section, we provide a high-level overview of our science-based targets, the key elements of our anticipated decarbonization pathway, our progress toward our existing goals and climate risks and opportunities based on our climate scenario analysis.\n\n1 Non-CO2e effects which may also contribute to aviation-induced warming are not included in this target. Delta commits to report publicly on its collaboration with stakeholders to improve understanding of opportunities to mitigate the non-CO2e impacts of aviation annually over its target timeframe.\n\n2 Carbon emissions intensity was materially impacted in 2020 and 2021 by lower passenger loads and other factors during the COVID-19 pandemic and Delta\u2019s middle seat blocking measures through April 30, 2021.\nTHE TRAVEL EXPERIENCE\nWe are accelerating our efforts to build a more sustainable travel experience by reducing single-use plastics on board, reducing food waste and introducing sustainability in the products and amenities we deliver to our customers. We refreshed our onboard product offerings in early 2022, and as a result of our initial single-use plastic replacement strategy, we reduced onboard single-use plastic consumption by approximately 4.9 million pounds per year.\n\nGROUND OPERATIONS AND FACILITIES\nAs of December 2022, we electrified 25% of our eligible core and critical ground equipment fleets necessary to service an aircraft at the gate, such as baggage tractors, belt loaders, aircraft tow tractors and other eligible GSE. We continue to work with airports throughout our network to add additional charging infrastructure to support our goal of electrifying 50% of our eligible GSE fleet by 2025. Additionally, we invested in updating airport facilities, modernizing the customer experience, and creating more sustainable facilities by incorporating technology to reduce our environmental impact.\n\nSUPPLY CHAIN\nIn 2022, we onboarded over 50% of our top 200 supply chain vendors, based on spend, to the EcoVadis ESG ratings platform. EcoVadis scorecards allow us to measure the impact of our supply chain, encourage vendors to take action to improve their scores and identify potential new vendors with strong sustainability ratings.\n\nAIRCRAFT OPERATIONS\nTo further reduce our emissions intensity, our Carbon Council, a cross-divisional senior leadership team, is focused on executing and tracking operational initiatives that reduce jet fuel consumption. This work includes immediate improvements within flight operations and collaboration with outside experts such as MIT to evaluate new technologies. Delta\u2019s efforts also supplement industry-wide efforts to support the modernization of the air traffic control systems, allowing for increased fuel efficiency and less carbon-intensive flying.\n\nFUEL\nSustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is central to reducing the life cycle emissions from aviation fuel; however, it is not currently available at the scale or cost necessary to meet the industry\u2019s needs. We have established a goal of replacing 10% of our jet fuel consumption with SAF by the end of 2030. We expect this goal to require at least 400 million gallons of SAF annually. At the end of 2022, Delta had agreements in place with multiple suppliers for an aggregate offtake of 200 million gallons of SAF annually by 2030. These agreements are subject to third-party investment and timely facility development.\n\nFLEET\nOur fleet renewal efforts have the most significant impact on reducing emissions and emissions intensity from our airline operations. In 2022, we took delivery of 69 aircraft that were, on average, 25% more fuel efficient per seat mile than aircraft retired since 2019, contributing to a fleet-wide fuel efficiency improvement of 4.2% compared to 2019. We also announced a series of new aircraft purchase agreements. We expect these purchase agreements to bolster our fleet renewal plans and continue to improve fuel efficiency in future periods.\n\nOur path focuses on two main pillars:\n\n- **FLEET**\n  - Our fleet renewal efforts have the most significant impact on reducing emissions and emissions intensity from our airline operations. In 2022, we took delivery of 69 aircraft that were, on average, 25% more fuel efficient per seat mile than aircraft retired since 2019, contributing to a fleet-wide fuel efficiency improvement of 4.2% compared to 2019. We also announced a series of new aircraft purchase agreements. We expect these purchase agreements to bolster our fleet renewal plans and continue to improve fuel efficiency in future periods.\n\n- **FUEL**\n  - Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is central to reducing the life cycle emissions from aviation fuel; however, it is not currently available at the scale or cost necessary to meet the industry\u2019s needs.

EcoVadis scorecards allow us to measure the impact of our supply chain, encourage vendors to take action to improve their scores and identify potential new vendors with strong sustainability ratings.\nOUR DECARBONIZATION PATHWAY (CONTINUED)\n\nDecarbonizing Aviation\nWe expect progress toward our climate goals, particularly our decarbonization efforts, to be driven by the following levers: fleet renewal, sustainable aviation fuel and operational improvements. Technological innovation concerning these levers, stakeholder engagement and coalition and policy development will be critical to reaching our goals. We mention our cross-collaboration and partnerships in this section, and our climate lobbying efforts are detailed later in this report.\n\nThe graphic model illustrates one potential pathway to achieve net-zero by 2050. This pathway is a proposal subject to numerous assumptions and uncertainties, many of which are outside our control. As illustrated by these graphics, even with meaningful improvements in fuel efficiency, our absolute emissions are expected to grow for a period of time due to projected capacity growth in future years. We aim to achieve absolute emission reductions over the medium- to long-term as we move toward 2050 and more low-carbon technologies become commercially and economically available.\nELIMINATING OUR CLIMATE IMPACT FROM FLYING\n\nFleet\nFleet renewal is our greatest opportunity to improve our fuel efficiency and emissions intensity. We have established sustainability considerations as one of the core pillars guiding our fleet strategy and capital allocation decisions concerning our fleet.\n\nWe plan to continue our fleet renewal initiative to support our environmental sustainability efforts. We expect fleet renewal to play a significant role in progressing our climate goals. In the short term, this means aiming for annual improvements in fleet-wide fuel efficiency each year through 2035, which, if achieved, would represent a meaningful reduction in fuel consumption rate from 2019 to 2035. Following 2035, we envision the availability of next-generation aircraft technology, such as the deployment of novel airframe designs and/or advanced propulsion technologies that could continue to improve fuel efficiency.\n\nIn 2022, we took delivery of 69 aircraft, including 42 next-generation mainline aircraft,1 that were, on average, 25% more fuel efficient per seat mile than aircraft retired since 2019, contributing to a fleet-wide fuel efficiency improvement of 4.2% compared to 2019.\n\nA combination of fleet renewal, operational initiatives and other factors resulted in overall fuel savings of roughly 151 million gallons in comparison to our fuel efficiency from 2019.\n\nIn May 2022, introducing the A321neo, our most fuel-efficient aircraft, boosted progress toward emissions intensity improvements. Over the next several years, we expect to continue on this path, growing other fuel-efficient fleets like the A220 family, the A350-900s and the A330-900s.\n\n---\n\n1 Excluding 737-900ERs.\nSUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL\n\nSAF is a liquid hydrocarbon fuel synthetically produced using renewable or waste-derived feedstock. It will play a key role in aviation\u2019s decarbonization pathway but is currently unavailable at scale or price parity with conventional jet fuel.\n\nWhat Is Sustainable Aviation Fuel?\n\nSAF is an alternative jet fuel that achieves lower life cycle GHG emissions compared to conventional jet fuel using various feedstocks such as used cooking oil, cellulosic waste and municipal solid waste. Approved conversion processes produce SAF, such as Fischer-Tropsch, HEFA (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids) and co-processing. We do not procure or accept SAF made from palm oil or PFAD (palm fatty acid distillate).\n\n- In the context of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) developed SAF sustainability requirements that include minimum emissions reductions, land use and food security considerations, among other factors. SAF must meet these requirements to be eligible for compliance with CORSIA.\n- ICAO has approved two entities, the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) and Roundtable of Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) to certify the sustainability of SAF.\n\nFor the aviation industry to achieve net-zero by 2050, an exponential increase to 330\u2013445 billion gallons of SAF per year by 2050 could be required.\u00b9\n\nCritical building blocks for scaling SAF include:\n\nGOVERNMENT INCENTIVES:\nPerformance-based, as well as feedstock- and technology-neutral incentives are required to help drive investment toward the development of SAF at a reasonable cost. For example, at the federal level, a 10-year SAF-specific Blenders Tax Credit coupled with a dedicated grant program are some of the policy supports necessary to help catalyze the domestic market. Additionally, at the state level, incentives and programs such as California\u2019s Low Carbon Fuel Standard\u2019s voluntary opt-in program for SAF need to be more widely adopted to bring SAF to other geographic locations economically. As international governments seek to drive investment in SAF, we caution that mandates without incentives will fail to ensure sufficient supply and reasonable pricing.\n\nSAF ACCOUNTING FRAMEWORK:\nOne of the benefits of SAF is that it can be delivered and stored as a \u201cdrop-in fuel\u201d using existing pipelines and storage infrastructure. However, an effective book-and-claim framework will be necessary from a carbon accounting perspective because SAF comingles with conventional jet fuel.\n\nCurrent feedstock and technologies can produce SAF with up to 80% lower life cycle emissions than conventional jet fuel, with the ability to blend with conventional jet fuel at up to 50%.\n\nDelta aims to procure more than 400 million gallons of SAF annually in an effort to achieve a goal of 10% SAF utilization by the end of 2030. In 2022, we signed offtake agreements with Gevo and DG fuels, bringing our procured 2030 SAF gallons to 200M. We continue to purchase from and align with leaders in the SAF industry to accelerate our yearly procurement. We have negotiated offtake arrangements for future SAF supply with these suppliers:\n\n- Gevo: 75 million gallons annually produced by using industrial field corn\n- Aemetis: 10 million gallons annually produced by utilizing used cooking oil and tallow as feedstock\n- DG Fuels: 55 million gallons annually produced by using timber waste\n- NWAB: 60 million gallons annually produced by utilizing slash, forest residues and mill residues\n\n\u00b9 According to the Air Transport Action Group (ATAG), an independent coalition providing a platform for the commercial aviation sector to collaborate on long-term sustainability issues.\nSUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL (CONTINUED)\n\nDelivery of this fuel is subject to timely third-party investment and facility development. These agreements expand availability of this nascent technology and align with Delta\u2019s SAF goal as a founding member of the First Movers Coalition.\n\nIn 2022, Delta procured 1.6 million gallons of SAF, a 329% increase compared to 2021.\n\nDelta is also working closely with customers to increase demand for SAF and help address the significant price premiums. Many of Delta\u2019s corporate customers are motivated by the aggressive Scope 3 targets they have set for their commercial business travel and cargo emissions. In 2022, Delta had agreements with 30 corporate customers, travel agencies and freight forwarders to help fund and apply SAF toward GHG emissions from their business travel and cargo shipped on Delta.\n\nOver the long term, a shift to next-generation SAF, such as power-to-liquid fuels and the ability to blend at more than 50% SAF is necessary for long-term efficiencies. Achieving these SAF goals will require working with manufacturers and fuel providers on regulatory approvals and significant investments in renewable electricity. These fuels, coupled with the use of direct air capture of carbon at the SAF production facilities, have the potential to achieve life cycle emissions reductions beyond the 80% maximum estimated today.\n\nLife Cycle Emissions of Fuel\n\nFrom Well-to-Wake\n\nLife cycle emissions account for the GHG emissions at every stage of the fuel\u2019s life \u2013 from development and production to its ultimate use. We have reported \u201ctank-to-wake\u201d combustion emissions since 2005 as part of our greenhouse gas emissions inventory. Sustainable aviation fuel emissions are reported on a full life cycle \u201cwell-to-wake\u201d basis to demonstrate the emissions reductions. Beginning in 2021, and again in 2022, our GHG emissions data includes \u201cwell-to-wake\u201d fuel emissions to increase transparency and follow SBTi guidance.\n\nLife cycle emissions from SAF can currently be up to 80% lower than conventional jet fuel because the feedstock production either absorbs carbon dioxide in the atmosphere or avoids generating GHG emissions associated with the disposal and decomposition of the feedstock as a waste. For bio-based feedstocks, the analysis also considers the potential GHG emissions increases from Indirect Land Use Changes (ILUC) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).\nAIRCRAFT OPERATIONS\n\nCarbon Council\u2019s Operational Improvements\n\nAs we work to execute and track operational initiatives that reduce jet fuel consumption and improve emissions intensity, Delta\u2019s Carbon Council manages fuel burn and drives reductions in fuel consumption through cross-divisional collaboration. Our Carbon Council is an established group of senior leaders overseeing Delta\u2019s operational trajectory to advance fuel efficiency and progress toward our medium- and long-term sustainability goals.\n\nStrategic working groups support our Carbon Council to drive further improvement in fuel efficiency. The working groups consist of relevant business units, each chosen for focused collaboration on specific initiatives. Each working group can spearhead progress in its dedicated area while identifying and communicating opportunities and roadblocks to the executive leadership team.\n\nOne example of the Carbon Council\u2019s work is the decision to install enhanced split-scimitar winglets for drag reduction on the 737 fleet. Delta TechOps recently finished a five-and-a-half-year project to equip all 130 Delta 737-900ER aircraft with these winglets. This aerodynamic enhancement improves fuel efficiency by reducing lift-induced drag. We expect this investment to yield an annual fuel savings of 8 million gallons for this fleet type alone, with an incremental 3.3 million gallons of fuel to be saved annually from the recently initiated undertaking of the same project across the 737-800 fleet.\n\nAnother example is Delta\u2019s active role with Air Traffic Control (ATC) and Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) in implementing EoR in 2021 and 2022. EoR is an improved instrument approach system that allows ATC to clear aircraft for landing with shorter flight paths. This system takes advantage of the FAA\u2019s NextGen airspace modernization initiative and can shorten flight times by 3-5 minutes. By reducing overall flight time, this system drives fuel savings and can help customers reach their destinations more quickly. This system could provide an estimated one million gallons in fuel savings annually at LAX alone once fully utilized.\n\nDelta\u2019s Carbon Council meets quarterly with the executive leadership team to guide decision-making and drive continued progress on fuel reduction initiatives, focusing on both medium- and long-term progress toward Delta\u2019s net-zero efforts.\n\nCarbon Council Focus Areas\n\nBelow is an explanation of our five Carbon Council focus areas to reduce fuel consumption, along with previous examples of their successful implementation:\n\n**Fixed Weight:** Reducing the permanently installed weight on the plane (e.g., radial landing gear tires and carbon brakes).\n\n**Variable Weight:** Reducing the boarded weight on the plane (e.g., reducing the weight of Unit Load Devices like cargo pallets).\n\n**Flying Operations:** Flight routing and planning changes to reduce fuel burn (e.g., investments in flight planning software and collaboration with Air Traffic Control regarding Required Navigation Performance (RNP)). Additionally, we will continue to seek to collaborate with governments, airports and others on cross-industry initiatives. One example of this ongoing collaboration is through the NextGen Advisory Committee, which provides independent advice and recommendations to the FAA related to air traffic management.\n\n**Ground Operations:** Investments in ground procedures and infrastructure to reduce fuel burn while the aircraft is on the ground (e.g., investments in communications technologies, maintenance pad electrification, APU Ambassadors dedicated to reducing Auxiliary Power Unit (\u201cAPU\u201d) usage while at the gate and partnerships with innovative companies to accelerate new methods of saving jet fuel during ground operations).\n\n**Aerodynamic Modifications:** Permanent modifications to aircraft to improve their aerodynamic performance (e.g., investments in split-scimitar winglets and blade-tip coating research with the U.S. Air Force).\nOFFSETS\n\nOffsets will play a role in compliance with the global CORSIA scheme and ultimately achieving net-zero by 2050.\n\nFor Delta to reach net-zero, out-of-sector solutions will likely complement fleet, SAF, operational initiatives and other in-sector technology improvements. Removal projects that absorb incremental and additional CO\u2082 from the atmosphere, such as afforestation and reforestation, or technology, such as direct air capture and carbon sequestration, will be necessary.\n\nWhile our primary focus is on decarbonizing aviation and reaching net-zero by 2050, we have also supported out-of-sector solutions for many years by purchasing carbon offsets. Deforestation needs to be halted by 2030 to achieve global climate goals. To further these goals, we continue to support the LEAF (Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest Finance) Coalition. This public-private coalition seeks to facilitate significant reductions in GHG emissions by financing large-scale tropical forest protection through a jurisdictional approach. LEAF works with national and subnational governments to ensure that all key stakeholders, including Indigenous Peoples, participate fully and receive a fair share of the benefits.\n\nIn 2022, we purchased and retired $116 million of carbon offsets which relate to a portion of our airline segment\u2019s 2021 and first quarter 2022 carbon emissions.\u00b9 We expect much of the remaining investment to support our goal to spend $1 billion through the end of 2030 toward airline decarbonization focusing on solutions other than offsets.\n\n\u00b9 In 2022 and Q1 2023, Delta purchased and retired offsets to cover flights flown and tickets purchased through March 31, 2022.\nIn the GHG emissions inventory below, CO\u2082e numbers cover all GHG emissions as carbon dioxide equivalents. CO\u2082 numbers only include carbon dioxide.\n\n| GHG Emissions Inventory\u00b9 (metric tons) | 2019 CO\u2082e | 2020 CO\u2082e | 2021 CO\u2082e | 2021 CO\u2082 only | 2022 CO\u2082e | 2022 CO\u2082 only |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------------|-----------|---------------|\n| Scope 1 Mainline Jet Fuel Combustion   | 34,967,854| 15,681,970| 22,647,716| 22,510,910    | 28,905,698| 28,731,090    |\n| Scope 1 Wholly Owned Subsidiaries Fuel Combustion | 2,181,283 | 1,342,575 | 1,745,400 | 1,734,856     | 1,668,437 | 1,658,358     |\n| Scope 1 Other                          | 179,284   | 150,360   | 168,140   | 162,838       | 166,865   | 161,488       |\n| Scope 2 Total                          | 295,889   | 274,076   | 246,219   | 245,048       | 203,486   | 202,944       |\n| Scope 3 Calculated\u00b2                    | 12,893,328| 5,935,956 | 8,561,092 | 2,338,830     | 12,302,246| 2,250,299     |\n| Sum of Emissions Above                 | 50,517,638| 23,384,937| 33,368,567| 26,992,482    | 43,246,733| 33,004,179    |\n\nAs part of our SBTi target-setting process, we assessed our Scope 3 emissions using the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain Reporting Standard. In 2022 we have expanded our disclosures around Scope 3 emissions to include additional categories, and we expect future work to focus on continually adding Scope 3 categories identified in the GHG Protocol.\n\n- Our GHG inventory covers emissions from all operations under Delta\u2019s operational control: Delta, Endeavor, Delta Vacations, Delta Material Services and Delta Flight Products.\n- The emissions reported for 2019\u20132022 were calculated and verified using the GHG Protocol, which aligns with the SBTi framework.\n\n\u00b9 Totals may not sum due to rounding.\n\u00b2 Scope 3, Category 3 calculations use primary data, and beginning in 2022, Delta calculated Scope 3, Categories 1, 2 and 4 using secondary, spend data.\n\u00b3 Beginning with this report and going forward, we will include upstream well-to-tank emissions from our mainline jet fuel in our totals going back to 2019.\nEMBEDDING SUSTAINABILITY IN EVERYTHING WE DO\n\nThe Travel Experience\nWe are dedicated to our efforts to accelerate the transition to a more sustainable and people-first future for air travel. In 2022, we continued our initiative to largely eliminate single-use plastics onboard our aircraft and introduced new, more sustainable products. Additionally, we diverted 2 million pounds of waste from the landfill. We analyzed passenger consumption to understand what they consumed onboard, allowing our team to onboard provisions accordingly. Understanding consumption prevents wasted products and saves fuel through reduced weight onboard our aircraft.\n\nREDUCING ONBOARD SINGLE-USE PLASTICS\nIn early 2022, we refreshed our onboard product offerings, and as a result of the initial replacement strategy, we estimate onboard single-use plastic consumption is reduced by approximately 4.9 million pounds per year through:\n\n- Continuing our transition to bamboo cutlery, introducing biodegradable dishware and replacing plastic placemats with premium paper. These transitions reduce annual plastic use by an estimated 2.4 million pounds.\n- Offering Imagery\u2019s cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay onboard, starting with select coast-to-coast flights and expanding to all domestic flights. The wine\u2019s aluminum packaging reduces annual plastic use by up to 250,000 pounds.\n- Being among the first airlines to use 100% recycled polyester (rPET) bedding, which \u2013 combined with the new reusable bedding packaging \u2013 reduces single-use plastic by up to 260,000 pounds per year.\n- Offering Delta One customers new amenity kits created by artisans from Someone Somewhere, a Certified B Corporation that combines traditional handcrafts with innovative products, preserving artisan traditions. The kits help reduce Delta\u2019s annual plastic use by up to 90,000 pounds by eliminating five single-use plastic items, including zippers and packaging.\n\nAs we move into 2023, we continue to look for innovative alternatives to single-use plastic products. We will explore alternative materials such as recyclable paper products as a key to further reduction. Our teams also continue to test a rotable cup program as we assess the viability of reusable cups on board commercial flights. These programs are our first steps in 2023 to further plastic reduction aboard our flights.\n\nDONATIONS\nReflective of our sustainability and giving back culture, we donated 1.3 million pounds of bedding, amenity kits, nonperishable food, water and other items to those in need in 2022. These donations, valued at $4.3 million, also included 68,000 pounds of PPE and first aid supplies and 90,000 pounds of perishable food that would have gone to the landfill.\n\n| 400,000 pounds of bedding and towels |\n| 50,000 pounds of water |\n| 80,000 pounds of amenity kits |\n\nImagery\u2019s wines are also sustainably grown, as certified by the California Sustainable Winegrowing Alliance.\n\n- Being among the first airlines to use 100% recycled polyester (rPET) bedding, which \u2013 combined with the new reusable bedding packaging \u2013 reduces single-use plastic by up to 260,000 pounds per year.\n- Offering Delta One customers new amenity kits created by artisans from Someone Somewhere, a Certified B Corporation that combines traditional handcrafts with innovative products, preserving artisan traditions. The kits help reduce Delta\u2019s annual plastic use by up to 90,000 pounds by eliminating five single-use plastic items, including zippers and packaging.\n\nAs we move into 2023, we continue to look for innovative alternatives to single-use plastic products. We will explore alternative materials such as recyclable paper products as a key to further reduction. Our teams also continue to test a rotable cup program as we assess the viability of reusable cups on board commercial flights. These programs are our first steps in 2023 to further plastic reduction aboard our flights.\nThe Travel Experience (Continued)\nWe also seek to source alternatives for certain products from which we cannot eliminate waste. To evaluate whether the alternatives we are sourcing for our onboard service and beyond represent a more sustainable option, we utilize a life cycle analysis tool to calculate and compare the GHG footprint and other environmental metrics of different product types.\n\nSKY CLUBS\nDelta Sky Clubs have eliminated pre-packaging for most food items and aim to use biodegradable or recyclable packaging options where feasible. Most clubs also have limited plastic products and have switched to compostable or reusable serviceware.\n\nMinneapolis\u2013Saint Paul, Seattle\u2013Tacoma and San Francisco International Airport clubs aim to be zero waste, defined as 90% landfill diversion. These clubs recycle, compost and provide reusable food service items.\n\nRESUMING ONBOARD RECYCLING\nMany airports halted their recycling programs during the pandemic. We have been working with each of these airports to help support them in all efforts to resume their programs. Our teams continue working with airports affected by logistical constraints to recycle at as many locations as possible. Through this hard work, we are currently recycling at 46 domestic airports.\n\nThe Power of Collaboration\nIn 2022, Delta took part in the Sky Team Alliance\u2019s Sustainable Flight Challenge to test and explore sustainability solutions. This initiative brought partner airlines together to share learnings and innovations with the common goal of reducing the industry\u2019s carbon footprint.\n\nOn the Plane\nOur most fuel-efficient aircraft in service at the time, the 737-900ER, took off powered by a fuel blend that included 400 gallons of SAF \u2013 marking a record for the largest amount of SAF used on a flight out of Atlanta. Gevo supplied the SAF for this record-breaking flight through its partnership with our team.\n\nThe aircraft included specific features to increase fuel efficiency and reduce drag, including new landing gear tires that reduce plane weight by 100 pounds and winglets.\n\nOne hundred percent electric ground service equipment (eGSE) bookended the Atlanta to Salt Lake City flight with battery-powered tractors and carts that loaded baggage and fuel. As mentioned in previous sections, we have invested to achieve a 25% eGSE fleet by the end of 2022, aiming for 50% by the end of 2025 and a 100% eligible eGSE fleet by 2035.\n\nIn the Sky\nAboard our record-breaking flight, our customer experience included receiving soft pillows and blankets made from recycled plastic bottles. Customers seated in First Class selected from an array of more sustainable menu offerings, such as meat sourced from ranches that practice regenerative land management and locally grown vegetables. First Class customers choose their meals before boarding, preventing wasted food on the flight. We offered all customers gourmet snacks served in recyclable packaging.\n\nAdditionally, customer service used no disposable plastic, recycled all beverage packaging and composted food scraps and serviceware in Salt Lake City. This flight was zero waste, with the exception of safety, health and hygiene items that must be single-use.\nGROUND SUPPORT EQUIPMENT ELECTRIFICATION PROGRESS\n\nGround Support Equipment (GSE) Progress\n\nTo reduce fuel burned by GSE that service aircraft between flights, we set a goal to achieve a 25% eGSE fleet by the end of 2022 and are planning for additional investments to achieve a 50% electric fleet (including 100% of electric core eligible GSE in 5 hubs) by the end of 2025 and a 100% electric GSE fleet in Delta\u2019s hubs by 2035. Delta is replacing internal combustion engine (gas and diesel) ground support equipment units with electrically powered equivalents. Electrified products offer improved sustainability and emissions (zero operating emissions, low noise and improved operator air quality), safety (more safety features and powertrain control), reliability (fewer moving parts and complexity), technology (foundation for future investment) and lower operating costs (reduced maintenance and fuel costs). Delta reviews multiple aspects of implementing new products, including safety, environmental impact and responsible supply chains.\n\nDelta\u2019s current lithium battery strategy focuses on lithium iron phosphate due to its increased safety and cobalt-free chemistry.\n\nIn 2022, we retired over 750 internal combustion engine units and replaced them with over 650 zero-emissions eGSE units. We bought baggage tractors and belt loaders (two largest fleets) and 100% of the purchase was electrified. Delta has doubled its electric fleet since the inaugural 2020 Delta ESG Report (12% in 2020 to 25% in December 2022).\n\nExpansion of eGSE depends, in part, on an adequate supply of alternative electric equipment and airport investment in charging infrastructure. We will continue working closely with our business partners to test, develop and encourage more eGSE options. Future investment efforts will center around airports that are eGSE ready and have adequate charging capabilities.\n\nElectrification Across Our Key Hubs\n\nAs we continue to electrify, the strong internal collaboration between divisions, including Corporate Real Estate, Government Affairs and Airport Customer Service (ACS), has provided the groundwork for advancing the electrification of our operations at Delta\u2019s hubs. Through Terminal Redevelopment efforts at LAX, LGA and SLC, we are adding the charging capacity needed to convert the core ground fleets (baggage tractors, belt loaders and aircraft tow tractors) to 100% electric. Further investments in BOS and SEA charging infrastructure will support 100% electrification of the eligible GSE over the next few years. Our focus in the New York City area (supported by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, IAT and others) led to the replacement of over 170 gas and diesel units and electric equivalents in 2022.\n\nAdding to the hub-specific wins, we reduced our off-road diesel emission rate by 42% over the last four years in California.\n\nThe purchase and installation of 40 Ground Power Units (GPUs) and 40 Preconditioned Air (PCA) units from a $5.4M partnership with the Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport and the Wayne County Airport Authority is an example of how collaboration with local airport authorities and federal programs accelerates efficiencies across our operations. In electrifying our gates, we aim to achieve a reduction of APU usage and, as a result, overall airport emissions.\nPROGRESS IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN\n\nExpanding ESG Standards for Suppliers\n\nOur focus on creating a world-class supply chain includes sustainable sourcing and furthers a significant long-term commitment to ethical and responsible procurement practices.\n\nWe utilize EcoVadis, a sustainability ratings platform for global supply chains, to evaluate ESG matters in our supply chain. We work collaboratively with suppliers to complete the EcoVadis assessment, obtain clear results through actionable scorecards and develop corrective action plans when needed across areas such as environment, human rights and sustainable procurement. A total of 256 suppliers have been assessed, including 107 of our top 200, surpassing our 2022 goal.\n\nDelta is committed to working with suppliers that adhere to responsible labor practices. The company evaluates vendors to ensure compliance with Delta\u2019s Supplier Code of Conduct.\n\nSCOPE 3 EMISSIONS\n\nIn 2022, we expanded our Scope 3 inventory to include our purchased goods and services, capital goods and upstream transportation and distribution (Categories 1, 2 and 4 respectively), to help establish a baseline for our supply chain emissions and facilitate our long-term emissions reduction efforts. As our sustainability journey continues, we will explore opportunities to attribute emissions more accurately and precisely to the types of products and suppliers we use and plan to partner with suppliers to refine and reduce our supply chain emissions.\n\nGoal Update\n\nOver half of Delta\u2019s Top 200 suppliers completed the EcoVadis assessment.\n\nPRODUCT HIGHLIGHT\n\nCustomers will now sip best-in-class tea sourced from around the globe in partnership with purpose-driven and Certified B Corporation Thrive Farmers. Customers in all cabins will enjoy bright English Breakfast tea. Delta One customers may also opt to sample soothing Guizhou Green, floral Egyptian Chamomile, calming Pacific Peppermint or malty Earl Grey.\n\nThe production of teas benefits thousands of Thrive Farmers\u2019 independent growers in Rwanda, India, China, Egypt and the United States. Thrive Farmers\u2019 innovative farmer direct model gives farmers a true stake in the sale of their produce. The reliable and consistent income allows farmers to produce better quality products, invest in their communities and improve environmental practices.\nENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS, BUILDING COALITIONS AND DRIVING POLICY DEVELOPMENT\n\nWe recognize many factors surrounding our climate goals are outside our control and will require significant capital investment, government policies and incentives, dedicated research and development and transformation of some of the world\u2019s largest industries. Two critical components of advancing and achieving our climate goals are effective public policy engagement and stakeholder engagement across sectors within and outside the aviation industry to bring cost-effective solutions under all levers to scale.\n\nWe have joined coalitions and partnerships centered around guiding ambitions. We describe a selection of those partnerships and coalitions here. Our team is advancing other important initiatives through the FAA\u2019s NextGen Advisory Committee, providing advice and recommendations to the FAA related to air traffic management and system modernization.\n\nAccelerating the Development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel Markets\n\nCLEAN SKIES FOR TOMORROW\nThis coalition provides a crucial global mechanism for top executives and public leaders across and beyond the aviation value chain to align on a transition to SAF. Delta served on the steering committee and actively contributed to working groups.\n\nFIRST MOVERS COALITION\nWe are a founding member of this public-private partnership and purchasing platform, facilitated by the Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry and the World Economic Forum, to accelerate and scale the development of breakthrough technologies and fuels through market-forcing strategies, helping hard-to-abate sectors, like aviation, reduce GHG emissions.\n\nTechnological Innovation in Fleet\n\nHYDROGEN FUEL WITH AIRBUS\nWe are working with Airbus to advance collective knowledge in the industry on the opportunities and challenges associated with using hydrogen fuel to power planes. We bring to the partnership the collective expertise and wisdom from our industry-leading teams: Flight Operations, Technical Operations, Airport Customer Service, Operations and Customer Center and Fuel.\n\nSupporting Fundamental Research and Development\n\nCONTRAILS RESEARCH\nWe are collaborating with MIT on research regarding the generation and potential elimination of persistent contrails. This research will be publicly released under an open-source license, enabling the industry to learn from this collaboration.\nCLIMATE RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nOur exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities informs our approach to climate and decarbonization.\n\nAs part of an industry that operates globally and is difficult to decarbonize, airlines are susceptible to climate-related risks such as extreme weather and increasing fuel costs. Identifying and understanding those risks and their potential impacts on our business is an important part of framing our overall climate strategy in response to an ever-changing climate landscape.\n\nOur Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework integrates specific climate risks into safety and security, operational, strategic, financial and legal and compliance risk assessments. In 2021, Delta conducted a climate scenario analysis to inform further and strengthen our understanding and management of potential climate-related risks.\n\nPROCESS FOR IDENTIFYING TRANSITION RISKS\n\nRisks arising from the transition to a low-carbon economy, including policy and legal, technology, market and reputation, may impact how we do business. To evaluate these risks, we applied three of the IEA\u2019s 2021 World Energy Outlook (WEO) scenarios, including:\n\n- Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) that sets out a pathway to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050 and is in line with limiting temperature increase to no more than 1.5\u00b0C\n- Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) that is consistent with the \u201cwell below 2\u00b0C\u201d goal of the Paris Agreement while achieving universal energy access and improving air quality\n- Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) that reflects current policies that are already in place, as well as those announced by governments and under development\n\nWe show the emissions trajectory and temperature outcomes of the three scenarios used in the analysis to project a particular future state of the world. GDP and population growth assumptions were held consistent across scenarios. For each scenario, we evaluated broad cross-cutting policy frameworks, detailed transport sector policies in regions in which Delta operates and forecasted prices of carbon and crude oil.\n\nPROCESS FOR IDENTIFYING PHYSICAL RISKS\n\nThe airline industry relies largely on business models concentrating operations in major airports globally. An extended interruption or disruption resulting from climate-related events, such as flooding in connection with rising sea levels at an airport where we have significant operations could have a material adverse effect on business. We evaluated 21 airport locations \u201312 domestic and 9 international \u2013 strategically important to our business to better understand our exposure to potential climate-related disruptions. For each location, we conducted a physical risk assessment to evaluate the risk of flooding and sea level rise, extreme weather events and increased temperature.\n\nThe baseline scenario used was RCP 8.5 (Representative Concentration Pathway), the perceived worst-case high emissions scenario where emissions are allowed to exceed cautionary levels and global temperature rises by about 3.7\u00b0C by 2023. This scenario is projected to cause irreversible damage to our planet\u2019s stability. When projecting an airport location to experience notable impact from certain physical risks like RCP 4.5, we used a lower emissions scenario where the global temperature rises only by about 1.8\u00b0C by 2100 to evaluate physical risks under a less dramatic scenario. Our physical risk assessment focused on 2050.\n### KEY TRANSITION RISKS  \n**Short-Term:** Before 2025; **Medium-Term:** 2025\u20132035; **Long-Term:** 2036 and beyond\n\n| Risk Type       | Potential Financial/Operational Impact                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Time Horizon | Management Strategies                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Policy/Legal**| Carbon pricing mechanisms could increase the price of aircraft fuel and could significantly impact our operating costs. We may be exposed to duplicative emissions pricing if a \u201cpatchwork\u201d of international carbon schemes are applied as opposed to a harmonized global approach. An increase in SAF mandates in various jurisdictions may result in increased operating costs due to the SAF premium or penalty in cases where SAF supply is not sufficient to meet the mandate. Additional regulatory policies governing aircraft emissions in the U.S. or abroad may increase our compliance costs. | Medium, Long | We monitor emerging regulations to understand potential risks and opportunities. We engage with policymakers and industry associations to advocate for solutions to decarbonize our industry and advocate for a global approach to addressing GHG emissions from international aviation. |\n| **Technology**  | Our climate goals rely on continued investment in fleet renewal, SAF and development of other technologies that are not commercially available or available at scale today. The cost to transition to lower emissions technology could result in increased capital investments in technology deployment, research and development (SAF or aircraft) or additional costs to adopt new technologies. | Medium, Long | We have established sustainability considerations as one of our key core pillars that guide our fleet strategy and our capital allocation decisions with respect to the fleet. A commitment to efficiency improvements from fleet renewal is expected to reduce GHG emissions intensity until new aircraft technologies that will further reduce emissions are available at scale. We are committed to engaging our stakeholders to help bring alternative fuels and new technologies to scale for the industry, including through public-private partnerships, such as the First Movers Coalition, focused on unlocking solutions for hard-to-abate sectors. These partnerships and coalitions focus on bringing SAF to market faster by influencing policy developments to support the production of SAF. |\n| Risk Type | Potential Financial/Operational Impact | Time Horizon | Management Strategies |\n|-----------|---------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------|\n| Market    | Business air travel could decline or recover at slower rates due to the increased use of alternatives such as virtual meetings and events. This could result in a decline in revenue. Demand for short-haul, regional flights could shift to lower-carbon alternatives such as high-speed rail in certain regions. Although such shifts are not expected to be material to Delta, this could also result in a decline in revenue. In addition to risks from potential changes to environmental regulation and policy, the transition to lower-carbon technologies, such as SAF, or changes in consumer preferences resulting from a negative perception of the environmental impact of air travel could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. For example, lower-carbon technologies such as SAF and direct air capture are currently not available at scale and may take decades to develop and the cost to transition to them could be prohibitively expensive without appropriate government policies and incentives in place. | Short, Medium, Long | We understand that climate change impacts from air travel are a concern for our customers, particularly corporate customers, as many are building \u201creturn to travel\u201d programs that have business travel reduction goals in order to meet climate metrics. We have announced our intention to set ambitious science-based targets to address our GHG emissions while still providing efficient transport for our customers. We also engage our corporate customers on sustainability by providing emissions data regarding their travel, along with opportunities to invest in SAF together to address our shared Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions using an in-sector solution. We believe our proactive climate strategy positions us to be an industry leader in sustainability to hedge against market shifts in consumer preferences. |\n| Reputation | Our reputation among customers could be impacted if we fail to make progress toward and achieve our ambitious climate goals. Not meeting climate goals or not setting aggressive industry targets may result in customers, investors and NGOs seeking more substantial improvements in the commercial airline sector. These risks could impact Delta\u2019s market share and revenue or result in a shift away from air travel more broadly. | Medium, Long | Maintaining our reputation and global brand is critical to our business. We have announced our intention to set ambitious climate goals and are diligently working to establish a transition plan to achieve our goals. We intend to reduce emissions through various levers as described previously. We also plan to continue to transparently communicate our actions and progress toward our goals and to work closely with our stakeholders to understand and seek to meet their expectations. |\n**KEY PHYSICAL RISKS**\n\n**Short-Term:** Before 2025; **Medium-Term:** 2025\u20132035; **Long-Term:** 2036 and beyond\n\nOur risk analysis assessed 21 of our most strategically important domestic and international airport locations and indicated that, with the exception of the airport noted below, the potential physical impacts (flooding and sea level rise, extreme weather events and increased temperature) under the scenarios used were projected to be negligible.\n\n| Risk Type                  | Potential Financial/Operational Impact                                                                 | Time Horizon | Management Strategies                                                                                                                                 |\n|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Acute Flooding             | Under a worst-case emissions scenario (RCP 8.5), acute flooding events at LaGuardia Airport (LGA) could potentially result in damage to airport infrastructure, such as runways. | Long         | We have completed major elements of construction for Delta\u2019s new terminal at LGA that will help mitigate risks to Delta\u2019s assets and critical systems. We are working with the Port Authority of NY and NJ to address the risk of flooding to the airport infrastructure. |\n| Sea Level Rise             | In both RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5, chronic impacts from sea level rise in LGA could damage airport infrastructure and may therefore require increased investment in fortifying the locations. Such increased costs could be passed on to us and increase our operating costs. | Long         | We are working with the airport authorities to understand the potential impacts of sea level rise and the airports\u2019 ability to fortify the shorelines, including at LGA. Additionally, we have the option to use alternative locations in certain highly impacted regions in case such risks become more significant in the future. |\n| Extreme Weather Events     | Extreme weather events such as hurricanes, typhoons and winter storms may continue to intensify and/or increase in frequency. Additionally, weather events, such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, may lead to disruptions in our fuel supply chain and operations. These disruptions may result in increased fuel costs, increased costs in handling irregular operations or decreases in revenue. | Short, Medium, Long | Our operations and real estate teams continue to work to mitigate potential extreme weather event impacts on our operations and assets, including working with airports to enhance airport infrastructure and adapting our operational procedures to prepare for such events. We monitor closely the likelihood of severe weather that could impact fuel supply and adjust fuel reserves at our hubs accordingly. Our efforts to diversify fuel supply, including expanding SAF in the fuel mix, are also intended to mitigate the risk of supply disruptions in the long term. |\n| Increased Temperature      | Extremely high temperatures (>114\u00b0F) may exceed the allowed temperature certified by the FAA; however, such temperatures were found to be extremely rare for the airport locations that we evaluated. | Long         | We monitor temperatures at our hubs frequently and evaluate the risk of acute temperature extremes. We continue to work with aircraft manufacturers to evaluate and improve the safety of our aircraft under these conditions. |\n| Risk Type          | Potential Financial/Operational Impact                                                                 | Time Horizon | Management Strategies                                                                                                                                 |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Resource Efficiency | Continuing to increase operational efficiency and deploy technical improvements that result in aircraft fuel efficiency could lower our fuel expenses and reduce our GHG emissions. | Short, Medium, Long | We plan to continue to renew our fleet by retiring less efficient aircraft and investing in newer generation models. We have established sustainability considerations as one of our key core pillars that guide our fleet strategy and our capital allocation decisions with respect to fleet. We continue to identify opportunities to further improve fuel efficiency. The Carbon Council plans to continue to focus on initiatives to save fuel and avoid GHG emissions. |\n| Energy Source     | SAF is a proven solution to decarbonize aviation, although it is not available at scale today. Increasing the percentage of SAF in our fuel helps us diversify fuel supply sources and reduce cost exposure to fossil fuels and potential carbon pricing schemes in the long term. | Medium, Long | Delta has a goal of having 10% of our jet fuel consumption come from SAF by the end of 2030. To achieve this goal, we are regularly evaluating multiple feedstock and technology types to understand the potential life cycle emissions reduction from different types of SAF. We are also putting offtake agreements in place to secure supply. |\n| Products and Services | As consumer awareness around climate change continues to grow, providing lower-emission air travel may improve our competitive position. | Short, Medium, Long | We have announced our intention to set ambitious climate goals and expect to utilize available levers, particularly fleet and alternative fuels, to advance these goals. We have been partnering and will continue to partner with corporate customers to scale up SAF for lower-emission air travel. Additionally, we work alongside our partners throughout the value chain to stay informed about emerging technologies and incorporate available technologies into our services. |\n| Markets           | Investing in strategic offsetting projects that support the shift to a lower-carbon economy may strengthen our relationship with the communities that we invest in and unlock growth opportunities for green infrastructure in emerging economies. | Short, Medium, Long | We evaluate the types of offset projects in which we have invested to understand their potential co-benefits and extended market impacts beyond emission offsets. We request projects that adhere to Delta\u2019s guidelines and principles. |\n| Resiliency        | Work with our airport hubs and our suppliers to better understand and develop capabilities that better protect our operations and assets from adverse climate physical impacts. | Short, Medium, Long | We regularly evaluate potential risks to our people, our business and our operation, including those to our critical systems. Our close relationship with our supplier partners and vendors provides us the capability to respond to short-term supply chain disruptions. Additionally, we work to diversify our fuel supply sources for both conventional fuel and SAF to increase resiliency in our fuel supply chain in the long term. Furthermore, we have identified opportunities to evaluate and analyze the potential impact of climate change on our business by conducting risk assessments and business impact analysis and integrating the findings into our risk mitigation strategies to better protect our company. |\nENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE\n\nThe Environmental Compliance & Health teams establish Delta\u2019s strategy, policies and systems to support compliance and implementation of best management practices to minimize environmental impacts and protect the health of our employees, customers and the communities we serve.\n\nThe programs serve as the environmental foundation of our sustainability efforts.\n\n- **The Environmental Compliance team** provides subject matter expertise and program oversight for air quality, water quality, waste management and disposal, remediation of environmental contamination, emergency response and represents Delta in interactions with federal, state and local environmental agencies.\n\n- **The Environmental Health team** provides expertise and program oversight for industrial hygiene/workplace exposure, chemical management, aircraft drinking water compliance and represents Delta in interactions with government agencies responsible for environmental, workplace health and safety and certain product regulation including, for example, OSHA, EPA, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n\nAs our operations continued to increase throughout 2022, approaching and, in some cases, surpassing 2019 levels, our environmental metrics remained relatively consistent. One exception was an increase in the number of environmental releases in 2022. When environmental releases occur, the Environmental team works across our operating divisions to ensure prompt notification, thorough response to minimize and mitigate any environmental impact and investigation with corrective actions to prevent recurrences.\n\n**Compliance Management**\n\nDelta continues to use three system tools to manage our environmental programs, reduce risk and minimize the impacts of our operations.\n\n**Delta\u2019s Environmental Management System (EMS)** outlines the overarching components of our environmental systems and processes and is modeled after the ISO 14001 framework. The EMS manages and tracks roles, responsibilities and procedures for compliance with regulations and implementation of best management practices on an airport-specific basis.\n\n**Delta\u2019s Environmental Programs Manual (EPM)** establishes Delta\u2019s policies, expectations and management protocols for internal environmental compliance with federal, state and local regulations and best management practices that go beyond compliance. The EPM sets forth environmental training requirements for employees and provides the forms, tools and resources to demonstrate compliance and reduce risk.\n\n**Delta\u2019s Environmental Management Information System (EMIS)** is a web-based tool that tracks internal environmental tasks outlined in the EPM. EMIS provides proactive notifications to station task owners to stay ahead of compliance tasks and generates reports to validate task completion.\nProgress\nWe measure environmental performance through a series of metrics, which include releases, violations, hazardous waste generation and air emissions.

Acting on that commitment, Delta created the new role of Vice President, Government Affairs \u2013 Sustainability, based in Washington, DC reporting to our Global Head of Government Affairs with a dotted line to our Chief Sustainability Officer. The new function reflects a best practice in responsible climate lobbying by creating a focal point for leading and coordinating Delta\u2019s advocacy strategies on international, federal, state and local climate policies. This structure empowers the entire Government Affairs function to strategically and collaboratively advance the company\u2019s climate goals in coordination with our business units.\n\nConsistent with this commitment to climate policy leadership, we strive for our coordinated lobbying activities and those of our membership-based trade associations to jointly support our climate goals. We constructively engage with our trade associations on climate policy and strategically engage with climate policy thought leaders, such as various environmental NGOs, think tanks and coalitions. The following sections address our direct and indirect climate lobbying activities, as well as certain lobbying activities of Monroe, over the course of 2022 and evaluate areas of actual or perceived misalignment with our climate goals and policy principles.\n\nClimate Lobbying Principles\n\nAs part of the highly regulated global aviation industry, we advocate for climate change policies that will help us achieve our climate goals. This requires concerted efforts to commercialize the nascent SAF industry and support breakthrough innovations in aircraft design. Our climate change policy principles provide a foundation for our advocacy and ensure consistency in our position development process. As a basis for navigating policies across the global markets, we embrace internationally and nationally harmonized policies to prevent the inconsistent application of policies that may result in competitive market distortions or send conflicting market signals. U.S. law, for example, recognizes the need for national consistency in aircraft regulation and preempts state and local regulation.\n\nDelta believes climate policy for the aviation industry should also be:\n\n1. Sector-specific but augmented by complementary policies to support our broader sustainability strategy (e.g., electrification of ground support equipment and operations);\n2. Preventative of revenue diversion for non-aviation climate mitigation purposes, ensuring we reinvest any revenue generated into this hard-to-abate sector and the diverse workforce it supports;\n3. Grounded in science to ensure GHG emissions reductions are maximized and realized in a manner designed to minimize increased costs for travelers;\n4. Performance-based, feedstock- and technology-neutral, recognizing the innovations needed to decarbonize our sector are not yet commercially available at scale;\n5. Supportive of the long-term capital investment necessary to sustain multi-decade aviation infrastructure and equipment commitments;\n6. Rooted in the need for operational safety, technological feasibility and economic reasonableness;\n7. Designed to drive efficiency in fleet procurement, fuel burn and air traffic operations; and\n8. Designed to incentivize rather than mandate a zero-carbon trajectory at the lowest cost (e.g., tax incentives, grants, R&D investment, voluntary opt-in), as there is no scalable market where SAF can compete on a level playing field with the on-road fuels market.\nDIRECT CLIMATE LOBBYING\n\nFederal\nIn 2022, the Administration and Congress advanced the largest investments in climate change policy in history, putting the United States on a path to achieve a roughly 40% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 and setting the stage for strong, incentive-based global leadership. Notably, the Administration accelerated its 2021 SAF Grand Challenge commitment by finalizing a comprehensive SAF Grand Challenge Roadmap, outlining a government-wide strategy for scaling up SAF production in the U.S. and serving as a replicable model for international partners.\n\nAs part of Delta\u2019s advocacy efforts in 2022, we positively influenced the federal policy environment through several key efforts targeting government funding, stakeholder engagement, legislative advocacy and regulatory implementation. Specifically:\n\n1. We directly advocated for increased funding and resources for the multiple federal agencies supporting the SAF Grand Challenge. For example, we advocated in support of the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA) Continuous Lower Energy Emissions and Noise (CLEEN) program and its Center of Excellence for Alternative Jet Fuels and Environment (ASCENT) as well as the Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) Bioenergy Technologies Office (BETO) to support the development of SAF at commercial scale.\n\n2. We also participated in stakeholder engagement with federal agencies and policymakers to inform the development of the final roadmap.\n\n3. We actively advocated alongside our supply chain and industry partners to support federal legislation to promote the development of the SAF market via targeted tax incentives and grants. Specifically, we supported the enactment of the SAF provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and in its earlier iterations (e.g., Build Back Better 2.0) as well as standalone policy measures such as the Sustainable Skies Act and the Aviation Emissions Reduction Opportunity (AERO) Act.\n\n4. Within the IRA, we also supported provisions that will enable the development of next-generation power to liquids (PtL) technology, among other breakthroughs \u2013 key to achieving net-zero emissions \u2013 including incentives for renewable electricity, clean hydrogen and carbon capture technologies. Additional policy measures of significance included the first-ever commercial EV credit and new as well as expanded loan guarantee authorities at DOE.\n\n5. Following the enactment of the IRA, we centered our advocacy around implementation and coordinated with supply chain and industry partners to file select comments with the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), encouraging flexibility in the interpretation of the law to maximize emissions reductions. We also set our sights on developing a coordinated advocacy strategy to support future bipartisan investment in SAF policy, given the short-term nature of the newly enacted SAF incentives.\n\nState\nWe laid the foundation for long-term engagement on SAF policy deployment and advocated for supportive policies to accelerate investment in SAF production in existing as well as new markets, with a prioritization on states where our hub operations are located.\n\nIn Georgia (GA) and Minnesota (MN), we fostered foundational discussions with multiple public and private stakeholders (e.g., GA Forestry Commission, Bioeconomy Coalition of MN) to create SAF ecosystems and directly influenced the development of the MN Clean Fuels Standard (CFS) Report. We also actively supported SAF incentive legislation in California, New York, Kentucky, Illinois and Hawaii.\nDIRECT CLIMATE LOBBYING (CONTINUED)\n\nExamples of our advocacy include:\n\n- In California, we directly advocated with industry and supply chain partners \u2013 inclusive of a robust media campaign \u2013 for significant budget support for increased SAF production as well as for legislation (AB1322) directing the California Air Resources Board to study and develop a plan for increased SAF incentives in its 2025 scoping plan.\n\n- In Illinois, we worked with a coalition of airlines and producers to successfully advance legislation (HB5749) providing a 10-year purchasers\u2019 incentive for SAF to help offset the state\u2019s jet fuel tax, which will be implemented in the summer of 2023.\n\n- In Hawaii, we successfully advocated to ensure SAF was eligible for the reinstated Renewable Fuels Production Tax Credit (SB2478) and worked with our trade association to advance the enactment of a new Low Carbon Fuel Advisory Board, inclusive of a commercial airline board member.\n\nInternational\n\nUnited Nations International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)\n\nOn the international level, 2022 marked the convening of the triannual 41st Assembly of the UN\u2019s International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The Assembly resulted in the adoption of a long-term aspirational goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions for international aviation by 2050, representing one of the only global sector-specific goals of its kind, as well as the adoption of a new baseline \u2013 85% of 2019 levels \u2013 for stabilizing GHG emissions from international aviation under ICAO\u2019s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).\n\nIn partnership with A4A and the International Air Transport Association (IATA), we directly supported the long-term goal and the important role of CORSIA as the only market-based measure governing international aviation emissions over a patchwork of individual or duplicative regulations (e.g., EU ETS), which can be problematic for an international industry. We also expressed concerns with the final baseline compromise, advocating to maintain the CORSIA baseline at 100% of 2019 levels for the duration of the program. Notably, the new baseline roughly doubles the costs of the program, potentially diverting billions in limited resources from preferred in-sector emissions reduction measures, such as SAF, to out-of-sector offsets. Moving forward, we believe it will be important for the United States to encourage the prioritization of SAF over offsets, to ensure structural decarbonization through additional policy supports and incentives, as well as take appropriate steps to implement CORSIA domestically with appropriate safeguards to protect the competitiveness of the U.S. industry.\n\nEuropean Union (EU)\n\nIn the EU, we again coordinated with our trade associations. We advocated for the EU to adopt incentives for SAF development and deployment, noting that the Refuel EU SAF mandate contained in the EU\u2019s Fit for 55 package seeks to drive SAF supply without appropriate incentives to enable cost-effective investment. Also, consistent with our support for harmonized global policies, we advocated for the exclusion of extra-European flights under the EU ETS to avoid undermining CORSIA and potentially adding duplicative charges and obligations for international aviation emissions.\nMONROE \u2013 DIRECT LOBBYING\n\nAt the federal, state and local levels, we also engaged in lobbying activities designed to reduce costs and enhance options for compliance flexibility associated with Monroe\u2019s operation of the Trainer refinery. We own Monroe as part of our strategy to mitigate the cost and supply risks associated with jet fuel. However, Monroe has experienced significant economic hardship under the federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) because of a lack of transparency and other flaws in the renewable identification number (RIN) credit scheme under that program, which make compliance costs prohibitive due to arbitrarily high RINs prices. This market failure undermines the larger goals and objectives of the RFS program. It is inconsistent with the original policy intentions of the program. As such, we have supported Monroe\u2019s efforts to seek policy reform measures to reduce the significant financial impact on the operation by advocating for transparent policies, such as lower volume requirements that better align with market supply and demand as well as a RINs\u2019 price cap to provide greater pricing stability and eliminate the opaque nature of the RINs market. Our advocacy intends to provide Monroe with greater financial certainty and economic flexibility to invest in the business, including investment in advancing its sustainability and climate objectives.\n\nWe have also leveraged Monroe\u2019s unique vantage point and expertise to inform our engagement with A4A and our value chain partners across the ecosystem to encourage the adoption of regulatory measures that may better incent SAF production. For example, we supported efforts to further update the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) Biointermediates rule under the RFS and advance more expedient pathway petition approvals, the lack of which restricts the SAF industry\u2019s growth by preventing the generation of RINs for fuel (e.g., co-processed jet fuel) produced from biocrude or other feedstock materials, among other items. Notably, as Monroe and other existing fossil fuel refiners evaluate opportunities for SAF deployment in the US, the volatility of the RFS RINs market is a major deterrent to sustained investment in SAF by creating significant challenges for companies underwriting the economics of SAF production. Additionally, the lower ethanol-equivalency value for most types of SAF compared to renewable diesel under the RFS places SAF at a competitive disadvantage in the renewable fuels market. Therefore, our Monroe-specific climate advocacy remains aligned with our larger climate goals and objectives as we look to advance policies that will help catalyze the SAF marketplace and help bring Monroe into our net-zero vision.\n\nINDIRECT CLIMATE LOBBYING\n\nIn addition to direct lobbying activities, we are members of sector-specific and multi-sectoral industry trade associations that engage in lobbying on a variety of matters, including from time to time climate change. Included in this section is a table of those trade associations and a description of our influence and potential alignment, where applicable, with the associations\u2019 stated climate policy priorities and any applicable insights from 2022. We have included all the trade association memberships disclosed in our separately issued annual political contributions and activity report that, to our knowledge, engage in lobbying activities on climate matters. Additionally, we have included Monroe\u2019s primary trade association membership in the table.\n### INTERNATIONAL AIR TRANSPORT ASSOCIATION (IATA)\n\n| About | Climate Change Position | Areas of Influence & Alignment |\n|-------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| IATA is the trade association for the world\u2019s airlines with a mission to represent, lead and serve the airline industry. Its 290 members comprise 83% of total air traffic, and it works with over 400 strategic partners to deliver solutions that shape aviation. | IATA recognizes the need to address the global challenge of climate change and has adopted an ambitious goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, in alignment with the Paris Agreement goal for global warming not to exceed 1.5\u00b0C. IATA also reaffirmed its support of global aviation industry goals under ICAO by:  \n- Reaffirming CORSIA as an effective measure to stabilize net emissions from international aviation in the short- to medium-term  \n- Calling for governments to support CORSIA, coordinate policy measures and avoid a patchwork of regional, national, or local measures  \n- Calling for governments to agree to a long-term goal equivalent in ambition to the industry\u2019s net-zero by 2050 goal  \n- IATA has also been a vocal proponent for global SAF incentives, key to decarbonizing the industry | Delta strongly supports IATA\u2019s net-zero goal. We also support IATA\u2019s active involvement in ICAO to promote harmonized global standards and international agreement on aviation emissions as well as complementary policies, such as SAF incentives. IATA\u2019s net-zero goal is an important signal to governments of the industry\u2019s ambition and helped enable adoption of an ambitious long-term net-zero goal at the 2022 ICAO Assembly. |\n### AIRLINES FOR AMERICA (A4A)\n\n| About | Climate Change Position | Areas of Influence & Alignment |\n|-------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| A4A is the primary trade association advocating for the leading U.S. airlines, both passenger and cargo carriers, on federal, state, local and international policies. A4A works collaboratively with industry stakeholders, federal agencies, the Administration, Congress, labor and other groups to improve aviation for the traveling and shipping public. | A4A is committed to advancing policy solutions to address climate change. A4A has committed to work with government leaders and other stakeholders on the following three goals, which it continues to affirm:  \n- Achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050  \n- Partnering with key stakeholders to advance production and deployment of 3 billion gallons of cost-competitive SAF by 2030  \n- Reaffirming the global aviation industry goals under ICAO, including:  \n  - CORSIA  \n  - Aircraft CO\u2082 certification standards applied to new aircraft and support for greater stringency  \n  - Adoption of a long-term aspirational goal, subject to critical aviation infrastructure and technology advances achieved by the industry and government | Delta strongly supports A4A\u2019s net-zero goal. We have played a leading role in raising A4A\u2019s climate ambitions and have a shared interest in advancing climate change policies that will help reduce GHG emissions on both a company and sector-specific basis. Our CEO sits on the A4A Board of Directors. At a staff level, we actively engage in key legislative and regulatory committees to influence policy development. Of note, we advocate for climate policies with A4A in several focus areas:  \n- SAF development, production and distribution  \n- Low/no emission technologies development  \n- Aviation environmental research and development  \n- Air traffic management and modernization  \n- Expansion of electric infrastructure and electric ground support equipment/operations at airports  \n- Implementation of the harmonized application of CORSIA and CO\u2082 aircraft certification standards  \n- Synergistic climate innovations across other sectors that can support aviation emission reductions |\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce is the world\u2019s largest business organization representing the interests of more than 3 million businesses of all sizes, sectors and regions.\n\nThe Chamber recognizes that humans are contributing to our changing climate and that practical, flexible, predictable and durable policies to address climate change are needed. The Chamber believes an effective climate policy should:\n\n- Support a market-based approach to accelerate GHG emissions reductions across the U.S. economy\n- Leverage the power of business\n- Maintain U.S. leadership in climate science\n- Embrace technology and innovation\n- Aggressively pursue energy efficiency\n- Promote climate resilient infrastructure\n- Support trade in U.S. technologies and products\n- Encourage international cooperation\n\nThe Chamber actively supported U.S. participation in the Paris Agreement and facilitated constructive business engagement with policymakers during COP27.\n\nAt the end of 2022, Delta withdrew its membership from the Chamber for reasons unrelated to climate or policy matters. However, Delta was a member of the U.S. Chamber\u2019s Task Force on Climate Actions, which was established by member companies seeking to influence the climate policy positioning of the Chamber from within and provides a platform for direct business engagement with diverse stakeholders influencing climate policy development. Through the Task Force and in other forums, Delta advocated for climate policies that support our sectoral interests, such as incentives for SAF and related research and development to support advanced propulsion systems and next-generation fuels.\n**BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE (BRT)**\n\n| About | Climate Change Position | Areas of Influence & Alignment |\n|-------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| BRT is an association of chief executive officers of America\u2019s leading companies working to promote a thriving U.S. economy and expanded opportunity for all Americans through public policy. For more than 45 years, the membership of BRT has applied CEO expertise to the major issues facing the nation. | The BRT believes that to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the world must work together to limit global temperature rise this century to well below 2\u00b0C above preindustrial levels, consistent with the Paris Agreement. The BRT also acknowledges that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s 2018 report limiting warming to no more than 1.5\u00b0C compared to preindustrial levels will be necessary to avoid some of the most severe risks associated with climate change. The BRT supports a goal of reducing net U.S. GHG emissions by at least 80% from 2005 levels by 2050. The BRT has developed a suite of principles by which U.S. climate policy should be guided, including but not limited to the following:  \n- Align policy goals and GHG emissions reduction targets with science  \n- Increase global engagement, cooperation and accountability  \n- Provide adequate transition time and long-term regulatory certainty  \n- Ensure that U.S. policies account for international emissions reduction programs  \nIn 2022, the BRT developed and adopted a \u201cRoadmap for U.S. Energy Policy,\u201d which includes a list of policy recommendations in response to the war in Ukraine and its impact on global energy markets. The recommendations included, among other measures, accelerating the clean energy transition and reducing overall energy demand. During COP27, the BRT hosted bipartisan conversations to advance global climate action. | Delta\u2019s CEO is a member of the BRT. In addition, Delta participates in the BRT\u2019s climate, environmental and governance committees at a staff level and leverages the organization for direct engagement opportunities with diverse stakeholders influencing climate change policy. This enables us to provide input into the development of BRT policy position papers and resources. We are appreciative of the BRT\u2019s recognition that while a market-based climate strategy should apply broadly across the economy, no one policy or approach can fully address climate change across such a diverse economy and such diverse sources of GHG emissions. The BRT\u2019s formal policy also notes that in unique circumstances, non-duplicative, tailored policies may be more effective or administratively feasible. For example, some emissions sources may face unique technological challenges or are subject to separate international agreements to limit emissions, such as CORSIA. |\n**AMERICAN FUEL AND PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURERS (AFPM)**\n\n| About | Climate Change Position | Areas of Influence & Alignment |\n|-------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| AFPM is the leading trade association representing the fuel and petrochemical manufacturing and refining industry. Its mission includes, educating policymakers, the media and the public on the value its members and their products provide the nation and the world as well as providing strategic business and technical information to its members, among other items. | AFPM is committed to engaging in the discussion and development of sound climate change policies. The association acknowledges climate change is real and is committed to the development of sound policies that enable its members to supply the fuel and petrochemicals that enable its members to supply the fuel and petrochemicals that growing global populations and economies need to thrive and to do so in an environmentally sustainable way. Policies addressing climate change must be:  \n- Balanced and measured to improve quality of life, ensuring the long-term economic, energy and environmental needs of humanity are met  \n- Protective of U.S. competitiveness and prevent the shifting of production, jobs and emissions from the United States to other countries  \n- Harmonized, preemptive and economy-wide  \n- Simple and transparent  \n- Achievable and flexible to adjust, as necessary | Monroe is a dues-paying member of AFPM. It has a representative on AFPM\u2019s Board of Directors (as do all other members) and on AFPM\u2019s Executive Committee. Monroe also has representatives on issue-specific committees, including environmental, fuels and government relations.  \nMonroe works alongside AFPM to advance policies that mitigate the economic hardship of RFS compliance as well as a diverse array of matters impacting the overall industry.  \nFrom a climate change lens, Monroe is working with AFPM to increase its thought leadership and engagement on the role the refining industry can play in the decarbonization of hard-to-abate sectors like aviation and heavy-duty trucking, including with respect to the role of SAF. As the fuel and petrochemical industries transition toward more sustainable fuels and feedstocks, Monroe\u2019s engagement in AFPM provides opportunities for Delta to send further demand signals for SAF production and to build relationships with prospective SAF producers as well as a platform for Monroe to explore potential SAF production pathways. |\nANALYSIS\n\nWe have evaluated the lobbying activities of the trade associations above for alignment with our climate goals and policy principles.\n\nWe analyzed alignment based on (i) whether the trade association has a climate position that supports the achievement of net-zero emissions by 2050 and/or temperature goals identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as the scientific underpinning of the Paris Agreement and (ii) whether specific trade association climate lobbying activities were consistent with our climate goals. The aviation-specific associations in which we are members have expressed strong support for achieving GHG emissions reductions in line with science, with both A4A and IATA having ambitious net-zero goals.\n\nThe advocacy efforts of A4A and IATA are geared toward advancing government policies and regulations that will support achieving their climate goals and opposing potential measures that would be harmful or counterproductive to reaching these ambitions. Thus, they align with our climate goals and principles. In some cases, approaches may differ yet continue to be aligned on goals and outcomes. The following are some illustrative examples which we believe are consistent with our climate goals.\n\n1. As discussed under our direct international advocacy, CORSIA is designed to stabilize international aviation emissions and is a multilateral, global approach, which is preferred to a patchwork of regional and jurisdictional approaches that may result in duplicative measures covering the same emissions. A4A and IATA advocated for the continued use of 2019 as a baseline for calculating offsetting obligations beyond the pilot phase of CORSIA to reduce dependence on out-of-sector offsets and further incentivize and facilitate the use of SAF to help decarbonize aviation operations.\n\n2. A4A and IATA have generally opposed SAF mandates that do not also include incentives that are well-designed to ensure a sufficient supply of SAF at competitive market prices and avoid competitive distortions. This opposition reflects the aviation industry\u2019s concern that mandates alone, without incentives designed to encourage supply and reasonable pricing, will not support the industry\u2019s ambitious decarbonization goals. Delta, A4A and IATA have therefore advocated for the EU to adopt incentives in addition to mandates to develop the SAF market and close the gap between traditional jet fuel and SAF. Collectively, we have also encouraged the adoption of a book-and-claim SAF accounting system as a means of improving the functionality of a mandated policy for a nascent market by providing greater supply flexibility.\n\n3. Additionally, IATA has opposed the EU\u2019s power to liquids (PtL) sub-mandate, which is at an even more nascent stage than SAF. Data demonstrate that prematurely requiring PtL could unintentionally increase emissions in the EU where there is an insufficient existing renewable energy supply to support green hydrogen in the early years of the program, undermining the objectives of the mandate. This position aligns with our principle that climate policy be grounded in science.\n\n4. A4A and IATA have opposed environmental taxes and fees where the revenue collected goes to national treasuries rather than aviation climate mitigation efforts, resulting in increased costs for travelers and the industry without corresponding benefits for the climate. Increased costs to the industry also reduce the ability of airlines to invest in new and more fuel-efficient aircraft and technologies.\n\n5. A4A and IATA advocate for globally aligned and coordinated measures to ensure that applicable measures are most effective and efficient and that airlines do not pay multiple times for the same ton of emissions. Without global harmonization, a patchwork of regional or national measures would only serve to increase the administrative burden and cost for airlines that often operate across multiple jurisdictions and distract from the sustained investments required to achieve long-term decarbonization.\n\n- Relatedly, at the state level through A4A, we opposed efforts by California and Hawaii to advance state-specific regulatory and legislative actions on federal preemption grounds. Notably, we opposed the regulation of aviation GHG emissions by the California Air Resources Board as well as the imposition of a state carbon tax on jet fuel (HB1639 and SB2007). Both positions are consistent with our principle of supporting harmonized national and international approaches to reducing aircraft emissions.\n6. IATA has opposed per-flight emissions disclosures at the national level due to variance in emissions methodologies by state that could lead to inconsistent and non-comparable disclosures and instead urged that any such requirements use a standard international methodology, which IATA is currently developing.\n\nWith respect to Delta\u2019s non-aviation-specific trade associations, the U.S. Chamber has not specifically taken a public position on the stated temperature goals identified by the IPCC, which does not align with Delta\u2019s climate goals; however, the Chamber has developed a clear climate change policy position and actively supported U.S. participation in the Paris Agreement while facilitating direct business engagement during COP27. The BRT also facilitated business engagement during COP27, and its climate change position indicates alignment with the stated temperature goals identified by the IPCC. However, its current 2050 ambition is not a net-zero goal.\n\n- There may be areas of perceived misalignment from the lobbying activities of these two organizations. For example, the Chamber and BRT actively opposed, on tax policy grounds, the overall Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) legislative package, which contained a variety of climate change-related provisions, including incentives to support SAF development, which Delta actively supported - although we did not take a position on the non-climate change related provisions of the broader package. Following direct engagement from member companies, the BRT expressed support for the provisions that incentivized clean energy technology deployment and the U.S. Chamber pointed to its growing support for bipartisan clean energy policies and expressed disappointment that the climate and clean energy provisions were tied to partisan legislation that they could not support.\n\nBoth organizations were ultimately criticized by NGOs and other groups for their positions; however, we do not find their lobbying activities to be inconsistent, given their analysis extended beyond the climate policy provisions of the legislation.\n\nWith respect to climate lobbying activity undertaken by our aviation and non-aviation trade associations, A4A, BRT and the U.S. Chamber filed comments on the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) climate risk disclosure proposal noting their support for more transparent and comparable climate-related disclosures while raising significant concerns around key provisions of the specific proposal. Each association expressed an intention to work constructively with the SEC to advance a reporting regime that is grounded in the SEC\u2019s long-standing concepts of materiality and that advances meaningful, decision-useful climate-related disclosures without being overly burdensome, complex or prescriptive. A4A, also provided airline-specific contextualization to demonstrate the range of interests and dynamics impacting our industry. We do not view any of these comments as inconsistent with our climate policies. As part of the iterative process, it is essential that trade associations provide sufficient input to inform this and future rulemakings governing disclosures.\n\n- Relatedly, at the state level, California sought to advance its own climate risk-disclosure proposal (SB260), which would have required reporting Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by corporations with over $1 billion in annual revenue. A4A opposed this legislation as duplicative of pending federal and international disclosure regimes, which is consistent with our climate policy principle of advancing harmonized policy approaches that mitigate redundancy.\n\nWith respect to Monroe\u2019s trade association engagement, AFPM has not specifically taken a public position on the stated temperature goals identified by the IPCC nor actively engaged in the COP process; however, AFPM has developed a climate change policy position, reflected in the previous table. This lack of clarity and engagement regarding the science-based temperature goals has resulted in criticism from NGOs and certain other organizations and is inconsistent with Delta\u2019s climate goals. There are also specific areas with respect to recent lobbying activities, including AFPM\u2019s lack of support for the SAF provisions in the IRA, where we disagree. In our assessment, AFPM partially took issue with the bill\u2019s treatment of liquid fuels, expressing concern with a perceived lack of recognition for their role in advancing a cleaner and more energy secure future. In contrast, Delta actively supported the SAF provisions within the bill as an important first step for scaling the market while acknowledging areas of improvement needed to provide investment certainty. While there are areas of misalignment, Monroe\u2019s engagement with AFPM has helped facilitate increased thought leadership and engagement within the association around the role of SAF and other clean fuel solutions for hard-to-abate sectors like aviation, which is supportive of Delta\u2019s SAF goal. Additionally, as the operator of an independent refinery, Monroe has utilized its membership in AFPM as part of its RFS compliance and risk mitigation strategy to seek permanent reform to the RFS program for the reasons explained previously.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that advocacy is only one element of Monroe\u2019s engagement with AFPM. It utilizes its membership to stay informed on, and to contribute to, best practices in the industry, covering a variety of issues beyond climate change including but not limited to safety, environmental stewardship and operational performance. Therefore, we believe the overall benefits of engagement outweigh the identified concerns.\nENGAGEMENT IS AN IMPORTANT LEVER OF INFLUENCE\n\nUltimately, we continue to believe our participation in diverse and multi-sector industry organizations, given our ambitious climate goals, helps positively influence the development and execution of climate policy positions and advocacy efforts. Participation in industry trade associations facilitates the identification, assessment and mitigation of risks and maximization of opportunities associated with emerging policy issues through constructive internal engagement and external advocacy, as appropriate.\n\nWith the continued utilization of our climate policy principles, we are sharing our expectations for climate advocacy with our trade associations and other stakeholders. While we do not always agree with the views or tactics of these trade associations, we believe they provide a valuable opportunity to understand the perspectives of various industry participants as we develop and evolve our advocacy strategy. We are committed to engaging in the collaborative problem-solving process and to working with our industry peers and other organizations in these political frameworks. Where we disagree with one or more of these trade associations on a matter tied to our strategy, we have in the past taken, and may in the future take, independent actions to mitigate any risks an association\u2019s actions may present to our strategy.\n\nAs the aviation and fossil fuel industries transition toward more sustainable climate solutions, Delta continues to evaluate operational pathways for integrating Monroe into a net-zero future - which includes RFS reform - and plans to continue to evaluate trade association climate policy positions while advancing opportunities to drive constructive change toward the advancement of our climate goals.\n\nConclusion\nDelta appreciates that many factors surrounding our ambitious climate goals are outside our control and will require significant capital investment, government policies and incentives, dedicated research and development and the transformation of some of the world\u2019s largest industries. As highlighted in this section, one critical component of the advancement and ultimate achievement of our climate goals is effective public policy engagement, including direct and indirect lobbying activities. Delta remains committed to being a voice of leadership on climate policy issues, including through trade associations.\nCONNECTING WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES\nCONNECTING THE WORLD THROUGH COMMUNITY IMPACT\n\nOur mission to connect the world starts with connecting to our communities.

Recognizing that our customers were also looking for ways to support people affected by the crisis, we ran a four-month promotion that allowed SkyMiles Members to donate miles that Delta then converted into dollars. These donations raised another $1 million toward the Red Cross Ukraine humanitarian relief efforts.\nSTRENGTHENING LOCAL COMMUNITIES\n\nGlobal change begins locally, which is why Delta gives back through local partnerships in communities across the U.S. and the world each year. In 2022, we:\n\nCommitted to numerous high-impact education programs ranging from early learning to higher education, like The Delta Air Lines Foundation\u2019s $2 million grant renewal for Adams-Young Academy at Cornerstone Schools, a $2 million grant for Spelman College\u2019s Center for Innovation & the Arts and a $1 million grant for Agnes Scott College\u2019s Global Journeys program.\n\nCommitted $5 million over five years to Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta\u2019s downtown hospital, Hughes Spalding, where they have strategically placed specific programs to address the clinical needs of kids in underserved areas, including clinics and programs for sickle cell disease, asthma, diabetes, family support and behavioral and mental health.\n\nCelebrated diversity in the U.S. and the world, including partnering with Pride organizations across the globe on parades and celebrations year-round.\n\nHelped revitalize historically underserved neighborhoods, including committing to a $5.5 million grant over five years from The Delta Air Lines Foundation to the Westside Future Fund with final payment to occur in 2023.

Delta people helped facilitate a week-long program to remember and honor those who were part of the significant turning point for the Allies in World War II. For some honored veterans, many in their mid-90s, it was their first time returning to France since the Normandy landings in 1944. With nearly 9,000 veterans working at Delta and many more continuing to serve in the Guard or Reserves, Delta people were proud to support this momentous occasion.\n\nVOLUNTEER ENGAGEMENT IN COMMUNITIES GLOBALLY\n\nOur employees serve as community ambassadors, showing up for causes they care deeply about to provide their time, expertise and donations.\n\nIn 2022, employees invested thousands of hours volunteering in communities globally, helped fundraise for key community partner causes and donated funds through The Delta Air Lines Foundation Matching Gifts to Education program.

We aim to communicate with customers promptly in case of a policy change or data breach. If an incident occurs, we assist those who may have been impacted by deploying our cybersecurity corporate business continuity plan, which is tested regularly to ensure its effectiveness. To maintain strict data security, Delta follows the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework, which emphasizes identification, protection, detection, response and recovery. We expect all Delta employees to adhere to information security and privacy policies as they handle corporate and customer information in their daily jobs. Our Information Security team is trained to remediate vulnerabilities identified within established timeframes and reports to management on a weekly basis regarding the security risk posture of our information technology assets.\n\nEnterprise-wide training is a vital component to reducing risk and promoting a secure brand that is serious about protecting customers, employees and company information. We require all employees and contractors with access to Delta\u2019s information to complete annual training, which is updated as new technology, security and privacy issues emerge. All new hires are required to complete training within 30 days of hire. We regularly assess our information security program capabilities and tools to improve reliability, enhance capabilities and scan our environment for vulnerabilities and weaknesses.\n\nOur Information Security Awareness program also includes an expert speaker series along with awareness and engagement events. We also participate in National Cybersecurity Awareness Month in October and Data Privacy Day in January.\n\nAwareness campaigns throughout the year focus on hot topics such as phishing, anti-tampering, data classification, password protection and ensuring a secure workspace.\n\nWe have established a dedicated Information Technology (IT) Risk team tasked with the goal of ensuring that risk remediation activities are carried out consistently and that risk remediation controls are operating as intended and within established thresholds.\n\nAt the Board level, the Audit Committee reviews cybersecurity risks and the security and operations of our information technology systems.

All emissions were calculated and verified using the GHG Protocol, which is in alignment with SBTi. Prior to our 2021 ESG Report, we calculated and reported emissions in accordance with The Climate Registry\u2019s General Reporting Protocol. Therefore, emissions for 2019 and 2020 reported prior to 2021 will differ from those emissions reported here.\n2. Tank-to-wake\n3. The Process for calculating Scope 2 GHG emissions from energy consumption (kWH) by Delta\u2019s leased facilities has changed from prior years by taking into account more granular facility square footage data.\n4. Well-to-tank. Mainline Jet Fuel WTT emissions for 2022 were calculated using the ICAO life cycle jet fuel emissions factor. Prior to 2022, Mainline Jet Fuel WTT emissions were calculated using a different emissions factor; therefore, 2022 emissions do not directly compare to prior year emissions. If 2022 mainline WTT emissions were calculated using the legacy emissions factor, resulting emissions would have been 7,781,117 mT of CO\u2082e. Note that the 0.56% progress toward our SBTi target was calculated using the legacy emission factor from the SBTi target validation process for consistency.\n5. Scope 3, Category 3 calculations use primary data, and beginning in 2022, Delta calculated Scope 3, Categories 1, 2 and 4 using secondary, spend data.\n6. Biogenic TTW carbon dioxide emissions are reported separately from the scopes consistent with current guidance from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.\n## FUEL EFFICIENCY\n\n| Metric Defined | Jet Fuel from
