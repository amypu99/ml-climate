Impact Report\nPurpose Guides Us\n\nThis year, NIKE celebrates its 50th anniversary \u2013 and 50 years of moving the world forward through the power of sport.\n\nOur journey started with Phil Knight and Bill Bowerman\u2019s vision to build the best running shoes in the world. Our goal was simple: serve athletes. And our belief was clear: do the right thing.\n\nToday, our passion for innovation still drives us. Our values continue to guide our growth. And our belief in sport will never, ever change. But now more than ever, we\u2019re dreaming even bigger about the difference that NIKE can make.\n\nToday, our ambition is to break barriers and build community to change the game for all. That means building a diverse, inclusive team and culture, and living the values that we share. It means innovating to protect our planet\u2019s future \u2013 and the future of the communities we serve.\n\nAnd it means moving people into action to create a better world \u2013 whether it\u2019s helping more kids access the joy and power of play, partnering to shape more equitable communities, or lending our voice and our example to help drive bigger change.\n\nOver the years, \u201cJust Do It\u201d has been a call to action for our team, too. We\u2019re proud of the progress we\u2019ve made. And we\u2019re even more inspired by how much farther we can go.\n\nSport moves us forward. It always has. And it always will.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve logged close to 150,000 miles in my career, and I feel as though I\u2019ve been a human barometer for change. I can see the changes in sport, in the world, in our environment. When I first started running, the so-called experts believed that if a woman ran more than a mile, she\u2019d do bodily harm. Well, here I am, two kids later, and I see more women than men out running and chasing their dreams. I think that says a lot about how far we\u2019ve come.\u201d\n\nJoan Benoit Samuelson, Long-distance runner\nLetter From John\n\nIf there is anything that NIKE\u2019s story proves, it\u2019s how powerful a shared purpose can be.\n\nFifty years ago, our journey began with a dream to serve athletes. As we grew, so did our belief in NIKE\u2019s role and opportunity for impact in the world.\n\nWhen we advocated for women\u2019s right to compete on sport\u2019s biggest stages, we saw the difference our voice could make. As we faced the threat of climate change, we realized that we couldn\u2019t just wait for solutions \u2013 we had to help create them. And as our society reckoned with racial injustice, we understood our responsibility to act \u2013 in our communities, and inside NIKE.\n\nOver the years, doing the right thing hasn\u2019t always been easy. And we haven\u2019t always gotten it right. But more than anything, what our journey has taught us is the importance of a bigger why.\n\nNIKE\u2019s mission is to bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete* in the world. Our purpose is to move the world forward through the power of sport.\n\nAnd in the face of today\u2019s pressing challenges, I believe that NIKE\u2019s potential to bring hope and inspiration matters more than ever.\n\nToday, we\u2019re redefining sport for a new generation. Whether it\u2019s prioritizing mental health and well-being; expanding opportunity for women and girls; investing in youth sport and addressing barriers to access; or helping more kids and communities discover the power of play and movement, we\u2019re working to shape a more equal, active and inclusive future.\n\nWe\u2019re innovating to meet the challenges of climate change \u2013 designing products with circularity in mind, giving new life to worn footwear and apparel, and collaborating across the industry to reduce our collective footprint.\n\n* If you have a body, you are an athlete \u2013 Bill Bowerman, Cofounder, NIKE\nWe\u2019re more focused than ever on building a diverse, inclusive team and culture, because creating the change we want to see starts with us. And through our platforms and partnerships, we\u2019re inspiring and empowering others to join us in working toward a more equitable future.\n\nNIKE\u2019s purpose is why I joined the company. And it\u2019s why I\u2019m so honored to be a part of this incredible team.\n\nNIKE is, and always will be, a brand of action. We don\u2019t just say we want to create positive change in the world \u2013 we set out to do it. And so long as we can help shape a brighter future, we will never stop working to do better.\n\nFor all the barriers that we have already broken, I believe our best chapters are ahead of us yet.\n\n\u201cWhat I love about sport is the opportunity it provides for us to create change. If there\u2019s even one little girl who picks up a tennis racket, feels more confident in her skin, leads a more active life because she sees someone who looks like her step out onto the court, that\u2019s my greatest victory.\u201d\n\nNaomi Osaka, Tennis player\nMay 1 marks 50 years of NIKE relentlessly innovating for athletes. 2022 is also our 20th year reporting on our environmental and social impact. Like our history, our future will be rooted in transparency, accountability and the belief that progress is possible.\nREPORTING HIGHLIGHTS\n\nClick links to be taken to the highlight\n\n2002\nFirst report\nWorkforce diversity disclosure\n\n2005\nFirst GRI Index\nFormal multi-stakeholder feedback on reporting\n\n2007\nFirst set of 5-year targets (FY11)\nGHG footprint\nTier 1 contract factories disclosure\n\n2010\nCarbon footprint of a shoe\n\n2012\nMeta trend analysis\nScope 3 carbon reporting\nFY15/20 targets\n\n2014\nValue chain footprint\n\n2016\nIssue Prioritization\nFY20 targets\n\n2018\nPay equity disclosure\nSASB Summary\nTier 2 suppliers disclosure\n\n2019\nTransition to annual reporting\nScience-Based Targets commitment\nExternal validation of data (carbon)\n\n2021\nPurpose targets connected to executive compensation\nFY25 targets\n\nFY21 NIKE, Inc. Impact Report\nLetter From the Chair of the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee\n\nPurpose is woven into NIKE\u2019s DNA \u2013 and foundational to NIKE\u2019s future.\n\nOver the years, purpose has shaped how NIKE operates its business, delivers sustainable growth, and creates value for consumers and shareholders. More than twenty years ago, the NIKE, Inc. Board of Directors established a Corporate Responsibility Committee specifically to oversee topics including environmental and sustainability initiatives, labor practices, community affairs and charitable activities, and diversity and equal opportunity. Not long after, NIKE released its first Corporate Responsibility Report, reaffirming its commitment to transparency and accountability.\n\nWhile the language has evolved over the decades, NIKE\u2019s commitment to do the right thing has remained unchanged. And the Board of Directors continues to actively oversee the company\u2019s purpose, because we know that strong governance supports and enhances NIKE\u2019s capacity to make progress.\n\nToday, the Board primarily exercises its oversight of NIKE\u2019s purpose through the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee. The committee oversees both the opportunities and risks associated with NIKE\u2019s three purpose pillars \u2013 people, planet and play. As a committee, we have been proud to monitor the development of NIKE\u2019s purpose 2025 targets and the company\u2019s performance against these targets. We are pleased to share NIKE\u2019s progress in this FY21 Impact Report.\n\nMichelle Peluso\nChair, Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee\nNIKE, Inc. Board of Directors\n2025 Targets\nWe are always committed to progress.\n\nIn 2022, NIKE celebrates 50 years of relentlessly pursuing innovation and 20 years of tracking and reporting our impact.\n\nAs NIKE has grown, so has our understanding of NIKE\u2019s role and responsibility around the world.\n\nOver two years, NIKE developed a set of challenging, but achievable, corporate commitments. The result is 29 targets against our People, Planet and Play efforts for 2025. We hold ourselves accountable to these targets through action plans and rigorous tracking.\n\nOur approach is industry-leading because we:\n\n\u2022 Connect executive compensation to progress against our 2025 targets\n\u2022 Leverage annual milestones to improve performance management\n\u2022 Extend accountability of targets deeper into our value chain, specifically in the areas of waste, labor and supplier diversity\n\u2022 Align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and other global external frameworks\n\nWe know that progress will not be linear, but accountability in this space means sharing our successes and learning from our setbacks. For 20 years, we\u2019ve remained committed to transparency by sharing our performance and progress through our Impact Report.\n## FY21 Performance Summary\n\n### People\n\n| Representation & Hiring | Metric | FY20 | FY21 | FY21 Change vs. Baseline | FY25 Target |\n|-------------------------|--------|------|------|--------------------------|-------------|\n| 50% representation of women in global corporate workforce and 45% in leadership positions | % women in global workforce | 50.2% | 50.4% | 0.2 p.p. | 50% |\n| | % women in leadership positions | 39.3% | 43.0% | 3.7 p.p. | 45% |\n| 30% representation of U.S. racial and ethnic minorities at Director level and above | % U.S. racial and ethnic minorities at Director level and above | 26.1% | 30.3% | 4.1 p.p. | 30% |\n| 35% representation of U.S. racial and ethnic minorities in our U.S. corporate workforce | % U.S. racial and ethnic minorities in U.S. corporate workforce | 31.6% | 34.3% | 2.8 p.p. | 35% |\n| $10 million investment in Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) | $ invested | \u2013 | $450,000 | \u2013 | $10M |\n| Enhance opportunities and marketing of open roles for first-line athletes to compete for corporate roles | Qualitative | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 |\n| 100% of strategic suppliers have gender equitable (GE) workplaces | % suppliers achieving mature gender equitable capability | \u2013 | 0% | \u2013 | 100% |\n\n### Pay & Benefits\n\n| Pay & Benefits | Metric | FY20 | FY21 | FY21 Change vs. Baseline | FY25 Target |\n|----------------|--------|------|------|--------------------------|-------------|\n| 100% pay equity across all employee levels on an annual basis | $ earned by men/women;

The continual expansion of our Purpose targets\u2019 depth and breadth is a key element of our strategy. As such, we introduced new areas included in target scope with the 2025 targets. As a result, in many cases, FY20 values disclosed in the FY20 NIKE Impact Report differ from those provided in this report, reflecting the more inclusive measurement scope in our most current targets.\n\nFor the 9 Planet targets and the 3 Supply Chain targets, the target year (in which the target value is expected to be achieved) is considered the full FY25. For the Foundational Expectations target and the People targets, FY25 Q4 constitutes the final measurement period.\n\n2 p.p. = percentage points.\n\n3 U.S. Racial and Ethnic Minorities as defined by EEO1 categories including American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian, Black or African American, Hispanic/Latino, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander.\n\n4 U.S. corporate workforce includes all U.S.-based full-time employees who do not work in our retail stores, distribution centers and Nike Air manufacturing innovation (Air MI).\n\n5 First-line athletes include full-time employees who work in our retail stores, distribution centers or Nike Air manufacturing innovation (Air MI).\n\n6 Strategic Suppliers: Strategic Finished Goods Suppliers; Suppliers representing approximately 80% of total footwear and apparel production.\n\n7 In order to reach mature gender equity, suppliers must achieve an overall Gender Equity Self-Diagnostic Tool (SDT) score of 71% and perform at a certain threshold in each of SDT\u2019s 10 domains. This target baselined in FY21 as the tools to measure didn\u2019t exist when the target period started. While none of the strategic suppliers reached a mature level of gender equity in FY21, more than 95% of suppliers met our FY21 milestone to deploy and validate the Gender Equity Diagnostic Tool, develop an action plan and implement actions.\n\n8 Healthy and safe workplaces: Supplier must reach Level 3 safety and health maturity on Culture of Safety Maturity Assessment (CoSMA).\n\n9 This index measures the emotional commitment our team members have for NIKE, influenced by their day-to-day experiences.\n\n10 This index measures the extent that our teammates feel that NIKE supports a culture of diversity and inclusion, as well as their personal perceptions around feeling valued and included.\n\n11 Criteria for measuring and improving engagement must be met for the factory to count toward the KPI of measuring and improving. While most suppliers have started to measure worker voice in their facilities, none have advanced to the next phase, which involves responding to and improving worker experience. We will begin reporting on progress next year as suppliers begin to enter this next phase. The target baselined in FY21 and wasn\u2019t measured in FY20.\n\n12 At the end of FY21, no Vice Presidents had been credentialed because of the program launching in April 2021.\n\n13 A Diverse Supplier is one that must be majority (at least 51%) owned, operated, managed, and controlled by a diverse* person or persons who are either U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. A \u201cdiverse person\u201d may be defined as a minority**, woman, disabled, LGBTQ and/or veteran. **Minority defined as African-American, Hispanic, Asian-American, Native-American, Pacific Islander or other types of ethnic minorities here in the United States.\n\n14 Target represents NIKE\u2019s Scope 1 and 2 emissions footprint, including facilities and HQ fleet vehicles, and corporate jets.\n\n15 FY15 is the baseline for NIKE\u2019s RE100 target, which was 14% renewable energy.\n\n16 This metric is part of Management\u2019s Assertion on select sustainability metrics, which PwC has performed limited assurance over for the period from June 1, 2020, to May 31, 2021, as indicated in the Report of Independent Accountants.\n\n17 Renewable electricity use was 14% when this target baselined in FY15.\n\n18 Scope includes suppliers representing approximately 80% of total footwear and apparel production; suppliers representing approximately 80% of total footwear upper materials and apparel textiles production; and about 95% of both inbound and outbound transportation.\n\n19 Footwear EPMs: Recycled Polyester, Recycled Rubber, Leather that reduces NIKE\u2019s enterprise carbon impact; currently includes synthetic leather and Flyleather. Apparel EPMs: Recycled Polyester, Organic Cotton, Recycled Cotton, Third Party Certified Cotton.\n\n20 Scope includes packaging applied in finished goods manufacturing; suppliers representing approximately 95% of total footwear production; Air Manufacturing Innovation; distribution centers; and Headquarter locations. Apparel manufacturing waste not yet included in reporting scope as data sources for target tracking are under establishment.\n\n21 Scope includes suppliers representing approximately 95% of total footwear production and about 60% of apparel; Air Manufacturing Innovation; distribution centers; and Headquarter locations. Diverted: Includes waste to energy incineration, recycled waste and composted waste. Recycled: Includes recycled and composted waste.\n\n22 Finished Product Waste consists of: Unsellable inventory in NIKE\u2019s marketplace (product deemed as unsellable through normal sales channels including aged inventory, samples, defectives, consumer returns); and end-of-life product owned by the consumer.\n\n23 Scope includes suppliers representing approximately 80% of total footwear upper materials and apparel textiles production.\n\n24 Restored through a portfolio of projects that support long-term resilience for water-stressed ecosystems and communities within our extended cotton supply chain.\n\n25 This metric is based on more than $550,000 in funding from NIKE which is part of Management\u2019s Assertion on select sustainability metrics, for which PwC has performed limited assurance over the cumulative funding since inception through May 31, 2021, as indicated in the Report of Independent Accountants.\nWE INVEST IN PEOPLE TO MOVE FORWARD\nAt its best, sport redefines human potential.\n\nWhen people can see their potential and know what they\u2019re capable of, they can do great things. But we know that barriers to achieving our individual and collective greatness persist.\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re building a diverse and inclusive team at NIKE to reflect the unique communities of the athletes we honor and the people who love our products. It\u2019s also why we\u2019re investing in more equal, inclusive and active communities.\n\nWe\u2019re working to break down barriers so everyone has the opportunity to be the best they can be \u2013 at NIKE and in the communities we serve.\nFocus Area\n\nREPRESENTATION & HIRING\n\nMove the world with a career at NIKE\nQuantitative Target (Employees)\n\n50% representation of women in global corporate workforce and 45% in leadership positions\n\nDiverse teams are more innovative, collaborative and productive. At NIKE, we believe a diverse, inclusive team and culture is necessary to create an equitable playing field for the future.\n\nAs gender inequality in the workplace remains a pervasive global issue, we strive to enable women to reach their full career potential while staying committed to fostering an environment that supports them in the workplace. We know that hiring and promoting women into leadership positions is good for employees, our business and the communities around the world in which we operate.\n\nDuring FY21, we increased the percentage of women in our global corporate workforce to 50.4% and women in leadership positions to 43.0%. We also expanded diversity recruitment and continued our use of transparent, data-driven talent practices and decisions.\n\nThrough our diverse slates process, we seek to fill positions using a diverse pool of qualified candidates. In FY21, the process was a key element to increase talent at the leadership level through externally posted roles. And to support this process, hiring managers are trained on guidelines, including how to post roles with inclusive language, create diverse interview panels and use appropriate escalation paths when representation targets were not met.\n\nWe also built relationships with over 50 external partners (including The Mom Project, Lesbians Who Tech and Women Who Code) while actively participating in several events (such as the Grace Hopper Celebration) that allowed us to source candidates from a variety of backgrounds. We consistently leverage these engagements to showcase NIKE as an employer of choice for underrepresented groups and to share opportunities that prospective talent may not be aware of, including areas outside of which we are primarily known, such as technology.\n\nInternally, our Women of Nike & Friends Network \u2013 through NikeUNITED \u2013 continues to play a significant role in retention and promotion of women through its robust, interactive programming. In FY21, the network held over 25 events, including NOW with Women of NIKE: Setting Career Intentions for 2021, International Women\u2019s Day with\nSerena Williams and Unlocking the Power of Women in Investing. WON continues to expand beyond the U.S., and within our APLA\\textsuperscript{26} geography, we established a new WON Network to amplify local voices as we continue to foster a sense of belonging and inclusion within the workplace and within our geographies.\n\nOur NikeUNITED Networks\n\nTeammates across NIKE have formed several networks, collectively known as NikeUNITED. These employee-formed and -managed communities offer resources to NIKE teammates around the world, helping advance the development of their members, promote cultural awareness, and help strengthen our commitment to diversity and inclusion.\n\n- Ability* Network\n- Ascend Network & Friends\n- Black Employee Network & Friends\n- Latino & Friends Network\n- NIKE Military Veterans & Friends\n- Native American Network & Friends\n- PRIDE Network\n- Women of NIKE & Friends\n\nConverse has also adopted this model with five distinct Employee Networks, collectively known as Converse United, including Converse Mosaic Network, Converse Pride Network, Women of Converse, Converse Military Veterans and Converse Abilities Network.\n\nMore information can be found at NikeUNITED.\\textsuperscript{27}\n\nAdditionally, various business functions have established sponsorship programs to further accelerate the career trajectory of women in the workplace. For example, two signature programs NIKE has developed to drive greater representation are:\n\n- **Women in NIKE (WIN):** a best-in-class, 24-month journey designed to provide a relevant and dynamic work experience for retired and retiring Women\u2019s National Basketball Association (WNBA) players. In FY21, the inaugural cohort successfully completed the program and later in CY21 the third cohort of 16 began their journey. Each of the 11 WIN fellows from the inaugural cohort continue to grow their careers with NIKE.\n\n\\textsuperscript{26} APLA stands for Asia-Pacific and Latin America.\n\\textsuperscript{27} https://purpose.nike.com/employee-networks\nValari: a nine-month fellowship that engaged the talents of former caregivers \u2013 who have already paved a way in the technology industry \u2013 and are eager to get back in the game by enhancing and restarting their careers. Launched in FY21, the program provides a curated learning experience that includes accelerated leadership development, career coaching, committed executive sponsors and NikeUNITED Network support, as well as mentorship.\n\nIn addition to developing signature programs targeting the advancement of women in the workplace, we also work with organizations (PowerToFly, Grace Hopper, Advancing Women Executives (AWE), etc.) that align with NIKE\u2019s values and goals to support women and drive representation and opportunity.\n\nWhile the landscape for top talent remains competitive, our targeted efforts and enhanced investments keep us on track to meet and potentially surpass our 2025 target for representation of women.\n\nMore Data\nNIKE, Inc.

Others are focused on specific populations.\n\nThe chart on the right shows how they are distributed.\n\n| U.S. Employee Population | % Women | % US Racial and Ethnic Minority | 2025 Targets |\n|--------------------------|---------|--------------------------------|--------------|\n| Corporate Employees     | 50.4%   | 34.3%                          | Representation |\n|                          | \u25b2 0.2 p.p. | \u25b2 2.8 p.p.                     | Professional Development |\n|                          |          |                                | Pay & Benefits |\n|                          |          |                                | Culture & Engagement |\n| Air MI                   | 37.5%   | 61.5%                          | Pipeline |\n|                          | \u25b2 0.4 p.p. | \u25bc -0.3 p.p.                    | Pay & Benefits |\n|                          |          |                                | Culture & Engagement |\n| Distribution Centers    | 48.5%   | 88.8%                          | Pipeline |\n|                          | \u25b2 0.9 p.p. | \u25b2 1.2 p.p.                     | Pay & Benefits |\n|                          |          |                                | Culture & Engagement |\n| Retail Employees        | 50.9%   | 77.3%                          | Pipeline |\n|                          | \u25b2 2.0 p.p. | \u25b2 1 p.p.                       | Pay & Benefits |\n|                          |          |                                | Culture & Engagement |\n\n\u25b2\u25bc Change since FY20\nAt NIKE, focusing on U.S. racial and ethnic minorities is important for the business and the culture we\u2019re building. Emphasizing Black and Latinx teammates allows us to better encompass, reflect, understand and appreciate our consumers, their communities and their cultures.\n\nThis focus helps NIKE build an inclusive company of the future \u2013 with a diversity of perspectives and experiences that helps to drive innovation, broadens our thinking as global citizens and strengthens our power to solve problems. And while hiring new, world-class talent will be necessary, we must also increase representation by promoting and developing the outstanding talent we already have \u2013 across all levels, and across all U.S. racial and ethnic minorities.\n\nDuring FY21, we increased the percentage of U.S. racial and ethnic minorities at Director level and above to 30.3%.\n\nWe\u2019ve expanded our focused development for our U.S. racial and ethnic minorities, and we now include McKinsey & Company\u2019s Management Program for mid-level leaders and McKinsey Academy for our Senior Directors and Vice Presidents. These programs aim to enhance these employees\u2019 skills and capabilities, better equipping them and the organization for future growth.\n\nNIKE also initiated a diversity and inclusion mentorship program for corporate employees in the U.S., which strives to further promote equity, opportunity, belonging and an inclusive culture. To date, over 600 employees have participated in the program. We look forward to expanding the program in FY22.\n\nMore Data\nNIKE, Inc. Totals by Race/Ethnicity (U.S.)\nAt NIKE, we are determined to increase representation within our U.S. corporate workforce. To achieve this target, we have partnered with expert external consultancies to develop targeted advocacy plans, focused on belonging, employee development and leadership representation across African American/Black, Hispanic/Latinx and Asian American/Pacific Islander demographics.\n\nWe continue to drive allyship through integrated programming and initiatives that support cultural awareness and leadership representation. We also prioritize the recruitment of the best and brightest talent available \u2013 bringing to NIKE critical capabilities that support our continued business growth while building a talent pipeline and diversifying our workforce.\n\nIn FY21, we scaled up our hiring efforts across traditional channels like executive recruiting, campus recruiting, and sourcing and partnerships. We are excited for these innovative programs and efforts to proactively expand our reach and talent diversity.\n\nWe\u2019re starting to see results from our investments in signature programs such as Serena Williams Design Crew (SWDC) \u2013 a six-month apprenticeship program to diversify talent within the design industry. Seventy percent of our diverse designers from our first cohort in New York City accepted full-time design positions within NIKE \u2013 all having worked on the premier launch of the Serena Williams Collection. In FY21, we expanded our pipeline efforts for Cohort 2, with eight of 11 accepting full-time positions. For Cohort 3, the program has grown to 14 designers.\n\nOn the heels of the SWDC\u2019s success, NIKE\u2019s Human Resources Innovation team partnered with Converse to launch a new internal design apprenticeship program in the U.S. in 2021. The Converse All Star Design Team offers a six-month course to six design apprentices from diverse backgrounds. The course focused on advanced learning and development education, networking and hands-on experience in global design and product creation and was supported by a team of 20 Converse designers, managers and peers. Two individuals from the program were hired, with Converse planning to continue it in FY22.\nIn addition, NIKE will continue recruiting across other key groups, such as the Native American and Indigenous community through our Nike N7 product collection, inclusive community portfolio and our internal employee network, the Native American Network (NAN). For example, the White House and Nike N7, alongside the Aspen Institute\u2019s Center for Native American Youth (CNAY), regularly convenes Native and tribal youth to participate in the White House Tribal Youth Forum. This forum features high-level administration officials, special guests from Nike N7 and Native youth discussing a variety of topics, such as mental health.\n\nIn FY21, NIKE hosted our second annual Footprint Summit, which focuses on creating pathways to potential corporate and other economic opportunities for Native and Indigenous community members. We saw a 44% year-over-year increase of attendees, particularly university and industry candidates and advocates from Native American and Indigenous communities. This event was entirely virtual, with expanded content delivered over two days and including 18 internal and external speakers, NIKE executives, employees, Nike N7 athletes and external partners. We look forward to the next summit, where we\u2019ll bring even more opportunity to this community.\n\nBeyond our corporate workforce, we have invested in retail, distribution centers and Air MI through the following initiatives:\n\n- Through Lane Four, NIKE offers a direct pay education program to enable distribution center and Air MI team members to complete their first bachelor\u2019s degree, in partnership with the University of Memphis. Inspired by the desire to make education equitable and accessible, Lane Four goes beyond standard corporate tuition reimbursement programs \u2013 with NIKE paying the University of Memphis directly. The benefits include Prep Academy with an earned admission track (no entry tests or GPA requirements), no out-of-pocket tuition costs, a laptop loaner program and 24/7 tutoring. Since its inception in December 2020, Air MI and more than 130 NIKE distribution center teammates have enrolled in the program.\n\n- NIKE is part of the Greater Memphis Chamber of Commerce Buy Memphis pilot B2B procurement initiative. This program engages Memphis companies to develop individual and shared processes and investments for driving more spend to locally, minority- and women-owned businesses.\n\n- Through our Starting Line-Partner initiative, we work with community-based organizations to design and deliver a multi-week onboarding experience to reach new distribution center talent while equipping potential candidates with essential skills.\n$10 million investment earmarked for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) in the form of scholarships and academic partnerships to increase intern and direct hires\n\nAt NIKE, we have seen positive progress hiring from the Black and Latinx communities at the early-in-career level. To further facilitate this progress, we have increased engagement with and participation from HBCUs and HSIs. In FY22, we look to amplify the progress we made in FY21 and make significant headway on our target.\n\nNIKE has established pathways for access and visibility within the HBCU/HSI network with a sharp focus on key institutions. NIKE has expanded its sponsorship of student clubs and organizations as well as within universities\u2019 career development centers. We\u2019ve invested $200,000 to support students with stipends for tuition and books at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University. We\u2019ve invested $250,000 with the Hispanic Scholarship Fund to provide scholarships, career readiness preparation and access to job opportunities.\n\nFurthermore, the \u201cUntil We All Win\u201d grant portfolio in North America supports HBCUs and HSIs through contributions to the following college funds:\n\n- United Negro College Fund (private HBCUs)\n- Thurgood Marshall College Fund (public HBCUs)\n- Hispanic Heritage Foundation (HSIs)\n\nIn FY21, NIKE made a strategic investment, creating a recruiting and sourcing team focused on engaging candidates from HBCUs and HSIs.\n\nOur University Relations and Recruiting Programs efforts in the U.S. have helped drive our diversity and inclusion strategies, as we\u2019ve expanded support to early-in-career and emerging leader talent pipelines. The demand for top, diverse talent remained strong in FY21 as we saw a flow of qualified talent consistent with pre-pandemic levels. For the second consecutive year, we hosted a comprehensive, virtual experience to help drive recruitment and interest.\nWith a commitment to growing our future workforce, we routinely rank among the top Global Internship programs and continue to see progress in the diversity of our intern class. Within our 2021 intern class, 32% identified as U.S. racial and ethnic minorities (FY20: 49%). Though our diversity progress is industry-leading, we attribute the FY21 dip in our U.S. racial and ethnic minority percentages to a decrease in the size of our intern class \u2013 due to the impact from the global pandemic. As with the previous year, we consistently saw high rates of internship conversions to full-time positions throughout NIKE, in line with industry benchmarks \u2013 even during the pandemic.\n\nAs a result of these initiatives, in FY21, 20% of NIKE\u2019s university talent applicants were candidates from HBCUs and HSIs (FY19: 8%; FY20: 18%).\n\nNIKE is also deepening and expanding our engagement with the HBCU and HSI network through an internal council. The purpose of this council is to leverage the knowledge and experience of NIKE employees who have attended or have a meaningful connection to HBCUs and HSIs, with the goal of strengthening NIKE\u2019s relationship with these communities through mentorship, scholarships and experiences.\nQualitative Target (Employees)\n\nEnhance opportunities and marketing of open roles for first-line athletes to compete for corporate roles\n\nAt NIKE, our employees who work at our retail stores are talented individuals made up of many cultures and backgrounds from across the globe \u2013 and they reflect the communities where we live, work and serve. Our first-line athletes possess a wealth of product knowledge and consumer insights and are very loyal to the brand. Through the NIKE Athlete Experience (NAX) program, we have created accessible pathways for first-line athletes to broaden their skills and competencies, with added exposure to corporate job experiences. NAX leverages talent within our NIKE ecosystem for future corporate opportunities and career growth.\n\nOur retail store employees are given the opportunity to participate in several distinctive career development experiences:\n\n- **The Retail Experience Program (REP)** invests in the first-line athlete development while allowing the NIKE corporate teams they work with to gain a first-hand perspective and to benefit from their expertise. REP is a four-month recurring critical experience program within NIKE Tech and Digital disciplines that leverages the perspectives and expertise of first-line team members. After completing the REP experience, first-line athletes will return to the store to apply their learnings as they continue to build their career in retail or at NIKE World Headquarters (WHQ). In FY21, eight first-line athletes participated in the REP program, increasing to 56 athletes by the end of CY21.\n\n- **The Track Stretch Program** is a short-term, six-month experience across functions at WHQ that allows for critical development and exploration of different career paths and specializations. Through a joint collaboration, first-line athletes bring their strong marketplace, product and consumer knowledge into the corporate environment \u2013 taking away deep experiences from the team they are embedded with back to their store to build their career. In FY21, 25 Track Stretch roles were filled, increasing to 53 by the end of CY21.\n\u2022 **The Academy Program** is a one-year rotational program in the U.S. that is open to both past and present Head Coaches (retail store managers). Participants spend time working in functions centered on deepening one-on-one connections with consumers. During the experience there is a specific focus on the participants\u2019 development and exposure across all of NIKE Direct. At the end of the Academy Program experience, participants are placed in a full-time employee role within NIKE Direct, North America. In FY21, The Academy Program welcomed six Head Coaches into this program.\n\nWe have also updated our approach to provide greater visibility into Gateway roles, which are entry-level corporate opportunities that may be a good match for a retail store employee looking to make the transition into a corporate position. While NAX efforts are specifically for retail teammates, Gateway roles are accessible to all employees (retail, distribution centers and Air MI). The NAX and recruiting programs team works with other functions to identify roles and job families that are good Gateway roles, which it then makes visible to first-line employees. First-line teammates are provided a curated list of open corporate roles on the external NIKE careers site so they can easily find and apply for open roles that match their interests.\n\nThrough the Gateway programs effort, over 40 job positions were identified as a match for first-line teammates and added to the curated list of positions visible to first-line employees. This resulted in significant interest from retail, distribution center and Air MI employees.\n\nIn another new approach, store employees were offered career sessions by the retail initiatives to give them a comprehensive overview of various business functions, roles and responsibilities with Gateway roles. In FY21, this team hosted eight career sessions for the first-line retail community with over 630 athletes interested in pursuing NAX roles. Career session content was focused on building a strong resume and preparing first-line employees for a successful interview.\nQuantitative Target (Supply Chain)\n\n100% of strategic suppliers are increasing access to career opportunities and upward mobility for women employed in their facilities\n\nWe know gender diverse businesses perform better and positively impact workers. Unfortunately, there\u2019s a gender gap in almost every industry. In the footwear and apparel manufacturing industry, especially, women make up the vast majority of the workforce, but female representation decreases with the move into leadership ranks.\n\nTo meet our target, suppliers must implement strong policies and practices that incorporate gender equity. We measure this target by validating supplier performance on the Gender Equity Self-Diagnostic Tool (SDT), which measures 10 domains of gender equity. In order to reach mature gender equity, suppliers must achieve an overall SDT score of 71% and meet thresholds in each of the 10 domains.\n\nWhile none of the strategic suppliers reached a mature level of gender equity in FY21, the first year of our five-year target, more than 95% of suppliers met our FY21 milestone to deploy and validate this assessment, develop an action plan and implement actions. We are pleased by the progress strategic suppliers are making to meet this target by focusing on sustainable change.\n\nWe know women make up 79% of production operators, yet only hold 52% of junior management and 28% of top management positions. In addition, men advanced to initial leadership roles (team leaders) at 3.5 times the rate of women. With this as our baseline, we know we have to help create access to career opportunities and upward mobility for women in our supply chain by increasingly building gender equitable environments throughout the strategic suppliers\u2019 workforce.\n\nTo create lasting change, we believe gender equity needs to be approached holistically throughout organizational culture as well as business operations. We are focusing on ensuring equitable policies and practices are in place and set a strong foundation for supporting internal and external talent pipelines. This should help to increase representation of women in leadership and the number of gender equitable factories.\n\n28 This target baselined in FY21 as the tools to measure didn\u2019t exist when the target period started. While none of the strategic suppliers reached a mature level of gender equity in FY21, more than 95% of suppliers met our FY21 milestone to deploy and validate the Gender Equity Diagnostic Tool, develop an action plan and implement actions.\nSetting Our Target\n\nIn FY20, we built the SDT in partnership with the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW) to measure gender equity at an organizational level specific to the footwear and apparel manufacturing industry. We consulted with a subset of suppliers to gather their input to help make sure the tool was grounded in real-life experience. ICRW then worked with gender experts and critical stakeholders to bring these practices to life. The tool is now publicly available on the ICRW website and includes supporting materials to help suppliers and others build robust gender equity capabilities.\n\nTo lay the groundwork for this target, we focused on working with strategic suppliers to build an understanding of the importance of gender equity. We recognize that every organization is at a different point on their gender equity journey. In FY21, we launched the SDT to enable factories to assess their gender equitable policies and practices and identify areas for improvement. All strategic suppliers completed the assessment, resulting in an average score of 56%, with each strategic supplier acting to improve their policies and practices. As part of the process, suppliers also submitted data on female representation across different levels of leadership.\n\nOne of the ways we help suppliers advance gender equity is through our relationship with International Finance Corporation (IFC). IFC brings strong gender equity experience in the manufacturing space, which will help us identify the steps suppliers need to take to achieve our gender targets and allow us to provide direct services to suppliers, including individualized support as well as broader training and knowledge building. In FY22, we plan to launch a talent accelerator pilot in Vietnam, with IFC, to help build the pipeline of women advancing into leadership roles.\n\nAlong with IFC, this accelerator will be co-created with three of our strategic suppliers: Huali, TKG TAEKWANG and Ramatex. It will also be supported by the Mekong Development Research Institute. This accelerator is made up of high potential female employees nominated by their managers to learn both hard and soft skills, as well as create a network with other women to help them advance in their careers.\n\nInformed by the first year\u2019s SDT data, we are also launching a suite of bespoke trainings with external experts to help support strategic suppliers in their journey to become more gender equitable. Going forward, strategic suppliers will continue to complete the SDT annually and further integrate gender equitable policies and practices in the workplace. To assess performance, we will be looking at each supplier\u2019s score and whether they have met all foundational policies and practices.\nWe rely on relationships we have developed with organizations like ICRW and IFC to support suppliers on improving their performance. We are also implementing specific programming to enable factories newer to this work have the support they need to create sustainable and long-lasting change. Engaging workers in this process is critical to assessing overall gender equity in a factory, and we are currently working on a tool to solicit worker input on how supportive and gender equitable their experience is at work to help factories to act based on the feedback from their workforce.\n\nWe will also continue to utilize external organizations, such as ICRW and IFC, to support knowledge and capability building for suppliers in their journey toward increasing career opportunities and upward mobility for women in their facilities. We\u2019ve seen interest across the industry as seven other retail brands have piloted the SDT in their supply chains. We\u2019re thrilled to lay the groundwork to help advance gender equity goals within our supply chain and beyond.\nSpotlight\n\nRamatex\n\nRamatex, a vertically integrated textile and apparel manufacturer with over 40,000 workers across six countries, initiated a gender equity program called \u201cHer Program\u201d in 2019. Goals of Her Program include enabling work-life balance in a gender discrimination-free workplace, closing the leadership gap by increasing women in leadership, and highly skilled roles. This program has been expanded to include a full diversity and inclusion vision, where the unique talent of every individual is recognized to foster a positive and respectful workplace culture.\n\nRamatex used the SDT, along with internal feedback and external experts, to continue building its robust gender strategy. The SDT helped shed light on opportunities for improvement and helped Ramatex benchmark its work to date. After analyzing the results, it updated its long-term strategy to include improving access to safe and convenient transportation and provided sexual harassment prevention training.\n\nRamatex also launched a strategy to take proactive steps to recruit women in traditionally underrepresented roles by providing training and structured rotation programs to supplement internal recruitment. Since the pilot, Ramatex has seen improved ratios of women in skilled roles and hired its first female mechanic. Ramatex also realized that 97% of illiterate employees were women, prompting it to launch an employee literacy program to help train its workforce.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about winning medals and breaking records. It\u2019s about the journey and the work we do to put things in a better place for each other and for those coming up behind us.\u201d\n\nShelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, Track and field athlete\nMaintain 100% pay equity across all employee levels on an annual basis\n\nNIKE\u2019s total rewards are designed to be competitive and equitable, meet the diverse needs of our global teammates and reinforce our values. Our goal is to support a culture in which everyone feels included and empowered \u2013 and rewarded for the success we create as a team.\n\nA personalized and holistic rewards system is essential to attracting, inspiring and developing premier talent. We link pay to company performance, demonstrated and expected individual performance, contributions and impact, and key talent needs for NIKE\u2019s long-term growth.\n\nCompany performance plays a significant role in our short-term and long-term incentives; individual performance impacts rewards like base pay increases, milestone bonuses and promotions into roles with more scope and responsibility.\n\nCompetitive and Equitable Pay\n\nWe believe that competitive and equitable rewards go hand in hand while recognizing that pay can be managed and assessed in a number of ways. NIKE annually benchmarks with other leading global companies. We use this data to inform salary investments and adjust the pay ranges and rates that guide our decisions.\n\nDuring FY21, we raised our minimum hourly rate to $15 for retail store teammates in North America and increased our hourly rates for store employees across EMEA.29\n\n29 EMEA stands for Europe, Middle East and Africa.\nWe define pay equity as equal compensation for employees who undertake the same work at the same career level, location, experience and performance. Globally, we assess this across gender, and in the U.S., we also assess this across races/ethnicities. In 2016, we signed the White House Equal Pay Pledge and have developed an ongoing discipline of reviewing our pay practices annually to achieve and maintain pay equity for our approximately 75,000 teammates across all geographies, functions and business units.\n\nOur FY21 pay equity data shows that for every $1 earned by men, women globally earned $1, and for every $1 earned by white employees in the U.S., racial and ethnic minority employees earned $1.\n\nBuilding Trust Through Transparency\n\nWe are deeply committed to helping our employees understand our talent and pay practices. We believe that by providing transparency into our policies and practices, we build trust and accountability \u2013 both of which are integral to our culture. During FY21, we hosted a series of compensation sessions with internal groups, including WON, to provide greater awareness of our pay philosophy and to educate employees on how pay is evaluated during key moments throughout their careers. More than 1,600 employees from six countries participated in the compensation sessions, and 95% said they would recommend the session to others.\n\nQualitative Target (Employees)\n\nProvide competitive and equitable benefits for all employees\n\nWe believe benefits should be comprehensive and inclusive. We design our programs and practices to support NIKE\u2019s values and goals \u2013 considering each component individually as well as collectively. We invest in programs and practices that positively impact our employees\u2019 engagement and well-being.\n\nThese decisions are informed by NIKE\u2019s values, employee insights and feedback, and market data. We\u2019re always asking ourselves whether our programs and practices are having the desired impact and if they can be done better, easier or more efficiently.\nSupporting Our Whole Team\n\nA big part of supporting our teammates is listening to our employees to help inform what we offer. As part of our commitment to evolving our benefits, during FY21, we introduced several new and enhanced programs, including:\n\n\u2022 A subsidy to help our employees with young children with the ongoing cost of childcare. U.S. NIKE full-time employees, including employees within our retail, distribution center and Air MI locations, receive up to $1,800/year per family to offset the cost of childcare.\n\n\u2022 A financial coaching and education benefit for all U.S. NIKE employees to help them reach their goals. We engaged Ernst & Young LLP to offer free, unlimited access to professional financial coaching, as well as comprehensive online resources. In launching this benefit, we partnered closely with our NikeUNITED Networks to market the program and drive adoption.\n\n\u2022 Enhanced support to help teammates manage diabetes and lose weight through our engagement with Omada Health. Teammates and adult dependents living with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes or at risk for diabetes or heart disease can sign up for 1:1 coach support, tools and resources to help build healthy habits that last.\nWell-being & Mental Health\n\nWe continue to build on our belief that encouraging people to live a healthy, active lifestyle sits at the core of NIKE\u2019s culture.\n\nWell-being is not a new concept for NIKE. We have always been about maximizing human potential, and that applies to every one of our employees. When we prioritize the well-being of our employees \u2013 inspiring and enabling everyone to deliver their best work \u2013 we bring our best as a team.\n\nOur approach to well-being is holistic; we strive to support the whole person and incorporate wellness into all aspects of the employee experience. Our well-being strategy is focused on supporting employees\u2019 physical, emotional and financial well-being, with bespoke benefit initiatives and programs for each area. Our approach is rooted in a strong foundation of culture, leadership and purpose.\n\nEqually as important as the benefits and resources we offer employees, we believe it\u2019s critical to sustain a dialogue with them about the importance of mental health. It is our responsibility to maintain an inclusive, empathetic culture where every employee can be their most authentic self \u2013 and that means creating a safe place where we can be vulnerable, ask for help and admit when we\u2019re not okay.\n\nAs a community, we are deeply committed to helping break down the stigma associated with mental health and promoting habits that nourish mind and body in everyday life. When we think about the future, it\u2019s about intentionally building a culture of empathy where everyone can speak up and seek help. We partner closely with our NikeUNITED Network teams to understand the unique well-being challenges facing diverse communities and we provide resources to meet those needs. During FY21, we scheduled dedicated Employee Assistance Program (EAP) sessions with specialized counselors for several of our networks, including Black Employee, Ascend and Nike Military Veterans and more.\n\nOur most senior leaders have been open about their own mental health experience and routines, which has helped advance the dialogue among employees and teams.\nAnd so have our elite athletes. Because of our broader connection to the sport community, we have the unique privilege of working with some of the world\u2019s greatest athletes, many of whom are outspoken advocates of mental health support. We frequently invite athletes to join employee meetings so our teams around the world can hear first-hand about their personal journey, what inspires them and their experience with mental health.\n\nWe now offer all employees and their eligible dependents 20 free sessions with a therapist or counselor, per family member, per year.\n\nNIKE has made significant investments in benefits and initiatives to support the well-being and mental health of our employees and their families.\n\nAcross all three pillars of well-being \u2013 physical, emotional and financial \u2013 we continue to drive awareness and adoption of the tools, benefits and resources available to our teammates globally to really make an impact and support positive outcomes.\n\nWe will continue to identify and provide competitive and equitable benefits, tailored to the needs of our employees.\n\n**COVID-19 Support**\n\nWe continue to support our employees throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFor employees who continued to work from home due to COVID-19 health and safety measures, we provided them with select technology and ergonomic products through a partnership with Staples.\n\nWe expanded our COVID-19 Sick Leave Policy, which, in addition to existing paid time off benefits and legally mandated sick leave programs, provides up to two regularly scheduled work weeks of paid sick leave for those experiencing symptoms associated with COVID-19, or needing to take time off to care for their children due to school or childcare closure, and now includes mental and emotional well-being.\n\nWe also offered support to meet the unique needs of hard-hit areas. For example, in India, we offered early payout of our Performance Share Plan to support immediate liquidity needs, we enhanced telemedicine and EAP access, and expanded EAP and telemedicine support for family members of our employees who reside in India.\nSpotlight\n\nEmployee Health and Wellness\n\nCompany-wide Wellness Week\nTo offer our team meaningful rest and recovery amid the challenges of 2021, we closed our corporate offices every Friday in July and for a full week in August 2021. At the same time, we offered our first-line employees time off and other benefits to support their well-being.\n\nExpanded Mental Health Support\nWe significantly expanded our mental health resources to provide employees and their families with access to the care and tools they need, when and how they need them.\n\n\u2022 **Lyra Health**\n  We launched a new engagement with Lyra Health to provide mental health support for our employees in the U.S. The program offers timely access to a high-quality and diverse provider network. In addition to live therapy sessions and coaching sessions, Lyra Health also offers Guided Self-Care and a library of skill-building videos, meditations and activities to support ongoing mental well-being.\n\n\u2022 **EAP**\n  Employees outside of the U.S., where Lyra is not offered, can take advantage of our EEAP, which offers 20 free counseling sessions for all NIKE employees and their families (per issue, per person) each calendar year. We also offer onsite EAP support at our distribution centers.\n\n\u2022 **Headspace**\n  Through NIKE\u2019s continued relationship with Headspace, a leading meditation app, employees get free access to their full library of guided sessions and resources.\n\n\u2022 **Crisis Text Line**\n  NIKE supports Crisis Text Line, a nonprofit that provides free 24/7 crisis counseling via text messaging.\n\n\u2022 **Mindfulness and Meditation**\n  Alongside our fitness facilities and classes at our WHQ, we also offer mindfulness and meditation classes and spaces. We\u2019ve expanded our virtual offerings for employees throughout the pandemic, and plan to continue hosting virtual sessions for our teams around the world.\nQuantitative Target (Supply Chain)\n\n100% of strategic suppliers are building world-class, safe and healthy workplaces for the people making our products\n\nWe believe all people enjoy a fundamental right to the protection of life and health in the workplace. As our global business evolves, NIKE\u2019s goal is hygienic and healthy workplaces across our supply chain, which includes those operated by suppliers.\n\nFostering a Culture of Health & Safety\n\nWe believe effective leaders set the ethical tone for the company, hold themselves accountable for safety performance, drive safe behaviors at work and motivate their colleagues to do the same. Effective corporate management and oversight of Occupational Safety & Health (OS&H) implementation at the highest level of an organization enables more effective and sustained health and safety programs and performance.\n\nWe strive to go well beyond our foundational expectations and foster a culture of health and safety, underpinned by risk-appropriate organizational capabilities and individual competencies, where leaders and workers collaborate to create a world-class safe and healthy workplace. We do this by adopting, refining and standardizing industry-leading safety management systems and rules and by developing education, training and certification programs, and safety leadership capabilities.\n\nOver five years, we have defined a roadmap for achieving world-class safety performance, tested and piloted programs to create advanced health and safety management systems, and developed new tools to measure individual competencies and leadership capabilities that enable a mature health and safety culture in the workplace.\n\n30 Healthy and safe workplaces: Supplier must reach level 3 safety and health maturity on Culture of Safety Maturity Assessment (COSMA).\nTransformational Leadership\n\nWith the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH), we have successfully piloted an enterprise-level program with our largest supplier groups to help their company leaders evaluate and improve the effectiveness of existing safety governance structure and safety leadership. We plan to scale this program to all the supplier groups in the Supplier Sustainability Council (SSC) in FY23 and to the remaining in-scope supplier groups by 2025. The SSC is a group of 11 strategic suppliers committed to innovating and scaling sustainability programs to enhance their operational performance and mitigate risk while sharing out best practices in the hopes of elevating worker safety across the sector.\n\nThe SSC workstreams, including transformational leadership in health and safety, come to life through the factory group leaders. The program is aimed at enterprise-level leaders and governing bodies that are accountable for the strategic direction and oversight of health and safety of their organization. The program enables these leaders to gain confidence and better understand the key elements of effective corporate health and safety governance, their strategic strengths and areas where they can improve.\nWorkplace Safety Facilitators\n\nNIKE requires Tier 1 and strategic Tier 2 suppliers to adopt fire prevention and emergency action plans for the protection of workers during normal working operations and emergency situations. Our journey to improve fire safety knowledge and practices among workers and managers started with a collaboration between the Fair Labor Association (FLA) and IOSH. From this relationship, NIKE developed a workplace safety facilitator program to develop soft skills so workers, managers and leaders can deliver peer-to-peer safety conversations on fire safety as well as other safety topics.\n\nSince the program began in 2015, over 100 suppliers have implemented the Workplace Safety Facilitator (WSF) Program, training nearly 9,000 workers on fire safety and facilitating safety programs. The goal of the program is to enable peer-to-peer engagement by having one facilitator per 100 workers and creating a positive safety culture through group and confirmation biases.\n\nMachine Safety Certifications\n\nAs we modernize our mode of manufacturing, improving suppliers\u2019 capabilities to operate and maintain modern and automated machinery continues to be a top health and safety priority. Our Code Leadership Standards (CLS) require suppliers to implement machine management programs and track their performance against international machine safety standards. Through engagement with internationally recognized safety experts Pilz, we provided advanced machine safety training and certification. Since starting the program in FY18, 97 machine safety practitioners have completed the Pilz training course, with 56 people designated as Certified Machine Safety Experts.\n\nReport Performance\n\nWe have developed a Culture of Safety Maturity Assessment (CoSMA) self-assessment tool to assist suppliers in measuring their progress. The maturity roadmap, assessment methodology and CoSMA tool are made available to suppliers through a third-party online training platform, hosted by the Phylmar Academy.31\n\nWhile working closely with third-party consultants, 27% of our in-scope suppliers (30 suppliers) have self-assessed their culture and have met our threshold for building safe and healthy workplaces, with mature management systems now covering more than 295,000 workers in our\n\n31 https://phylmar.learningcart.com/content/Phylmar-Academy.aspx\nSpotlight\n\nLearning Communities\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has required suppliers to be more agile and resilient. Our largest manufacturing countries have facilitated more learning community events focused on health and safety than ever before. The pandemic has shown us the value of sharing best practices, thinking outside the box and exploring an opportunity to connect, learn and make tangible progress for workers and local communities. The learning community is a country-based forum led by a committee of strategic suppliers that meet regularly to address relevant and emerging issues, share best practices and solve common sustainability problems.\n\nFor example, during the rise of COVID-19 cases in Indonesia, many healthcare facilities were unable to treat patients due to the limited supply of oxygen. A supplier shared with the learning community that as best practice they had donated oxygen tanks to the local government to supplement the supply. In response, additional suppliers donated oxygen tanks to their community hospitals.\n\nsupply chain. The data is validated by worker voice, through a safety perception survey, though COVID-19 headwinds and travel restrictions have limited our ability to validate progress onsite. We are exploring alternative data collection methods, including virtual safety perceptions surveys. In FY21, we completed an effectiveness study on the online training and updated it to include more detailed assessment criteria and case studies on how to use the tool. At the end of FY21, 232 factory personnel, third-party consultants and NIKE internal staff had completed the online training and were able to self-evaluate their health and safety culture maturity using standard methodology and metrics.\n\nIn FY21, we began discussion with the International Labour Organization (ILO)\u2019s Vision Zero Fund (VZF), seeking a deeper understanding of its vision, mission and strategy, which focuses on eliminating severe or fatal work-related accidents, injuries and diseases in global supply chains. In March 2021, NIKE participated in the VZF inaugural high-level forum, and we look to expand our relationship and collaboration with VZF, which we feel will help accelerate our compliance strategy and mitigate systemic high-risk issues with suppliers.\n\nMore Data\n\nOH&S Data for NIKE Employees and Tier 1 Focus Footwear Factories\nFocus Area\n\nINCLUSIVE CULTURE & ENGAGEMENT\n\nACG Cinder Cone Jacket\n\nFemale-only Yoga Studio in Kabul\nQuantitative Target (Employees)\n\nTop quartile in benchmarked companies for both engagement and inclusion\n\nAt NIKE, we want to create and support the culture we need to unleash our full potential to perform at our best. And thus, we are continuously building a culture where employees feel they belong, can be themselves and see themselves as part of NIKE\u2019s future.\n\nTwo key metrics that we use to evaluate this are the Engagement Index and the newly added Inclusion Index \u2013 measured on our annual Employee Engagement Survey. Higher scores for engagement, diversity and inclusion have been demonstrated to correlate with lower turnover and higher productivity. Like many companies, we saw a small decrease in our engagement rankings due to the macro impact of the global pandemic and social and racial justice events in the U.S. Internally, we also faced significant change as a result of an enterprise reorganization and our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy.\n\nTo better understand how we can support our employees through continuous change, we began a series of sensing and listening sessions \u2013 made up of focused conversations on the importance of well-being and mental health, and invested in resources such as hiring a director of well-being, and expanding associated benefits to include Lyra Health, Calm and Headspace. We will continue to invest in this top priority for the company.\n\nFY21 was the first year we incorporated the Inclusion Index, as we looked to understand employee sentiment around our culture of belonging. Through our employee pulsing and sensing strategy, we will continue to monitor employee sentiments regarding inclusion as we continue to evolve our approach to meet our employees\u2019 changing needs.\n\nIn addition to monitoring our progress over time, it\u2019s important to note that NIKE compares its results to other companies in our research vendor\u2019s database. To be an industry leader in employee experience, NIKE scores should be among the best-performing companies, and our survey results should reflect this.\n\n32 Consumer Direct Acceleration is NIKE\u2019s strategy to increase investments in digital technology and simplify consumer construct.\nTo increase employee engagement in FY21, we:\n\n- Committed to communicating more often about engagement (and what we\u2019re doing about it).\n- Developed an employee voice program to gather feedback and drive actions more frequently.\n- Launched The Source, NIKE\u2019s digital learning platform, to increase employee development through technology-enabled, on-demand curated learning within critical capability areas.\n- Launched One United Play Learning, a company-wide initiative to driving change based on survey results. One United Play Learning targets two key pillars: fueling our strategy and elevating the skills of our employees. It is a curated collection of courses, focusing on consumer centricity, digital acumen, and data and analytics.\n\nTo improve and promote diversity and inclusion, we:\n\n- Increased representation at all levels of the organization (specifically leadership).\n- Created diversity and inclusion learning and development programming.\n- Increased communication, visibility and awareness of NIKE\u2019s purpose.\n- Initiated a diversity and inclusion mentorship program for corporate employees within the U.S.\n- Hired a diversity, equity and inclusion director in EMEA and APLA to develop and execute a location-specific strategy centered on representation, education, development and community.\n\n\u201cA mission of mine is to make the spaces that I\u2019m a part of more inclusive. I believe in equality and equity when it comes to sport, when it comes to fitness, when it comes to life. And I want to work with people who also believe and will join me at the forefront of this work.\u201d\n\nIbtihaj Muhammad, Fencer\nQualitative Target (Employees)\n\nContinue to focus on improving access to athletes* of all abilities for our brand, our experiences, our product, our facilities and our company\n\nAt NIKE, our commitment to accessibility and disability inclusion is key to meeting our 2025 diversity goals and will drive innovation in products and services that meet the needs of athletes* in the modern world.\n\nIn FY21, NIKE developed an accessibility strategy to cultivate and advocate for an equitable playing field for athletes with disabilities \u2013 which accounts for one in five people in the world today.\n\nTo support our commitments, NIKE set the following goals:\n\n\u2022 Increase representation of people with disabilities at NIKE with more inclusive and intentional hiring practices.\n\n\u2022 Elevate employee experience through a more flexible, accessible and equitable working environment for employees with disabilities.\n\n\u2022 Increase awareness \u2013 while destigmatizing the word \u201cdisability\u201d by expanding and promoting learning and development opportunities.\n\n\u2022 Foster a culture of belonging and inclusion for athletes with disabilities.\n\n\u2022 Pursue bold and innovative ideas that align with NIKE\u2019s strategic goals to establish us as an industry leader in disability inclusion.\n\nThe NikeUNITED Ability* Network expanded to EMEA to support a culture of belonging and inclusion with athletes who are disabled and create awareness and educate employees.\n\nOne of the ways NIKE looked to gauge progress was through external accessibility indices. For example, NIKE scored 90/100 points on Disability Equality Index with Disability:IN. To announce the score and drive awareness, we hosted Jill Houghton, President and CEO of Disability:IN, and held a fireside chat with Tom Clark, Ability* Network Executive Sponsor and President of Innovation. NIKE teammates also participated in several disability inclusion and accessibility panels and the Ability* Network launched its \u201cI Speak\u201d campaign.\nQuantitative Target (Supply Chain)\n\n100% of strategic suppliers are measuring and improving the engagement of the people making our products\n\nWhile most of suppliers have started to measure worker voice in their facilities, none have advanced to the next phase that involves responding to and improving worker experience. We look forward to reporting on progress next year as suppliers begin to enter this next phase.\n\nWe want to empower suppliers to engage with and value their workers. We know that higher engagement leads to a more efficient, agile and committed workforce, which results in beneficial outcomes for both workers and the organization. Not only are engaged workers more likely to feel physically and mentally secure, they are also more likely to actively and positively contribute to their work. Now more than ever, engaging and valuing the people who make our products is critical.\n\nOur target focuses first on measuring worker experience through the Engagement and Wellbeing (EWB) Survey, then supporting suppliers in developing and embedding the capabilities needed to respond and improve these experiences. Since 2017, we have been scaling the deployment of the EWB Survey to reach more suppliers.\n\nThe two phases of our target include measuring engagement, and then building the systems and capabilities to improve engagement.\n\n33 Criteria for measuring and improving engagement must be met for the factory to count toward the target KPI of measuring and improving. While most suppliers have started to measure worker voice in their facilities, none have advanced to the next phase, which involves responding to and improving worker experience. The target baselined in FY21 and wasn\u2019t measured in FY20.\nHowever, measuring worker voice is just the start. Recognizing that no two suppliers are the same or at the same point in their journey, we work to meet them where they are and actively support building capabilities that increase engagement. This approach is foundational to a future where we continue to grow with those suppliers that value and engage their workers.\n\nWe also seek to drive supplier-led measurement of worker voice. NIKE enables a standardized approach through our guidelines on best practices in implementing worker voice tools, a process we\u2019ve developed for survey vendors, and an action planning guide, driving supplier ownership and accountability. We have a robust network of survey vendors that leverage mobile and tablet technology to deploy these surveys digitally, which enables rapid feedback and more potential to integrate into their worker\u2013management communication systems. At the end of FY21, 23 suppliers, representing 83,960 workers, have purchased ongoing subscriptions directly with these companies, and are using them for many features, including the deployment of our EWB Survey as well as deploying digital grievance mechanisms.\n\nWe have a suite of tools and supports such as the EWB Action Planning Guide, which helps suppliers develop and implement a process for converting these insights from workers into action and embedding these practices into their HRM systems.\n\nIn FY21, COVID-19 continued to present unprecedented circumstances for suppliers and their workforce. Despite this significant resourcing impact, suppliers recognized a need to understand the engagement and well-being of their employees more than ever. We observed suppliers investing in ways of engaging workers safely during COVID-19. This can be observed through a significant increase in remote deployments of our EWB Survey using smartphones. For example, in FY21, 85% (65 out of 74) of the deployments were remote (2019: 52% remote).\n\nThe EWB Survey was conducted in 71 strategic supplier locations in FY21, exceeding our annual goal of 59 suppliers. Since May 2017, the EWB Survey has been deployed at 85 unique factories, representing more than 490,000 workers.\n\nNot only will we look to build the right tools and processes to support an inclusive culture and engagement in our supply chain, but we will continue to tap into survey insights to help prioritize and develop a more data-driven approach. We seek to identify key trends that can be shared with suppliers, building knowledge across our supply chain and highlighting opportunities to further build capabilities, together, as we progress toward 2025.\nWorker Voice\n\nWe have embedded worker voice across our programs to make sure workers\u2019 experiences guide our actions and understanding. We have also found that enabling supplier ownership as a guiding principle to our work is key to help making long-term positive change for workers. By having suppliers build their capabilities across human resources and health and safety, we see more long-term, positive impacts on workers. Over the past decade, these two values have guided our approach to worker voice, enabling suppliers to take steps to help ensure workers are protected, valued, safe and have safe, anonymized ways to provide feedback to management and third parties through digital grievance channels.\n\nAnonymous Worker Feedback\n\nSuppliers can provide anonymized, aggregated data to NIKE, giving suppliers ownership of their data (and related actions) while enabling greater trust between the supplier and NIKE. To date, 100% of suppliers have shared their data with NIKE, which has enabled us to analyze it in depth to understand key areas of strength and opportunity across our supply chain and identify areas where further support is needed. For example, analysis in 2019 on our EWB Survey data set elevated our focus on understanding the root causes of concerns on sexual harassment as well as worker perceptions of safety in the factory. In FY21, Shift Project, a well-respected human rights organization, highlighted NIKE\u2019s EWB program as a best practice in their study outlining the opportunities of technology-enabled worker voice tools.\n\nRoot Cause Analysis\n\nThrough the EWB Survey data analysis, we identified a cluster of suppliers in Vietnam and Indonesia that reported higher rates from workers on concerns around sexual harassment. We worked with these suppliers to engage directly with the ICRW to do a deep dive analysis on the root causes and mitigations of sexual harassment in an extensive, year-long process. The aim was to create an environment where workers are treated fairly by establishing more transparency and accountability.\n\nIn addition, ICRW helped create more awareness of the relationship between gender power imbalances and how elevating more women into leadership roles can help address this problem. It focused on helping suppliers assess the effective implementation of policies by engaging deeply with workers and getting a sense of how well workers\nunderstand the topic and related policies and processes. This worker-centric approach identified actionable ways suppliers could encourage reporting on harassment, improve grievance reporting mechanisms and strengthen their trainings.\n\nFinally, suppliers worked with ICRW to understand how to increase trust in their grievance channels by promoting these channels to workers, encouraging their use and confidentiality, and ensuring feedback is reported to employees so they know actions are taking place.\n\n**Safety Perception Surveys**\nAs suppliers strive to move beyond meeting NIKE\u2019s foundational expectations and foster a culture of health and safety, we will deploy a safety perception survey to validate leadership and worker engagement in safety programs and processes, and training and development opportunities.\n\n**More Information**\n*See the Health & Safety section of this report*\nSpotlight\n\nSupplier Compensation\n\nWe believe that a skilled, valued and engaged workforce is key for growth and sustainability. NIKE is working with suppliers around the world as they seek to develop strategic compensation capabilities (such as competitive wage and benefits systems that progressively meet their employees\u2019 basic needs, including some discretionary income), because every employee has the right to a standard of living that adequately supports them and their families. We define our standards in our Code of Conduct (the Code) and Code Leadership Standards (CLS), which align to the FLA\u2019s standards on fair compensation.\n\nOur Approach\n\nIn 2015, we started engaging our strategic suppliers to develop new compensation and benefit models. We created a hands-on pilot with a supplier in Thailand, synthesized our learnings in collaboration with the University of California at Berkeley\u2019s Institute for Research on Labor and Employment, and began facilitating shared learnings across our strategic suppliers. Since then, we\u2019ve transitioned from testing new ideas to exploring opportunities for scale. We now create forums to help facilitate the sharing of best practices across strategic suppliers and to understand their common challenges in enabling competitive pay. In doing so, we help suppliers assess the different capabilities needed to enable mature compensation approaches as part of their overall strategic HRM systems. Best practices include having integrated IT systems, benchmarking with the local labor market, aligning incentives and incorporating worker voice.\n\nVisibility Is Key\n\nEnhancing our visibility into worker take-home pay and supplier compensation structures through our relationship with the FLA has strengthened this work even further. By the end of FY20, 13 of suppliers\u2019 facilities in six different countries (China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Honduras and El Salvador) had completed the FLA\u2019s wage data collection tool, which allows suppliers to evaluate their wage data relative to external local living wage benchmarks where available, such as legal minimum wage, national poverty lines and estimates of living wages.\n\nTo supplement the FLA data, we\u2019ve worked with external organizations to secure data on local apparel and footwear manufacturing wages in key countries. This research helps inform our understanding of wages in our supply chain, in general, and how and where to focus our support for suppliers in developing their compensation systems.\nWe have now scaled our wage data collection to 103 strategic suppliers that manufacture 80% of NIKE\u2019s product by volume and employ over 700,000 workers. For each of these suppliers, we have compared their wage data to external benchmarks in order to assess progress toward fair wage as defined in our CLS. We have found these suppliers have an average gross pay of 1.9 times the minimum wage (excluding overtime) across 13 countries. On average, these suppliers pay 1.7 times the applicable national poverty line (where available). In addition we found that 53% pay above applicable living wage benchmark(s) where available.\n\nTo supplement the current benchmarks, we also work with external organizations to secure data on local manufacturing wages in the apparel and footwear industry, along with other industries in key countries. This research helps inform our understanding of wage competitiveness in our supply chain, in general, and how and where to focus our support for suppliers in developing their compensation systems.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nBeyond analyzing wage data, we will continue to work with factories to advance their human resource capabilities to attract, protect, retain and develop talent. Strategic and fair compensation is a key priority that we will continue to articulate to suppliers as part of our broader work on HRM, and in doing so, we emphasize two important elements \u2013 supporting workers\u2019 livelihoods and remaining competitive employers of choice in local labor markets.\n\nAs we make progress on these approaches, we also encourage suppliers to provide anonymous feedback on our business practices through Better Buying\u2019s annual Purchasing Practices Index survey. We use this survey to hold our business teams accountable in strengthening and improving responsible business practices in our supply chain. We will also continue to strengthen our relationships with civil society organizations in key regions, and particularly as it relates to the important connection between freedom of association and wages.\n\n34 Represents 39 factories. National poverty line available in: Vietnam, El Salvador, Mexico, Thailand and Turkey based on FLA compiled poverty lines benchmarks.\n35 Represents 51 out of 97 suppliers where living wage benchmarks are available. Pay is average net pay, excluding overtime. We used the following benchmarks where available, and a composite where multiple benchmarks are available: Global Living Wage Coalition, Asia Floor Wage; Wage Indicator Foundation, Cost of Living Estimate (Turkey), Living Wage Estimate EIL-SV (El Salvador).\nAt NIKE, we are implementing a holistic diversity and inclusion curriculum to further a culture that fosters trust, accountability and allyship.\n\nIn partnership with the University of Southern California, we launched a robust diversity and inclusion curriculum covering topics such as anti-racism, racial inequity and micro-aggressions. To date, over 350 leaders from our NikeUNITED and ConverseUNITED Networks have participated in a pilot program \u2013 with it being rolled out to the entire organization in late 2022.\n\nIn addition, our Vice President Leadership Team are now required to complete content to build awareness and grow deeper knowledge on how to best mitigate unconscious bias in the workplace. In FY21, we provided the Vice President Leadership Team and Human Resources business partners with intensive training on effective and compliant use of diversity and inclusion data to advance representation. Additionally, they participated in Inclusive Leadership training, which was developed in collaboration with Northwestern University. Those on the credential track received their certificate in FY22. The content was designed in the U.S. and specifically addressed race and social justice issues prominent to this geography.\nQuantitative Target (Employees)\n\n2x investments focused on professional development for racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S. and women globally\n\nAt NIKE, we strive to promote equity, opportunity, belonging and an inclusive culture. This work does not, however, replace our talent management processes and professional development opportunities that support growth for all teammates in their careers.\n\nWe continue to invest in our talent through offering professional development opportunities hosted by various external organizations, including:\n\n- McKinsey & Company Executive Leadership Program\n- The Executive Leadership Council (ELC)\n- Hispanic Association for Corporate Responsibility (HACR)\n- Leadership Education for Asian Pacifics (LEAP)\n- Out Leadership\n- Advancing Women Executives (AWE)\n- Stanford Women\u2019s Leadership Development Program\n- Stanford LGBTQIA+ Executive Leadership Program\n- Center for Creative Leadership (CCL)\nAt NIKE, we feel that our commitment to business diversity and inclusion (BD&I) is the right thing to do as it supports our ability to deliver strategic business results. During FY21, NIKE defined an enterprise-wide procurement strategy, drove awareness and gained support from executive leadership.\n\nOur strategy is based on three critical pillars:\n\n- **Drive Accessibility and Development** \u2013 expand visibility to diverse suppliers and help shape or build supplier capabilities\n- **Fuel Demand** \u2013 engage and educate our leaders and buyers across NIKE to stoke demand and embed BD&I into their objectives\n- **Establish Internal Structure** \u2013 build the team and design the processes, tools and metrics required to deliver within Procurement\n\nTo increase spend on diverse suppliers, NIKE:\n\n- Established relationships with nine supplier diversity councils globally to increase connection with certified diverse suppliers and collaborated with 10 companies to benchmark, leverage best practices and inform targets.\n- Activated the BD&I Portal by SupplierGATEWAY, a diverse supplier registration portal, in FY21 to establish a direct connection between suppliers and buyers (8.5% of total suppliers are currently diverse) and identified four areas with the most diverse supplier growth potential (Real Estate, Technology, Brand Marketing, Professional Services).\n\u2022 Launched The Academy in the U.S. to amplify the BD&I strategy and accelerate the capabilities of diverse suppliers so that they grow in their relationship with NIKE, with the aim of expanding globally. Once graduated, our diverse suppliers will join a network of Academy alumni that will empower them to pursue additional business growth opportunities.\n\n\u2022 Began incorporating BD&I contract clauses in service agreements with suppliers in both EMEA and Converse.\n\nThis commitment to supplier diversity was demonstrated across the organization in FY21, including, for example:\n\n\u2022 NIKE actively engaged in the search for a presentation skills training supplier for our Global Procurement team as we sought to be intentional in our sourcing. Through the SupplierGATEWAY, we identified Perspectivity, a minority-owned training and public speaking business that aligned well with our culture given its deep knowledge and experience working with other Fortune 50 companies. Perspectivity\u2019s program received outstanding survey reviews, with most employees expressing that they will be able to immediately apply the learnings directly.\n\n\u2022 NIKE often works with general contractors who engage subcontractors when building out new NIKE Direct stores. By expanding its work with diverse suppliers both on the general contractor and subcontractor level, NIKE can support more minority-owned suppliers. This approach was piloted with the NIKE by Williamsburg store build-out, where 40% of contractors NIKE hired were minority-owned businesses \u2013 demonstrating its potential.\n\n\u2022 When NIKE repurchases shares, it looks to licensed institutions for assistance with the repurchases. The program allows these institutions to engage with NIKE in other capital market activities. NIKE engaged a smaller diverse supplier in its August 2021 repurchase rotation and this allowed NIKE to begin to build a long-term sustainable relationship with a diverse organization in the capital market arena.\n\nOur strategy to expand and grow the diverse supplier base resulted in a movement of $197 million of NIKE\u2019s supplier spend in FY21 to diverse suppliers.\nAdditional Priority Areas (Employees)\n\nOCCUPATIONAL HEALTH & SAFETY\n\nExcess material being recycled from Air Manufacturing\nOur approach to Occupational Health & Safety (OH&S) rests on several foundational pillars that we use to monitor our facilities\u2019 adherence to our foundational expectations:\n\n- NIKE\u2019s Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) Policy\n- NIKE\u2019s Code of Conduct\n- NIKE Code Leadership Standards\n- Local laws wherever we or suppliers operate\n\nCertain NIKE owned and operated facilities undergo external audits and internal assessments. When those processes reveal gaps in OH&S standard implementation, we implement management plans and develop tools to address and correct those problems.\n\nNIKE Owned and Operated Facilities\n\nThe continued response and focus on mitigating the spread of COVID-19 remained a priority in FY21 with regards to the health and safety of our employees across all functions and geographies. We continued to follow and communicate guidance provided by the CDC as well as the advice of health experts to adjust the ever-evolving COVID-19 trends and risks. We put in place robust health and safety measures that included:\n\n- Developing a comprehensive risk assessment, infection control plans and employee education campaigns\n- Staffing a team of fully dedicated contact tracers\n- Applying rigorous sanitation and cleaning protocols\n- Sourcing and distributing over 1 million NIKE face coverings to teammates worldwide\n- Facilitating access to COVID-19 testing\n- Offering onsite vaccination clinics in collaboration with local public health agencies\nBeyond the pandemic response and in the pursuit of continuous improvement, we also expanded our EHS Management system to develop enhanced EHS Audit tools that were piloted across various retail, distribution center and Air MI operations. In partnership with NIKE\u2019s Responsible Sourcing and Manufacturing teams, we also piloted the industry-leading Social Labor Convergence Program\u2019s (SLCP) EHS self-assessment module and verification at select global logistics operations. We launched a centralized global chemical management system to provide our employees with electronic access to Safety Data Sheets, and to recognize, evaluate and address occupational health and safety risks associated with chemicals and materials.\n\nWe installed occupational health clinics, staffed with medical professionals and injury prevention specialists, to not only respond to onsite injuries incidents but also to provide education and guidance on preventative health measures, with a focus on reducing ergonomic-related injuries associated with our most common injury type related to repetitive strains and sprains. Despite the global pandemic, NIKE maintained its focus on new facility construction and existing renovation efforts across the globe while maintaining world-class low injury rates.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nWith a focus and emphasis on Life Safety programs and management systems, NIKE will establish cross-functional and global processes to elevate our standards and playbooks associated with emergency action, fire safety, medical response and first aid and occupational health management. Continued socialization and launch of our global office safety program, as well as our global building and construction safety program, will continue across our key cities. As the pandemic continues, we will maintain our goal that all employees receive and maintain their vaccination status as a key priority.\n\nMore Data\n\nOH&S Data for NIKE Employees and Tier 1 Focus Footwear Factories\nIN BUSINESS AND SPORT\n\nWE VALUE FAIR PLAY\nAt NIKE, we believe a world-class supply chain is grounded in standards that demonstrate respect for the environment, the people who make and move our product, and the principles of a healthy and safe workplace.\n\nWe work directly with suppliers on improving their manufacturing conditions and minimizing negative impact to workers, local communities and the environment.\n\nWe launched our Code of Conduct for suppliers in 1992, including a commitment to provide suppliers with expertise and resources to achieve compliance. We continue to evolve and expand our standards and programs to drive improved outcomes for workers in our supply chain and communities where suppliers operate and enhanced value for NIKE and suppliers.\n\nIn FY21, we embarked on the most aggressive expansion of our foundation expectations program to date. Our Code of Conduct was updated with new expectations that expanded the scope into new areas of our supply chain while significantly accelerating the timeline for all in-scope facilities to meet our foundational expectations by 2025.\nFocus Area\n\nFOUNDATIONAL EXPECTATIONS\n\nNIKE One Central \u2013 Berlin, Germany\n\nNIKE European Logistics Center \u2013 Laakdal, Belgium\nQuantitative Target\n\n100% of facilities in our extended supply chain meet NIKE\u2019s foundational labor, health, safety and environmental standards, demonstrating respect for the rights of their workers and communities where they operate.\n\nEvolving Our Program\n\nIn FY21, we continued to evolve, strengthen and expand our foundational expectations with suppliers to better align with our 2025 targets. Some key areas strengthened include:\n\n- New expectations for suppliers to develop and share their own internal Code of Conduct.\n- Strengthened expectations on identifying and addressing forced labor, child labor and freedom of association.\n- Added Construction Safety and Powered Industrial Trucks Code Leadership Standards.\n- Added Greenhouse Gas Emission Code Leadership Standards to support commitments made by NIKE in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and in support of NIKE\u2019s carbon reduction targets. We also updated our Air Emissions Code Leadership Standards to prepare for the adoption of the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC) Air Emissions Guidelines.\n\nWe continue to rate suppliers on our color-coded rating scale. Our Bronze, Silver and Gold ratings remain the same. A Bronze rating indicates foundational compliance with NIKE\u2019s Code and CLS. Silver signals that a facility is enhancing its sustainability capabilities as a business driver within our industry. Gold indicates NIKE would consider a facility to be world class in sustainability in any industry.\n\nPreviously, our below-compliance ratings were coded Yellow or Red. We have removed the Yellow rating and added a zero-tolerance rating, to differentiate compliance findings more clearly.\nTransitioning to Common Industry Assessments\n\nNIKE believes an industry approach will continue to be a critical lever to drive positive impact. In support of this vision, we have continued to actively engage in industry solutions to evaluate facility performance through the SLCP, the Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC) and ZDHC. This work enables consistent industry measurements of facility performance and reduces resources required to monitor performance so they may be redirected to improving conditions for workers and the environment.\n\nIn FY20, we worked with SAC and SLCP to build common industry assessments on environment, labor, and health and safety, which reduce duplication and audit fatigue for suppliers working with multiple brands. In FY21, we accelerated our transition to using common industry assessments.\nDeveloping Our Expanded Scope\n\nIn FY21, we announced the expansion of our compliance program to in-scope material suppliers supplying approximately 90% of our footwear uppers and apparel materials and focus distribution centers representing at least 80% of volume, as well as to our NIKE owned or operated manufacturing facilities (Air MI). We began assessing sites in the expanded scope in FY21 and expect to complete assessing the majority of our remaining sites in FY22.\n\nIncreasing Scope: Foundational Target\n\n| 2015 | 2020 | 2025 |\n|------|------|------|\n| **Make** | | |\n| Corporate Services | Corporate Services | Corporate Services |\n| Raw materials | Raw materials | Raw materials |\n| Materials manufacturing and finishing | Materials manufacturing and finishing | Materials manufacturing and finishing |\n| Finished goods manufacturing | Finished goods manufacturing | Finished goods manufacturing |\n| **Move** | | |\n| Logistics | Logistics | Logistics |\n| **Sell** | | |\n| Retail | Retail | Retail |\n| Consumers | Consumers | Consumers |\n| End of Life | End of Life | End of Life |\n\nRemediation Program\n\nAt NIKE, we seek to work with suppliers that share our commitment to workers, the environment and the communities they operate in. However, we also recognize that in some cases, committed suppliers struggle to fully comply with our foundational expectations. When a non-compliance is identified, a systematic approach is key to sustainable remediation. To better support suppliers in their efforts to improve working conditions, we work with third-party service providers to design programs that provide the tools needed to enable suppliers to meet and importantly, to sustain, compliance with our foundational expectations.\nExperience has taught us that without a systemic approach to remediation of issues, improvements are often temporary, and these issues resurface in future years. To address this, we have designed a program that provides third-party support for suppliers to develop holistic remediation plans that seek to fully address the root causes driving the non-compliance and validates that a thorough approach was taken to implement systems needed to prevent future non-compliance through an onsite verification visit. This approach is being piloted with six Tier 1 suppliers and will scale in FY22.\n\nAs we extend monitoring against our foundational expectations deeper into our supply chain with materials suppliers, we also recognize that additional support may be needed to build capabilities to own and manage compliance with our foundational expectations. We have engaged with a third-party service company to create training content on some of the most common areas of non-compliance as well as training content to support suppliers in identifying the right people within their organization to own and drive improvements of systems to support foundational performance. The program also offers in-depth, one-on-one engagement with each supplier to build comprehensive project plans designed to level up systems needed to achieve and maintain compliance with our foundational expectations. This program was piloted with 10 suppliers in FY21 and will scale to in-scope Tier 2 suppliers in FY22.\n\nCapacity Building for Compliance and Remediation\n\nWe have built targeted approaches to enable suppliers, focus distribution centers and NIKE owned and operated manufacturing facilities (Air MI) to meet our foundational expectations, as well as to transition to industry assessments, and we have designed and deployed capacity building programs.\n\nFinished Goods Suppliers and In-Scope Materials Suppliers\n\nAs we evolve supplier expectations, we have also enhanced supplier access to training and capability building to improve management systems, adopt technical improvements in environmental, labor, health and safety standards, and to sustain those improvements.\n\nWe are partnering with Better Work, a joint program of the ILO and IFC, which provides assessment and remediation programs to finished goods suppliers located in countries with active Better Work programs. In FY21, 33 factories were assessed using Better Work Factory Services to assess foundational performance.\nFocus Distribution Centers\nTo support the inclusion of focus distribution centers (DCs) in our foundational expectation target for the first time, we updated our standards to meet the needs of our DCs, increased supplier awareness of standards through training and engagement, assessed DCs against standards using industry tools and launched a remediation management program to support DCs in addressing issues surfaced through this process. Looking ahead, we are focused on scaling assessment tools to additional DCs and evolving remediation approaches.\n\nNIKE Owned or Operated Manufacturing Facilities (Air MI)\nWe continued to invest in comprehensive safety program upgrades and management systems, formalizing a safety steering committee and governance, investing in upgraded machine-specific lock-out and tag-out procedures, and formally separating pedestrians from mobile equipment in our facilities. We also initiated a comprehensive internal audit of all machine safety in manufacturing equipment.\n\nSpotlight\nEmployment of Foreign Migrant Workers\nAt NIKE, we have a responsibility to conduct our business ethically. Hiring and employing foreign migrant workers carries heightened risks of forced labor due to the complex network of actors throughout the recruitment and employment process. Understanding this complexity, NIKE has adopted a holistic approach to address issues to which foreign migrant workers are particularly vulnerable. This includes strengthening our standards and expectations, identifying risks, working with global and local cross-industry, multi-stakeholder organizations and proactively advocating for our work at global, regional and local levels.\n\nWe believe the adoption of the Employer Pays Principle, which prohibits workers from paying fees for their employment, is critical in helping eliminate forced labor risks in our supply chain, the industry and beyond. As a member of the Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment (LGRR), an initiative of the Institute for Human Rights and Business, NIKE shares the organization\u2019s aim to drive positive change in the international recruitment industry, starting with advocacy to governments and organizations for the adoption of the Employer Pays Principle. In March 2021, we updated our Code and CLS to drive clarity on expectations for our facilities about the types of fees that are prohibited.\nNIKE recognizes the value in providing robust resources for suppliers to identify risks in their operations and build capabilities to recruit workers more responsibly. Building on the regional trainings offered to suppliers since FY19, in FY21, NIKE worked with the Responsible Labor Initiative (RLI) to deliver the Responsible Recruitment Due Diligence Toolkit training to all strategic materials suppliers in Taiwan. This training equips suppliers with knowledge and practical tools to conduct responsible recruitment due diligence, and includes post-training coaching and consultation to identify gaps in recruitment systems, develop sustainable improvements plans and prioritize them for implementation.\n\nIn FY19, NIKE launched Verite\u2019s CUMULUS Forced Labor Screen\u2122 in Malaysia, a due diligence tool to help identify risks related to the recruitment of foreign migrant workers by suppliers. Since then, we have expanded use of the tool to all remaining Tier 1 and strategic Tier 2 suppliers hiring foreign workers in countries and regions including Thailand, Taiwan, Japan, Jordan, Egypt, Korea, Mexico, Argentina and Brazil. This process helps us identify risks and opportunities to further support suppliers and their recruiting agents in implementing best practices and serves as an ongoing tool to monitor the effectiveness of programs in addressing and minimizing risks related to forced labor.\n\nNIKE believes addressing critical human rights risks, such as forced labor, often requires collective action. We have long worked with multi-stakeholder and external organizations such as the FLA and the ILO\u2019s Better Work Program to address labor risks in our supply chain. Through our engagement with these and other organizations, we work to address a wide range of human rights risks, including those related to forced labor.\n\nFor example, in FY21, we collaborated with ILO Better Work in Jordan to work toward the elimination of pregnancy testing in foreign migrant workers\u2019 home countries and enhancing workers\u2019 awareness on prohibition of pregnancy testing and any form of verbal abuse. In addition, we also supported Better Work in its delivery of several trainings to the workers of suppliers, in order to enhance a higher degree of psychological well-being, mental health and improved workplace communication.\n\nIn FY21, NIKE also began a Strategic Partnership Program with Issara Institute in Thailand. All NIKE Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers operating in Thailand that employ foreign migrant workers will have access to the program enabling onsite support, expert consultation and ongoing engagement with workers and supplier management. At the core of the program is worker voice, where both foreign and local workers can provide feedback or concerns through multiple channels managed by Issara. This work focuses on building trust with workers to self-identify gaps and empowers suppliers to strengthen human resources systems to address issues, with a focus on issues impacting foreign workers.\nRemaining Grounded in Best Practices\n\nAs we evolve our program, we maintain best practices that are key to driving meaningful impact for our foundational expectations.\n\nBusiness Integration\n\nOur foundational expectations are embedded in our core business practices and are codified in our Code and CLS. We focus on building long-term relationships with suppliers that share our values, which supports better experiences for workers and improved environmental practices.\n\nSupplier Lifecycle\n\nWe then integrate compliance with our Code and CLS throughout the supplier lifecycle and supplier management led by our sourcing teams.\n\n\u2022 Onboarding: Potential new suppliers are subject to a New Source Approval Process. The process evaluates the risks of starting a relationship within a requested country and requires additional approval for locations in countries identified as high risk. Suppliers must receive an overall Bronze audit rating \u2013 our base acceptable level \u2013 prior to beginning full production.\n\n\u2022 Ongoing: Once a supplier is approved, we monitor compliance with our Code and CLS through regular announced and unannounced audits conducted by internal and external parties. Suppliers are expected to review and remediate audit findings to maintain their overall Bronze rating.\n\nWe investigate all allegations of non-compliance with our Code and CLS. In situations where improvements are required, we take a collaborative approach to working with supplier managers to verify corrective actions are taken, problems are remediated and that the managers have onsite verification. Should a supplier fail to remediate issues, they will be subject to review and sanctions, including potential termination of the supplier relationship.\n\n\u2022 Divest: If the relationship with an existing supplier is terminated, resulting from poor performance against our foundational expectations or other reasons, our responsible exit process is triggered. This includes evaluation of the risks to NIKE, the workers, the local community and the environment associated with the upcoming divestment. We take this process seriously. It includes a reduction in production orders over a determined length of time to create the lowest amount of disruption to a business and workers that is possible under the circumstances. In higher-risk situations, multi-stakeholder working groups develop and monitor an exit plan to manage the risks identified.\nMonitoring Progress\n\nIn FY21, finished goods suppliers onboarded common industry assessments while materials suppliers, distribution centers and NIKE owned and operated manufacturing facilities (Air MI) conducted their initial common industry assessments against our Code and CLS. As a result, we saw a downward shift in our ratings from 94% compliance to 85%, which was anticipated as part of the scope expansion.\n\nWe have found that a safe and healthy workplace and working hours are the leading causes of supplier gaps against our Code and CLS in manufacturing and initial assessments in distribution centers are beginning to surface environmental, labor, health and safety issues.\n\nAdditional details on our audits can be found in the Data Appendix of this report.\n\nMore Data\n\nAudit and worker data\nWE BUILD COMMUNITY\n\nTHROUGH THE LOVE OF SPORT\nWe focus on play to help all kids achieve their full potential, because an active next generation means a more equitable future.\n\nWhen it comes to play and sport, we know many kids face barriers. That\u2019s why, with more than 100 community partners and their grassroots programs, we\u2019re prioritizing inclusive programming that helps break the barriers that keep kids from being active around the world.\n\nWe also know that having a caring coach is critical to helping kids see their potential. We\u2019re investing in youth coaches so they can become game-changing mentors and help kids realize their potential both on and off the field.\n\nProviding opportunities for kids to play helps to build stronger, more resilient communities.\n\nAn active life today helps kids reach their full potential tomorrow.\nFocus Area\n\nACTIVE KIDS\n\n% girl participation\n\nQuantitative Target\n\nDrive sustained community impact by getting kids moving in our key cities and sourcing backyards with 50% girl participation\n\nPlay is the foundation of sport. And sport creates positive change \u2013 in kids\u2019 lives, in our communities and in the world. That\u2019s why NIKE is focused on getting kids moving by partnering with more than 100 community organizations around the world, through our Made to Play commitment. Our goal is to give all kids the opportunity to access and benefit from play and sport, so they\u2019re equipped to become tomorrow\u2019s leaders. It\u2019s also why we\u2019re continually creating new digital tools and resources to empower caring adults to become coaches who can create inclusive, fun environments that invite all kids to play. And we\u2019re prioritizing those facing some of the greatest barriers: starting with girls and kids from marginalized communities.\n\nIn FY21, we directly reached nearly 600,000 kids around the world \u2013 55% of whom were girls. We achieved this through the collective efforts we support as part of our Made to Play commitment to get kids moving. We also shared our best practices and tools with more than 24,000 coaches and helped train nearly 6,400 of them in delivering fun, inclusive experiences to all kids.\n\nIn FY21, we reminded the world that girls are made to play. Girls face complex cultural, social and economic barriers to play and sport. As a result, they drop out of sport at twice the rate of boys \u2013 and have fewer sport opportunities overall. To help remove these barriers, NIKE released the Made to Play Coaching Girls Guide. This open-source guide was co-created by NIKE and the Center for Healing and Justice Through Sport (formerly We Coach), with support from Youth Sport Trust.\nSpotlight\n\nInternational Day of the Girl\n\nOn October 11, 2020, International Day of the Girl, we came together with athletes and partners around the world to amplify girls\u2019 voices. As part of NIKE\u2019s first annual global celebration, we hosted a virtual event called \u201cGirls are Made to Play: A Conversation on Changing the Game.\u201d The event featured the voices and stories of NIKE athletes Scout Bassett, Rayssa Leal and Olivia Moultrie, and girls in community programs like Everybody Dance LA! and America SCORES New York. ESPN\u2019s LaChina Robinson led the conversation, which included an introduction with Caitlin Morris, Vice President, Social and Community Impact at NIKE, to show how empowered adults can be at the forefront of helping to change the game for girls. We also invited Nike Run Club (NRC) members to earn a special International Day of the Girl badge, and 1.45 million NRC members ran to support the need to reimagine sport for girls everywhere.\n\nInternational in Europe and subject matter experts and leaders in girls\u2019 sport and physical, social and emotional development. It\u2019s designed to shine a light on barriers to play that are specific to girls, and those who identify as girls, while equipping coaches and other caring adults with tools to help break those barriers and make sport fun for girls \u2013 now and in the future. The Guide has been translated into 24 languages \u2013 and adapted for different countries and cultures.\n\nAnother barrier girls face is access to the right apparel and equipment. Over the past two years, we\u2019ve donated 75,000 NIKE Swoosh sports bras and 3,000 NIKE Pro hijabs through our community partners to girls around the world. We\u2019ve also created tools for caring adults to guide conversations, as well as visual cards for girls to help them determine the right fit. Because product, combined with a positive experience, provides the best opportunity for girls to play with comfort and confidence.\n\nTogether with tennis champion Naomi Osaka and Laureus Sport for Good, NIKE created Play Academy, an initiative that aims to change girls\u2019 lives through play and sport. The program, originally launched in Tokyo and expanded to Los Angeles and Haiti, provides grants and\ncapacity-building training for grassroots organizations. Play Academy emphasizes fun, positive play experiences and coaches who are trained in gender inclusivity and can serve as role models to inspire the next generation of girls.\n\nWe\u2019re also working to help recruit and train more coaches who are representative of the kids they\u2019re serving. In Europe, we partnered with ICOACHKIDS to create five coaching essentials designed for anyone \u2013 especially those who have never coached before \u2013 to learn how to become a coach and inspire kids to move. In summer 2021, we made the series available on the NIKE Training Club and NIKE Run Club apps to encourage NIKE members to become volunteer youth coaches who can help inspire a lifelong love for sport.\n\nIn a joint effort between NIKE, China\u2019s Ministry of Education and China Education Development Foundation, the Active Schools China initiative continues to shape the role of play and sport for children in China. By the end of FY21, the program had engaged more than 3.9 million students from 8,500 schools in 30 provinces. The program also trained more than 10,000 physical education teachers across the country.\n\nIn November 2020, the fourth national Active Schools Innovation Awards ceremony was held online for the first time, and hundreds of thousands of viewers watched and interacted via livestream. The initiative has so far received nearly 8,000 applications and recognized 400 of the country\u2019s most creative and inspiring teachers transforming physical education across China.\n\nThe Boundless Girls program in China has reached more than 20,000 girls from 223 schools across the country. The engagement between NIKE and the China Youth Development Foundation provided gender-inclusive training and inclusive programs, as well as mini-fund support for creative teachers to unlock barriers to sport participation and reimagine sport for girls in China. NIKE employees volunteered 6,435 hours of time to support the program by the end of FY21.\n\n\u201cOur legacy is to make sure there\u2019s an arena where the next generation can play and thrive.\u201d\n\nDina Asher-Smith, Track and field athlete\nFocus Area\n\nINCLUSIVE COMMUNITY\n\nQuantitative Target\n\nInvest $125 million to support organizations working to level the playing field and address racial inequality\n\nInequality stands in the way of all communities seeking to thrive in an equal and just society. In FY21, NIKE invested a total of $36.6 million to unite and inspire communities to create a better and more equitable future for all.\n\nIn FY21, NIKE, Inc. announced a four-year $40 million commitment on behalf of NIKE, Jordan Brand and Converse to advance a more just and equitable society for Black Americans. In addition to the investment from NIKE, Inc., Jordan Brand and Michael Jordan donated $100 million over the next 10 years.\n\nFollowing these initial announcements, NIKE, Inc. formed partnerships with NAACP Empowerment Programs, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. (LDF), Black Girls CODE, and Black Girl Ventures \u2013 with each organization receiving funding ranging from $500,000 to $1 million. Jordan Brand and Michael Jordan made donations of $1 million each to the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. (LDF) and the Formerly Incarcerated & Convicted People and Families Movement (FICPFM), and $500,000 to Black Voters Matter to support reformative practices that drive real change in the Black community.\n\nLater in FY21, NIKE Inc. underscored that commitment through the support of new partnerships with Goalsetter to increase financial literacy among America\u2019s youth, with a focus on Black youth, and the National Urban League to champion employment and homeownership for the\nBlack community. Additionally, working with local teammates, we invested $2.75 million to support 37 local organizations across Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Memphis, New York City, Portland and St. Louis to fuel economic empowerment, education innovation and social justice on behalf of Black communities.\n\nIn London, the NIKE Brand supported the Black community through a community grant program, engaging employees in the grant-making process to help advance equality and expand opportunities. We\u2019ve since awarded grants to 15 community organizations dedicated to creating lasting change for the Black community in play and sport equity, education, economic empowerment, career development, mental health and more.\n\nFollowing the Michael Jordan and Jordan Brand\u2019s initial donations, together, of $1 million to the NAACP LDF, $1.1 million to the Formerly Incarcerated and Convicted People and Families Movement and $500,000 to Black Voters Matter, Michael Jordan and the Jordan Brand awarded a total of $5 million to the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture \u2013 where the Nike Foundation is a founding donor \u2013 Morehouse College\u2019s Journalism in Sports, Culture, and Social Justice program and the Ida B. Wells Society for Investigative Reporting.\n\nConverse made additional donations totaling over $500,000 to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, The Equal Justice Initiative, the ACLU of Massachusetts, the ACLU of Pennsylvania in collaboration with Converse Athlete Natasha Cloud, and The New Commonwealth Racial Equity and Social Justice Fund to advance equity and social justice work.\n\nSince FY20, NIKE\u2019s Until We All Win grant portfolio in the U.S. has underscored our commitment to diversity and inclusion in the communities where we live, work and play. Grants totaling $4.5 million in FY21 supported nonprofits working to advance equality in communities represented by our eight North America-based Employee Networks, collectively known as NikeUNITED.\n\nIn the next year, we aim to expand our support to nonprofits dedicated to creating a better and more equitable future in communities outside the U.S.\n\nLearn More\nNikeUNITED\nFocus Area\n\nEMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT\n\n% of employees engaged in their communities\n\n| Year | % Engaged |\n|------|-----------|\n| FY20 | 37%       |\n| FY21 | 35%       |\n\nTarget 35%\n\nQuantitative Target\n\nIncrease the number of employees engaged in their communities to a minimum of 35%\n\nAs a company that invests in communities as a core part of our purpose, NIKE also supports every employee\u2019s personal desire to give back and directly impact positive change across a wide range of causes in their local communities. We know our employees are both resilient and generous: so much so, that despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic last year, our employees helped direct more support than they ever have to the communities where they live and work.\n\nThrough our employee giving platform, Give Your Best, we reward employees for engaging in their communities by matching their cash donations and awarding $10 an hour for volunteering \u2013 either in-person or virtually. Our Give Your Best serves as the strongest measure of our employees\u2019 engagement in their community. In FY21, 35% of our global employee population engaged with our Give Your Best platform to help deliver NIKE\u2019s purpose.\n\nIn FY21, as a part of NIKE\u2019s employee matching gift program, NIKE employees directed $21 million to thousands of organizations around the world \u2013 a 38% increase over the prior year.\nSpotlight\n\nNIKE Community Impact Fund\n\nThrough the NIKE Community Impact Fund (NCIF), an employee-led grant-making program, teammates in the U.S. and Europe engage in a local community grant selection process that aims to support organizations that create active communities and provide access to play and sport. The success of NCIF is rooted in the passion of NIKE employees \u2013 no one is more committed to what their neighborhoods and communities need more than the people who live there. In FY21, 247 employees helped direct $1.3 million in support of community-based initiatives to drive local impact near eight NIKE Community Store neighborhoods across the U.S. \u2013 Chicago, Detroit, East Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York City, Portland, Washington, D.C., and Watts (total grants of $50,000 per store); NIKE\u2019s WHQ backyard (total grants of $500,000); NIKE\u2019s North America Logistics Campus in the Mid-South (total grants of $100,000); NIKE\u2019s European Headquarters (EHQ) in the Netherlands (total grants of \u20ac125,000); and the European Logistics Campus in Belgium (total grants of \u20ac139,000).\n\nOur employees mobilized to contribute to social justice efforts advancing equality and directed $3.1 million to more than 65 organizations. On Giving Tuesday alone, employees directed $7 million to 2,634 organizations globally in a single day \u2013 a record amount in the four years that NIKE has elevated the day by matching employee giving two-to-one to all organizations on Give Your Best, NIKE\u2019s employee giving platform.\n\nIn FY21, we continued to invest in our retail employees through the NIKE Community Ambassador (NCA) program. The NCA program gives NIKE store employees the opportunity to share their love of sport by volunteering in local schools and communities. More than 6,700 NCAs from 560 stores across 29 countries have volunteered to deliver positive sport experiences, rooted in inclusive coaching principles and games. As a result, NCAs around the world support and inspire kids to succeed both on and off the court. And despite the pause on in-person volunteering for NCAs due to the pandemic, we developed several new coaching resources and hosted virtual trainings in key markets that NCAs leveraged to enhance their training and education. We expect a significant increase in NCA activity once it\u2019s safe for everyone to gather in-person again with community partners and the kids they serve.\nIn Greater China, as part of the global Jordan Brand Wings program, 456 employees have volunteered 100,000 hours of time since the program began in 2015 to support primary school and high school youth \u2013 with many mentors leveraging virtual meeting tools to connect with the kids during the pandemic. Since 2015, the program has helped more than 2,120 rural high school students from 30 schools across 16 provinces. As the program embarks on its third season locally, employees will expand their support to provide scholarship graduates with mentorship and career support.\n\nDuring the pandemic in FY21, Converse\u2019s employee network, ConverseUNITED, introduced virtual Community Sessions to amplify local engagement efforts focused on youth. The events are designed to inspire middle school and high school-aged kids from community partner organizations by leveraging the unique and creative talent of employees to illuminate the career possibilities at Converse and within the industry. Over 150 youth have participated in the program\u2019s offerings, including virtual Sneaker School, which steeps individuals in the basics of sneaker creation \u2013 from design through manufacturing \u2013 and Basketball 101, which offered a crash course in developing a business plan for a performance basketball sneaker.\nFocus Area\n\nCOMMUNITY INVESTMENT\n\nQuantitative Target\n\nInvest 2% of prior-year, pre-tax income to drive positive impact in communities\n\nFor nearly 50 years, NIKE has been a committed and active participant in the communities where we live, work and play. As the needs of our communities became clear last year, NIKE responded by investing more than ever before.\nIn FY21, COVID-19 impacted all businesses, including ours. However, it was our communities that felt the greatest impacts. At the same time, racial injustice magnified those effects. As a company, we responded by leading with our values and giving our best to support our communities.\n\nOur ability to adapt to these significant, quickly changing needs led to NIKE\u2019s investment of $97.7 million \u2013 which represented 3.4% of the prior year\u2019s pre-tax income \u2013 far exceeding not only our original FY20 target of 1.5% of the pre-tax income but also our 2025 target of 2% investment. These investments have helped to drive significant, positive change for kids and communities around the world.\n\nJordan family members have also joined forces to help advance NIKE, Jordan and Michael Jordan\u2019s BCC through the launch of the Jordan Brand\u2019s inaugural Family Grant Program. In its first year, the Family Grant Program supported 11 organizations across eight U.S. cities. Michael Jordan and the Jordan Brand also launched a second inaugural program, the Community Grant Program, with an open call to grassroots organizations to directly apply for grants to help advance local solutions and more equitable futures for Black Americans. In its first year, the Community Grant Program awarded grants to 18 grassroots organizations across 16 U.S. cities.\n\nConverse worked with passion and pride in FY21 to connect young people with the resources they needed to realize their potential. With a sharper strategy centered on three goals \u2013 social justice, creativity and sport \u2013 Converse was able to adapt and respond to the changing needs of individuals and their communities. Last year, Converse increased its grant funding by six times and expanded to 27 community partnerships in Boston, London, Los Angeles and New York City. Over 80% of the individuals served by Converse\u2019s programming were from Black and Brown communities.\n\n\u201cThe dream for me is that every kid has the same opportunities and chances in life.\u201d\n\nNafi Thiam, Track and field athlete\nWE DON\u2019T WAIT FOR SOLUTIONS\n\nWE CREATE THEM\nTo help protect our planet, we don\u2019t wait for solutions, we create them.\n\nWe believe that we, along with our industry, have a responsibility to reduce our impact on the planet.

To do that, the world\u2019s GHG emissions need to be cut by half this decade, and we need to reach net zero by 2050.\n\nAt our scale, it\u2019s an ambitious goal, and many of our toughest challenges still lie ahead. But with clear targets and strategies, ambitious does not have to mean aspirational.\n\nAs noted in our net zero graphic on the next page, our carbon targets span different time periods and scopes. In this section, we start by covering 2025 targets and then discuss how they fit into our SBT ambitions.\nThe Path to Net Zero\n\nCurrent Plan\n\n- Nike commits to RE:100\n- Renewable electricity\n- Alternative fuels\n- HQ fleet vehicle electrification\n- Energy efficiency\n- Coal elimination\n- Supplier Climate Action Program\n- Air freight reduction\n- No rush shipping\n\nFuture Plan\n\nBuilding on current plans and increasing focus on:\n\n- Converting to environmentally preferred materials\n- Converting factories to renewable energy\n- Working across industry to accelerate progress\n\nBY 2030, WE AIM TO HIT OUR SCIENCE-BASED TARGETS\n\nScope 1 & 2 Target: -65%\nScope 3 Target: -30%\n\nBY 2050, WE AIM TO REACH NET ZERO\n\nScope 1, 2, & 3 Target: -90%\nIncreasing Scope: Carbon Targets\n\n| 2015 | 2020 | 2025 |\n|------|------|------|\n| **Make** | **Corporate Services**<br>WHQ only (diversion) | **Corporate Services**<br>All HQs | **Corporate Services**<br>All HQs & Offices (owned or operated); corporate jets |\n| | **Raw materials**<br>Product carbon footprint | **Raw materials**<br>Environmentally preferred materials: polyester, cotton, leather, rubber | **Raw materials**<br>Environmentally preferred materials: polyester, cotton, leather, rubber |\n| | **Materials manufacturing and finishing**<br>FW & AP | **Materials manufacturing and finishing**<br>FW & AP, Air Manufacturing Innovation | **Materials manufacturing and finishing**<br>FW & AP, Air Manufacturing Innovation |\n| | **Finished goods manufacturing**<br>FW | **Finished goods manufacturing**<br>FW | **Finished goods manufacturing**<br>FW & AP |\n| **Move** | **Logistics**<br>Inbound logistics | **Logistics**<br>Distribution Centers; inbound and outbound logistics | **Logistics**<br>Distribution Centers; inbound and outbound logistics |\n| **Sell** | **Retail**<br>U.S. only (owned or operated) | **Retail**<br>Global (owned or operated) | **Retail**<br>Global (owned or operated) |\n| | **Consumers** | **Consumers** | **Consumers** |\n| | **End of Life** | **End of Life** | **End of Life** |\n\n\u201cLife and the world are like the marathon. You have flat courses and free moments. And you can also have hilly courses and face challenges. Running a good marathon is not a one-day event \u2013 it\u2019s years and months of training and consistency. The same is true for climate change. It\u2019s good to think big. It\u2019s good to dream big. But consistency and commitment will win this most important race.\u201d\n\nEliud Kipchoge, Long-distance runner\nQuantitative Target\n\n70% absolute reduction of GHG emissions in owned or operated facilities through 100% renewable electricity and fleet electrification\n\nRenewable electricity use is driving the majority of reductions across our owned or operated facility emissions via power purchase agreements (PPAs) and onsite renewable electricity. Office closures (due to COVID-19) and energy efficiency work are also contributing to reductions.\n\nProcuring Renewable Electricity\n\nIn FY21, NIKE made strides toward our target to reach 100% renewable electricity in NIKE owned or operated facilities. In September 2020, NIKE\u2019s groundbreaking virtual power purchase agreement (vPPA) in Spain went live, covering our owned or operated electricity footprint in Europe. Iberdrola, S.A.\u2019s Cavar wind project provides NIKE\u2019s European operations with 110,000 MWh per year of renewable electricity. This project, along with PPAs delivering power across the U.S. and Canada and various onsite solar projects globally, brings NIKE to 78% of our 100% renewable energy target in owned or operated facilities.\n\nNIKE continues to explore and develop renewable energy solutions. Our countries of focus in FY21 included Australia, China, Japan, Mexico and Vietnam. While driving toward coverage for our owned and operated footprint, we increasingly explore solutions that may open pathways for adoption of renewable energy in our supply chain.\n\nWe continued to expand the generation and use of onsite renewable energy at our distribution centers globally. At our Tepana distribution center in Mexico, a rooftop solar array went live. The solar array is estimated to produce 1,000 MWh annually, covering ~50% of the facility\u2019s electricity needs and representing more than 10% of NIKE\u2019s load in Mexico. In Belgium, at our Converse European Logistics Campus, a rooftop solar array also went live and is estimated to produce 3,000 MWh annually, covering a significant portion of the facility\u2019s electricity needs.\n\n36 FY15 is the baseline for NIKE\u2019s RE100 target, which was 14% renewable energy.\nReducing Energy Use\n\nSome highlights of our efforts to reduce energy use in FY21 include:\n\n**Retail**\n- Piloting programs that allow stores to see actual energy use in real time and adjust operations to reduce energy use.\n- Building locations to be more energy efficient through updates and modifications to equipment such as heating and ventilation systems, LED lighting or the use of Environmental or Building Management Systems to manage energy consumption.\n- Transitioning to electricity for store heating and cooling needs, to transition more quickly to renewable energy than available by natural gas.\n- Eight stores that opened in Greater China in FY21 obtained Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification, including two Gold.\n\n**Offices**\n- Office closures yielded a significant temporary reduction in building energy usage globally. In FY21, we saw a 42% reduction in Scope 1 emissions from FY20. And a 48% reduction in emissions from transportation vehicles due to reduction in services at our WHQ campus.\n\u2022 We are optimizing our space usage to reduce the square footage of our global real estate portfolio. When we have office space growth, or renovations, we are incorporating electrification and energy-efficient design to decarbonize and reduce energy usage.\n\n\u2022 In FY21, we completed the LeBron James and Serena Williams buildings, both of which achieved LEED Platinum certification.\n\n\u2022 Launching Smart building pilots at both our WHQ and EHQ campuses. We will be completing these pilots in FY22 and are eager to review energy reduction results.\n\n\u2022 At our Greater China Headquarters (GCHQ), we expanded our employee electric vehicle (EV) charging network, where now 30% of available parking is supported with EV charging.\n\nDistribution Centers\n\u2022 Extreme temperatures in key regions required us to increase our energy use (electricity to cool, natural gas to heat) to keep the distribution centers temperate for our employees.\n\n\u2022 In Byhalia, Mississippi, our Adapt distribution center received LEED Gold certification, emphasizing the minimal impact of the building and the operational life of the facility.\n\n\u2022 In Belgium, our Court distribution center features include onsite solar panels, advanced LED lighting and use of biomethane in lieu of natural gas for heating, making the distribution center completely fossil free for its operations.\n\nAir MI Facilities\n\u2022 COVID-19 operating procedure requires increased ventilation. HVACs draw more outside air, increasing energy use.\n\n\u2022 We ended facility use of propane and switched to lower-carbon natural gas fuel.\n\n\u2022 Purchased hand-held gas detection meters to quickly detect, track and fix possible system leaks.\n\n\u2022 Identified priority electrification projects for FY22, including water heater conversions.\n\nCorporate Jets\n\u2022 NIKE\u2019s first investment for sustainable aviation fuels for employee air travel, kicking off the first step in our journey to 100% sustainable fuels for commercial air travel.\n\n\u2022 As of December 1, 2021, home base fuel planning includes 7,500 gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for each quarter.\nQuantitative Target\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions from key suppliers\u2019 manufacturing and transportation operations will be at or below 2020 levels through use of renewable energy, energy efficiency and alternative fuels\n\nThe significant reduction we saw in FY21 was largely due to COVID-19-related factors including manufacturing slowdown and our lowest inbound air freight rate on record. Outbound emissions increased versus baseline in response to increasing e-commerce sales but was a smaller portion of this target.\n\nManufacturing\n\nFor NIKE to achieve its 2030 Scope 3 science-based emission reduction target and longer-term net zero target, it is critical that emissions from manufacturing suppliers are reduced. Finished goods and materials suppliers account for approximately 30% of NIKE\u2019s total emissions footprint. Under a business-as-usual scenario, NIKE expects emissions from manufacturing to increase by more than 30% over the next five years \u2013 which means that, to reduce absolute emissions during this time, we need to push beyond incremental reductions and unlock transformative solutions.\n\nAchieving these targets not only reduces emissions but also builds shared value. Our programs help to drive operational efficiencies and energy savings among our supply chain while also building operational resilience for a future where climate impacts are the norm.\n\nOur manufacturing emissions reduction strategy with suppliers is built on four pillars:\n\n1. Expand ongoing efficiency improvements\n2. Maximize use of onsite solar photovoltaic (PV) at factory sites\n3. Procure offsite renewable grid electricity through mechanisms such as PPAs\n4. Phase out of coal use in dyeing and finishing facilities and switch to lower-carbon fuels\nEnergy Efficiency\nDuring FY21, we deployed NIKE\u2019s Energy Minimum Program, which is an energy management foundation geared at achieving energy and cost savings. This enabled us to achieve resource productivity gains with finished goods and materials suppliers. This program brings organizational capabilities, data analytics and energy management activities to suppliers.\n\nAdditionally, we worked with individual facilities to scale key energy efficiency opportunities with the greatest impact on their unique energy and carbon footprint. For example, we worked with apparel suppliers to increase motor efficiency and worked with footwear suppliers to reduce energy use in midsole processing. We also began exploring new finishing methods in materials manufacturing that could potentially cut energy and water use in half and significantly reduce emissions, with an aim to pilot this technology at a manufacturing facility in FY22.\nOnsite Renewable Energy\nCosts of onsite solar PV installations have declined so much that they can be less expensive than grid-purchased electricity, offering financial savings for suppliers while also reducing their carbon footprint. Onsite solar PV can typically provide up to 15% of electricity requirements at supplier facilities and can be scaled fairly quickly across sites, making it a major component of our renewable energy strategy with suppliers.\n\nSince launching in FY19, the NIKE onsite solar PV program has helped increase uptake of rooftop solar PV among suppliers across our supply chain. Through the program, NIKE provides technical advice and assistance, helping to reduce risk for suppliers during the contracting process and make the business case for these investments.\n\nIn FY21, NIKE launched onsite solar programs in Vietnam and Indonesia, and suppliers added significant onsite solar PV capacity, with 25 facilities signing contracts for 32 MW of solar energy.\n\nIn Greater China, we continue to work with suppliers to maximize the use of renewable energy through the use of solar and biofuels.\n\nOffsite Renewable Energy\nWhile suppliers are making significant emissions reductions through deployment of onsite solar PV, facilitating access to offsite renewable electricity through mechanisms like PPAs will offer even greater opportunities for suppliers to reduce their emissions footprint.\n\nNIKE is exploring different ways to support PPAs across our major markets and encouraging suppliers to take advantage of those opportunities where they exist. In FY21, suppliers contracted over 90 million kWh/year of offsite renewable energy for NIKE production by engaging in PPAs. This includes Feng Tay Group, which contracted nearly 50 million kWh/year at three of their facilities in India.\n\nAs NIKE suppliers do not have the ability to procure clean energy through PPAs in several of our major markets, we are continuing to explore and advocate for government policy frameworks to support.\n\nFor example, we are collaborating with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Vietnam Low Emission Energy Program (V-LEEP)\nto support the Vietnamese Government\u2019s renewable energy direct power purchase agreement (DPPA) pilot being launched jointly by USAID, the Vietnam Ministry of Industry and Trade, and the Electricity Regulatory Authority of Vietnam. In FY21, we assisted several Vietnam suppliers in preparing for the DPPA pilot application, anticipated to open in FY22. Through the pilot, NIKE may be able to secure renewable electricity for nearly 100% of our owned and operated spaces in Vietnam, and suppliers will be able to power nearly 40% of NIKE\u2019s manufacturing load in Vietnam with renewable energy.\n\nNIKE, together with a strategic factory group, stands ready to move forward with the DPPA pilot when the program is finalized by the Vietnamese government. Over the past year, we have analyzed the local electricity market to select a developer to work with when program applications open.\n\nNIKE is sharpening its policy advocacy efforts to open up renewable energy procurement opportunities in our key sourcing markets. At COP26, NIKE executives met with government officials and signaled our strong desire for competitive clean energy market solutions through participation in the U.S. Department of State Clean Energy Demand Initiative. Also at COP26, NIKE helped to launch USAID\u2019s Corporate Clean Energy Alliance, a coalition of businesses committed to working with governments across Southeast Asia to facilitate the rapid deployment of clean energy.\n\nAlready, some strategic suppliers have taken innovative approaches to scale their access to renewable energy and we encourage their efforts. Notable among these is Shenzhou, which is seeking direct investment in a wind farm to provide renewable electricity to its factory in Zhejiang, China.\n\nThrough a growing suite of renewable electricity solutions, NIKE hopes to continue accelerating supplier emissions reductions toward meeting long-term climate targets.\n\n**Coal Elimination**\n\nThrough NIKE\u2019s participation in the UN Fashion Charter, we have a goal to eliminate coal from Tier 2 suppliers by 2030. In FY21, NIKE joined a collective action initiative with Apparel Impact Institute and seven other brands. Through the initiative, NIKE co-chairs a working group to explore how we can work collectively across brands to eliminate coal from Tier 2 suppliers. Currently, 50% of Tier 2 suppliers have coal elimination plans in place.\n\n**Logistics**\nSpotlight\n\nSupplier Climate Action Program\n\nWe know we cannot meet the ambitious targets laid out by the Paris Agreement and our own Science-Based Targets (SBTs) alone. Meaningful climate action requires long-term commitments and engagement with all parts of our supply chain. Fortunately, NIKE has built close relationships and mutual trust with manufacturing suppliers over decades, which allow us to develop innovative products and co-invest in manufacturing capabilities. We are leveraging those relationships to drive action on climate change.\n\nIn May 2020, NIKE launched a new climate program with NIKE\u2019s Supplier Sustainability Council (SSC). The SSC is a group of strategic suppliers committed to sustainability to enhance their operational performance and mitigate risk while sharing out best practices in the hopes of elevating worker safety across the sector. Challenges related to climate change were among the top sustainability issues raised by the SSC. Of particular concern were the rising cost of energy, hotter working conditions, increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather events, and new policy and regulation introduced by governments to mitigate GHG emissions.\n\nWith those concerns in mind, NIKE developed the Supplier Climate Action Program (SCAP). Eleven of NIKE\u2019s largest finished goods and materials suppliers committed to the program and account for approximately 60% of strategic supplier emissions. SCAP not only provides technical assistance to suppliers to help set more ambitious climate goals but also turns the process of achieving our supply chain emission reductions into an aligned strategic effort.\n\nThe SCAP asks suppliers to take the following actions:\n\n\u2022 Develop a company-wide GHG inventory\n\u2022 Set a validated science-based emissions target for Scope 1 and 2 emissions\n\u2022 Publicly disclose climate-related information through CDP\n\u2022 Collaborate with NIKE to explore climate-related risks and opportunities in the extended supply chain\n\n38 Facilities in Extended Supply Chain: 100% finished goods suppliers (AP, FW, and EQ); in-scope materials suppliers; focus DCs; and Air Manufacturing Innovation facilities \u2013 In-Scope Materials Suppliers: Suppliers representing approximately 90% of total footwear upper materials and apparel textiles production \u2013 Focus DCs: Distribution centers representing at least 80% volume.\nDuring FY21, these suppliers completed all of the foundational requirements of the program, which includes having their science-based Scope 1 and 2 emission targets validated by the World Resources Institute (WRI). Those ambitious commitments cover their footprint across their entire footwear and apparel businesses (not only NIKE-related emissions) \u2013 a projected 42% reduction in baseline emissions over 10 years. This level of reduction is what is needed collectively across the globe to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. At its heart, this program is supporting the deepest parts of our supply chain to take climate action and create ripple effects within the industry and beyond.\n\nOver the coming months, NIKE and the SSC will create a joint climate action plan, which will serve as a roadmap for our collective emission reduction pathway over the next 10 years.\n\n**Air Freight**\n\nIn FY21, NIKE saw the lowest inbound air freight usage on record since we began tracking (from supplier to destination distribution center). Initially, the decision to reduce air freight was made to mitigate business uncertainty at the onset of the pandemic. Due to the substantial positive impact on our inbound carbon emissions (air freight is on average 42 times more carbon intensive than ocean freight), NIKE is working to not return to pre-pandemic air freight usage, through our Move to Zero air freight program.\n\nHistorically, carbon emissions from outbound transportation (from a NIKE distribution center to final destination, including to the consumer) have been challenging with the growth of e-commerce sales, as we try to balance speed and carbon emissions. In FY21, that challenge only intensified as e-commerce sales grew even faster.\n\n**Alternative Fuels**\n\nIn FY21, we continued to expand piloting alternative fuels for both ocean freight and air freight. These pilots used biofuels made from waste streams and carried certifications from the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials and the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification. In total, our investments in these pilots secured alternative fuels for about 4% of our total inbound volume, resulting in the reduction of approximately 11,000 metric tons of carbon emissions.\n\nWe continued to expand our use of alternative fuels for outbound\ntransportation in EMEA with key activations on lanes from our European Logistics Campus in Belgium to London. During FY21, the EMEA outbound team reduced outbound transportation carbon impact by using multi-modal solutions and alternative fuels. As a result, 28% of our total line-haul solutions are now multi-modal. Of our total line-haul trucking kilometers, 22% are driven on alternative fuels, mainly fueled with hydro-treated vegetable oil (HVO) solutions. We also began using electric trucks for deliveries in Tokyo, Seoul and Mexico City.\n\nIn Greater China, alternative transportation methods for outbound shipping have helped reduce carbon emissions. Taking advantage of new railways systems, implementing alternative fuels and utilizing electric vehicles have reduced carbon emissions in outbound freight by more than 572 metric tons. We also began utilizing trucks to replace air freight while maintaining the same service level in digital order transportation, reducing 70% of carbon emission compared with air freight in FY21.\n\nWe have learned there are many options available for alternative fuels \u2013 with varying carbon emission reductions, limited availability and some with other potential environmental concerns. To enable us to make the best decisions possible based on currently known information as we begin to scale, we worked cross-functionally to develop a sustainable fuels policy, which clearly outlines definitions, criteria and guidance for fuel efforts and reporting. The policy is intended to provide guidance, which allow us to build effective strategies to accelerate the use of alternative fuels.\n\nAs a bridging strategy, until alternative fuels are widely available, we also continued to offset 100% of the carbon impact of the transport of our U.S. and European e-commerce orders (from distribution center to consumer) through innovative forestry engagements with FM in the U.S. and WeForest in Europe. For our European e-commerce orders, we reached the milestone of planting 1 million trees since the start of the program. This was done through a Move to Zero Community Challenge, calling on our members and employees to collectively run 1 million kilometers. For every participant who ran 1 kilometer, one tree was planted on behalf of NIKE.\n\nMore Data\n\nCarbon Data\nQuantitative Target\n\n0.5M metric tons of GHG emissions reduced through increasing our use of environmentally preferred materials to 50% of all key materials\\(^{39}\\)\n\nWe know that materials account for approximately 70% of NIKE\u2019s product carbon footprint. By tapping into the insights and experience of at least the past five years, we are focusing on improving the environmental impact of materials within our products. We\u2019re also moving from having no material priorities to concentrating our efforts on specifically targeted material replacements.\n\nFor footwear, we are focused on improving specific, high-volume materials (polyester, rubber and leather), particularly through significant increases in the use of recycled versions and the necessary integrated business strategies. Innovation will be increasingly important, focusing on new recycling methods and material types that meet our product and consumer requirements.\n\nPolyester and cotton make up the bulk of NIKE Apparel\u2019s material use and carbon impact, and these two fibers are where the focus is for impact reduction at scale. We are concentrating conversions to recycled polyester, organic cotton and recycled cotton content on key high-volume fabrics and products. This strategy requires partnership across NIKE\u2019s entire organization, from innovation through to our consumers at retail.\n\nOne year into our five-year journey, our focus on key materials with scalable low-impact alternatives has enabled NIKE to make tremendous progress toward our carbon reduction goals. NIKE is well ahead of our recycled polyester plan in both footwear and apparel. While we\u2019re tracking behind our footwear goals in both leather and rubber, we have strategies in place that should allow us to make up the gap. NIKE product creation is focused on meeting these goals.\n\n\\(^{39}\\) Key Materials \u2013 Polyester, cotton, leather and rubber.\n### Top Five Materials in Product by Volume\n\n| Material                        | FY20       | FY21       |\n|--------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| **Polyester**                  |            |            |\n| Recycled metric tons           | 44,387     | 55,477     |\n| %                              | 23%        | 33%        |\n| **Total Polyester Use**        | 195,490    | 166,343    |\n| **Cotton**                     |            |            |\n| Organic metric tons            | 10,811     | 13,680     |\n| %                              | 10%        | 12%        |\n| Recycled metric tons           | 503        | 905        |\n| %                              | 0.4%       | 0.8%       |\n| Third-party certified Cotton   | 85,139     | 66,776     |\n| %                              | 75%        | 58%        |\n| **Total Cotton Use**           | 113,615    | 115,543    |\n| **Rubber**                     |            |            |\n| Recycled metric tons           | 564        | 689        |\n| %                              | 0.7%       | 0.9%       |\n| **Total Rubber Use**           | 76,141     | 78,896     |\n| **Ethylene-Vinyl Acetate (EVA) Foam** |            |            |\n| Recycled metric tons           | 978        | 907        |\n| %                              | 2%         | 2%         |\n| **Total EVA Foam Use**         | 61,053     | 53,055     |\n| **Leather**                    |            |            |\n| Flyleather metric tons         | 53         | 57         |\n| %                              | 0.1%       | 0.1%       |\n| Synthetic Leather              | 18,623     | 16,031     |\n| %                              | 36%        | 26%        |\n| **Total Leather Use**          | 51,647     | 60,502     |\n\n40 Total material use reflects EPM and conventional materials. As we\u2019ve shifted data sources to enable more inclusive scope of measurement in our FY25 commitments, our percentage has dropped. We continue to explore ways to ensure we grow our sustainable cotton percentage in alignment with the expanded measurement scope.\n\n41 Cotton and polyester data includes Nike Brand footwear, apparel, and socks and Converse footwear and apparel. Rubber, EVA foam and leather data includes Nike Brand footwear only.\n\n42 All leather is Leather Working Group certified.\nPolyester\n\nValued for its lightweight performance, design versatility and durability (among other benefits), polyester is a material that you\u2019ll find in nearly every pair of NIKE Footwear. From the Flyknit in our most innovative football boots and running shoes to favorite sportswear icons, polyester is a core material for NIKE Footwear. Our use of polyester makes it critical that we focus on the conversion and scale of recycled polyester as a lever for reducing the overall carbon impact of our highest use material.\n\nNIKE Footwear is tracking ahead of our 2025 goal of 50% recycled total polyester usage. At the end of FY21, recycled polyester made up 38% of NIKE Footwear\u2019s total polyester usage, double the amount from the end of FY20. Progress was driven by our focus on foundational polyester-based materials that cut across our product portfolio, such as laces, linings and reinforcements. In addition, we\u2019ve prioritized converting textiles and yarns to recycled polyester used in innovative styles (such as Cosmic Unity and Space Hippie), our business volume drivers (such as Vapormax and Star Runner) and iconic silhouettes (Air Force 1 and Air Max).\n\nNIKE Apparel\u2019s most important lever for carbon impact reduction is polyester because it makes up approximately 50% of our materials. In addition, conversion to recycled polyester is achievable with little to no compromise to material quality, performance and aesthetic.\n\nIn FY21, we saw a 12 p.p. increase for recycled polyester in apparel to 38% from FY20. Similar growth is projected for upcoming years as the strategy to convert our top volume polyester-containing materials to recycled versions plays out. Key apparel that featured recycled polyester in FY21 included the WNBA anniversary kits, ACG, and the club and federation kits for Global Football.\n\nWe have made great progress \u2013 NIKE is annually among the top users of recycled polyester in our industry. But we know more needs to be done.\n\nRubber\n\nRubber is the key outsole traction material used across NIKE Footwear. First and foremost, we\u2019re looking to reduce how much rubber is used to lower our impact. We aim to move to high-recycled percentage formulations that maintain material benefits while lowering environmental impact. In parallel, we\u2019re innovating ways to reduce the amount of rubber used through additive design and manufacturing while also exploring other materials and methods to replicate the performance of rubber at a lower impact.\nNIKE Footwear aims to achieve our 2025 goal of 10% recycled rubber through greater use, by leveraging higher-percentage recycled rubber content per pair. Progress to date has been driven by using recycled rubber formulations primarily in black rubber outsoles in performance product. In the future, we want to standardize those formulations across footwear. Using current technology, increasing the percentage of recycled rubber can degrade performance and durability. We are working across our innovation and manufacturing teams and rubber compound suppliers to unlock high-performing recycled rubber options that meet our design and durability expectations.\n\nConverse, well-known for its vulcanized rubber soles, has been exploring lower impact alternatives. In FY21, Converse successfully piloted and launched a new injection cupsole across core Chuck Taylor All Stars that do not feature the classic pinstripe. The initiative produces 60% less waste and between 1% and 6% lower energy consumption compared to the vulcanization method.\n\nLeather\n\nLong valued for its durability and style versatility, leather is a material synonymous with iconic NIKE Footwear. From the triple-white Air Force 1 and Air Jordan 1 to the Tiempo football boot, consumers value the look, feel and performance of leather. However, leather is also one of the highest impact materials for both carbon and waste used in NIKE Footwear. To achieve our 2025 goals, we\u2019re working to convert at least 10 p.p. of our leather usage to leather alternatives \u2013 this includes synthetic and recycled synthetic leathers, NIKE innovations like Flyleather and other traditional leather alternatives.\n\nDue to the consumer preference for classic NIKE leather icons in FY21, leather models are outpacing the growth of the rest of NIKE Footwear, putting us behind our plan to achieve our 2025 goal. By the end of FY21, we started to reverse course and put strategies in place to accelerate toward our long-term goal. We aim to increase the use of Flyleather in the next two years, as we unlock options and additional capacity. We\u2019re putting innovation resources toward the exploration of other leather alternatives from non-animal sources. We\u2019re also scaling use of recycled synthetic and synthetic leather in our key essentials, in place of traditional leather.\n\n46% 43\n\nNIKE Footwear has a goal of 46% of our leather usage will be leather alternatives by FY25\n\n43 46% based upon baseline data (finalized CY22), equivalent to +10 p.p. vs. FY20 baseline.\nCotton\n\nCotton use in NIKE Apparel is growing due to our focus on sport lifestyle product and T-shirts and we have long supported a 10% blending strategy for organic cotton. This puts NIKE among the top users of this key sustainable fiber globally. In addition, we feature organic cotton as a primary fabric content in key products such as our Kids/Girls NIKE Sportswear Jerseys made with at least 50% organic cotton.\n\nFor recycled cotton, FY21 was relatively stable as our team prioritized other material conversions (such as recycled polyester). Recycled cotton will become more of a strategic focus in FY22. Our ability to scale this material is dependent on the differing capabilities of suppliers and the quality/content constraints inherent in the mechanical yarn creation process. The main supply for recycled cotton is shredded textile waste from garment manufacturing, so increases in recycled cotton blending will coincide with higher closed-loop recycling rates and reduced waste at Tier 1 suppliers going forward.\n\nIn FY21, we achieved 70% sustainable cotton by supplementing our use of recycled and organic cotton with third-party certified cotton.\n\nMore Data\n\nCarbon Data\nSpotlight\n\nFY30 Science-Based Target in Carbon\n\nFY21 is the first year that we are reporting performance on our Science-Based Targets (SBTs). We committed to setting SBTs in FY17, and while the baseline for our targets was set against FY15 data, galvanized coordination around this work did not begin until FY19 when the targets were finalized. Since FY19, we have been working to make systemic changes across NIKE to achieve our SBTs, the impact of which we will be realized in the coming years.\n\nOur SBTs represent the first full carbon footprint targets we\u2019ve ever set and are much bigger than any of NIKE\u2019s historical carbon targets in both duration and scope. First, the targets cover the time period from FY15 to FY30, rather than our standard five-year target cadence. Second, the SBTs\u2019 scope reaches deeper into our supply chain than ever before and extends further than our direct influence. Lastly, SBTs are absolute targets, similar to our 2025 carbon targets. Prior to these targets, we\u2019ve only had relative, per unit carbon targets.\n\nThese factors create a set of carbon targets that become more difficult to achieve as our business grows. While our 2025 targets help us make progress toward our SBTs, it doesn\u2019t guarantee success with our SBTs. This necessitates that we make progress in areas not covered by our 2025 targets in order to stay on track.\n\nFY15\u2013FY21 Performance\n\nScope 1\u20132\n\nOur Scope 1 carbon emissions are increasing due to the expansion of our facility portfolio and the absence of scalable, lower carbon alternatives to replace natural gas and jet fuel. To counteract this increase, we continue pursuing energy efficiency opportunities and are exploring renewable natural gas and sustainable aviation fuel. In FY21, we developed an internal sustainable fuels policy to enable consistency in decision-making.\n\nWe have seen great progress with Scope 2 emissions, driven by renewable electricity through PPAs, vPPAs and onsite renewable energy. More information on our work can be found in the Carbon section of this report. As of FY21, we have seen a 55% decrease in our Scope 1 & 2 emissions since FY15.\nScope 3\nAs a growth company, decoupling our emissions footprint from unit growth in the face of absolute carbon targets is a critical challenge to address. Our growth has contributed to our FY21 emissions footprint increasing by 17% versus the FY15 baseline. The increasing emissions intensity of the Vietnam electricity grid has driven up the manufacturing portion of our emissions footprint. Additionally, the use of higher carbon-intensive materials in footwear (such as leather) combined with increasing material use per product has also spurred much of the emissions growth. Another important consideration in understanding our progress is that as products that are out now in the market reflect decisions made three years ago, we\u2019re not yet seeing the impact of strategies and investments made since the announcement of the SBT.\n\nTo achieve this ambitious emissions goal we will focus on increasing environmentally preferred materials, converting factories to renewable energy and working across industries to accelerate change.\n\nMore Data\nScope 1 and 2 Emissions Data\n\n2030 Science-Based Target: Scope 1, 2 & 3 Totals (Metric Tons CO\u2082e)\nZero Waste\n\nOur vision is zero waste, period.\nThe traditional linear system of production, based on a take-make-waste model, is outdated and adds additional strain to the world\u2019s natural resources and ecosystems. Brands and suppliers are bearing the cost of producing materials that go to waste while simultaneously paying for disposal. Additionally, today\u2019s consumers, investors, governments and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) expect brands to help be part of the solution.\n\nA more sustainable and circular future requires designing waste out of products from the start, optimizing manufacturing processes for maximum material efficiency, and then managing manufacturing material, end-of-life product and packaging via circular systems to preserve, recover, renew and regenerate its physical utility and economic value for society and the planet \u2013 now and for future generations. This requires an integrated, holistic approach where internal teams and external suppliers work together to continuously optimize the whole system.\nMaterials Stewardship Hierarchy\n\nWaste must be managed responsibly. The core elements of our circular materials stewardship system include:\n\n- **Waste material definitions**: Standardized definitions of waste generated across the enterprise based on specific characteristics relevant for planning, implementing and evaluating waste reduction; and recycling and disposition policies, strategies and programs.\n\n- **Waste estimation and prevention**: Systems to estimate how much waste will be generated and what\u2019s driving it at various levels of analysis \u2013 from product components to aggregated waste streams at generation points across the enterprise \u2013 so it can be systematically minimized.\n\n- **Data reporting and transparency**: Systems to enable data relating to waste generation, recycling and disposition to be captured, aggregated and distributed across the enterprise.\n\n- **Material segregation and sortation**: Clear and enforced protocols for waste type segregation, sorting and storage to preserve material quality, utility and value.\n\n- **Collection, transport and consolidation**: Logistics to efficiently collect, move and consolidate waste from points of generation across the enterprise to downstream handlers for recycling, energy recovery or responsible disposition.\n\n- **Waste processing**: Operations that are co-located or downstream from points of generation across the enterprise that process waste materials into manufacturing feedstock that meet customer specifications for use in making new products. These operations may or may not be owned and operated by NIKE and may or may not process exclusively NIKE waste. Processing can take many forms, such as sorting, grading, grinding, shredding, baling, extruding, composting and various forms of biological or chemical decomposition.\n\n- **Demand creation**: Business development activities to create market demand for Nike Grind materials \u2013 including rubber, foam, leather and textile blends from manufacturing scrap and end-of-life shoes \u2013 across NIKE product creation teams and with external global companies.\n\n- **Feedback loops**: Systems that enable planned versus actual waste to be compared to inform continuous improvement.\nQuantitative Target\n\n10% waste reduction per unit in manufacturing, distribution, headquarters and packaging through improved design and operational efficiency\n\nNIKE engages with thousands of suppliers to make thousands of products and is constantly innovating. There are a myriad of potential drivers of waste that need to be systematically identified and eliminated or consistently controlled across the entire value chain if we are to achieve and sustain the global waste reduction target.\n\nThis 2025 waste target represents an expansion of scope of our 2020 targets. We now include packaging applied at supplier facilities and our NIKE owned and operated manufacturing facilities (Air MI) within the target. We remain on track to meet our target. We saw a decrease in Tier 1 footwear operational waste per pair driven by continued scaling of our targeted phylon midsole defect tracking and reduction program. We also encouraged wholesalers to order full case units, which drove down disposed waste per unit in distribution centers. Finally, our EMEA distribution center closed the loop on being 100% plastic free for all digital and B2B packaging deliveries.\n\nManufacturing\n\nWaste of any kind is a signal of inefficiency, which can be a signal of cost and added environmental impact. Manufacturing NIKE products generates more than 120 million kg of waste per year. The upstream manufacturing of these wasted materials consumes resources, generates pollution and costs money. Reducing midsole and outsole defects \u2013 which are a major driver of waste \u2013 increases factory production capacity and reduces energy and labor per unit. Because waste that is prevented doesn\u2019t have to be bought or made into a new material via a recycling process, waste prevention has significantly greater environmental and economic benefits than recycling.\n### Increasing Scope: Waste Target\n\n| 2015 | 2020 | 2025 |\n|------|------|------|\n| **Make** | | |\n| Corporate Services | Corporate Services | Corporate Services |\n| WHQ only (diversion) | All HQs (reduction + diversion) | All HQs (reduction + diversion + recycling) |\n| Raw materials | Raw materials | Raw materials |\n| Materials manufacturing and finishing | Materials manufacturing and finishing | Materials manufacturing and finishing |\n| Finished goods manufacturing<sup>46</sup> | Finished goods manufacturing | Finished goods manufacturing |\n| FW Packaging (waste reduction), AP, AC (waste reduction); FW only (waste diversion) | FW (reduction and diversion) | FW + AP (reduction + diversion + recycling); FW, AP + AC packaging (reduction) |\n| **Move** | | |\n| Logistics | Logistics | Logistics |\n| DCs (diversion) | DCs (reduction and diversion) | DCs (reduction + diversion + recycling + FPW) |\n| **Sell** | | |\n| Retail | Retail | Retail |\n| Pilot 29 retail stores in U.S. (diversion) | | (FPW) |\n| Consumers | Consumers | Consumers |\n| End of Life | End of Life | End of Life |\n\n<sup>45</sup> Air MI is now in targets scope.\n\n<sup>46</sup> Packaging target included a selection of shoeboxes only.\n\n---\n\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s everybody\u2019s responsibility to advocate for change. We need to continue to reimagine this world and make it better.\u201d\n\nMegan Rapinoe, Global football athlete\nTo prevent waste, we are focusing first on mastering the fundamentals by focusing on measurement. We can\u2019t reduce waste unless we measure it and understand what\u2019s driving it, so we continue to improve our measurement practices, particularly tracking bottom component defects to enable root cause analysis.\n\nIn FY21, 17 suppliers that drive 80% of midsole waste finished implementing systems for capturing midsole defect data and increased their use of this data to identify and address root causes. This resulted in a 30% reduction in phylon midsole defect waste, prevented more than 2.4 million kg of waste and prevented 9.4 million kg of associated carbon emissions.\nBuilding on this foundation, we designed and began piloting a system to aggregate bottom defect data from individual factories to enable analysis across factories to identify root causes affecting multiple factories. This system will be scaled in FY22 and FY23.\n\nWe also continued scaling a program to ship certain input materials to suppliers in reusable boxes instead of single-use cartons. By targeting material suppliers located near facilities where backhauling reusable boxes is practical, we prevented approximately 1 million kg of cardboard waste, reduced associated carbon emissions by 1.4 million kg and saved more than 120 million liters of water.\n\nHowever, these savings were offset by increases in single-use cartons driven by increased consumer demand for franchise models made with leather. The cartons used for shipping leather are very heavy (up to 14 kg) and switching these to reusable boxes isn\u2019t logistically practical at this time.\n\n**Footwear**\n\nWith footwear, we focus on per pair reduction, rather than total waste, because the number of pairs produced is driven by consumer/marketplace demand (not product/design teams). We identified the key waste streams by mass and overall impact and are concentrating our efforts on the biggest areas of opportunity. In footwear creation, our biggest waste streams mirror our high-impact material zones: leather, mixed textiles, foam and rubber are among the top impact areas.\n\nThrough FY21, our creation-led waste target was behind plan. While we\u2019ve made progress in reducing synthetic leather and upper textile waste, traditional leather and polyurethane (PU)-coated leather continues to lead an increase in waste. Consumer demand for NIKE lifestyle icons (e.g., Blazer) is driving this increase usage. But, along with its carbon impact, leather is one of the most inefficient materials in a footwear production environment. To date, traditional leather waste is negating the gain we\u2019ve made elsewhere and is contributing the vast majority of our incremental waste. More efficient leather alternative conversions are actively planned in key footwear products, with women\u2019s and kids\u2019 leading the way, but we will not likely realize the savings associated with these models until end FY22 and into FY23.\nClosed-Loop Recycling\nWhile our first aim is to reduce waste in the footwear creation process, we also want to create opportunities for reinserting the waste we create back into footwear product. Our goal is to leverage at least 25% of Tier 1 factory waste back into footwear. We work closely with the NIKE circular economy team to identify closed-loop opportunities in manufacturing centers and with our creation teams and suppliers to enable the conversion of the waste into new materials.\n\nWe are slightly behind our preferred pace to hit our 2025 goals, but we\u2019re confident we\u2019re building a robust plan to increase momentum over the next year or two. We have viable scale solutions in closed-loop rubber (the number one source for our recycled rubber is our own Tier 1 factory waste) and EVA foam. The greatest challenges come from converting synthetic leather and leather scrap to a viable new material, but we\u2019re working across NIKE innovation, manufacturing and suppliers to develop an outlet for those materials that can be put back into footwear.\n\nApparel\nNIKE Apparel\u2019s goal is to increase efficiency in our product designs earlier in our creation and development process, which will reduce waste when those products are manufactured. This can be achieved through adjustments to patterns, which increase fabric efficiency in manufacturing, by using lighter weight materials where possible, and greater use of highly efficient methods of make, such as Flyknit.\n\nDue to system upgrades, some key product efficiency data was unavailable in FY21. Once the upgrade is complete (scheduled for FY22), we will baseline key product efficiency metrics and work with our consumer creation teams to set waste reduction goals, develop tracking reports and incorporate them into our target dashboard. Using data developed for our 2020 targets, interim goals have been rolled out to our product teams to work toward until the data/systems upgrade is complete.\n\nPackaging\nThe majority of NIKE\u2019s packaging in footwear is produced with over 90% recycled content. Our 2025 target is important as it leverages the previous success in increasing the recycled content to now focus on using less. Multiple projects have been initiated to achieve our goal of reduced packaging.\nSpotlight\n\nNIKE Approach to Changing Terminology\n\nLanguage matters. \u201cWaste\u201d is material \u2013 material that meets certain criteria that cause it to be labeled and thought about as \u201cwaste.\u201d How we define when material becomes \u201cwaste\u201d and waste becomes \u201crecycled\u201d affects how waste problems and opportunities are defined, how waste reduction and recycling strategies are developed and evaluated, how waste impacts are measured and reported, and how environmental product claims are substantiated. NIKE products are made using a wide range of materials that are constantly evolving. This means our manufacturing waste streams are constantly evolving, too. How waste gets physically segregated and measured affects our ability to identify and act on waste drivers and recycling opportunities.\n\nFor these reasons and more, waste terms and definitions are foundational for our waste programs, and they need to evolve to keep this foundation strong as the materials we use change, and the way waste is thought about internally and externally evolves. To this end, in FY21, we reviewed waste terms and definitions internally and externally to assess if and where they may need to be aligned, standardized, updated or created. This included:\n\n\u2022 Participating in the GRI Business Leadership Forum on the new GRI 306 Waste Standard\n\u2022 Reviewing waste-related terms and definitions across a wide range of external standards and legislation governing corporate impact reporting and product marketing claims in our industry and across other industries\n\u2022 Reviewing the boundaries of our waste accounting system to begin preparing for the multi-year process of developing 2030 targets\n\u2022 Updating our internal Scrap Material Guide\n\nOur objective is to continuously improve our foundation for measuring and communicating what matters in a way that accurately characterizes reality, is credible and trustworthy, enables NIKE to understand and take appropriate responsibility for the impacts associated with making our products, and is meaningful to stakeholders.\nKey packaging highlights from FY21 include:\n\n- NIKE has initiated a project to introduce two new sizes of shoeboxes used, improving the fit of the shoes within the carton. We utilized over 27 million of the improved fit shoe cartons in FY21, resulting in a reduction of 735,000 kg of corrugate waste shipped from suppliers in the first year of the transition. NIKE is also reducing the amount of toe stuffing used in our shoes and, in FY21, removed 2,232,176 kg of toe stuffing material from our packaging.\n\n- NIKE is also reducing the weight of the shipping cartons utilized to ship product globally from footwear suppliers by 24%. In FY21, lighter weight footwear cartons reduced the shipping carton weight by 770,000 kg in the first year of the transition.\n\n- As a signatory to The Fashion Pact, NIKE is also working to eliminate single-use plastics in our packaging by 2030. By December 2021, we had successfully eliminated plastic shoppers in our retail stores. We are teaming with other industry leaders to research options to replace apparel polybags with a more sustainable, non-plastic alternative. We are also working to eliminate plastic packaging for our digital shipments with a paper alternative and are making great progress across our geographies, with our European Logistics Campus 100% converted.\n\n- We are phasing out all dunnage (both plastic and paper) in our distribution centers for the majority of our products. Dunnage is the filler material intended to protect the product from damage in transit. At the end of FY21, 84% of our distribution centers used zero dunnage.\n\nDistribution Centers\n\nCorrugated cardboard continues to be the key waste stream for disposed waste at our distribution centers. When customers order a variety of products or place orders of smaller quantities than factory case sizes, distribution centers must remove factory shipments from inbound corrugated cardboard cartons and repack them as customized orders \u2013 which inherently creates more waste. As online sales have grown, we expected corrugated cardboard waste to similarly increase due to needing to repack factory case sizes to smaller e-commerce order sizes, but it did not.\n\nOne impact of online consumer sales is that it can lead to increased corrugated cardboard waste when you have to repack factory case sizes to smaller e-commerce order sizes. As a way to mitigate the effects of increased online e-commerce sales, we looked to our other product flows fulfilled in our distribution centers, which include brick-and-mortar shipments to NIKE Direct stores and wholesalers' distribution centers.\nand stores. We encouraged our wholesalers to order full-case factory quantities, which minimized the need to rehandle and repack for our wholesale volume. This compensated for the effects we saw from the growth of online sales.\n\nAt our European Logistics Campus, we moved toward 100% plastic-free digital deliveries, and all shipping boxes for Digital are now 100% recycled content. This was the next evolution in digital packaging improvement after a 50% reduction in our total outbound digital packaging versus the original design we offered two years ago.\n\n**Headquarters**\n\nAt our headquarters (HQs) globally, we continue to focus first on eliminating and then diverting waste from our operations, with the ultimate goal of achieving zero waste. Onsite food, catering services and custodial services create the most waste at our headquarter campuses. We are tackling these sources through several initiatives: adopting reusable or recyclable items for food services, custodial services and employee events, tailoring food production to demand and creating awareness through employee education.\nIn FY21, waste per occupant at HQs was down 52% compared to FY20. This significant reduction is temporary and primarily driven by office space closures due to the pandemic. Over the last year, our team has made significant progress on permanent initiatives to reduce waste.\n\nOur Food Services began piloting reusable containers for our Grab\u2019n Go service offerings in preparation of return-to-work activities, and began developing a zero waste break room, eliminating many of the single-use items.\n\nAt our Converse HQ, the team started a reuse-the-box program in response to the increase in shipping of product samples due to the pandemic. This program has dramatically reduced the need for new boxes.\n\nIn GCHQ, we continue to create awareness through employee education and the promotion of relevant initiatives, moving toward achieving zero waste. In FY21, an additional 1,054 GCHQ athletes participated in the Bring Your Own Box/Cup program while 1,737 employees responded to the call of the Clear Your Plate Campaign to reduce food waste. In April 2021, GCHQ canteens officially replaced all paper promotional materials with electronic screen displays, as well as implemented utensils made with recycled materials.\n\nAt WHQ, our custodial team reviewed many service items focusing on what could be switched from single-use to refillable containers or reusable. Our team was able to implement a number of items to reduce waste.\n\nDue to the pandemic, we have paused some of this global work but will resume as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cClimate change is very real. You don\u2019t have to be an expert, but I think it\u2019s important for us to work together to make change happen. As athletes who love what we do, we won\u2019t be able to share that love for sport if there\u2019s no place to play.\u201d\n\nChloe Kim, Snowboarder\nQuantitative Target\n\n100% waste diverted from landfill in our extended supply chain with at least 80% recycled back into NIKE products and other goods\n\nIn FY21, strategic suppliers diverted 99.7% of waste from landfill, including achieving 100% landfill diversion from footwear manufacturing. In addition, we saw greater than 90% diversion across our distribution centers and NIKE owned and operated manufacturing facilities (Air MI).\n\nWe achieved our manufacturing (i.e., combined Tier 1 footwear/apparel) open-loop recycling annual milestone through increased local downcycling and Nike Grind customer demand. The delta between diversion and recycling rates is primarily due to challenges in recycling mixed materials (e.g., synthetic leather, textile blends, laminated materials) and leather. As a result, these materials are sent to energy recovery.\n\nWaste Diversion\n\nFootwear\nIn FY21, 100% of NIKE\u2019s manufacturing scraps at footwear suppliers were diverted from landfills through increased recycling and maintaining sufficient energy recovery\\(^{48}\\) capacity for non-recycled waste. Approximately 7% of the waste that was generated was recycled through NIKE\u2019s closed-loop recycling programs, 43% was recycled into other companies\u2019 products or locally downcycled, and 49% went to energy recovery.\n\nApparel\nWe also exceeded the FY21 diversion target of 95% for strategic apparel suppliers. Strategic apparel suppliers were able to increase diversion rates by expanding open-loop (external) recycling and maintaining sufficient energy recovery capacity for non-recycled waste. FY21 was the first full year for NIKE Apparel suppliers to participate in the waste minimum program and for this data to be used for tracking and planning closed-loop recycling strategies. The waste minimum program provides a playbook, coaching and support for suppliers.\n\n\\(^{48}\\) Energy recovery is a process in which all or a part of solid waste is processed to use the heat content, or other forms of energy, of or from the material.\nto set up basic waste programs. By implementing this program, factories establish a foundation for accurate and consistent reporting of key performance indicators (KPIs). It also creates an opportunity to reduce costs associated with waste disposal and increase revenue from the sale of waste resources. The waste minimum program enables suppliers to continuously improve efficiency and reduce risks associated with management of waste.\n\n**Distribution Centers**\n\nIn North America, we launched a Drive to 100% Food Waste Diversion program in Memphis, the first of its kind to minimize and divert food and food-associated waste from the cafeterias of our distribution centers in the region. By including sustainability requirements in procuring our food vendor for these facilities, we signaled the strategic imperative of starting this initiative and found a dedicated vendor. We identified a composting vendor and supported its efforts to enter the region, and brought together six vendors to create and implement the program. The vendors included: ISS Guckenheimer (food services), Atlas Organics and Compost Fairy (composting), Vegware (product replacement), and SBM (Janitorial and Sustainability Team) and Immaculate Facility Services (janitorial). This work included product replacement, back-of-house food prep optimization, and employee training and education.\n\nIn July 2020, North America Supply Chain launched the first Mid-South composting and food donation program. In FY21, this employee-facing program resulted in 1,500 pounds of food donations to area nonprofits and 68,000 pounds of food waste composted. In addition, we came full circle and used the compost created for our facility flowerbeds.\n\n**Air MI**\n\nAir Manufacturing Innovation (Air MI) has a long history of recycling airsole manufacturing scraps back into new products within our manufacturing operations. We have now implemented this practice in our foam production business as well. During FY21, our team tested and scaled the ability to capture and recycle foam scrap from line startup and shutdown, and batch quality testing, into new foam pellet product. Over the course of the year, more than 50% of production scrap was captured and recycled in-house into new batches of product. Additionally, the team worked to reduce the overall scrap rate per unit of foam material produced.\nHeadquarters\nAt our workplaces globally, our waste focus areas are:\n\n\u2022 Employee education on proper waste disposal to decrease contamination rates and maximize proper collection of compost and recyclables\n\n\u2022 Continued progress on eliminating food packaging and other hard-to-recycle consumables\n\n\u2022 Creating relationships with third-party vendors to increase donations to the community and manage hard-to-recycle items that cannot be processed by our local/city waste municipalities\n\n\u2022 Continue to develop opportunities to utilize and reuse NIKE waste and other waste streams in the construction of NIKE workplaces\n\nWe have expanded our diversion efforts, ensuring that landscape debris, office supplies and furniture from moves, pallets and construction debris are diverted from landfill. We have also been able to increase annual product, furniture and office supplies donations through spring cleaning events to clear out items that accumulated in our offices. In FY21, globally, we saw great gains in landfill diversion, from 56% in FY20 to 69% in FY21. We launched a cross-functional waste task force across our service lines and a more stringent data collection process that has driven focus and progress on initiatives.\n\nMajor achievements in waste diversion for FY21 are:\n\n\u2022 Our teams across the globe stepped up donation efforts, building new engagements to increase the amount of furniture, fixtures and equipment that could be donated vs. landfilled or downcycled. Our WHQ team partnered with The Van and began selling excess office furniture and our EHQ team launched a borrow-an-office-chair program to support work-from-home activities.\n\n\u2022 Instead of buying new, at WHQ, we continue to increase our workplace furniture reuse program. We reused roughly 4,100 pieces in FY21 alone.\n\n\u2022 At WHQ, we launched a glove recycling program working with TerraCycle, and in one year, our team diverted more than 250,000 individual gloves from landfill. The glove recycling program is strongly supported by staff and is a tangible, everyday way for our team to be engaged in the Move to Zero. Based on this success, we have expanded the program to collect and divert more food service and custodial gloves with the ambition to capture and divert all single-use gloves in our operations.\nAt our Greater China HQ, the team has developed a \u201cShoe to Workplace\u201d program where excess NIKE fabrics, and old employee shoes, are collected and remade into furnishings/construction materials for the workplace. This program is being leveraged for our campus expansion in China.\n\nOpen-Loop Recycling\n\nA higher-than-expected total waste footprint for FY21 put increased pressure on achieving the open-loop recycling target, as it increased the volume of waste required to be recycled. As a result, open-loop recycling came in 0.8% under target.\n\nWe recycled just over 55% of NIKE\u2019s manufacturing scrap across footwear and apparel, with increased demand from local recycling markets and global Nike Grind customers. Recycling markets continue to be stronger for apparel than for footwear materials.\n\nNike Grind\n\nFor nearly three decades, the Nike Grind program has been at the cutting edge of developing circular waste systems to reuse and recycle material waste from our footwear and apparel supply chain, helping keep it away from landfills and incineration.\n\nSome Nike Grind highlights in FY21:\n\n- The Home Depot began carrying TrafficMaster interlocking gym tiles made with at least 75% recycled rubber including at least 37% Nike Grind. Over 750,000 pounds of rubber waste were recycled through this product.\n\n- A skateboard griptape made with 33% Nike Grind rubber recycled from footwear manufacturing scrap launched for sale online and in select skate shops. The griptape is manufactured and sold by Jessup, the official griptape sponsor of USA Skateboarding for the Tokyo Olympics.\n\n- In collaboration with Lyft and the Portland Bureau of Transportation, Lyft developed and began installing ebike and scooter docking e-stations featuring at least 25% Nike Grind rubber in the top layer of the mats. The docking mats with Nike Grind were piloted in Portland and have since expanded to ebike stations in Denver and Chicago.\n\n---\n\n49 Open-Loop Recycling is defined as recycling of our FW waste by third parties into other products.\n\u2022 In FY21, we began supplying Nike Grind to Hero Flooring, a U.S.-based flooring company. Hero Flooring uses post-consumer Nike Grind rubber from ground-up end-of-life sneakers to develop rubber flooring. The flooring has been installed in NIKE retail stores, office spaces and beyond.\n\n\u2022 The Nike Grind program was named as a top three finalist out of 86 applicants for Gartner\u2019s 2021 Power of the Professions Award for Social Impact in recognition of our cutting-edge circular supply chain.\n\nIn Q4 of FY21, global supply chains faced container shortages, particularly from shipments originating in Asia. As a result, shipments of Nike Grind materials to global recyclers were often delayed.\n\n### Nike Grind Footwear\n\n| Waste Source | Disposal Method | FY20 | FY21 |\n|--------------|-----------------|------|------|\n| Post-Industrial (Factory Scrap) | Recycled into NIKE Products and Recycled by Global Open Loop Customers | 46,220 | 50,569 |\n| Post-Consumer + Unsellables50 (Consumer Shoes + NIKE Samples and Defectives) | Recycled by Global Open Loop Customers | 79 | 170 |\n| Total footwear materials recycled | Energy (MWh) | 46,299 | 50,739 |\n\n### Closed-Loop Recycling51\n\nIn apparel, connections between Tier 1 product and Tier 3 recyclers/yarn suppliers are being made by a cross-functional team, prioritizing the diversion of 100% polyester textile waste to emerging chemical recycling suppliers. Availability of polyester chemical recycling suppliers (needed to recycle textiles into high-quality feedstock) has yet to scale in most of our key manufacturing countries though. Progress will be gradual until these programs are in place for future products.\n\nRecycling 100% cotton and cotton-blended textile waste (which makes up the bulk of the scrap) is dependent on recycled cotton-containing materials being developed. This work is being coordinated across cotton fabric suppliers and is challenging due to different capabilities and technologies used between them. Closed-loop cotton waste recycling rates will remain the same until seasonal materials strategies are developed and catch up with supply. Due to polyester\u2019s carbon impact and availability of recycled yarns and fabrics, NIKE Apparel has prioritized recycled polyester in the near term.\n\n50 Unsellables: Primarily include samples, defects and returns. Results do not account for Nike Grind footwear waste data from China, which includes unsellables only.\n51 Closed-loop recycling, meaning how much of our own waste goes back into our own products.\nFootwear\nNIKE Footwear\u2019s goal is to shift our existing waste streams back into our product via closed-loop recycling. We currently have a robust system for recycling rubber back into outsoles and continue to expand this while also developing new innovations that will allow us to reach our goal of 10% recycled rubber.\n\nNIKE has also developed methods for recycling EVA back into our foam midsoles. This was piloted with select suppliers in Vietnam over the last year. While COVID-19-related supplier shutdowns slowed the initial expansion of this initiative, production has ramped up and closed-loop EVA recycling is growing.\n\nWe continue to conduct research and development, working with material innovation vendors to find solutions for harder-to-recycle materials like leather. With new recycling unlocks, including the ability to sort materials by type and color, we can significantly expand NIKE\u2019s use of waste materials back into our product.\n\nMore Data\nWaste Table\n\nQuantitative Target\n\n10x the amount of finished product waste refurbished, recycled or donated\n\nA product end-of-life is the biggest contributor to NIKE\u2019s waste footprint. This target reflects the efforts NIKE is taking to create a holistic, systems-approach to finished product waste and to create circularity, enabling NIKE to build the back-end operating model required. We create products with the intent to design out waste, avoid negative environmental impact, use material components that extend the product\u2019s life and consider how it can be returned to the fashion system as valuable feedstock. We want to create a consumer experience that empowers consumers to extend product life and reduce waste.\n\nOur desired state will maximize refurbishment, donation and recycling to avoid landfill and waste. NIKE is working to create an integrated end-to-end process to resell, donate and recycle finished product waste based on its condition and business rules, extending the life of a product while ensuring it flows to its highest use.\nOur guiding principles are:\n\n- Not to collect as much finished product waste as we can, but to maximize value, extend product life, and prevent product from landfill and incineration\n- Positively contribute to our 2025 sustainability targets\n- Deliver innovative and creative solutions that drive long-term business value\n- Create a great consumer experience\n- Be authentic and transparent\n- Maximize local infrastructure\n\nFY21 was a pivotal year in our journey. After multiple years of research, incubation and piloting, North America publicly launched NIKE Refurbished, the first NIKE-owned external sales channel for refurbished product. This channel is powered by an in-house refurbishment operation that receives NIKE inventory previously thought to be unsellable, refurbishes and grades it, and finds the best channel to extend its useful life. These channels include donation through Social and Community Impact partnerships and Nike Grind for inventory no longer in sellable or donatable condition. Publicly launched in March 2021, by the end of FY21, NIKE Refurbished was live in 15 NIKE United stores in the U.S. with aggressive scale plans slated for FY22.\n\nIn June 2021, we launched key services across our geographies to tackle finished product waste, including a new takeback program called RAD (Recycle and Donation). This was a proof of concept in 22 stores across EMEA to takeback both end-of-life footwear and apparel product, working with recycling and donation vendors in the geographies to make the most of end-of-life waste. We are testing and learning with partners such as Soles4Souls, Wolkat, Really/Kvadrat and DenimX.\n\nGreater China launched its first Reuse-A-Shoe program that recycles old shoes from consumers in China and converts them into Nike Grind material. This program was launched on our digital platform and in 65 NIKE store partner doors in Wuhan. From shoes collected from Chinese consumers and processed by Nike Grind technology, Wuhan Biyun primary school students, who experienced the pandemic, received two brand-new Nike Grind courts.\nWhen we actively look for opportunities that connect our zero waste target with our Made to Play commitment to get kids moving, great things can happen. In FY21, through our partnerships with organizations like Delivering Good, Good Sports, Good360 and Soles4Souls, we were able to donate 1.2 million products to schools and community organizations. At twice the number we donated in the previous year, these products, which would have otherwise been recycled or destroyed, benefit the community and help remove some of the barriers that youth face when it comes to accessing and benefitting from play and sport.\n\nThe challenges we saw in FY21 were finding customers for recycling end material (specifically FPW Grind). We must continue exploring innovative use way to build consumer demand, and explore technology to advance circular business models and scale refurbishment plans.\n\n### 10x Finished Product Waste\n\n|                | FY20 Baseline | Refurb | Recycle | Donate |\n|----------------|---------------|--------|---------|--------|\n| FY21 Progress  | 1,277,703     | +128,920 | +328,274 | +612,679 |\n| +91%           |               |        |         |        |\n\nFY21 NIKE, Inc. Impact Report\nFocus Area\n\nWATER\n\nQuantitative Target\n\n25% reduction in freshwater usage (L per kg) in textile dyeing and finishing\n\nFor the past decade, the World Economic Forum (WEF) has listed water crises and impacts from climate change among the top five global risks. This is important for NIKE because our supply chain spans the globe and the impacts of an otherwise local water issue, such as a drought or flood, can ripple across the supply chain and affect the consumer.\n\nFreshwater Reduction\n\nWe continue to execute against the strategy we developed in FY15\u2013FY16, which has proven effective as demonstrated by significantly exceeding our FY20 freshwater reduction target.\n\nThis strategy has three components:\n\n\u2022 **Create Awareness** among suppliers that water crises are real, and it\u2019s necessary to reduce our dependence on freshwater.\n\n\u2022 **Drive Commitment** from suppliers to do their part to reduce their freshwater use. We collaborated with suppliers to establish freshwater reduction targets that will help us reach our 2025 target.\n\n\u2022 **Build Capability** among suppliers so they are executing their freshwater reduction targets using generally accepted best practices for water management and wastewater treatment. The indications are that training and adoption of best practices are not consistent or robust. As a result, in FY21, we put special emphasis on training and capability building.\n\nWe ended FY21 with a 6.7% freshwater reduction from our FY20 baseline. That is more than a quarter of the way to our 2025 target with four years to go.\nThe Ningbo Shenzhou Knitting Company, Ltd., reduced its freshwater use in FY21 by 13.9% (FY16\u2013FY20: 39%); and its sister facility \u2013 Gain Lucky \u2013 in Vietnam reduced its use by 8.6% (FY16\u2013FY20: 9.7%). Shenzhou Group achieved its progress primarily through investments in low-liquor dyeing equipment and manufacturing efficiencies. In addition, the Far Eastern Group\u2019s Vietnam facility delivered a 9.79% reduction by focusing on wastewater recycling using one of the largest textile wastewater recycling systems in all of Vietnam. These three facilities represent approximately 35% of the materials production for the in-scope suppliers for our 2025 water reduction target. Since FY15, the number of wastewater recycling installations has continued to increase to the point where wastewater recycling is a standard feature of any new construction by suppliers.\n\nSpotlight\n\nBrave Blue World Foundation\n\nIn FY21, the NIKE water program was recognized by the Brave Blue World Foundation as a global leader and industry role model for driving water sustainability in the footwear/apparel supply chain. Specifically, through collaboration and engagement, sportswear multinational NIKE has encouraged its suppliers to explore ways of reducing water used in their manufacturing processes. This has enabled textile and apparel supplier Vertical Knits to introduce innovative water recycling and manufacturing process improvements at its site in Yucat\u00e1n, Mexico, reducing freshwater use by 85% per kg of fabric. It has also achieved a 50% reduction in energy savings. The project will significantly reduce NIKE\u2019s overall water footprint, as well as the ease the impact on supplies at a local level.\nWastewater Compliance and Capability Building\n\nAs mentioned in previous reports, full compliance to the ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines by suppliers has been one of our greatest water-related challenges. We are making significant progress. In FY20, 69% of focus suppliers (24 facilities) fully complied with the ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines; and in FY21, 74% of compliance list suppliers and finished goods suppliers (104 facilities) demonstrated full compliance. Whereas suppliers have made excellent progress in removing manufacturer restricted substance list (MRSL) chemistries from their manufacturing, many suppliers find challenges with achieving the ZDHC foundational limits for the conventional parameters that are always present in wastewater.\n\nCapability building is a key unlock for suppliers that treat their wastewater. In FY20, we assumed a leadership role to define \u201ccapable\u201d through the development of the ZDHC\u2019s Wastewater Treatment System Operator Minimum Qualifications Guidelines; and NIKE became the first ZDHC brand to commit to adopting this guideline, which takes effect on January 1, 2024. In FY21, we started training suppliers. We collaborated with DuPont Water Solutions to provide four 8-hour, online training sessions on ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis. Two sessions were held in English, one in Mandarin and one in Vietnamese in two-hour blocks over a month. Over 300 water and wastewater operators and engineers in the Greater China, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia attended the full eight hours. In addition, we also collaborated with Greeley and Hansen, a Chicago-based engineering firm, to provide eight hours of wastewater operations and troubleshooting training over a month in Spanish to approximately 50 wastewater and operators at suppliers in North, Central and South America.\n\nExternal Engagements\n\nCEO Water Mandate: Our commitment to water stewardship, exemplified by joining the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and reporting annually on progress.\n\n| Water (million liters) | FY20 | FY21 |\n|------------------------|------|------|\n| Textile Dyeing and Finishing |      |      |\n| Municipal/City Water to Facility | 13,277.6 | 13,067.5 |\n| Ground Water | 4,804.5 | 4,391.4 |\n| Surface Water | 2,102.4 | 1,466.9 |\n| Rainwater Collection | 34.5 | 16.5 |\n| Condensate Use | 390.6 | 395.7 |\n| Total Freshwater Use | 20,609.5 | 19,338.0 |\n\n52 Includes focus suppliers only. Focus suppliers represent key suppliers involved in the dyeing and/or finishing of materials, which directly support footwear and apparel finished product assembly.\nIn recognition of World Water Day on March 22, 2021, we gave strategic suppliers around the world nearly 200 copies of the Water Environment Federation Wastewater Treatment Fundamentals training manual in English, Mandarin, Vietnamese and Spanish. In FY20, NIKE sponsored the Mandarin translation of this 700-page training manual.\n\nAs January 1, 2024 approaches, we remain active with the ZDHC Foundation, training providers and other external stakeholders to enable the right infrastructure is in place to train and test the wastewater treatment operators in all parts of the world so they can meet the expectations of this new guideline.\nSpotlight\n\nMicroparticles and Microplastics Research at NIKE\n\nMicroparticles and microplastics have been an emerging issue in the footwear and apparel industry in recent years. NIKE joined The Microfibre Consortium (TMC) and has assumed a leadership position in the development of the TMC Guideline to control microfibers and microparticles in textile wastewater. In conjunction with this guideline, NIKE has invested in research to examine how to measure and control microparticles in textile wastewater. Current approaches do not measure smaller particles, are highly prone to contamination and lack standardization.\n\nIn FY21, not only did we help to identify a commercially available method to measure microparticles down to two microns, but we validated a method to capture and help prevent the discharge of those microparticles into the environment through textile wastewater by using ultrafiltration. This is the same ultrafiltration as one of the two fundamental building blocks to a textile wastewater recycling system. We look forward to sharing more as we make progress on this crucial issue.\n\n\u201cThe Earth is our one and only playground. What happens when climate change makes our playground unsafe to play in? It\u2019s women, youth and underrepresented groups who will suffer first until everyone suffers from it. We don\u2019t need an environmental catastrophe to realize our playground is in danger.\u201d\n\nAda Hegerberg, Global football athlete\nQuantitative Target\n\n13 billion liters restored through a portfolio of projects that support long-term resilience for water-stressed ecosystems and communities within our extended cotton supply chain\n\nAs the global climate changes and creates localized shifts in precipitation patterns, impacts to water availability and quality are critical to consider. Many of the regions that NIKE supplies cotton from face one or more water stressors, including periods of drought and water scarcity, heightened storm severity and flood events, and increased levels of water pollution. By focusing on projects that support the long-term sustainability of water sources and promote improvements to water quality, NIKE not only supports the resilience of our cotton supply chain but also the communities that grow it. These communities include the farmers and surrounding populations that rely on safe water availability, as well as the organisms in the local ecosystems that share those water resources.\n\nIn order to achieve this target, NIKE is establishing a portfolio of projects located specifically in the water basins that suppliers source cotton from. The project portfolio centers on three primary focus areas: water restoration and protection, water for productive use and water access.\n\nIn FY21, NIKE completed two water restoration projects in Australia and India. In Australia, NIKE supported the legal establishment and registration of a covenant that enables conservation management in perpetuity of 84,000 hectares of land in the Murray-Darling basin. This project will allow regeneration of the land to a more natural state and prevent future commercial development. With this land use change, the region will see improved water quality through decreased sediment and nutrient loading, as well as increased water quantity through reduced runoff volumes and higher rates of absorption.\n\nIn India, NIKE supported conversion of 30 hectares of farmland to drip irrigation practices in Maharashtra, engaging 75 farmers (17 of whom were women) in the project activities. Shifting to the use of this precision irrigation method will help conserve water through increased efficiency in the drought-prone district.\n\n53 This metric is based on more than $550,000 in funding from NIKE which is part of Management\u2019s Assertion on select sustainability metrics, for which has performed limited assurance over the cumulative funding since inception through May 31, 2021, as indicated in the Report of Independent Accountants.\nAlthough NIKE\u2019s project partners were forced to cancel plans to continue project work for a second year in India due to reprioritization of resources for COVID-19, additional work toward the target continued. While wrapping up the aforementioned projects, NIKE also laid the groundwork for future projects to begin in FY22 that will bolster existing efforts in Australia and expand our project portfolio to additional priority communities in our extended cotton supply chain.\n\nWork highlights included making substantial strides toward achievement of the target, engagement and empowerment of indigenous communities and women, and improvement to the biodiversity of the local ecosystems within the Murray-Darling basin.\n\nOne of the main challenges we faced was the cancellation of a second year of work in India due to the COVID-19 pandemic and reprioritization of funds, requiring us to instead look for alternative options for project opportunities.\n\n| Water restored (L) | FY20 | FY21 |\n|--------------------|------|------|\n| Australia          | 650M | 2.05B|\n| India              | 0    | 11.7M|\n| Total              | 650M | 2.06B|\n\nNiagara River tributary \u2013 Buffalo, NY\n\nMarcus Rosten, Environmental educator\nFocus Area\n\nCHEMISTRY\n\nQuantitative Target\n\nAdopt clean chemistry alternatives for our 10 priority chemistries across our supply chain\n\nChemistry provides the foundation of our materials and products. From raw-material processing to product creation to new methods of make, chemistry lets us innovate and influence design, performance and sustainability throughout the value chain. Every NIKE product and initiative leverages chemistry. NIKE\u2019s industry-leading approach to the use of chemistry has elevated product performance and shaped manufacturing while reducing the use and impact of hazardous substances.\n\nBecause chemistry is essential in all materials and products, it is also essential that we take a responsible, proactive role in managing our chemical footprint. Selecting and creating cleaner chemistry materials leads to benefits in our health, our planet and our future. Integrating cleaner chemistry into NIKE products supports circularity by avoiding hazardous substances, supporting material reuse for years to come.\n\nOur cleaner chemistry work begins with our foundational requirements set forth in the Code, requiring all suppliers to properly manage chemistry and create approaches to meet our Restricted Substances List (RSL) and MRSL requirements. Publishing our first RSL over 20 years ago, we launched our Chemistry Playbook in 2018, updating it annually with the latest information on RSL, MRSL and chemicals management information.\n\nIn FY21, we met the foundational expectation that our products will meet our own RSL guideline, with no chemical issues identified in finished goods that exceeded these limits. More than 98% of our materials passed RSL testing upstream, with the remaining 2% improved before use in production.\nIt is imperative that we have transparency into the chemicals used to create our materials and products. We call this chemical visibility, and we are scaling industry tools to capture supplier inventory conformance to the ZDHC MRSL. We continue to expand the scope of our MRSL conformity program year on year across the majority of our materials production. While this approach will not give us complete information on every substance in use today, it helps ensure that any MRSL listed substance is banned from intentional use. This is another step on the journey toward realizing full chemical traceability and visibility.\n\nIndustry alignment remains the key to success for our compliance focused work across a shared supply chain. We continue to support and drive development of transparent guidelines, tools and training programs within our industry through collective action work in groups such as the Apparel and Footwear International RSL Management (AFIRM) Group and the ZDHC Foundation.\n\nThe successful scaling of these transparent guidelines supports suppliers by reducing conflicting requirements and offering capability improvements where needed. Together, these programs continue to accelerate us toward realizing the vision of zero discharge of hazardous chemicals.\nWe also have an opportunity to move beyond compliance and accelerate the adoption of cleaner, more sustainable chemistry that moves us closer to the vision of responsible and circular design and manufacturing. We will continue to use chemistry to create innovations that support athletes while we move toward smarter, greener chemistry inputs.\n\nOur assessment process for new chemistries provides a consistent measure that can be used across a variety of chemistry types. Our process has been in place since early 2018, and we\u2019ve found it to be a valuable tool for enabling new chemistries support NIKE\u2019s sustainability goals. As part of the assessment, chemistries new to NIKE are evaluated against the same criteria, covering a range of attributes. For example, it checks if they are regulated in any regions where we sell products or if the formulation contains any chemistries of concern. Based on performance against each attribute, the assessment provides a score that can be used to compare formulations. The process is also adaptable so when we identify new attributes or proposed regulations we can quickly determine if any of the chemicals we\u2019ve evaluated previously present a risk to the brand from their use.\n\nAdoption of Clean Chemistry Alternatives\n\n| FY21 | FY22 | FY23 | FY24 | FY25 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) | Dimethylformamide (DMFa) | DCP (dicumyl peroxide) | Zinc Pyrithione | Nonyl phenol ethoxylates (NPEOs) |\n| Formamide | Organic Solvents (VOCs) | Bisphenols | Fomaldehyde | Neoprene |\n\n54 Approximate timeline for when clean chemistry alternatives are estimated to be adopted. Timeline represents point in time, not full year or trailing 12-month view.\nWe created a list of 10 priority chemistries where we have a target to go beyond our baseline compliance obligations. These priority chemistries continue our journey toward cleaner chemistry, solving specific challenges that we have uncovered, and helping us advance safer materials flowing into and through a circular economy.\n\nWe believe that our success in meeting our chemistry compliance goals gives us the opportunity to work toward our ultimate vision of more sustainable chemistry and zero discharge of hazardous chemicals.\n\nSeveral of the 10 priority chemistries are not currently covered by any compliance obligations. However, because of quickly changing regulatory landscapes and our commitment to sustainability, we\u2019ve decided to identify and adopt cleaner chemistry alternatives to replace them, hopefully setting an example.\n\nOne example is bisphenols in receipt paper. While bisphenol A has been restricted from use in many regions, often its replacement is another bisphenol that isn\u2019t regulated yet. With this target, we aim to stop using any bisphenols in receipt paper and use a more sustainable alternative.\n\nDMFa is regulated and on the RSL but the regulated limit does not disallow for its use. We decided that we needed to not just meet the RSL limits but work with material suppliers to eliminate DMFa completely from synthetic leather production.\n\nZinc pyrthione is used for odor management in textiles. It is not currently regulated but information about its potential impacts leads us to reevaluate our use. Based on the new data, we have a target to remove zinc pyrthione from our supply chain by 2025.\n\nAdopting these cleaner chemistry alternatives is NIKE\u2019s 2025 chemistry target. For substances such as formaldehyde and NPEO, which have been restricted on the RSL for years, our targets are for specific areas where risks still exist for their use, including in recycled content streams.\n\nFor the majority of our 10 priority chemistries, the focus in FY21 was on establishing multi-year plans to achieve targets by 2025. We expect to see measurable progress toward these targets in FY22 and beyond.\nIn FY21, we drove substantial progress in our PFC phase out. Since 2015, the use of any C8-based fluorinated chemicals has been banned in our products. In 2017, we set a target to eliminate all PFC-based finishes from our product line. We\u2019re doing this without sacrificing our high durability, performance standards or aesthetics. We made significant progress in our goal as we approached our target to eliminate PFC-based finishes by the end of the 2021.\n\nWe focused on the most challenging material types and designs to enable us to achieve our target on schedule. Removing PFC-based finishes, especially in high-performance materials, requires product-by-product optimization and involves teams across the product creation process.\n\nThroughout our phaseout, we have made a point of completing a toxicology assessment on all PFC alternatives to help enable better chemistry to be substituted into the supply chain. Our continued success and progress toward our goal of 100% PFC-free durable water repellents was made possible by close collaboration with material and chemical suppliers.\n\n**Highlights and Challenges**\n\n- **Solvents:** Our work to reduce the use of solvents in footwear manufacturing has been in progress for more than 20 years. Between 1995 and 2014, NIKE reduced solvent use by 96% per pair of shoes through the adoption of water-based adhesives. But we know there is still opportunity for improvement. FY21 was a year of looking for opportunities to meet our 10% reduction target by reviewing models, production numbers and solvent fractions in key areas where we use solvents, including in inks and paints applied to footwear. Lacking an industry approach with tools to monitor and calculate volatile organic compound (VOC) reduction, we are building the tools to collect further information. Once these tools are available, we can leverage them in other areas.\n\n- **NPEO-free recycling processes:** While critical to advancing circularity, the use and reuse of materials from outside our typical supply chain presents challenges for ensuring chemical constituents in the product. As we consider new and different recycled or upcycled material streams, we face new challenges in ensuring these materials meet our extensive chemical guidelines. Each input stream, whether it is from our industry, from other industries, or pre- or post-consumer items, creates distinct challenges for brands to manage. Ensuring post-consumer materials are processed and prepared in a way that\n\n---\n\n55 Our PFC phase out includes all per- and poly-fluorinated (PFAS)-based finishes.\nwill not add in restricted substances is the basis of one of our top 10 priority chemistries in ensuring an NPEO-free recycling process. The lessons learned and systems developed to achieve this target will provide a roadmap for addressing similar challenges with other legacy chemicals that add complexity to circularity.\n\n- **Unintended consequences:** Addressing our 10 priority chemistries is just one piece of our overall sustainable chemistry journey. We are also working to enable the cleaner chemistry alternatives we champion, and any new materials used in product will not become problematic in the future through our chemistry assessments. Our chemistry experts go beyond simple hazard identification when evaluating chemicals. We compare chemistry options at many steps along the way, where we collaborate with designers, chemists, engineers, safety professionals and more.\n\nAll of this work is required to make the right chemistry selection for NIKE, our athletes* and the planet. This drives our sought-after adoption of cleaner, more efficient, better chemistry. We anticipate that our 2025 target will not just change the course of NIKE\u2019s chemistry journey but influence the sustainable growth of our whole industry.\nOUR APPROACH\nAbout This Report\n\nThis NIKE Impact Report represents the first year of performance against our 2025 Purpose targets.

The Board oversees our purpose work primarily through the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee (CRS&G Committee). As specified in its charter, the CRS&G Committee reviews and provides guidance with respect to NIKE\u2019s corporate purpose, including corporate responsibility, sustainability, human rights, global community and social impact, and workplace diversity and inclusion.\n\nThe CRS&G Committee oversees both the risks and the opportunities associated with purpose. Specifically, this includes reviewing significant purpose strategies, activities, policies, investments and programs; monitoring the development of, and progress toward, our Purpose targets; and providing guidance regarding purpose reporting.\n\nTo carry out its responsibilities, the CRS&G Committee receives regular updates from management regarding our purpose work, including:\n\n\u2022 At each regularly scheduled CRS&G Committee meeting, progress reports regarding the 2025 targets\n\u2022 Biannual presentations on each of the three purpose pillars \u2013 people, planet and play \u2013 from the respective management leader\n\u2022 Annual presentations on purpose strategy and reporting\n\nAt each Board meeting, the CRS&G Committee reports to the Board on purpose highlights and key developments. The Compensation Committee also plays a significant role in the People pillar by overseeing talent management and development for executive officers and senior management, including with respect to employee engagement and workplace diversity and inclusion.\nPurpose Management\nPurpose leadership begins with our Chief Executive Officer and Executive Leadership Team, who set the tone and ensure it is integrated into NIKE\u2019s business strategy. Cross-functional teams support this integrated approach while dedicated functional leadership drives the day-to-day work.\n\nRisk Management\nNIKE Global Risk Management (GRM) is an independent and objective audit and risk organization that is guided by a philosophy of enhancing and protecting NIKE, Inc.\u2019s value and brand through world-class risk management capabilities. It assists NIKE, Inc. in accomplishing its objectives by partnering with management to build and maintain effective risk management, control and governance processes. NIKE GRM reports administratively to the Chief Financial Officer and functionally to the Audit & Finance Committee.\n\nGRM identifies and evaluates risks to NIKE, Inc., including those related to purpose, as part of its risk assessment process. This process then informs GRM\u2019s audit and risk plan and how GRM deploys risk management services across NIKE, Inc. Regular risk updates and insights are provided to management and the Audit & Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.\nData Tables\n\nPeople\\textsuperscript{58,59}\n\n58 For all people targets we restate immaterial historical data where data changes due to retroactive actions.

Impact Report publication.\n\n73 Data is collected based on U.S. legal reporting requirements, reporting on all NIKE\u2019s operations except retail, which is excluded from OSHA recordkeeping requirements. Retail will be included in future reports.\n\n74 Continual process improvements in our distribution centers have allowed us to have a reduction in our year-over-year TCIR.\n\n75 The industry average comes from the United States Department of Labor; Bureau of Labor Statistics. Each industry classification (such as DC, Air Manufacturing Innovation (Air MI), Offices, Footwear Manufacturing, Apparel Manufacturing) reports a separate average for recordable injuries and lost time rates (which are captured).\n\n76 A surge in product demand in a tight labor market is the primary driver behind the increase in injury rate. At the beginning of 2019, a number of employees elected to work overtime in order to meet production demands. We then added over 500 temporary workers to staff the production demands, many of whom had never worked in a manufacturing environment before. We have since stabilized our workforce and are seeing a downward injury trend that we expect to continue.\n\n77 Air MI injury rate was influenced by COVID-19 with interruptions in work, adjustments to manufacturing process and the addition of hundreds of temporary workers to augment the workforce.\n\n78 Tier 1 focus factory data is self-reported by factories and may be incomplete. At the time of the FY21 NIKE, Inc. Impact Report publication, December 2021 data was estimated for factories where actual data was unavailable. The BLS does not calculate manufacturing rates for equipment/accessories. As of CY21, there are no accessories focus factories.\nFoundational Expectations\n\nTarget: 100% of facilities in our extended supply chain meet NIKE\u2019s foundational labor, health, safety and environmental standards demonstrating respect for the rights of their workers and communities where they operate\n\nAudit, Non-compliance\n\n| Category                                      | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | FY21 Total |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|------------|\n| Age Standards                                 | 0      | 0.3    | 0.3        |\n| Building Is Safe                              | 1.2    | 5.9    | 5.4        |\n| Chemical Management                           | 8.6    | 9      | 9          |\n| Discrimination                                | 4.9    | 1.1    | 1.6        |\n| Dorms, Canteen and Childcare                  | 1.2    | 2.6    | 2.5        |\n| Fire and Emergency Action                     | 6.2    | 12.8   | 12         |\n| Forced Labor                                  | 0      | 0.5    | 0.4        |\n| Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining | 0      | 1.1    | 1          |\n| Harassment and Abuse                          | 2.5    | 0      | 0.3        |\n| Hazardous Waste                               | 0      | 0.7    | 0.6        |\n| HSE Management Systems                        | 1.2    | 2.5    | 2.3        |\n| Occupational Health and Hygiene               | 6.2    | 12.2   | 11.4       |\n| Other                                         | 1.2    | 0.8    | 0.9        |\n| Regular Employment                            | 2.5    | 1.3    | 1.4        |\n| Solid Waste (Non-Hazardous Waste)             | 0      | 0.5    | 0.4        |\n| Wages and Benefits                            | 27.2   | 9.7    | 11.7       |\n| Wastewater                                    | 11.1   | 0      | 1.3        |\n| Working Hours                                 | 14.8   | 16.4   | 16.2       |\n| Workplace Is Safe                             | 11.1   | 22.5   | 21.2       |\n\nWorker Count Results\n\n| Region            | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | FY21 Total |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|------------|\n| Americas          | 63,115 | 3,217  | 66,332     |\n| EMEA              | 25,948 | 408    | 26,356     |\n| N Asia            | 115,416| 24,829 | 140,245    |\n| S Asia            | 269,240| 24,693 | 293,933    |\n| SE Asia           | 507,010| 21,927 | 528,937    |\n| Total             | 980,729| 75,074 | 1,055,803  |\n\nAudit Counts\n\n| Category                                      | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | FY21 Total |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|------------|\n| NIKE                                          | 129    | 14     | 143        |\n| SLCP79                                        | 194    | 137    | 331        |\n| SAC\u2019s FEM79                                    | 220    | 164    | 384        |\n| ZDHC79 Wastewater Guidelines                  | 96     | 177    | 273        |\n| Better Work                                   | 33     | 0      | 33         |\n| Total                                         | 672    | 492    | 1,164      |\n\n79 Number of reports received.\n## Planet\n\n### Carbon\n\n#### FY21 Emissions Summary (Metric Tons CO2e)\n\n| Scope 1, 2 and 3 | Emissions | Emissions (%) |\n|------------------|-----------|---------------|\n| Scope 1          | 42,720    | 0.4           |\n| Scope 2 (market-based emissions) | 76,420 | 0.7 |\n| Scope 3          | 10,823,562 | 98.9         |\n| Total            | 10,942,702 |               |\n\n80 NIKE converts all energy consumed to kWh using net calorific value of the direct fuels consumed, including transportation fuels.

materials manufacturing, materials finishing, and finished goods manufacturing. | Emissions data is calculated using primary activity data and extrapolations. CO\u2082e emissions include CO\u2082, CH\u2084, and N\u2082O. NIKE Brand and Converse footwear finished goods manufacturing emissions data is derived from 100% primary data and represents nearly 90% of the emissions in finished goods manufacturing. For this subset, vendors provide monthly energy consumption: from the local utility grid, onsite generators, other fuels, and purchased steam. For electricity: kWh values are multiplied by CO\u2082e emissions factors for electricity purchased from the local utility grid by the country/region in which the factory resides. For onsite generation and other fuels: CO\u2082e emissions are calculated using the IPCC bottoms up calculation methodology. CO\u2082e methodologies are used for emissions estimates outside of footwear finished goods manufacturing based on lifecycle analysis data applied to product creation data, and employ conservative assumptions to avoid understating NIKE's footprint. To evaluate NIKE's value chain footprint, we identified and quantified CO\u2082e emissions created at each stage of the value chain. The impact of each individual product differs considerably, based on its profile, materials used, size and weight, method of manufacture, and location of production, use, and disposal. Several internal and external tools were used to develop this estimation including: NIKE's Materials Sustainability Index and Enablon. | 30% |\n| 2 Capital Goods | Not relevant | NIKE does not have significant investment in capital goods as most manufacturing equipment is owned and operated by contracted factories. | N/A | N/A |\n| 3 Fuel and Energy-Related Activities | 13,025 | Includes emissions associated with the extraction, production, and transportation of fuels and energy purchased and reported in NIKE's Scope 1 and 2 footprint. Does not include upstream electricity emissions, T&D losses, or other onsite fuels besides natural gas (propane, diesel, biogas, hi-sene). | Emissions data is calculated using primary activity data, extrapolated consumption, and publicly available CO\u2082e emissions factors. Consumption is multiplied by the emissions factor, using an identical global factor across all countries and regions. | 58% |\n| 4 Upstream Transportation and Distribution | 544,099 | Includes ~95% of global inbound transportation and ~95% of global outbound transportation via the following modes of transportation: air, ocean, truck and rail. Excludes non-NIKE paid freight. Also included is the shipment via air freight of Nike AirBags produced in North America and shipped as components for footwear manufacturing to manufacturing partners in Asia. | Transactional data is applied to a third-party transportation carbon calculator against industry standard emissions factors (distance traveled x cargo weight or volume x emission factor). Upstream emissions from air transport of airbag components is calculated using industry standard air freight emission factors per ton-mile and production volume. | 100% |\n## Scope 3 Emissions By Category and Operational Boundaries\n\n| Emissions Sources                  | FY21 Metric | Scope of Reported Emissions                                                                 | Emissions Calculation Methodology                                                                                                                                                                                                 | % Of Emissions |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| 5 Waste Generated in Operations   | 1,810       | Emissions relative to the fate of the waste generated in our own operations including HQs and DCs. | Total HQs and DC waste not diverted from landfill multiplied by a lifecycle assessment-based emission factor for municipal waste sent to landfill.                                                                                                                                         | 100%           |\n| 6 Business Travel                 | 3,395       | Includes emissions from commercial air travel.                                               | Air CO\u2082 emissions are estimated based on number and distance of trips.

(\u201cNIKE\u201d) management assertion that the environmental sustainability metrics for the year ended May 31, 2021 and the employee metrics (together, the \u201csustainability metrics\u201d) as of May 31, 2021 in management\u2019s assertion are presented in accordance with the assessment criteria set forth in management\u2019s assertion. NIKE\u2019s management is responsible for its assertion and for the selection of the criteria, which management believes provide an objective basis for measuring and reporting on the sustainability metrics. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on management\u2019s assertion based on our review.\n\nOur review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) in AT-C section 105, Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements, and AT-C section 210, Review Engagements. Those standards require that we plan and perform the review to obtain limited assurance about whether any material modifications should be made to management\u2019s assertion in order for it to be fairly stated. The procedures performed in a review vary in nature and timing from and are substantially less in extent than, an examination, the objective of which is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management\u2019s assertion is fairly stated, in all material respects, in order to express an opinion. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. Because of the limited nature of the engagement, the level of assurance obtained in a review is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had an examination been performed. We believe that the review evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our conclusion.\n\nWe are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements related to the engagement.\n\nWe applied the Statements on Quality Control Standards established by the AICPA, and, accordingly, maintain a comprehensive system of quality control.\nThe procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment. In performing our review, we performed inquiries, and for a selection of specified metrics, performed tests of mathematical accuracy of computations, read relevant policies to understand terms related to relevant information about the specified metrics, reviewed supporting documentation in regard to the completeness and accuracy of the data in the specified metrics, and performed analytical procedures.\n\nGreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions quantification is subject to significant inherent measurement uncertainty because of such things as GHG emissions factors that are used in mathematical models to calculate GHG emissions, and the inability of these models, due to incomplete scientific knowledge and other factors, to accurately measure under all circumstances the relationship between various inputs and the resultant GHG emissions. Environmental and energy use data used in GHG emissions calculations are subject to inherent limitations, given the nature and the methods used for measuring such data. The selection by management of different but acceptable measurement techniques could have resulted in materially different amounts or metrics being reported.\n\nThe preparation of the other sustainability metrics requires management to establish the criteria, make determinations as to the relevancy of information to be included, and make assumptions that affect reported information. The selection by management of different but acceptable measurement techniques could have resulted in materially different amounts or metrics being reported.\n\nAs discussed in management\u2019s assertion, the Company has estimated GHG emissions for certain emissions sources for which no primary usage data is available.\n\nBased on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to NIKE\u2019s management assertion in order for it to fairly stated.\n\nMarch 9, 2022\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n805, SW Broadway, Suite 800 Portland, OR 97205\nwww.pwc.com\nNIKE, Inc.

NIKE management is also responsible for the completeness, accuracy, and validity of the sustainability metrics.\n\nEnergy and Emissions\n\nStandards\nNIKE captures, calculates, and reports direct and indirect GHG emissions data with consideration of the principles and guidance of the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development\u2019s (WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative\u2019s Corporate GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) (\"GHG Protocol\") and the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard, which are recognized external standards.\n\nOrganizational Boundary\nNIKE uses the operational control approach in conformance with the GHG Protocol to report energy and electricity consumption and direct and indirect GHG emissions for 100% of the facilities where NIKE has operational control.\n## Scope\n\nNIKE's scope 1, 2, a subset of scope 3 emissions (commercial air travel and outbound and inbound logistics), and renewable electricity consumption reporting coverage is outlined below.\n\n| Emissions Source                  | Scope Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Renewable Electricity Consumption | \u2022 Percentage of global energy sourced from renewable energy is calculated as follows: (Renewable Electricity in MWh)/(Scope 1 and Scope 2 Total energy consumption within the organization in MWh) X 100  \n  \u2022 Renewable electricity includes onsite solar and wind consumed, electricity purchased via Energy Attribute Certificates and Electricity Contracts as described in NIKE's market-based emissions table below.  \n  \u2022 Actual activity data is sourced from direct measurement or third-party invoices when possible. Estimates are used when actual data is not available and are determined based on our estimation methodology described in the Estimation Methodology section. |\n| Retail                            | \u2022 Includes NIKE owned or operated NIKE Brand and Converse stores globally.  \n  \u2022 Energy consumed includes natural gas and electricity. Natural gas usage outside of the U.S. and Canada (and for landlord-managed sites in the U.S. and Canada), and electricity usage outside of the U.S., Canada and EU (and for landlord-managed sites in the U.S., Canada and EU), is estimated. Our estimation methodology is described below.  \n  \u2022 Refrigerant leakage from HVAC units are not included in reporting at this time. |\n| Distribution Centers (DCs)        | \u2022 Includes top 39 NIKE owned or operated Distribution Centers (\"DCs\") globally as of May 31, 2021, which represent approximately 90% of shipped units.  \n  \u2022 Energy consumed includes natural gas, hi-sene, diesel, propane, electricity, onsite solar, and onsite wind.  \n  \u2022 Diesel is used in backup generators.  \n  \u2022 Propane is used in at least two DCs for scrubbers/ floor sweepers. A portion of propane usage is estimated leveraging known propane usage. Our estimation methodology is described below.  \n  \u2022 In addition, emissions include fugitive emissions from refrigerant gas loss. Our estimation methodology is described below. |\n| Offices                           | \u2022 Includes emissions from building facilities at 4 Headquarter (\"HQ\") locations: World Headquarters U.S. (\"WHQ\"), European HQ, Greater China HQ (\"GCHQ\"), and Converse HQ (together covering over 10 million ft\u00b2). Also includes emissions from non-HQ office facilities (such as regional sales offices).  \n  \u2022 Energy consumed within HQs includes natural gas, diesel, propane, electricity, and onsite solar; within non-HQ offices, energy consumed includes natural gas and electricity only. Natural gas usage within non-HQ offices outside of the U.S. and Canada (and for landlord-managed sites in the U.S. and Canada), and electricity usage within non-HQ offices outside of the U.S., Canada, and EU (as well as for landlord-managed sites in the U.S., Canada, and EU), is estimated. Our estimation methodology is described below.  \n  \u2022 Diesel is used in backup generators.  \n  \u2022 Propane is used in food services, vendor landscaping services, and some forklifts.  \n  \u2022 Refrigerant leakage from HVAC units are not included in reporting at this time. |\n| Air Manufacturing Innovation      | \u2022 Includes NIKE owned manufacturing facilities and related facilities that are the primary producers of NIKE air units.  \n  \u2022 Energy consumed includes natural gas, diesel, propane and electricity.  \n  \u2022 Diesel is used in backup generators.  \n  \u2022 Propane is used in a single limited application in one Air Manufacturing Innovation (Air MI) facility.  \n  \u2022 Refrigerant leakage from HVAC units are not included in reporting at this time. |\n| Vehicles                          | \u2022 Vehicles include service vehicles at WHQ and GCHQ.  \n  \u2022 Fuel consumed includes gasoline.  \n  \u2022 Company-leased fleet vehicles for use by employees in other geographies are not included in reporting at this time. |\n| Jets                              | \u2022 Includes jet aviation fuel from our business travel using NIKE's corporate jets, operated from the U.S. |\n| Commercial Travel                 | \u2022 Data represents commercial business air travel for all employees across 49 countries.  \n  \u2022 Commercial air travel emissions are estimated based on mileage calculated from number and route distance of trips. |\n| Outbound Logistics                | \u2022 Data represents approximately 95% of global outbound transportation and distribution of products sold via the following modes of transportation: air, ocean, truck, and rail. Reported figures reflect well to wheel emissions.  \n  \u2022 Emissions from transportation of Converse products outside of North America and transportation of NikeID products are excluded. |\n| Inbound Logistics                 | \u2022 Data represents approximately 95% of global inbound transportation and distribution of finished goods via the following modes of transportation: air, ocean, truck, and rail. Reported figures reflect well to wheel emissions.  \n  \u2022 Emissions from transportation of Converse products outside of North America and transportation of NikeID products are excluded. |\nExclusions\nEach year, we aim to increase the quality of the data reported. As tenants of leased facilities, we do not yet have access to complete refrigerant sources and certain energy sources for shared building common spaces.\n\nGHG Base Data\nActivity data used to calculate Scope 1 (direct) emissions is sourced from direct measurements or third-party invoices (e.g., diesel, jet fuel and natural gas). Activity data used to calculate Scope 2 (indirect) emissions is sourced from third-party invoices (e.g., electricity) wherever possible and is collected across the business via a variety of internal processes and systems. Scope 3 (commercial air travel) data used to report GHG emissions from transporting our employees is obtained from reports provided by third parties which includes number of flights and distance data. Activity data used to calculate Scope 3 inbound and outbound emissions are sourced from third-party invoices (e.g., supplier expenditure including weight, transportation type, distance, and weight/volume) and is collected across the business via a variety of internal processes and systems.\n\nAs described in this assertion, activity data for Scope 1 and Scope 2 is sourced from estimates where actual consumption data is not available. NIKE continues to work on obtaining systematic access to more actual consumption data. Estimates are described in more detail below. Reported data has been rounded to the nearest whole number.\n\nEstimation Methodology\nEstimation methodologies employ reasonable assumptions to avoid understating NIKE\u2019s emissions footprint and are described below.\n\n| Natural Gas (retail and non-HQ offices outside of the U.S. and Canada, and landlord-managed sites in the U.S. and Canada) | Where actual data is not available, natural gas usage is estimated for sites outside of the U.S. and Canada, and for landlord-managed sites in the U.S. and Canada. Square footage of retail and non-HQ offices per country is used, along with country-level climate assumptions and CBECS energy use intensity (kWh per square foot) based on climate region. In the U.S. and Canada, where some sites are landlord-managed and visibility on energy consumption is low, our internal known average country-level energy use intensity is used instead of the external CBECS benchmark. Approximately 91% of retail scope 1 emissions in FY21 were estimated, and approximately 89% of non-HQ scope 1 emissions in FY21 were estimated. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Electricity (retail and non-HQ offices outside of the U.S., Canada, and EU, and landlord-managed sites in the U.S., Canada, and the EU) | Where actual data is not available, electricity usage is estimated for sites outside of the U.S., Canada, and EU and for landlord-managed sites in the U.S., Canada, and EU. Square footage of retail and non-HQ offices per country is used, leveraging actual FY21 square footage data, along with electricity intensity (kWh per square foot of known FY21 NIKE electricity usage in retail or offices). Approximately 96% of retail scope 2 market-based emissions in FY21 were estimated. Approximately 77% of non-HQ scope 2 market-based emissions in FY21 were estimated. |\n| Propane (DC) | Propane usage at one DC is estimated leveraging propane consumption intensity at a comparable DC based on relative square footage. |\n| Fugitive emissions from refrigerant gas loss (DC) | Refrigerant leakage from HVAC units was calculated by applying an operating emission factor (i.e., leak rate) of 10% (sourced from EPA's Direct Fugitive Emissions from Refrigeration, Air Conditioning, Fire Suppression, and Industrial Gases) to the total system capacity across all units. The Global Warming Potential (\u201cGWP\u201d) of R410a was sourced from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report published in 2014. |\nEmission Factors\n\nEmissions are reported in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent and include CO\u2082, CH\u2084 and N\u2082O. Exceptions to reporting CH\u2084 and N\u2082O are as follows:\n\n- Facilities\u2019 emissions are reported in CO\u2082e, however, within a limited subset of consumption data, emission factors for other gases (CH\u2084, N\u2082O) are not provided. These exceptions include AIB/EU Residual Mix Emissions factors, Green-E/US Residual Mix, and certain supplier-specific emission factors. In these cases, CH\u2084 and N\u2082O emissions are sourced from the next available source in the market-based emission factors hierarchy.\n\n- Commercial Travel emissions are in CO\u2082 due to data availability. The emissions from other gases are not material to NIKE\u2019s reported GHG emissions.\n\nCarbon dioxide emissions and equivalents resulting from the activities and business units described above have been determined on the basis of measured or estimated fuel and electricity usage, multiplied by relevant, published carbon emission factors, which are updated annually according to an internal policy to use the most recent emission factors available before the annual internal cutoff date, which is 15 days after the fiscal year end. Carbon dioxide equivalent emissions utilize GWPs primarily sourced from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report (Assessment Report 5 \u2013 100 year), and EPA emission factor sources use Assessment Report 4.\n\nIn quantifying market-based electricity GHG emissions, GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance defines a hierarchy of factors for quantifying market-based emissions, in order from highest to lowest precision. The table below describes the hierarchy and the relevance to NIKE for the current year reporting.\n\n| Emission Source Type                  | Emission Factor Employed                                                                 |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Direct Line Connection                | Not applicable                                                                           |\n| Energy Attribute Certificates         | NIKE applies a zero emission factor for on-site solar and wind generation where Renewable Energy Credits (or Guarantees of Origin) generated are retained by NIKE and for purchased renewable energy attribute certificates applied to NIKE\u2019s operations. Biofuel renewable energy credits employ a zero emission factor for CO\u2082; biofuel source-specific emission factors are applied to fugitive emissions for CH\u2084 and N\u2082O and are not material. |\n| Electricity Contracts                 | NIKE applies a zero emission factor for all facilities in scope of its power purchase agreements. |\n| Energy Supplier-Specific Emissions Factors | U.S., Canada and EU: NIKE applies publicly available supplier-specific emission factors where available. |\n| Residual Mix                          | U.S. and Canada: NIKE applies residual mix emission factors from Green-e Energy U.S. Residual Mix Emissions Rates. EU: NIKE applies country emission factors from the Association of Issuing Bodies (AIB). |\n| Location-Based Factors                | If none of the above options are available, NIKE uses location-based factors as described in the table below. |\nThe table below outlines the emission factor sources used in FY21 emissions calculations.\n\n| Emission Source | Emission Source Type | Emission Factor Employed |\n|-----------------|----------------------|--------------------------|\n| Scope 1         | Natural Gas          | GHG Protocol Emission Factors from Cross-Sector Tools March 2017 |\n| Scope 1         | Hi-sene              | GHG Protocol Emission Factors from Cross-Sector Tools March 2017 |\n| Scope 1         | Diesel               | GHG Protocol Emission Factors from Cross-Sector Tools March 2017 |\n| Scope 1         | Propane              | GHG Protocol Emission Factors from Cross-Sector Tools March 2017 |\n| Scope 1         | Gasoline             | GHG Protocol Emission Factors from Cross-Sector Tools March 2017 |\n| Scope 1         | Fugitive emissions from refrigerant gas loss | Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report published in 2014; EPA's Direct Fugitive Emissions from Refrigeration, Air Conditioning, Fire Suppression, and Industrial Gases published in 2014 |\n| Scope 1         | Jet Fuel             | GHG Protocol Emission Factors from Cross-Sector Tools March 2017 |\n| Scope 2         | Electricity (U.S., Canada & EU) | Contractual instruments: (Virtual) Power Purchase Agreements (vPPA); energy attribute certificates (EAC). In FY21, NIKE employed a zero emission factor for: \u2022 Facilities in Oregon, U.S. that are in scope of NIKE\u2019s PPA with Avangrid \u2022 Facilities in the U.S. and Canada that are in scope of NIKE\u2019s U.S. vPPA \u2022 Facilities in the European Economic Area are in scope of NIKE\u2019s EU vPPA \u2022 Facilities in EU that purchase solar and/or wind GOs/EACs |\n| Scope 2         | Electricity (U.S., Canada, and EU) | Supplier-specific emission factors (various sources) In the absence of a contractual instrument (or electricity consumption that exceeds onsite renewables and contractual instruments), NIKE applied supplier-specific emission factors where they are available and meet a third-party quality criteria review. |\n| Scope 2         | Electricity (U.S. and Canada) | Green-e Energy US Residual Mix Emissions Rates For facilities in the U.S. and Canada that do not have contractual instruments or supplier-specific emission factors available, NIKE uses residual mix factors. |\n| Scope 2         | Electricity (U.S.) | eGRID (location-based) In the absence of contractual instruments, supplier-specific emission factors, and residual mix factors, NIKE applies a regional/national grid mix factor. This only applies to landlord-managed facilities in the U.S. |\n| Scope 2         | Electricity (EU) | AIB European Residual Mixes For facilities in the EU that do not have contractual instruments or supplier-specific emission factors available, NIKE uses residual mix factors. |\n| Scope 2         | Electricity (Global, excluding U.S.) | IEA World Electricity CO2 Emissions Factors (location-based) In the absence of contractual instruments, supplier-specific emission factors, residual mix factors, and a regional/national grid mix factor, NIKE applies a protocol that covers all countries globally. This global protocol serves as a catch-all for any sites that haven\u2019t obtained an emission factor from a more granular source in the market-based hierarchy. |\n| Scope 3 (Commercial Travel only) | Air travel | GHG Protocol Emission Factors from Cross-Sector Tools March 2017 |\n| Scope 3 (Outbound Logistics) | Air, Ocean, Truck and Rail Shipping | Outbound logistics emission factors are sourced in compliance with the European Standards Methodology for calculations and declaration of energy consumption and GHG emissions of transport services (freight and passengers) DIN EN 16258 standard (March 2013). |\n| Scope 3 (Inbound Logistics) | Air, Ocean, Truck and Rail Shipping | Inbound logistics emission factors are sourced in compliance with the European Standards Methodology for calculations and declaration of energy consumption and GHG emissions of transport services (freight and passengers) DIN EN 16258 standard (March 2013). |\nUncertainty\nGHG emissions quantification is subject to significant inherent measurement uncertainty because of such things as GHG emissions factors that are used in mathematical models to calculate GHG emissions and the inability of these models, due to incomplete scientific knowledge and other factors, to accurately measure under all circumstances the relationship between various inputs and the resultant GHG emissions. Environmental and energy use data used in GHG emissions calculations are subject to inherent limitations, given the nature and the methods used for measuring such data. The selection by management of different but acceptable measurement techniques could have resulted in materially different amounts or metrics being reported.\n\nThe preparation of the other sustainability metrics requires management to establish the criteria, make determinations as to the relevancy of information to be included, and make assumptions that affect reported information. The selection by management of different but acceptable measurement techniques could have resulted in materially different amounts or metrics being reported.\n\nNIKE recognizes that commercial air travel and logistics remain an estimate since unforeseen circumstances can occur (e.g., different routes due to adverse weather or unforeseen aircraft fleet changes), however the figures presented are considered to be a reasonable estimate of NIKE\u2019s commercial air travel and logistics emissions.\n\nWater\nBackground\nIn support of its Water Restoration target, NIKE funds project work aimed at supporting the long-term resilience of the water basins within its extended cotton supply chain. Thus far, NIKE has not implemented water restoration project activities itself, but instead supports project activities and implementation conducted by third-party partners (typically NGOs). Additionally, NIKE partners with third-party engineering firms to calculate approximate restoration volumes and tracks the volume of water restored through these projects. Since the inception of NIKE\u2019s Water Restoration projects in India and Australia, NIKE has funded more than $550,000 for the two projects.\nScope\nNIKE\u2019s water restoration efforts focus on regions in Tier 4 of its cotton supply chain. NIKE only considers water restored through this portfolio of projects when calculating progress towards the water restoration target. Additional water restoration that occurs incidentally in or through unrelated NIKE activities is not included.\n\nEstimation Methodology\nNIKE works with project implementation partners and third-party engineering firms to quantify volumetric benefits from the water restoration projects. This quantification approach aligns with the World Resources Institute\u2019s Volumetric Water Benefit Accounting Methodology and uses the United National Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) CROPWAT program, version 8.0 of CROPWAT and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, version 1.2.1 of SWAT (QSWAT+). Data inputs for quantification are provided by the project implementation partners and estimated volumetric benefits are discussed and confirmed with project partners and third-party engineering firms.\n\nConservatively, we assume that the benefits would accrue at a rate of approximately 20% per year for the first two years and 50% per year for years three and four. Beginning the fifth year the full volumetric benefits will be claimed. An external engineering firm determined NIKE\u2019s share of the total volume of water restored in FY21 was 2,063,366,665 liters.\n\nThe project types included in this volume of water restored include:\n\n1. Agricultural water demand reduction measures (Beed District, Maharashtra State, India)\n   a. VWB Indicator: Reduced consumption\n   b. Calculation Method: Consumption method\n\n2. Land conservation (Nimmia-Caira Wetlands, New South Wales (NSW), Australia)\n   a. VWB (Volumetric Water Benefit) Indicator: Avoided runoff\n   b. Calculation Method: Curve Number method\n\n3. Wetland restoration and creation (Nimmia-Caira Wetlands, NSW, Australia)\n   a. VWB Indicator: Increased recharge\n   b. Calculation Method: Recharge method\nUncertainty\nVolumetric water benefit quantification is subject to inherent measurement uncertainty as, short of project work that can accommodate water meters or similar tracking technologies, the interventions that support water restoration are nearly impossible to directly measure. Additionally, the data types needed for these projects are often variable, such as climate conditions, flow rates, irrigation efficiency, soil types, and evapotranspiration rates. Using WRI's VWBA Methodology\u2019s calculation methods and best estimates for data inputs, NIKE and its partners work to limit uncertainty to an acceptable degree. The selection by management of different but acceptable measurement techniques could result in materially different amounts of metrics being reported.\n# Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Index\n\nThis report has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards.\n\n## General Disclosures\n\n| GRI Standard | Number | GRI Disclosure | Location and Notes | Omission | UNGC Principle/SDG Mapping |\n|--------------|--------|----------------|--------------------|----------|---------------------------|\n| Organization Profile | 102-1 | Name of the organization | NIKE, Inc. | | |\n| | 102-2 | Activities, brands, products, and services | FY21 10-K: Item 7.

Adapting to these changes while maintaining comparability in our data is critical to instilling integrity and confidence in the validity of the insights the data provides. We understand that we must adapt and be nimble to keep pace with broadening data sets and emerging standards. We continue to focus on the internal controls in our sustainability data processes and systems. We have obtained external assurance on select reported metrics (Scope 1 and 2 energy consumption and emissions, renewable electricity, Scope 3 commercial air travel emissions, and inbound and outbound logistics emissions; selected diversity and inclusion data; and cumulative water restoration funding). More information can be found in the Appendix. In cases where shifts in scope, methodology and/or data quality have led to changes in previously reported performance results, we\u2019ve restated historically reported results and provided context on the changes in the Restatements section of the Appendix. The data presented in this report has been collected through a variety of processes, reviewed and internally validated, and represents the most complete and accurate information at the time of publication. NIKE will continue to be transparent on revisions to reported data in the future.\n\nFY20 was the target year for our FY20 targets (FY15\u201320) and is the baseline year for the majority of our 2025 targets. The continual expansion of our Purpose targets\u2019 depth and breadth is a key element of our strategy. As such, we introduced new areas included in target scope with the FY25 targets. As a result, in many cases, FY20 values disclosed in the FY20 NIKE Impact Report differ from those provided in this report, reflecting the more inclusive measurement scope in our most current targets.\n\nCOVID-19 Methodology\n\nEstimation methodology for FY20 Q4 COVID-19 slowdown adjustments are as follows:\n\n- Carbon Scope 1 and 2 Emissions (except for HQ security vehicles); Transportation Emissions \u2013 Activity Data: FY20 Q3 trailing 12 months (TTM); FY20 Q4 = FY19 Q4. Emissions Factors, Scope: unadjusted FY20.\n- Carbon Manufacturing Emissions \u2013 Activity Data: FY20 Q4 = percent of FY observed historically. Emissions Factors, Scope: unadjusted FY20.\n- Waste Manufacturing and Packaging \u2013 FY20 Q4 = average of Q1\u20133.\n- Waste DCs, HQs, Air MI \u2013 FY20 Q3 TTM.\n- Water \u2013 FY20 Q4 = average of Q1\u20133.\n\nDue to the effects of COVID-19, the fourth quarter of FY20 (March 2020\u2013May 2020) resulted in lower than normal production, impacting the final measurement year of our FY20 targets and baseline measurement year of our FY25 targets. To help enable measurement consistency and avoid the inevitable artificial reductions in performance metrics during this unprecedented time, continuing our approach from our FY20 NIKE Impact Report, we have adjusted Q4 performance figures for the targets that were most impacted (carbon, waste and water). These Q4 adjustments generally reflect an FY20 Q3 trailing 12-month view of performance and provided a more conservative view of where we landed on FY20 targets than would be rendered using actual performance figures during the global shutdown. These adjustments had the effect of inflating our footprint to resemble business as usual and were only applied to targets where we were aiming for a reduction in impact vs. baseline (\u201creduction targets\u201d) and to targets where we were aiming to reach a certain percentage (\u201creach targets\u201d) that share underlying data with reduction targets. None of the adjustments resulting in meeting targets that we would not have met if we didn\u2019t normalize our performance to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 slowdown on our FY20 targets target year and FY25 targets baseline year. We carried this approach through to measuring performance toward our FY25 targets to ensure consistency in how we accounted for the pandemic across target periods.\n## General Disclosures\n\n| GRI Standard | Number | GRI Disclosure | Location and Notes | Omission | UNGC Principle/SDG Mapping |\n|--------------|--------|----------------|--------------------|----------|---------------------------|\n| Reporting Practice | 102-49 | Changes in reporting | No significant changes from previous reporting periods in the list of material topics and topic Boundaries. | | |\n| | 102-50 | Reporting period | About This Report: page 137 | | |\n| | 102-51 | Date of most recent report | We published the FY21 Impact Report in March of 2022. | | |\n| | 102-52 | Reporting cycle | NIKE reports on an annual reporting cycle. | | |\n| | 102-53 | Contact point for questions regarding the report | purpose@nike.com | | |\n| | 102-54 | Claims of reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards | About This Report: page 137 | | |\n| | 102-55 | GRI content index | Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Index; pages 170\u2013183 | | |\n| | 102-56 | External assurance | PwC Assurance Report: page 159 NIKE, Inc.

All material types reported are purchased from external suppliers except for EVA foam, which is sourced internally. Data reported consists of both direct measurements and estimates. While many materials are measured directly for a wide variety of products, some volumes are estimated. The majority of cotton and polyester volume data is sourced using direct measurements, though product creation data is used to estimate material volumes for certain parts of the business. Nike Brand apparel and footwear shifted data source used for FY25 targets reporting for majority of reporting.\n\n| GRI Standard | Number | GRI Disclosure | Location and Notes | Omission | UNGC Principle/SDG Mapping |\n|--------------|--------|----------------|--------------------|----------|---------------------------|\n| **Energy** | | | | | |\n| **Material Aspects: Renewables and Energy Use** | | | | | |\n| GRI 103: Management Approach | 103-1 | Explanation of the material topic and its Boundaries | Issue Prioritization: pages 138\u2013141 | Carbon: pages 84\u2013103 | |\n| | 103-2 | The management approach and its components | Carbon: pages 84\u2013103 | | |\n| | 103-3 | Evaluation of the management approach | Carbon: pages 84\u2013103 | | |\n| GRI 302: Energy | 302-1 | Energy consumption within the organization | Carbon: pages 84\u2013103 | Data Tables, Planet: pages 151\u2013157 | |\n| | 302-2 | Energy consumption outside of the organization | Carbon: pages 84\u2013103 | Data Tables, Planet: pages 151\u2013157 | |\n| | 302-3 | Energy intensity | Carbon: pages 84\u2013103 | Data Tables, Planet: pages 151\u2013157 | |\n## Environmental\n\n| GRI Standard | Number | GRI Disclosure | Location and Notes | Omission | UNGC Principle/SDG Mapping |\n|--------------|--------|----------------|--------------------|----------|---------------------------|\n| **Water**    |        |                |                    |          |                           |\n| GRI 103: Management Approach | 103-1 | Explanation of the material topic and its Boundaries | Issue Prioritization: pages 138\u2013141 | Water: pages 123\u2013129 |                           |\n|              | 103-2 | The management approach and its components | Water: pages 123\u2013129 |          |                           |\n|              | 103-3 | Evaluation of the management approach | Water: pages 123\u2013129 |          |                           |\n| GRI 303: Water And Effluents 2018 | 303-1 | Interactions with water as a shared resource | Water: pages 123\u2013129 |          |                           |\n|              | 303-2 | Management of water discharge-related impacts | Water: pages 123\u2013129 | NIKE Code Leadership Standards |                           |\n|              | 303-5 | Water consumption | Water: pages 123\u2013129 |          |                           |\n| **Emissions**|        |                |                    |          |                           |\n| GRI 103: Management Approach | 103-1 | Explanation of the material topic and its Boundaries | Issue Prioritization: pages 138\u2013141 | Carbon: pages 84\u2013103 |                           |\n|              | 103-2 | The management approach and its components | Carbon: pages 84\u2013103 |          |                           |\n|              | 103-3 | Evaluation of the management approach | Carbon: pages 84\u2013103 | PwC Assurance Report: page 159 |                           |\n| GRI 305: Emissions | 305-1 | Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions | Carbon: pages 84\u2013103 | Data Tables, Planet: pages 151\u2013157 | 8 |\n|              | 305-2 | Energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions | Carbon: pages 84\u2013103 | Data Tables, Planet: pages 151\u2013157 | 8 |\n|              | 305-3 | Other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions | Carbon: pages 84\u2013103 | Data Tables, Planet: pages 151\u2013157 | 8 |\n|              | 305-4 | GHG emissions intensity | Carbon: pages 84\u2013103 | Data Tables, Planet: pages 151\u2013157 | 8 |\nEnvironmental\n\nAdditional Information\nNIKE converts all energy consumed to kWhe using net calorific value of the direct fuels consumed, including transportation fuels. Emissions data for HFCs, PFCs and SF6 are not reported. NIKE has phased out SF6 and therefore doesn\u2019t have SF6 emissions. Emissions for other greenhouse gases are either not relevant, immaterial or data is not available.\n\nScope 1 and 2\nFor information on direct and indirect energy consumption, Scope 1 and 2 emissions and the Scope 3 emissions accounting standard used, see the Management Assertion letter.
