It encompasses a portfolio of material ESG topics informed by ongoing engagement with a wide range of leaders, communities and other stakeholders.\n\nOur ESG strategy is designed to complement and integrate with Kroger\u2019s business model and operating strategy, aiming to unlock greater value over time for our associates, customers, communities and company\u2014ultimately helping people, our planet and our company thrive.\n\nThis year\u2019s ESG Report includes a discussion of our latest materiality assessment, completed in May which aligns with the principles of double materiality. It considers both the potential impacts of Kroger\u2019s operations on people and our planet, and the potential impacts of specific topics on Kroger\u2019s resilience and ability to operate in the future.\n\nThe Board of Directors oversees Kroger\u2019s management approach to ESG topics. In addition, a dedicated Public Responsibilities Committee of the board\u2014established in 1977\u2014provides deep oversight of the company\u2019s ESG strategy and goals related to environmental sustainability and social impact.\n\nKroger\u2019s executive leadership team is accountable for operationalizing and driving performance against our ESG goals, which are established and managed by a centralized ESG team, led by Kroger\u2019s group vice president of Corporate Affairs, who serves as chief sustainability officer, and an internal network of business leaders and subject matter experts across many disciplines.\n\nDetails on our management approach to ESG topics can be found throughout this report. We have made additional reporting resources on key topics available on our website, www.thekrogerco.com, including how we align impact philanthropy and investing to our ESG strategy through corporate giving and our two foundations: The Kroger Co. Foundation and The Kroger Co. Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Foundation.\n\nReport Scope\n\nThis ESG Report covers Kroger\u2019s 2022 fiscal year from January 30, 2022, to January 28, 2023. Unless otherwise noted, data included in the report reflects this period. The report incorporates most of our operations, except for certain datasets related to integrating banners from more recent mergers into our tracking systems. Where appropriate, we note the scope of specific performance tracking in the relevant report section.\n\nReporting Frameworks\n\nThe content in this report has been prepared in alignment with leading ESG reporting practices. We used the same principles for defining report content as in earlier years\u2014such as stakeholder inclusiveness and materiality\u2014as well as discussion of our management approach and several relevant topic-specific disclosures.\n\nWe continue to monitor and contribute to developments in reporting standards and best practices. Kroger serves on the International Sustainability Standards Board\u2019s Technical Reference Group, through which volunteer industry experts are appointed to advise on issues that should be considered in the standards-development process. To review our disclosures against the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Food Retailers & Distributors Standard, see our SASB Index at the end of this report. We strive to increase Kroger\u2019s SASB-aligned disclosures over time.\n\nIn addition, Kroger is highlighting how our management approach aligns with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework. As we set new greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions-reduction targets to align with the requirements of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), we will adjust our accounting and reporting to reflect new scopes of work. We also continue to monitor developments in emerging frameworks like the Task Force on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) and broader Science Based Targets Network.\nAs we reflect on the last year, I am incredibly optimistic about the future of Kroger and our ability to deliver for all stakeholders.\n\nHow is Kroger addressing climate change?\nWe recognize our dual responsibilities when managing climate impact: reducing the adverse impacts of our operations on a changing climate and mitigating the potential impacts of a changing climate on our business. Kroger\u2019s current target is to reduce GHG emissions by 30% by 2030, from a 2018 baseline. In 2022, we achieved further progress toward our goal, reducing emissions by a cumulative 15.2% so far. We are currently reviewing our Scope 1 and 2 target and contemplating new Scope 3 and Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) goals to reduce emissions from our supply chain and agricultural food production, respectively. This work continues in 2023.\n\nWhat progress has been made on Kroger\u2019s Zero Hunger | Zero Waste plan?\nKroger introduced our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste plan in 2017 to help create communities free of hunger and waste. Since then, we achieved our goal to direct 3 billion meals to our communities more than two years ahead of schedule, reflecting donations of in-kind and surplus food and $1.3 billion in charitable giving for hunger relief. We also accelerated our zero-waste vision with progress on waste diversion, food waste reduction and packaging goals.\n\nWhat do you hope to achieve by 2030?\nI\u2019m excited about the connections between our purpose-led business strategy and ambitious ESG goals. We see incredible opportunity to grow and reach more customers through our seamless ecosystem and expanding Kroger Delivery platform, unlocking the true potential of fresh, healthy food to nourish and improve health for millions of people in America. Our shared-value strategy will bring affordable fresh foods to even more homes, giving more customers easy ways to live a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle.\nAbout Kroger\n\nThis year, Kroger celebrates our 140th anniversary.

Today, Kroger\u2019s ESG strategy and continued leadership aim to unlock shared value for all of our stakeholders and our company.\n\nIn This Section\n9  Our ESG Strategy\n10 Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Impact Plan\n11 Material ESG Topics\n13 Living Our Purpose\n14 Stakeholder Engagement\n15 Key Performance Data Tables\nOur ESG Strategy\n\nWe imagine a world where everyone is Thriving Together. The objective of our ESG strategy is to achieve lasting positive change through a shared-value framework that benefits people and our planet and creates more resilient systems for the future.\n\nKroger has a unique role to play in the future of food. To feed a growing global population, the world needs more responsible and sustainable food production at scale. We are helping build a more resilient and equitable food system that preserves access, affordability and choice for all our customers\u2014today and in the future.\n\nKroger\u2019s Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social and environmental impact plan is at the center of our ESG Strategy. Zero Hunger | Zero Waste is widely recognized as an industry-leading platform for collective action and systems change. Since introducing our plan, we\u2019ve achieved significant progress through increased awareness, collaboration and innovation.\n\nOur strategy aims to address ESG topics of the highest importance to our business and to our associates, customers and communities. These topics align to three strategic pillars: People, Planet and Systems.\n\nPeople\n\nFood Safety, Access & Health\nKroger\u2019s brand promise, Fresh for Everyone\u2122, reflects our efforts to increase access to safe, affordable food and other essential products for customers across our geographies. This includes improving food security, nutrition and health and providing the best customer experience.\n\nJust & Inclusive Economy\nOffering access to employment, benefits, well-being resources and more; providing career paths that attract, engage and retain talent; and fostering a safe working environment that values diversity, equity and inclusion for all.\n\nPlanet\n\nClimate Impact\nImproving business resilience, reducing climate impact and supporting the transition to a lower-carbon economy by investing in energy efficiency and renewable energy and by reducing food waste and refrigerant emissions.\n\nResource Conservation\nOperational improvements to reduce waste and food waste, offering more sustainable Our Brands packaging and optimizing water use.\n\nSystems\n\nBusiness Integration\nStrong ESG governance and a commitment to ethics and compliance build trust and promote the long-term interests of our stakeholders. Key areas of focus include data privacy and cybersecurity and responsible marketing practices.\n\nResponsible & Resilient Systems\nOur efforts to improve environmental and social impacts throughout our global supply chain include responsible sourcing and supply chain accountability, including respecting human rights and advancing animal welfare in ways that maintain affordability for our customers.\nZero Hunger | Zero Waste Impact Plan\n\nKroger\u2019s Zero Hunger | Zero Waste impact plan sits at the center of our ESG strategy. It\u2019s our commitment to build a more sustainable, resilient and equitable food system for all.\n\nZero Hunger | Zero Waste aims to address the fundamental absurdity in our food system: Collectively, the world produces more than enough food to feed everyone today. In fact, more than 35% of food produced is wasted, yet 1 in 8 Americans still struggle with hunger. Our plan builds on our strengths to help build a more sustainable and equitable food system that advances food and nutrition security for generations to come.\n\n**Fresh for Everyone\u2122**\nNourishing Our Communities\n\n**Affordable Fresh Food**\n- Offer low prices and promotions on fresh, healthy food every day\n- Increase food access through our seamless digital platform and online payment through Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT)\n- Offer affordable Boost by Kroger Plus membership options for savings on groceries, fuel and delivery fees\n- Promote nutritional scoring and Better-for-You options to improve health and well-being\n\n**Food Rescue & Donations**\n- Use promotions and markdowns as food nears use-by dates for faster sale\n- Rescue remaining fresh food for made-in-store items or donation to local food banks\n\n**Advocacy**\n- Support public policy and legislative solutions that improve access to food and food benefits\n\n**Resource Conservation**\nReducing Emissions & Waste\n\n**GHG Emissions**\n- Reduce overall facility energy use and emissions\n- Divert food waste from landfills to reduce GHG emissions\n- Work with others to reduce emissions from agricultural production and our supply chain\n\n**Operational Waste & Food Waste**\n- Improve facility waste management and recover more recyclables to increase waste diversion\n- Maximize food waste recycling programs, including animal feed, composting and anaerobic digestion, as well as de-packaging solutions\n\n**Transform**\n- Advance more sustainable agricultural production methods that conserve resources and protect pollinators, natural habitats and biodiversity\n\n**Meals**\nImproving Food & Nutrition Security\n\n**Stronger Communities**\n- Donate more meals to nourish our communities (achieved goal to donate 3 billion meals in early 2023, more than two years ahead of schedule)\n- Strategically align philanthropy to our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste plan, prioritizing programs that provide meals and improve food security\n- Support organizations helping create a more sustainable food system\n- Encourage customers to Round Up their purchase to the nearest dollar to benefit The Kroger Co. Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Foundation to support local communities\n\n**Advance Innovation**\n- Direct catalytic funding to entrepreneurs with game-changing ideas through the Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Foundation\u2019s Innovation Fund\n- Build coalitions of mission-aligned collaborators to test solutions\nMaterial ESG Topics\n\nKroger\u2019s latest materiality assessment began in late 2022 and was completed in May 2023. This assessment was conducted in alignment with principles of double materiality and best practices outlined in multiple ESG reporting frameworks, including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Global Sustainability Reporting Standards.\n\nDouble Materiality Assessment\nDriven by the evolution of regulation and voluntary reporting frameworks, double materiality is the leading methodology for conducting materiality assessments today. This approach contemplates two different lenses through which material ESG topics can be viewed and disclosed, including:\n\n- **Outward impact:** The potential impact of a company\u2019s activities on people, the environment and the economy. For example, managing GHG emissions has an impact on our planet.\n- **Inward impact:** ESG topics or matters that may affect the company\u2019s ability to operate and deliver business value in the future. For example, changing weather patterns and temperatures may pose potential risks to the company\u2019s business operations and sourcing regions.\n\nThis is Kroger\u2019s third formal materiality assessment and the first aligned with double materiality principles. Two previous materiality assessments were completed in 2018 and 2020, and findings were shared publicly in Kroger\u2019s ESG Reports and online resources.\n\nFor this latest assessment, we collaborated with ERM, a third-party sustainability consultancy with expertise in materiality assessments and related services. ERM also conducted our past materiality assessments and is familiar with Kroger\u2019s business model and relevant stakeholders.\n\nDetermining Material Topics\nWe determined relevant ESG topics by reviewing the priorities of key stakeholder groups through ongoing engagement, sustainability reports, sustainability ratings and rankings, reporting frameworks, industry reports, consumer surveys and media scans. The result was a list of 26 topics identified for further assessment. We identified boundaries for each topic based on stakeholder expectations and our management practices.\n\nTo prioritize these topics and apply the Stakeholder Inclusiveness Principle outlined in the GRI Standards, ERM conducted in-depth interviews with 32 internal and external stakeholders. We also invited about 60 additional subject matter experts and stakeholders to complete a quantitative online survey. Based on these insights, we prioritized eight ESG topics as most \u201cmaterial,\u201d i.e., foundational to our business or presenting higher levels of risk or opportunity.\n\nHigh-priority topics were discussed and validated through a series of meetings with internal leaders and the Public Responsibilities Committee of the board. The validated topics shaped the content of this ESG Report, detailing our management approach, goals and performance for each Tier 1 topic. Topic placement on the matrix informs the company\u2019s management approach. This report also provides discussion of other Tier 2 and Tier 3 ESG topics defined through the assessment.\n\nDouble Materiality Assessment Process\n\n| Discovery | Assess inward impact | Assess outward impact | Topic prioritization | Validation |\n|-----------|----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|------------|\n| Source review, trends analysis, defined topic list | Internal & external stakeholder engagement | Value chain mapping, external stakeholder engagement | Topic ranking, summary report | Leadership engagement & review, validation workshop |\nAbout the Results\nThe output of the double materiality assessment can be characterized in a few main takeaways. Key impact areas for 2023 include eight topics across all three pillars of Kroger\u2019s ESG Strategy:\n\n- **Social topics affecting people:** Food safety; food & product access & affordability; health & nutrition; and talent attraction, engagement & retention\n- **Environmental topics affecting our planet:** Energy & GHG emissions and food waste\n- **Corporate Governance topics:** Data privacy & cybersecurity and responsible supply chain & sourcing\n\nThese findings generally align with the company\u2019s strategic focus areas while providing additional validation and insights.\n\nSee specific ESG topic definitions in the Material Topics Summary Table.\n\nTopic Placement\nThe matrix represents the two types of impact associated with each ESG topic. Topics are positioned on the matrix according to relative degree of impact, which reflects both internal and external perspectives. A high rating on the X axis (inward impact) means a topic may pose a higher degree of risk or opportunity to Kroger and its ability to create value over time. A high rating on the Y axis (outward impact) means that Kroger\u2019s business activities related to a topic may have a higher degree of impact on people and our planet.\n\nTopics at the top right of the matrix have the highest degree of both types of impact and are strategically important (Tier 1). All topics on the matrix are important; however, these insights from both internal and external stakeholders inform and shape Kroger\u2019s management approach, topic prioritization, potential investment of resources and public reporting.\nLiving Our Purpose\n\n**Kroger**\n\n#3\nNewsweek\nMost Trustworthy Companies in America (Grocery & Convenience Stores)\n2023\n\n#27\nAxios Harris Poll 100 Reputation Rankings\n2023\n\n#78\nNewsweek\nAmerica\u2019s Most Responsible Companies\n2023\n\nSupermarket News\nRetailer of the Year\n2022\n\nNewsweek\nAmerica\u2019s Best Loyalty Programs\n2022, 2023\n\nSustainability, Environmental Achievement and Leadership (SEAL) Business Sustainability Award\n2023\n\n**Score: 100**\nHuman Rights Campaign Foundation Corporate Equality Index\n4 consecutive years\n\nDisability:IN\nBest Places to Work for Disability Inclusion\n4 consecutive years\n\nMental Health America\nGold Bell Seal for Workplace Mental Health\n2023\n\nComputerworld\nBest Places to Work in IT\n5 consecutive years\n\nRippleMatch\u2019s Campus Forward Award for excellence in early-career hiring\n2023\n\n**Philanthropy**\n\nThe Kroger Co.

While our approach to engagement varies by stakeholder group, we prioritize topics based on our strengths, ESG strategy, materiality assessment results, and other risk-based analyses.\n\n### Key Stakeholders\n\n| Stakeholders                  | Primary Engagement Methods                                                                 | Engagement Outcomes 2022                                                                 |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Shareholders                  | Kroger\u2019s leaders, our Investor Relations team and other subject matter experts engage with shareholders throughout the year. Key channels include direct investor engagement, investor conferences, our annual shareholders\u2019 meeting, quarterly earnings calls, financial reports, investor questionnaires about ESG topics, [www.thekrogerco.com](http://www.thekrogerco.com), press releases and webcasts. | In 2022, under the direction of the board, we requested engagement meetings with 34 shareholders representing 48% of our outstanding shares and subsequently met with 18 shareholders representing 41% of our outstanding shares (we met with many of those shareholders more than once). Some investors we contacted did not respond or confirmed that a discussion was not needed at that time. |\n| Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) | We engage many NGOs to share the vision for Kroger\u2019s ESG strategy and Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social and environmental impact plan. We welcome dialogue with NGOs on diverse sustainability topics to help advance common goals for people and the planet. | NGO engagement shaped our management approach to material ESG topics. These insights helped inform our roadmap for Kroger\u2019s GHG emissions-reduction goal and our approach to conducting human rights impact assessments and reporting findings and next steps. |\n| Associates & Labor Unions     | We strive to engage with all Kroger associates in all locations. We use associate training, one-on-one discussions and coaching, the company\u2019s intranet, email, leadership meetings and town halls, affinity and inclusion groups, internal and external social media, and an annual associate engagement survey. We also communicate with local and international unions through scheduled meetings, telephone calls and ongoing collective bargaining agreement negotiations. | Quarterly and annual associate insights informed continued investments in wages and benefits, including new resources to support associates\u2019 health and well-being and provide free, confidential financial counseling services. We also added three Associate Resource Groups: Kickstart for new associates, Environmentally Conscious Outcomes (ECO) for associates interested in advancing sustainability, and Prime Timers for associates in the later stages of their careers. |\n| Customers                     | We offer customers many ways to engage with us, including in-store service counters, surveys, focus groups, websites and social media, as well as Kroger Customer Connect\u2014our live call center. | Continual feedback from customers guides improvements to our in-store and digital shopping experiences. Our 84.51\u00b0 customer insights team also monitors shopping behaviors, trends and sentiment, which informed the design and national launch of our Boost by Kroger Plus annual membership. |\n| Communities                   | We foster close relationships with the neighborhoods in which we operate. Key channels include direct engagement, local giving and fundraising, service and volunteerism, weekly food donations, hunger relief, ongoing special events, store openings, media relations and more. | Kroger is a trusted member of our local communities in good times and difficult times. In 2022, Kroger gave back over $46 million to local schools, churches and other eligible nonprofit organizations through Community Rewards. Enrolled customers earn donations for the charity of their choice on almost anything, every time they shop. |\n| Suppliers & Manufacturers     | Kroger\u2019s engagement with our suppliers is a critical element of our commitment to responsible sourcing and supply chain accountability. We focus our engagement during the onboarding process and continue it through ongoing meetings, site visits, surveys and audits. | We engaged suppliers throughout 2022 to help shape several key ESG policies and goals, including an updated Kroger Vendor Code of Conduct, an [Our Brands](http://www.ourbrands.com) packaging baseline, and framing for a new sustainable agriculture commitment. |\nThe Kroger team recognizes our unique role in the future of food. We are helping build a more resilient and equitable food system that preserves access and affordability\u2014today and in the future\u2014by advancing more responsible and sustainable production methods for the food and consumer goods on which we all depend.\n\n### Key Performance Data Tables\n\n| Goal | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | Baseline | Target Year | Status |\n|------|------|------|------|----------|-------------|--------|\n| **Social Impact: Zero Hunger | Zero Waste** | | | | | |\n| **Total Meals:** Increase cumulative total of meals directed to our communities (food and funds) | | | | | | |\n| 1 billion meals (2017\u20132019); 3 billion meals (2017\u20132025) | 1.8B | 2.3B | 2.9B | 2017 | 2020; 2025 | -\u25cb- |\n| **Surplus Food:** Improve management of surplus food company-wide | | | | | | |\n| Optimize recovery of surplus food for donation through Kroger\u2019s Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Food Rescue program | 90M pounds | 94M pounds | 106M pounds | 2017 | 2025 | -\u25cb- |\n| Strive for 100% of retail stores to participate in food rescue every year | 93% | 93% | 100% | 2017 | 2025 | -\u25cb- |\n| Increase company-wide donations of fresh Produce, Deli and Dairy items to be 45% of total food rescue | 37% | 42% | 45% | 2017 | 2025 | \u25cb |\n| **Philanthropy:** Strategically optimize giving to hunger relief organizations as share of total company-wide charitable giving (total of food and funds) | | | | | | |\n| Align grants from The Kroger Co.

That\u2019s why we\u2019re helping build a more just and inclusive world where everyone has access to nutritious, affordable foods every day.\n\nIn This Section\n\n21 Food Safety, Access & Health\n33 Just & Inclusive Economy\nFood Safety, Access & Health\n\nIn 2022, we welcomed a return to more normal daily routines; however, our communities faced persistent high rates of food and nutrition insecurity and chronic health conditions. We embrace our essential role in providing access to safe, fresh and affordable food to nourish millions of households across the country.\n\nFood Safety\n\nProviding safe, quality food and products for our customers and their families is Kroger\u2019s highest priority. Food safety, quality assurance and regulatory compliance are key facets of our Corporate Food Technology (CFT) practice; for our suppliers and partners, they are conditions of doing business with us. We strive to meet and exceed our stakeholders\u2019 high expectations for food safety, quality and freshness.\n\nKroger\u2019s vice president of CFT and Regulatory Compliance leads a team of scientists and technologists who oversee food and product safety and quality assurance for our retail stores, food processing facilities, warehouses and dedicated fulfillment centers. They monitor food integrity and purity, product size and specifications, and advise on food safety best practices, allergens, process controls, legislation, regulations and opportunities for improvement. Kroger\u2019s executive leadership team and Public Responsibilities Committee of the board have primary oversight to food safety.\n\nWe follow a risk-based management approach, which focuses on preventing foodborne illness through a culture of continuous improvement and accountability. Key areas include associate training on food safety policies and process controls, facility food safety audits, performance monitoring and analysis, and efficient recall management.\n\nKroger has been an active member in The Consumer Goods Forum for many years, including its Coalition of Action on Food Safety: the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI). The GFSI brings together 45 retailers and manufacturers from around the world and an extended food safety community to oversee food safety standards for businesses and help provide access to safe food for people everywhere.\n\nMaterial Topics:\n- Food Safety\n- Non-Food Product Safety\n- Food & Product Access & Affordability\n- Local Communities\n- Health & Nutrition\n- Customer Experience\n- Retail Security\nPractices & Process Controls\nDuring the past two years, Kroger increased the size of the CFT team to provide additional oversight and more frequent product testing to continually improve customer satisfaction. The team tests Kroger-manufactured items for safety and quality; conducts food safety audits at all Kroger facilities; reviews third-party audits of suppliers\u2019 facilities for compliance; works with regulatory agencies and suppliers to manage recalls affecting Our Brands and national brand products; and advises the Corporate Affairs team on recall communications, policy development and advocacy.\n\nEvery year, the CFT team updates cleaning protocols and master sanitation and cleaning schedules at all facilities, reflecting best practices from Ecolab. Some cleaning protocols put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic are now standard procedures at our facilities. We have strict governance in place to ensure our own facilities and suppliers adhere to food safety requirements and process controls (including critical cold chain management guidelines), and the team monitors Kroger\u2019s operational performance on food safety training, audits and inspections.\n\nSupermarkets\nAcross our stores, food safety managers help ensure compliance with federal, state and local regulations through our risk prevention strategy, which focuses on:\n\n- Associate training\n- Food safety process controls\n- Store sanitation\n- Audits and food safety reviews\n\nThey also participate in food safety organizations and industry groups to stay informed of new developments and share best practices. In 2022, Kroger continued to train new Fresh department associates in food safety practices; however, annual company-wide training numbers are not yet available due to our transition to a new learning platform.\n\nKroger completed nearly 14,400 in-store food safety audits in 2022.\n\nManufacturing Facilities\nAll Kroger-operated food manufacturing facilities are certified to Safe Quality Food Institute standards, and every plant has an assigned Quality Assurance Manager and a Safe Quality Food Practitioner. We manufacture 45% of Our Brands food items at 32 food processing plants across the country, using quality control plans (QCPs) from the ingredient level all the way to the finished product. The plans are adjusted according to various inputs, including customer comments.\n\nOur manufacturing food safety risk mitigation strategy includes:\n\n- Leadership and training\n- Hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls\n- Sanitation control\n- Food allergen control\n- Environmental monitoring programs\n- Audits and food safety reviews\n- Recall management\n\nSupply Chain\nKroger seeks to have all distribution and fulfillment centers that store food achieve GFSI standards for warehouse and distribution facilities by 2025. To support this transition, a new Corporate Supply Chain Food Safety Manager oversees all food safety and regulatory programs in these facilities. In 2022, we conducted preliminary external audits for 38 warehouses that store and distribute food.\n\nDistribution Centers\nManagement responsibilities are outlined in our food safety and sanitation standards, and associates implement formal documented programs, including site-specific Food Safety Plans.\n\nKroger\u2019s distribution centers follow established cold chain management standards to help ensure temperature-sensitive products are managed properly in transit and storage. This is of particular importance during inbound and outbound transportation.\n\nKey elements of these standards include:\n\n- Food safety responsibility and documented practices\n- Proper receipt and storage of materials\n- Cleaning practices\n- Maintenance for food safety\n- Pest prevention to avoid food adulteration\n\nFulfillment Centers\nOur fleet of refrigerated Kroger Delivery trucks, which can store up to 20 orders, are designed to keep food safe and fresh for customers while being delivered to their doorstep. In addition to our warehouse food safety standards, we implement further process controls to manage ambient, chilled and frozen product at our dedicated Kroger Delivery fulfillment centers. Powerful machine learning algorithms optimize delivery routes, considering factors such as road conditions and optimal fuel use to deliver food safely and efficiently.\n\nAllergens\nKroger carefully manages federal requirements for food safety regarding allergens. Known allergens required on labels include peanuts, tree nuts, dairy, egg, wheat, fish, crustacean shellfish, soy and sesame. Effective January 1, 2023, food manufacturers were required to include sesame as an allergen on all labels to align with the U.S. Food Allergy Safety, Treatment, Education and Research Act. Kroger modified all labels for Our Brands and made-in-store products containing sesame and those that may come into contact with sesame during production. In addition, Kroger-operated manufacturing plants amended allergen control programs to account for sesame.\nRecall Management\n\nProducts are removed from sale for many reasons, including incorrect package labels, undeclared allergens and, on rare occasions, the risk of illness or injury. Because our customers\u2019 safety is our highest priority, Kroger is a leader in recall management and communications. We consistently meet and exceed industry and government standards for recalls and product withdrawals. Our experienced team of experts coordinate recalls with suppliers, regulatory agencies and our own network of food safety specialists and recall managers. This 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week process focuses on identifying items to be recalled or withdrawn from our distribution network and retail stores and working with appropriate teams to ensure the recalled items are quickly removed from sale. We also investigate the issue, take corrective action and modify or create programs to minimize or eliminate similar issues in the future.\n\nKroger was one of the first retailers to implement a personalized customer notification system for certain types of recalls. Using our customer loyalty database, we can identify shoppers who may have purchased a specific recalled item. If a recall involves a possible health risk\u2014such as an undeclared allergen or potential foodborne illness\u2014we immediately activate our notification systems to alert customers quickly through register receipt messages and automated phone calls. Kroger also offers a toll-free Customer Service Center and information line staffed with professionals who can answer questions about food safety and items that may have been recalled.\n\nIn 2022, the Kroger team managed a total of 83 recall events. Of these, 39 were Class I product recalls, including 29 related to food products. Three of these Class I recalls involved Our Brands products; however, none were for items produced in a Kroger-operated manufacturing facility. As in previous years, recalls for undeclared allergens continue to be a primary cause of Class I recalls.\n\nEnabling Faster Recalls\n\nThe Kroger Technology & Digital team is working with CFT and other departments to develop systems to enable product and data mapping at every step of an item\u2019s journey through the supply chain. This will enable future compliance with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) and Food Traceability Final Rule, which takes effect in January 2026. This legislation is designed to enhance supply chain traceability and enable faster identification and removal of certain foods for consumers\u2019 safety.\n\nWe completed initial systems design work for data mapping and began building the system in mid-2023. Kroger is prioritizing products specified as high risk on the FDA\u2019s Food Traceability List; ultimately, we plan to extend these capabilities to all food and non-food items sold across retail stores and e-commerce channels.\n\nIn addition to enabling faster recalls, this critical work will connect to other supplier management tools and improve supply chain accountability and compliance with relevant sourcing policies.\n\nNon-Food Product Safety\n\nProduct Safety & Quality\n\nOur Brands non-food products adhere to a multifaceted program to help ensure quality. We work with carefully selected suppliers that have been vetted and that adhere to compliance requirements as outlined in our centralized Supplier Hub, including third-party Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certifications.\n\nAll products undergo evaluation and standard-setting during the development process. Product quality is designed into the process from the start through preliminary analytical testing, technical document review, product specification concurrence between Kroger and the supplier, and a first production review prior to release. After introducing the product to market, we continue to monitor and maintain quality. New products are tested by a third-party laboratory after six months in market, and we use a risk-based approach to conduct third-party testing for mature products.\n\nKroger monitors and documents all customer feedback, which is also reviewed and addressed by our technical team and the supplier for continual improvement. Kroger\u2019s CFT and Regulatory Compliance teams also monitor regulatory activity over time related to product safety and ingredients to help ensure continued product safety and compliance.\n\nInformation about product regulatory compliance is available in the Business Ethics & Compliance section.\nFood & Product Access & Affordability\n\nWith access to healthy, affordable food more important than ever today, we continue to advance our Purpose and brand promise, Fresh for Everyone\u2122. Kroger serves millions of customers daily with low prices, special promotions and personalized offers to help stretch budgets and make cooking at home more delicious and affordable.\n\nIn 2022, our combined paper and digital coupons helped our customers save more than $1.4 billion, in addition to everyday promotions and discounts. This focus on increasing access to healthy food is central to Kroger\u2019s Zero Hunger | Zero Waste impact plan, which aims to create communities free of hunger and waste. Our key focus areas include:\n\n- Expanding the reach of our core operations and seamless digital ecosystem of brick-and-mortar stores and home delivery services, and expanding online access and payment via EBT\n- Operationalizing store and facility best practices and Zero Hunger | Zero Waste programs to recover and redistribute more wholesome surplus food in our communities\n- Aligning charitable giving to improve food and nutrition security at national and local levels\n\n1.4B+\nin customer savings through our combined paper and digital coupons in 2022\n\nOwnership for relevant food access policies, programs and progress is shared among several lines of business and corporate functions, including Retail Operations, Merchandising, Sourcing, e-commerce and Corporate Affairs. The company\u2019s executive leadership team and Public Responsibilities Committee of the board provide additional oversight.\n\nExpanding Our Reach\n\nOur approach to increasing access to high-quality, affordable food and other items centers on our convenient neighborhood locations and seamless digital shopping platform. In 2022, we significantly expanded the Kroger Delivery fulfillment center network, unlocking greater access to fresh, affordable food for more customers across 14 states. We operate eight dedicated fulfillment centers and a fleet of delivery vehicles to bring groceries to even more customers in existing and new geographies.\n\nKroger continues to meet the requirements set by the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service to accept EBT payments online. In 2023, we accelerated the rollout of capabilities to accept EBT payments online for customers eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Access Program (SNAP) and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). We expect to complete this rollout later this year to all geographies, removing some barriers to food access like store location and transportation.\n\nCustomers looking to save money can also take advantage of Boost by Kroger Plus, our affordable membership program that offers reduced Pickup and Delivery fees. For more details about Kroger Delivery and Boost, see Customer Experience.\n\nStore Best Practices\n\nOur Retail Operations team oversees store-level programs to maximize the amount of fresh food that fulfills its highest purpose: Feeding people. As fresh food nears its use-by date, our systems prompt associates to reduce prices for faster sale, making nutritious foods even more affordable for shoppers. In 2022, we also changed how and where we merchandise our popular markdown programs in stores to increase visibility and customer engagement. For online shoppers, the Kroger Delivery team designed a \u201cflash sale\u201d feature that highlights high-inventory items every day, offering customers special discounts to save even more.\n\nWe continue to optimize our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Food Rescue program to recover safe, nutritious surplus food for local hunger relief agencies to distribute. In 2022, our Retail Operations team achieved 100% store participation across all geographies, meaning every store is actively donating items. Company-wide, our associates rescued 106 million pounds of surplus food last year, up 11% from 2021.\n\nThis reversed a slightly declining trend in food rescue during the pandemic due to supply chain constraints and reduced agency capacity to pick up surplus food. We also achieved our goal to strike a better balance of surplus food donations, in line with federal nutrition guidelines, and provide more nutrient-dense surplus food to our communities. In 2022, 45% of food donated through our food rescue program came from fresh Produce, Deli and Dairy departments.\n\nWe continue to look for opportunities to improve program execution through associate training and innovations in technology and last-mile logistics. Innovations like automated markdown technology will allow us to more efficiently lower the prices on relevant food items in more store departments, in turn reaching more customers. We plan to conduct additional pilots across multiple business units to test new ideas for optimizing markdowns and food rescue in the year ahead.\n\nMore information about Kroger\u2019s Zero Hunger | Zero Waste plan is available on our website.\nFighting Hunger\n\nKroger is a generous community partner. In 2022, Kroger\u2019s charitable giving totaled $336 million company-wide; of that, $253 million focused on improving food access and food security in our communities. This includes the value of surplus food donations and charitable donations for hunger relief.\n\nAfter introducing Zero Hunger | Zero Waste in 2017, we strategically aligned the company\u2019s charitable giving to national, regional and local organizations and programs that feed more people. In 2022, we directed a total of nearly 600 million meals to our communities, bringing our cumulative total to 2.9 billion meals.\n\nSupporting Our Communities\n\n| Year | Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Food Rescue & Other Food Donations (pounds) | Corporate & Foundation Charitable Donations (dollars) | Total Meals Directed to Communities |\n|------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| 2017 | 91M         | $200M                                                | 325M                                                |\n| 2018 | 100M        | $192M                                                | 316M                                                |\n| 2019 | 101M        | $205M                                                | 493M                                                |\n| 2020 | 90M         | $213M                                                | 640M                                                |\n| 2021 | 94M         | $210M                                                | 546M                                                |\n| 2022 | 106M        | $253M                                                | 599M                                                |\n| Total| 582M        | $1.3B                                                | 2.9B meals                                           |\nLocal Communities\n\nKroger\u2019s goal is to be a trusted and welcome partner in the communities we call home. Our business, facility and Corporate Affairs leaders proactively engage public officials and other community stakeholders to understand priorities, listen to concerns and address unique local needs. We encourage our leaders and associates to give back where they work and live through volunteer service, with leaders often serving as non-profit board members.\n\nKroger\u2019s management approach to community engagement is led by a centralized Corporate Affairs function with oversight from the Public Responsibilities Committee of the board. Business and Corporate Affairs leaders engage federal, state and local elected leaders and community representatives, lead public policy advocacy, and advance positive social impact in our communities.\n\nWe aim to build stronger, more resilient communities by supporting efforts that align with our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste plan; improve food and nutrition security; advance diversity, equity and inclusion; and provide disaster relief. Long-standing relationships with national organizations also provide key services in our local communities. These include the American Red Cross, Feeding America and its network of affiliated local food banks, No Kid Hungry and World Wildlife Fund (WWF), among others.\n\n$336M in total charitable giving to our communities in 2022\n\nGiving Back\n\nKroger has a long history of generous community support. In 2022, in-kind product donations for hunger relief and nutrition support were supplemented by corporate donations and grants from Kroger; The Kroger Co. Foundation, our private foundation; and The Kroger Co. Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Foundation, a registered public charity. In all, we directed $336 million to our communities in food and funds, providing nearly 600 million meals and other essential support.\n\nWe also engage Kroger shoppers in our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste mission, offering easy ways for customers to give back by rounding up their purchase to the nearest dollar to benefit The Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Foundation, or by donating directly in-store or online. The foundation follows best practices to responsibly steward these funds to eligible community organizations, including local food banks, disaster relief agencies, non-profits that advance sustainability and more.\n\nIn 2022, we activated a new visual enhancement at self-checkout locations across our retail divisions to encourage customers to Round Up to end hunger. Through Kroger Community Rewards, we also facilitate fundraising for thousands of local non-profit organizations across our communities. The program enables customers to direct a portion of our charitable giving to any eligible non-profit of their choice. Customers simply enroll in Community Rewards, link their shopper\u2019s card to the eligible local 501(c)(3) organization of their choice, and shop in-store or online using their card. The organizations receive quarterly donations based on the number of enrolled customers and total linked purchases. In 2022, we directed $46.6 million in giving to local organizations through Kroger Community Rewards.\n\nSupporting the Military\n\nKroger provides essential support and services through the United Service Organizations (USO) for our nation\u2019s active-duty service members and their families. The Kroger Family of Companies is the largest cumulative donor in the USO\u2019s history, with financial support of more than $41 million since 2010.\n\nIn 2022, we introduced the first of three mobile Kroger + USO canteens that will travel across the country to military training and mission locations, as well as to rapid-response deployments to nourish military service members and communities experiencing natural disasters.\n\nThe remaining two mobile canteens were introduced in May 2023. These three canteens will be stationed in Atlanta, Kansas City and Salt Lake City to support service members wherever they are deployed in the U.S.\n\nFor more details on our foundation grant-making programs, please see The Kroger Co. Foundation\u2019s 2023 Report and The Kroger Co. Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Foundation\u2019s 2023 Report.\nHealth & Nutrition\n\nWe seek to offer Kroger associates and customers easy ways to live a healthier lifestyle, believing in the power of fresh food to nourish families and improve health. Through our core retail operations, Kroger Health business and more, we advance food access, nutrition and health through products and services, customer and community engagement, and strategic philanthropy.\n\nThe company\u2019s approach to health and nutrition encompasses multiple lines of business and functions, from Merchandising and Retail Operations to Kroger Health, e-commerce and Marketing. We aim to offer customers easy ways to live a healthier lifestyle when shopping with Kroger in stores and online, including through health services offered by our pharmacies, The Little Clinic and our dietitians. We also advance food access, nutrition and health at the national and local levels through strategic philanthropy and community engagement. Our executive leadership team and the board\u2019s Public Responsibilities Committee oversee progress on our health and nutrition programs, and pharmacy and clinic safety measures.\n\nFood as Medicine\n\nKroger believes in the power of food to nourish families and improve health. Our Food as Medicine platform aims to deliver a personalized approach to eating and enjoying food to help people live healthier lives and prevent illness before it starts.\n\nIn 2022, Kroger outlined new efforts to create healthier communities and support the U.S. National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition and Health, including:\n\n- Collaborating with The Rockefeller Foundation and American Heart Association (AHA) to mobilize $250 million for a national Food as Medicine research initiative to improve health and well-being, reduce health care costs for insured populations and improve health equity\n\nThe Rockefeller Foundation-AHA national research initiative will continue to evolve in the coming years to test food-related interventions to improve health and validate results through comprehensive clinical trials. Kroger looks forward to exploring new ways to scale food-related interventions and solutions with the potential to improve population health and reduce health care costs.\n\nKroger Health\n\nOur Kroger Health business leads the company\u2019s health services strategy and programs. Kroger Health includes retail, mail order, central fill and specialty pharmacy operations; retail health clinics; nutrition and dietitian services; and health advocacy. A team of 24,000 health care practitioners, including pharmacists, nurse practitioners, dietitians and technicians, serves over 17 million customers annually.\n\nKroger Health also offers business and community solutions for government entities and other health payers, including health plan providers and Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nNutrition Insights & Personalization\nKroger recognizes that making healthy food choices can be challenging, so we developed OptUP, a nutrition rating system to simplify choosing nourishing foods while shopping. It helps our customers in three unique ways:\n\n\u2022 **Nutrition ratings:** Driven by Kroger\u2019s team of expert registered dietitians, OptUP nutrition ratings use data science, evidence-based nutrition information and machine learning to rate foods on a scale from 1 to 100. The more nutritious the food, the higher the nutrition rating. OptUP nutrition ratings are available on www.kroger.com and the Kroger app to help customers compare the healthfulness of different products and select what\u2019s right for them.\n\n\u2022 **OptUP scores:** OptUP scores are personalized nutrition and health insights based on household purchases over time. While nutrition ratings depict the healthfulness of single items, an OptUP score provides insight into macro trends by enabling customers to see the nutritional value of their grocery purchases over time. Scores range from 10\u20131,000; generally, customers are encouraged to aim to score above 600.\n\n\u2022 **Better-for-You Products:** Backed by a proprietary science that identifies similar, substitutable products with a higher nutrition rating, our online Better-for-You feature highlights alternatives to make choosing healthier options simple. Our customers can find the Better-for-You carousel on www.kroger.com and the Kroger app.\n\nMillions of customers have engaged with these nutritional insights to date and, in 2022, 20% of Kroger customers using our digital ecosystem engaged with the Better-for-You carousel while shopping.\n\nBeyond OptUP, we help improve nutrition security through other products and services, including our Telenutrition service offering two-way video chat appointments available across the U.S. with Kroger Health registered dietitians; Kroger Health Food Boxes, dietitian-curated boxes of nourishing, shelf-stable food shipped nationwide; and Welsana, our Diabetes Prevention Program designed to help diabetes patients manage their condition and enjoy healthier lives.\n\nResearch & Clinical Trials\nCritical health research and clinical trials often struggle to meet enrollment targets and engage a diverse group of participants. In 2022, Kroger Health established a clinical trial site network in conjunction with the pharmaceutical industry, contract research organizations and health systems. With select Kroger pharmacies and The Little Clinic locations serving as clinical trial sites, we are bringing research opportunities to the communities where customers live, work and eat.\n\nIn collaboration with Persephone Biosciences, Kroger Health launched the ARGONAUT clinical study to identify microbiome-based biomarkers indicative of colorectal cancer. Select Kroger pharmacies and The Little Clinic locations across Toledo, OH, enrolled people with a variety of colorectal cancer risk levels to advance the understanding of gut and immune health. Kroger Health plans to enroll additional participants and add locations.\n\nThe ARGONAUT study is the first of many Kroger clinical trial opportunities that will provide an alternative to the traditional clinical trial and research organization model. This marks the company\u2019s first trial in active recruitment as we work to advance health care research, prevent disease and improve health outcomes for the people we serve.\n\nHealth Equity & Advocacy\nKroger recognizes that upstream factors like existing policies and legislation affect equitable access to health services. We are working with policymakers to design and fund initiatives that increase patient access to more nutritious foods and expert nutrition advice while measuring outcomes to promote widespread adoption across our health ecosystem.\n\nIn 2022, Kroger Health expanded federal advocacy efforts to promote policies that increase the accessibility and affordability of our health care services. This includes extending scope-of-practice laws to enable our providers to practice at the top of their training and education. It also includes promoting novel approaches to help patients lead healthier lives by linking better eating habits with improved health outcomes.\nPrescription Drug Awareness\n\nKroger Health offers solutions to help customers manage medications safely at home. In 2018, Kroger Health joined EVERFI from Blackbaud to create its Prescription Drug Safety Education curriculum for high school students. During the past five years, the program expanded to include 14 geographies across the U.S., reaching more than 100,000 students in 1,300 schools.\n\nThe Prescription Drug Safety Education curriculum focuses on raising awareness and encouraging students to make safe decisions around prescription medications. It helps students manage difficult situations and choices in high school and beyond.\n\nOf students participating in the program:\n\n- 80% reported being able to identify signs of prescription medication misuse\n- 83% said they understood ways to avoid misusing prescription drugs\n- 79% were confident in their ability to help someone who demonstrates the signs of misusing prescription drugs\n\nTo further reduce prescription medication misuse, Kroger Health, Cardinal Health Foundation, DisposeRx\u00ae and local police stations typically host drug take-back events twice a year at pharmacy locations across the country. In the past five years, the program has collected and properly disposed of 128,000 pounds of medications and served more than 58,000 visitors across 34 states.\n\nEncouraging Vaccinations\n\nThe National Institutes of Health notes that vaccine-preventable diseases cost the country $27 billion annually in lost wages and increased health care costs. Kroger Health provides a range of routine immunizations to prevent infection and the spread of serious diseases, in addition to resources on recommended vaccines for consumers based on their age group.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Kroger Health collaborated with businesses and non-profit organizations to host pop-up vaccine clinics, and now Kroger Health offers the same service for flu, COVID-19 and any industry- or school-related vaccines. Since earning the 2022 American Pharmacists Association Immunization Champion Award, Kroger Health expanded the number of trained providers in their clinics and pharmacies, improving availability via the online scheduler and offering faster response to walk-in patients seeking vaccines. During the past two years, non-COVID-19 vaccine growth shows these investments are working and improving community vaccination rates.\n\nPromoting Wellness\n\nIn 2022, we hosted the Kroger Wellness Festival in Cincinnati to engage consumers and promote health and wellness. Nearly 125,000 visitors participated in the two-day event, which featured family-friendly interactive workshops, group fitness activities, celebrity appearances and cooking demonstrations, free concerts and more. The next Kroger Wellness Festival will take place in September 2023 in Cincinnati.\nCustomer Experience\n\nKroger operates conveniently located retail supermarkets and a digital ecosystem serving over 60 million households in our communities every year. The company\u2019s Leading with Fresh and Accelerating with Digital strategy seeks to deliver fresh, friendly and full shopping experiences every day, no matter how customers choose to shop with us. Our approach to customer experience and satisfaction is overseen by our executive leadership team and Marketing, Merchandising, Retail Operations and e-commerce departments and integrated across all lines of business and functions.\n\nWe measure performance using sales, operations and customer satisfaction metrics. Kroger and its banner stores consistently rank among top loyalty programs for retail supermarkets.\n\nTo serve our customers, Kroger offers more than 2,200 pickup locations, 2,500 delivery locations and home delivery through eight Kroger Delivery fulfillment centers and with Instacart. From a digital perspective, 98% of our customers have access to delivery through our seamless Pickup and Delivery ecosystem, including nearly 23 million people who engaged with us online in 2022.\n\n98% of our customers have access to delivery through our seamless Pickup and Delivery ecosystem.\n\nStrategic Areas of Focus\n\nKroger\u2019s business strategy focuses on four areas: Fresh, Our Brands, Personalization and Seamless, growing our customer base and creating a unique customer value proposition that will serve the business in many economic environments.\n\n\u2022 Fresh: We continue to bring our brand promise\u2014Fresh for Everyone\u2122\u2014to life across the company. Today, 92% of customers buy fresh products from Kroger, demonstrating its level of importance. In 2022, Kroger rolled out a new End-to-End Fresh program across 1,400 stores to increase freshness and extend shelf life in our customers\u2019 homes.\n\n\u2022 Our Brands: Kroger\u2019s affordable Our Brands products continue to resonate with customers, particularly amid a challenging inflationary environment. Our Brands identical sales increased 10.1% in 2022, again demonstrating they are a customer favorite and competitive differentiator. We introduced a new Smart Way opening price point product line, which consolidates and simplifies several brands into one, making it easier for customers to find the most affordable options. We also celebrated the 10th anniversary of the Simple Truth\u00ae brand, which includes more than 1,500 unique natural and organic products and achieved more than $3 billion in sales last year.\n\n\u2022 Personalization: Our data science teams are using predictive science to serve customers the right products at the right time at the best value. Because we understand our customers, we provide recommendations to start their baskets and deliver personalized offers on the products most important to them, saving them time and money. In return, we gain customer trust and loyalty, and we are consistently ranked among the best at offering personalized savings and solutions that meet our customers\u2019 needs.\n\nIn 2022, digital engagement reached an all-time high as customers looked for more ways to save. We launched the Boost by Kroger Plus membership program to offer new ways to shop and save. Early results are encouraging, and we continue to evolve the program.\n\nIn 2023, we are making significant investments to build out our personalization capabilities, including increasing the use of real-time data to predict customer needs, which will support sales growth during the next three years.\n\n\u2022 Seamless: As our digital footprint expands, Kroger aims to offer a seamless experience that allows customers to shift easily between store shopping, pickup and delivery. In 2022, digital sales increased 12%. Kroger Delivery customers are more engaged across our entire ecosystem, spending more and shopping with Kroger more often. Next, we are focused on reaching new customers and adding more shopping occasions. Solutions like Kroger Delivery Now, enabled by our vast network of conveniently located stores, connects customers to fresh groceries and household essentials in as little as 30 minutes.\nKroger Delivery Expands\n\nDedicated fulfillment centers, powered by Ocado Group since 2018, have achieved a significant step up in geographic penetration and customer satisfaction. We opened our first dedicated Kroger Delivery fulfillment centers in 2021 and continued to expand the network in 2022. Today, we operate eight fulfillment centers in Monroe, OH; Groveland, FL; Forest Park, GA (Atlanta); Pleasant Prairie, WI; Dallas, TX; Romulus, MI (Detroit); Aurora, CO; and Frederick, MD. Additional locations are slated for California; Phoenix, AZ; Cleveland, OH; Charlotte, NC; as well as in South Florida and the Northeast.\n\nKroger Delivery is a vertically integrated network, enabling coverage of up to 90 miles from the hub location. Additional spoke facilities in key geographies serve as last-mile cross-dock locations that expand our ability to serve more customers. As orders near their delivery times, the automated system retrieves products to be sorted for delivery in an algorithm-governed process that ensures items are intelligently sorted. For example, fragile items are placed on top, bags are evenly weighted and each order is optimized to fit into the fewest bags, reducing plastic use.\n\nLoyalty Strategy\n\nMore than 60 million loyal households are enrolled in our popular Kroger Plus loyalty program. Membership unlocks special pricing, fuel discounts, digital offers and more, including the chance to direct a portion of the company\u2019s charitable giving to local non-profit organizations through Kroger Community Rewards.\n\nCustomer feedback demonstrates the strength of our loyalty program: 82% of members are satisfied with the program and 79% agree it helps them save money. Kroger\u2019s loyalty program was ranked #1 in the Grocery & Drug sector in The Loyalty Report\u2122 2022 by Bond Brand Loyalty. Newsweek also recognized Kroger for having one of America\u2019s Best Loyalty Programs again in 2023.\n\nBoost by Kroger Plus\n\nIn 2022, we announced the national launch of Boost by Kroger Plus, the industry\u2019s most affordable grocery delivery membership program. For either $59 or $99 per year, Boost provides customers with benefits like unlimited free delivery on orders of $35 or more and 2X Fuel Points for every $1 spent on groceries and general merchandise purchases through Delivery, Pickup and in stores. Kroger estimates the membership can save customers more than $1,000 per year on grocery deliveries and fuel. In the program\u2019s first year, Boost by Kroger Plus members saved a total of more than $115 million.\n\nCustomer Insights\n\nKroger\u2019s Net Promoter Scores\u2122\u2014measures of customer and stakeholder approval\u2014continue to improve for both in-store shopping and Pickup services, reflecting ongoing improvements in wait times, items in stock and customer service. Social listening capabilities help us monitor how customers talk about Kroger on social media across a range of topics. Satisfaction surveys and purchasing insights\u2014using proprietary 84.51\u00b0 data science and tools\u2014also inform improvements in service, product quality and item assortment. We apply customer equity capabilities to understand how Kroger is perceived relative to our competitors, and we continue to see improvement in areas like digital, fresh items and personalization.\nRetail Security\n\nRetail Store Safety\nSafety has long been a core value for Kroger. We are committed to protecting our customers and each other with secure workplaces and stores. In an ever-changing environment, we monitor and implement best practices in associate training, preparedness and prevention. Safety and loss prevention teams in Retail Operations and Supply Chain functions lead efforts to enhance safety and security with oversight from Kroger\u2019s executive leadership team and Public Responsibilities Committee of the board.\n\nIn 2023, reflecting increased safety incidents and threats across the retail industry, Kroger is taking additional steps to increase safety for our associates and customers.\n\nPersonal Safety\nWorking collaboratively with law enforcement and other authorities, we monitor risk and take proactive steps to protect our associates, customers and communities. We incorporate safety principles and best practices into facility and parking lot designs, including mobile security units and real-time video monitoring to prevent and deter safety incidents. Through a combination of Kroger and third-party services, we provide security presence at relevant stores, depending on local needs.\n\nWe also create and implement training programs to foster safe and secure workplaces. We require associates to carefully review a Personal Safety training program first introduced company-wide several years ago, achieving a 98% completion rate in 2022. This training focuses on increasing awareness of what to do in the event of an active assailant in our facilities. We believe this training could also provide life-saving knowledge for incidents that occur outside our walls.\n\nIf unexpected events occur on-site, we focus on how to care for our associates holistically, both at home and at work. Kroger\u2019s comprehensive benefits include free counseling and access to a well-being assistant 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We also provide specialized toolkits and training for leaders to understand how best to support their teams and have thoughtful conversations with associates about their well-being.\n\nTo support recovery for affected associates, customers and communities, we also support local victims\u2019 advocacy groups and provide resources to help people heal and restore balance to their lives.\n\nPreventing Theft & Loss\nKroger\u2019s Asset Protection team employs sophisticated systems to minimize theft from our stores and reduce product losses. This includes technology aimed at reducing loss at self-checkout stations and other innovative systems. Alongside the Buy Safe America Coalition, Kroger has been on the forefront of supporting legislation that curbs the impact of organized retail crime. Organized retail crime continues to plague the industry through large-scale theft of items, which are often sold on e-commerce platforms without verification of how the seller obtained the goods. We believe our work helps protect our associates and customers while advancing safer communities.\n\nMost recently, Kroger supported the Integrity, Notification and Fairness in Online Retail Marketplaces for Consumers Act (INFORM Consumers Act), which became law in December 2022 as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023. The INFORM Consumers Act is designed to make it easier for shoppers to identify exactly who they are buying from and make it harder for deceitful sellers to avoid identification.\n\nFirearm Policy\nKroger continues to follow local laws regarding open carry policies; in addition, we ask our associates and customers not to bring firearms to Kroger facilities, even in communities where it\u2019s permitted. Several years ago, the Fred Meyer retail division exited the firearms and ammunition category. Those products\u2014which were only sold at Fred Meyer stores\u2014represented a negligible share of company sales at the time.\nJust & Inclusive Economy\n\nKroger offers access to employment, personalized development and career advancement for thousands of people every year. Many associates come to us for a part-time job and discover a fulfilling career. We strive to hire people who reflect the communities we serve and create a respectful and welcoming work environment where everyone can thrive.\n\nOverview\n\nHuman Capital Management\n\nSince 1883, we have taken pride in bringing together diverse teams with a passion for food and people to fulfill Our Purpose\u2014To Feed the Human Spirit\u2122. We value and respect our associates and appreciate their efforts to deliver fresh and friendly experiences for our customers and uplift our communities. That\u2019s why we are committed to making investments that help them feed their futures.\n\nKroger\u2019s Chief People Officer leads efforts to support, inform and advocate for our associates by providing oversight to the company\u2019s Human Resources, Labor Relations and Corporate Affairs functions. Guided by Our Purpose and Values, these groups\u2014along with human resources professionals across the business\u2014focus on advancing our human capital management strategy to support individual and company success. A Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) team also monitors and measures progress on human capital management metrics and identifies opportunities to further support associate engagement and belonging.\n\nA dedicated People Analytics team within the Human Resources & Labor Relations function is responsible for analyzing and reporting key information about our workforce, including demographics, hiring, training and advancement, engagement, and retention data.\n\nThe board\u2019s Compensation & Talent Development Committee oversees progress on human capital management topics.\n\nKroger has publicly disclosed our EEO-1 reports on our ESG Hub.\n\nMaterial Topics:\n- 2022 Workforce Overview\n- Talent Attraction, Engagement & Retention\n- Labor Relations\n- Diversity, Equity & Inclusion\n- Associate Health, Safety & Well-Being\n\n2022 Highlights\n\n- $650M invested in associate wages and training in 2022\n- $1.9B invested in associate wages and benefits since 2018\n- $18/hour average hourly wage; $23.50/hour including benefits\n- $3.8M in emergency financial assistance for associates through our Helping Hands Fund\n- 168M learning courses completed\n2022 Workforce Overview\n\nDiversity in Our Workforce\n\n| Gender          | Full time | Part time | Total  |\n|-----------------|-----------|-----------|--------|\n| Women           | 87,700    | 119,900   | 207,600|\n| Men             | 97,400    | 113,800   | 211,200|\n| Total           | 185,100   | 233,700   | 418,800|\n\nReflecting Our Communities\n\nOur goal is to shift the demographic representation of women and people of color, both at a company and local level, to reflect our changing country, communities and local neighborhoods.\n\n| Race/Ethnicity          | U.S. Population | Kroger Operating Area Population | Kroger Associates | Totals  |\n|-------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|---------|\n| White or Caucasian      | 61.7%           | 55.1%                            | 59.3%             | 248,134 |\n| Hispanic or Latino      | 18.0%           | 21.9%                            | 13.8%             | 57,596  |\n| Black or African American| 11.9%           | 12.7%                            | 16.8%             | 70,305  |\n| Asian or Asian American | 5.1%            | 6.8%                             | 3.9%              | 16,253  |\n| Other                   | 3.4%            | 3.5%                             | 6.3%              | 24,462  |\n\nDiversity in Our Leadership Roles\n\n- **Department Leaders**: 65.1% of all Department Leaders are women or people of color, a slight decline vs. 2021\n- **Assistant Store Leaders**: 57.2% of all Assistant Store Leaders are women or people of color, a slight increase vs. 2021\n- **Store Leaders**: 48.2% of all Store Leaders are women or people of color, down 1.8% vs. 2021\n\n2022 Highlights\n\n- **6% increase in average hourly compensation in 2022 vs. 2021**\n- **28.2% increase in average hourly compensation since 2018**\n\nAverage Hourly Compensation\n\nIncludes comprehensive benefits\n\n| Year | Average Hourly Compensation |\n|------|-----------------------------|\n| 2018 | $18.36                      |\n| 2019 | $19.10                      |\n| 2020 | $19.67                      |\n| 2021 | $22.11                      |\n| 2022 | $23.50                      |\n\n24.

Kroger data as of fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022\nTalent Attraction, Engagement & Retention\n\nBecause we value and respect our associates, we strive to connect meaningfully with them throughout their employment journey, providing important opportunities to learn, grow and advance. To bring this to life, we focus on three key priorities:\n\n\u2022 Connecting and retaining our talent\n\u2022 Developing our leaders\n\u2022 Advocating for our associates and their well-being\n\nThis begins with a consistent and effective onboarding experience and continues through ongoing connections with every associate to support performance and development. The company\u2019s Human Resources & Labor Relations team manages recruiting and retention efforts, with oversight from the board\u2019s Compensation & Talent Development Committee.\n\nTalent Attraction\n\nKroger continues to evolve as an Employer of Choice, adapting and improving how we engage to attract and tap into diverse sources of talent across all lines of business and functions. This includes enhancing our early talent pipeline, recognizing that, for many associates, Kroger is their first job. We provide accessible and flexible employment options for many, including retired workers looking for work and meaningful ways to stay active in their community.\n\nIn 2022, 17% of new hires across the company were 18 years old or younger. During the past 18 months, we also welcomed more than 530 interns to our company. Kroger interns work on real projects and produce real results across all areas of the business from supermarket divisions, manufacturing and supply chain to corporate functions and our Kroger Technology & Digital team.\n\nWe successfully expanded our New Beginnings program, which offers second-chance employment opportunities to justice-impacted individuals. In the past year, we expanded the program from eight to 49 food processing and distribution facilities across 19 states. Powered by collaboration with more than 35 trusted community partners, we seek to attract and retain fair-chance talent to create opportunities for individuals to start fresh and become financially stable through gainful employment.\n\nAssociate Listening & Engagement\n\nListening plays a critical role in our ability to retain and develop our associates. We gather feedback throughout the year in a variety of forms, including our annual Associate Insights survey. In 2022, the company-wide engagement score was 56, a two-point increase from 2021. We also saw a 12% increase in survey participation this year.\n\nWhile this shows improvement, we still have work to do. Since receiving the results, we have developed and activated nearly 14,000 site- and team-based action plans to address the key areas identified by the survey, including associate belonging, overall well-being and supervisor effectiveness.\n\nAs part of our ongoing journey to listen to associates, we launched two new pulse surveys to check our progress on creating positive change for our associates. One survey assesses associate well-being, asking how associates are feeling. The other measures associate loyalty and advocacy. Together, these pulses\u2014at four intervals during the year\u2014enable us to track our progress more frequently instead of only annually. Based on the insights, we can offer additional resources for leaders and associates throughout the year to respond to feedback more quickly.\n\nDeveloping Leaders & Associates\n\nWe aim to cultivate a culture of opportunity where everyone can thrive. This includes providing tools and resources to help our associates develop skills and grow their careers.\n\nKroger offers a range of comprehensive training and development opportunities for all leaders and associates, from entry-level new hires to corporate and executive leaders. In 2022, associates company-wide completed more than 168 million learning courses to advance compliance, operational excellence and leadership development.\n\nWe also accelerated our journey with our gamified learning app Fresh Start to continue transitioning to an engaging digital onboarding and learning experience. Fresh Start is available on shared company-owned devices or associates\u2019 personal devices. It provides quick and effective training to frontline associates in an engaging format, helping them develop important skills that build confidence and capabilities to effectively serve our customers. Its flexible design allows us to quickly develop and deliver training that meets the changing needs of the business.\n\nFresh Start, along with our traditional training modalities, allows us to deliver a wide variety of information to associates at all levels, including role-based training and courses centered on service excellence, Our Purpose and Values, associate well-being and safety.\nIn 2022, we also focused on leadership development, enabling our leaders to build capabilities and effectively guide our business and our associates through the challenges of today and whatever may come next. Our highly effective leaders have a deep sense of ownership in the business and passion to improve every day, while keeping people at the heart of everything we do.\n\nKroger offers a wide range of learning tools and resources to help leaders build effective teams who live Our Purpose and deliver on our business strategy. We invest in our leaders\u2019 development by:\n\n- Participating in formal internal development programs and experiences, including our Store Leader Development Program\n- Offering an extensive catalogue of on-demand and instructor-led development courses designed to support leaders at every career level\n- Participating in regional and industry development programs\n\nEvery year, we invite assistant store managers to participate in Kroger\u2019s Store Leadership Development Program to build the foundational skills needed for future success. This 10- to 13-week program includes a mix of real-world store experiences, one-on-one training and leadership development curriculum. About 1,500 assistant store managers participated in the program in 2022.\n\nEarlier this year, we introduced a new Career Track Development Framework and an extensive leadership development course catalogue that highlights specific development opportunities to help associates at different career levels thrive in their current role and prepare for the next career opportunity. New and refreshed content is released each quarter with training, tools and resources focused on building key leadership skills and capabilities.\n\nChampioning Performance\nWe believe regular, meaningful feedback is critical to personal development and growth. To ensure associates receive timely coaching and conversations regarding their performance, we ask all managers to dedicate time and attention to coaching and developing others.\n\nThrough Kroger\u2019s Ongoing Connections performance management approach, each associate has regular performance and development conversations to set expectations and facilitate career development across team members. We also highlight available career paths to help our associates see the wide range of opportunities available for them at Kroger.\n\nTo learn more about our continued commitment to the growth and development of our associates, visit Life at Kroger.\n\nInvesting in Our Associates\nWe are committed to investing in the success of our associates. In 2022, we raised our average hourly rates by more than 6%, adding up to an incremental investment of over $1.9 billion in associate wages since 2018. Our average hourly wage is more than $18, and more than $23.50 including comprehensive benefits. We are committed to sustainably increasing our associates\u2019 wages and plan to invest more than $770 million in our associates throughout 2023.\n\nContinuing Education\nTo help associates achieve their learning goals, we offer an industry-leading continuing education assistance benefit, offering up to $3,500 annually (and up to $21,000 over the course of a career). In 2022, we expanded eligibility for this benefit with all part-time and full-time associates now eligible after 60 days of service.\n\nSince inception, the program has directed over $27 million in tuition reimbursements to nearly 6,000 associates. More than 3,000 associates, 90% of whom are hourly, participated in the program last year.\n\nModernizing Systems\nIn 2022, Kroger completed the first phase of a company-wide people system transformation, consolidating 12 legacy systems into two new systems that integrate time, payroll and HR solutions in a consistent, seamless experience for our associates and managers. With core HR management systems and payroll functionality now in place, we will continue our transformation in 2023 and early 2024 with the phased launch of remaining HR and timekeeping functionality. This investment in modernized systems is designed to help simplify and enhance the associate experience with more mobile-enabled functionality, reduced manual processes and a streamlined user interface.\n\nLabor Relations\nKroger respects our associates\u2019 rights to form and join organizations of their own choosing. We do not prevent, retaliate or discriminate against workers choosing to associate with any group (or not) or bargain collectively (or not).\n\nCollective bargaining agreements are a regular part of our business and cover many associate matters, including wages, health care and pensions. These contracts are regularly negotiated by Kroger\u2019s team of labor negotiators who follow a process and take a measured approach to each.\n\nApproximately 64% of our associates are covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with local unions affiliated with one of several different international unions. There are over 300 such agreements, usually with three- to five-year terms.\n\nIn addition to wage investments noted earlier in this section, we invested more than $280 million in our associates\u2019 pensions in 2022. Kroger also provides affordable, high-quality health care benefits to eligible associates, investing $1.2 billion annually in their health and wellness benefits.\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion\n\nKroger strives to create an environment where everyone feels respected and that they belong. As part of that work, we aim to attract, retain and develop talented associates who best reflect our communities. Because of our unique business model, we help unlock economic opportunity for nearly half a million people of various ages and aspirations\u2014from those seeking entry-level, part-time jobs to graduate-degree specialists across corporate functions.\n\nWe also aim to develop and advance diverse leaders to increasing levels of responsibility. For open leadership positions, we assemble a diverse slate of candidates for consideration. In 2023, every manager across the company is expected to actively mentor and develop an associate who has a different background from them. This, along with other goals and objectives, is used to assess the manager\u2019s performance and ultimately affects their compensation. Currently, over 90% of retail division executive leadership teams have at least one diverse leader.\n\nTo continue developing a diverse talent pipeline, we increased our strategic partnerships with historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs). This includes partnerships with diversity networks, military organizations, neurodiverse groups and others. Please see the Workforce Overview on page 34.\n\n90% of retail division executive leadership teams have at least one diverse leader\n\nA More Inclusive Culture\n\nKroger\u2019s internal DEI Advisory Council includes cross-functional leaders who are committed to advancing progress. The Council works closely with senior officers and business leaders to identify opportunities and specific actions for improvement. An Associate Influencer Group comprising hourly associates helps facilitate input and feedback from all company levels.\n\nKroger also offers 15 Associate Resource Groups (ARGs), or affinity groups, with chapters across the company. These groups enable personal connections across the Kroger Family of Companies, influence business decisions, facilitate shared experiences, encourage cross-ARG membership for awareness and promote personal and professional growth. Kroger leaders sponsor and personally engage with the ARGs, which include these communities:\n\n- African American\n- Asian\n- ECO (Environmentally Conscious Outcomes)\n- ITOPiA (embracing all personality types)\n- KePasa (for the Hispanic community)\n- Kickstart (for associates who are new to Kroger or looking for a new opportunity at Kroger)\n- Men for Equality\n- Our Abilities (disability inclusion)\n- Parents\n- Pride (LGBTQ+ inclusion)\n- Prime Timers (for associates at later stages of their careers)\n- Veterans\n- Wellness\n- Women\u2019s EDGE\n- Young Professionals\n\nFor the fourth consecutive year, Kroger was named among the Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion, earning a score of 100 on the Disability Equality Index. Kroger was also named among the 100 \u201cBest of the Decade\u201d Companies by Minority Business News.\n\nKroger earned a top score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation\u2019s 2022 Corporate Equality Index\u2014an annual assessment of LGBTQ+ workplace equality\u2014for the fourth year in a row. We provide same-sex partner benefits and transgender-inclusive health care for our associates.\n\nWe also work with the National LGBT Chamber of Commerce to create and enhance relationships with LGBTQ+ suppliers as part of our Supplier Inclusion program.\nFramework for Action: Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Highlights\n\nCreate a More Inclusive Culture\n- Enhance DEI training in leadership development\n- Offer inclusion training to all associates\n\n156K+ associates & leaders trained in 2022\n661K+ associates & leaders trained since 2020\n\nDevelop & Diversify Talent\n- Review and enhance policies and practices to promote equity; increase recruiting relationships\n- Expand regional leadership development and mentorship programs\n\nFrom 6 to 53\nenhanced relationships with multicultural schools and institutions, including HBCUs and HSIs\n\nAdvance Diverse Partnerships\n- Deepen and expand our relationship with current diverse suppliers\n- Onboard new suppliers; achieve $10B in annual diverse supplier spend by 2030\n\n100 new diverse suppliers in 2022, up 15%\n\nAdvance Equitable Communities\n- Deepen local leadership involvement and community service\n- Increase giving through The Kroger Co.

We believe managing personal health and safety is critical to our associates\u2019 well-being and our company\u2019s success.\n\nKroger\u2019s operating unit leaders and executive leadership team are responsible for our management approach to associate health and safety, with additional oversight from the Public Responsibilities Committee of the board. Business units and administrative functions follow an established approach to help protect associates\u2019 health and safety.\n\nWe extend our view of safety beyond protecting our associates physically, investing in many ways to support our associates\u2019 well-being both inside and outside of work.\n\nOSHA Standards\n\nKroger follows established policies and standards to meet or exceed relevant Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requirements, including comprehensive hazard communications and lockout/tagout plans, as well as guidelines for emergency evacuation, personal safety and personal protective equipment.\n\nIn 2022, Kroger\u2019s company-wide OSHA reportable injuries declined 5.15%, driven by a nearly 8% reduction in injuries in supermarket operations. Lost-day rates improved for both associates and contractors versus the prior year.\n\nWhere needed, we continued to deploy online training for OSHA safety requirements last year to enable associates to complete required training virtually to complement a return-to-classroom style learning. Find more details about our safety performance.\n\nRetail Stores\n\nIn the first half of 2022, we introduced a new safety program\u2014AllSafe!\u2014for associates in all retail supermarkets. We extended the program to Fred Meyer Jewelers and Pharmacy Central Fill operations associates in the second half of the year. The program is designed to increase associates\u2019 awareness and attention to personal safety and well-being.\n\nAllSafe! is grounded in four principles:\n\n- Nothing we do is worth risking injury\n- Accidents can be prevented\n- Safety will be managed\n- Safe behavior is a condition of employment for all associates\n\nKroger has detailed requirements and processes in place to prevent, review and address safety concerns in stores. Through clearly communicated expectations, routine monitoring and regular safety behavior training and reinforcement, we continue to reduce the number of injuries and accidents in our stores.\n\nDedicated on-site safety teams meet routinely to review recent injury root causes and safety audit results, and to resolve any issues. Associate health and safety policies and practices follow our established management approach:\n\n- AllSafe! teams\n- Department-specific safety requirements\n- Associate safety training and education\n- Safety 360 injury analysis and corrective action through a centralized Enterprise Compliance Management System\n- Safety observations and peer feedback\n\nSupply Chain\n\nLeaders also focus on measures to improve associates\u2019 health and safety at Kroger-operated food processing facilities, distribution centers and dedicated fulfillment centers, as well as in transit between locations. Later this year, an existing program for manufacturing with Safety in Motion\u00ae, Inc. will be extended and customized to support Kroger\u2019s new integrated Supply Chain function, which includes the farmer fleet and transportation teams.\n\nKroger also expects third-party contractors supporting supply chain operations to uphold the same worker health and safety standards. With the expansion of Kroger Delivery, we developed additional training resources to help keep associates safe in the dedicated fulfillment centers and on the road.\n\nWell-Being\n\nTo help enable our associates to thrive, we take a holistic approach to their well-being, delivering exceptional experiences that support their physical, mental and financial health.\n\nA key component of these efforts is the ongoing refinement of our competitive Total Rewards programs, which include compensation, health care benefits, retirement benefits and perks available to all associates, including those represented by collective bargaining agreements. We offer competitive benefits and pay in our stores, distribution centers, dedicated fulfillment centers, manufacturing plants, technology hubs and corporate offices.\n\nThe mental and emotional well-being of our associates is paramount. During the past two years, we accelerated efforts in this space, focusing first on our managers to better enable them to support associates and create a safe and supportive environment within their teams. In 2022, we expanded access to mental health providers for company health care plan participants and created an easy-to-navigate guide to available resources, including self-help apps, confidential counseling, family support services, fitness discounts and more. Last year, Kroger achieved gold-level certification through Mental Health America\u2019s Bell Seal for Workplace Mental Health for the second year in a row.\n\nTo support our associates\u2019 financial health, we also expanded our financial coaching benefit to our frontline hourly associates. This first-of-its-kind, one-on-one coaching program provides free confidential coaching to help associates navigate a variety of financial topics.\n\nWe continue to assess how we work and our policies and benefits to meet associates\u2019 needs more effectively, helping them prioritize their own well-being while also supporting each other.\nAs a responsible business, Kroger strives to protect the natural resources we depend on. We are focused on addressing our climate impacts and supporting resource conservation by eliminating food and operational waste, increasing efficiency and boosting the sustainability and resilience of our supply chain.\n\nIn This Section\n\n41 Climate Impact\n45 Resource Conservation\nClimate Impact\n\nJust as climate change can affect our operations and supply chain, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions produced from Kroger\u2019s operations can affect a changing climate. That\u2019s why we periodically evaluate our resilience to climate change and are taking steps to reduce our emissions.\n\nClimate Strategy\nManaging climate impacts is a core tenet of our ESG strategy. Our climate strategy includes the goals we set, the actions we take to achieve our goals and our assessment of climate risks and opportunities. We are implementing this strategy by integrating ESG topics into the way we do business, developing the business and financial plans needed to achieve our GHG-reduction goal, and continually assessing how a changing climate, evolving stakeholder expectations and other risks may affect our business.\n\nClimate Change Resilience\nTwo years ago, we conducted our first quantitative climate risk assessment to determine the likelihood of different physical climate risks, including drought, extreme heat and extreme precipitation, impacting Kroger\u2019s operations. This was assessed at representative facilities in different geographies to determine if future impacts could potentially increase operating costs for these facilities.\n\nWe used climate modeling in three scenarios reflecting different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs): median under 2\u00b0C (cool RCP 4.5 models), 2\u00b0C to 4\u00b0C (warm RCP 4.5 models), and over 4\u00b0C (RCP 8.5 models). These were taken from the 1/16\u00b0 degree localized constructive analogs (LOCA) climate dataset for 2030 and 2050 time frames.\n\nFor each physical climate risk, we also identified potential financial impacts. While we recognize the limitations of such metrics to capture the entire long-term financial impact of climate risks, they help contextualize the business impacts of physical climate risks. We concluded that, at this time, the physical risks modeled do not pose a substantive financial threat to our operations. We will revisit this analysis periodically with plans to expand it to include a climate risk assessment using scenario modeling for select parts of our supply chain.\n\nMaterial Topics:\n- Climate Change Resilience\n- Energy & GHG Emissions\n\nClimate Governance\nThe Public Responsibilities Committee of the Board of Directors reviews and guides the company\u2019s actions pertaining to corporate citizenship, including how we manage climate impacts and resilience. Within the company, multiple teams implement our climate strategy, including Retail Operations, Supply Chain, Manufacturing, Sourcing, Finance and Corporate Affairs.\n\n2022 Highlights\n-15.2% change in GHG emissions since 2018 (goal baseline)\n55.1% cumulative electricity avoided in supermarkets (compared to 2001 baseline)\n-2.2% annual change in electricity consumed in Manufacturing\n2,047 stores using infrared refrigerant leak-detection technology\nTo help prepare for and manage physical climate risks, including natural disasters and business disruptions to our supply chains, we maintain over 200 business continuity plans. We have installed technologies and processes to ensure our stores, plants and distribution network can respond quickly and remain operational. We monitor energy availability and costs to help anticipate how changing climate patterns like increasing temperatures could affect our energy-sourcing costs and activities.\n\nWe also assess the transitional climate risks due to refrigerant legislation. As a result of state and federal requirements regarding the phasedown of hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants, we anticipate steadily replacing refrigerant infrastructure across our store portfolio to reach required levels, which could incur additional costs.\n\nOngoing stakeholder engagement and market research help us understand how consumers, investors and others may be thinking about a changing climate. Based on these learnings, Kroger continues to take action on this important topic. For example, we introduced multiple products with lower carbon impacts, like upcycled grains and carbon-neutral eggs.\n\n### Energy & GHG Emissions\n\nTo manage the energy our business consumes and the GHG emissions that we produce, Kroger sets GHG-reduction targets, identifies and implements reduction projects, and measures annual emissions to track progress on our goals.\n\n#### Climate Targets\n\nIn 2020, we set a goal to reduce absolute GHG emissions from our operations by 30% by 2030 against a 2018 baseline. The goal was developed using climate science, supporting a well-below-2\u00b0C climate scenario according to the absolute contraction method. During 2022, Kroger\u2019s ESG, business unit and Finance teams developed an initial portfolio of projects to help us achieve our current GHG-reduction goal, which we will refine over time. We published our GHG Goal Roadmap in early 2023.\n\nGiven the global consensus that more urgent climate action is needed and increasing indications from stakeholders like investors that companies are expected to take meaningful action on climate change, we committed to set a new goal aligned with the requirements of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). This includes resetting our current Scope 1 and 2 emissions goal to support the 1.5\u00b0C scenario and setting new Scope 3 emissions goals, including a Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) goal. This will remain a priority throughout 2023.\n\nAdditional targets and commitments that can help reduce Kroger\u2019s GHG emissions include our current No-Deforestation Commitment and our zero-waste and sustainable packaging goals.\n\n#### Emissions Disclosure\n\nKroger\u2019s GHG emissions for 2022 are summarized below, with more details provided in the Appendix of this report and our latest CDP Climate response. Kroger uses the GHG Protocol methodology to calculate our GHG emissions.\n\nEmissions performance trends are as follows:\n\n- **Scope 1** emissions increased by 1% over the prior year. While stationary and refrigerant emissions decreased, mobile emissions increased as a result of our Delivery business expanding in the reporting year. Refrigerant emissions changes vary widely by type of refrigerant; in some cases, the increase is the result of transitioning away from ozone-depleting substances (ODSs), which are not reported in GHG inventories, to alternatives that are reported.\n\n- **Scope 2** emissions decreased by 13% (market-based) and 2% (location-based) compared to the previous year. This was achieved through energy-efficiency and energy-reduction projects, procurement of renewable energy through utility providers and changes in emissions factors.\n\n- **Scope 3** emissions decreased by 0.3% over the last year. For 2022, we calculated emissions for the following Scope 3 categories: fuel- and energy-related activities (FERA) not included in Scope 1 or Scope 2 emissions, waste generated in operations, business travel, employee commuting, processing of sold products and investments. Emissions decreased primarily due to refinements in emissions calculation methodologies. We are calculating more comprehensive Scope 3 inventories for 2021 and 2022 as part of resetting our GHG-reduction goal in alignment with SBTi requirements.\n\n#### Total Carbon Emissions\n\n| Year | Total Carbon Emissions (Scope 1 and 2; market-based)\u2014MTCO\u2082e |\n|------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2018 | 5,774,060 (baseline)                                       |\n| 2019 | 5,967,845                                                  |\n| 2020 | 5,275,845                                                  |\n| 2021 | 5,251,448                                                  |\n| 2022 | 4,894,705 (-15.2% from baseline)                            |\n\nMTCO\u2082e = metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent\nEmissions-Reduction Opportunities\n\nTo meet our emissions-reduction targets, our engineering teams identify, evaluate and implement short- and long-term projects to reduce energy consumption, move to lower-carbon energy sources and reduce excess emissions. Saving energy and reducing emissions also help decrease operating costs and offset upfront investment costs. Kroger teams often pilot new technologies to gauge their effectiveness in our retail, manufacturing and distribution network. Our GHG Goal Roadmap summarizes our goal governance process and how we anticipate achieving our goal, including the types of emissions-reduction opportunities that will help enable goal achievement.\n\nEnergy Management in Our Facilities\n\nWe track our electricity and natural gas consumption company-wide through the EnergyCAP platform. We use the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ENERGY STAR\u00ae platform for our stores to benchmark against industry peers and identify new opportunities for energy savings. So far, 13 Kroger-operated manufacturing plants have installed energy management systems to identify consumption hotspots and energy-reduction opportunities.\n\nIn 2022, we continued placing glass doors on open refrigerated cases in our stores, saving on average 225,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity and 16,000 therms of natural gas per store annually. We are also transitioning multiple areas of our stores to new or more efficient LED lighting, including our overhead lighting (35,000 kWh saved per store), parking lot lighting (100,000 kWh saved per store), open medium-temperature cases (10,000 kWh saved per store), and track lighting in our Produce department (23,000 kWh saved per store).\n\nFuel-Efficient Logistics\n\nIn our supply chain, we continue to refresh our truck fleet, replacing older vehicles with more fuel-efficient models. Trucks typically have a lifespan of eight years in our fleet. In 2022, we replaced about 200 trucks with new units.\n\nAs a long-time Partner of the U.S. EPA SmartWay program, we reduce truck miles and emissions through dynamic routing, truck speed limits, automatic shutdown for truck idling, and automatic transmissions to manage gear shifts.\n\nReducing Emissions from Refrigerants\n\nA well-managed refrigerant inventory reduces waste and costs and ensures responsible reclaim practices. During the last decade, we continued to transition away from ODSs to other refrigerants across our systems. In our stores, we use a four-pronged approach:\n\n- Proactively monitoring, mitigating and reducing leaks\n- Replacing aging refrigeration systems to improve energy efficiency and reduce refrigerant charge/emissions\n- Properly managing refrigerant inventory to reduce waste and ensure responsible reclaim practices\n- Transitioning to refrigerants with lower global warming potential (GWP)\n\nKroger is part of the U.S. EPA GreenChill program, through which we set annual targets to reduce refrigerant emissions in retail stores. During 2022, we achieved a 10% reduction in refrigerant emissions in our retail stores.\n\nKroger\u2019s Refrigerant Management Policy for our stores outlines the company\u2019s procedures and documentation for all refrigerant gas handling. Kroger has a zero-tolerance leak-rate policy to ensure refrigerant is not added to equipment until any leaks are fixed, regardless of the system or the size of the leak.\n\n---\n\nOur 2022 GHG Emissions Footprint\u2014MTCO\u2082e\n\n| Emissions Category | 2022 Emissions (MTCO\u2082e) | Year-Over-Year Change (%) |\n|--------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Scope 1 total emissions | 2,335,900 | +1% |\n| Scope 1 (stationary) | 578,392 | -4% |\n| Scope 1 (mobile) | 420,020 | +32% |\n| Scope 1 (refrigerant emissions) | 1,337,488 | -3% |\n| Scope 2, location-based (purchased electricity) | 2,695,641 | -2% |\n| Scope 2, market-based (purchased electricity) | 2,558,805 | -13% |\n| Total (S1 + S2 location-based) | 5,031,541 | -0.4% |\n| Total (S1 + S2 market-based) | 4,894,705 | -7% |\n| Scope 3 (partial) | 2,390,614 | -0.3% |\n\n28 Scope 3 emissions reflect the following categories: fuel- and energy-related activities (not included in Scope 1 or 2), waste generated in operations, business travel, employee commuting, processing of sold products and investments. The latter two categories have not been reported in earlier inventories.\nAll relevant associates and technicians must read, sign and adhere to the policy. We are actively transitioning stores to use new infrared detectors that identify lower concentrations of leaked refrigerants, with the goal of transitioning all stores by the end of 2024. To date, 2,047 stores use this new technology.\n\nWe continue to transition to lower-GWP refrigerants as they become commercially available and economically viable to meet our GHG-reduction target and to meet forthcoming state and federal requirements.\n\nStarting in California, we will ultimately achieve a portfolio GWP of under 1.4 by 2030, which translates to an approximately 15% reduction in baseline company-wide refrigerant emissions on a carbon dioxide equivalent (CO\u2082e) basis. We are implementing our strategy for aligning with forthcoming federal HFC phase-down requirements under the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act, which will occur across the business.\n\nWe already use ammonia refrigerant systems in 81% of our manufacturing plants and 20 distribution centers. In early 2023, we opened a new retail store footprint. We are working with multiple national service providers to install EV infrastructure at our stores have provided more than 8,700 MWh of electricity to local consumers through more than 886,000 charging sessions.\n\nTransiting to Renewables\n\nTo date, we have installed solar arrays at 15 facilities, generating more than 10,500 megawatt-hours (MWh) of renewable power in 2022. Of that, 6,000 MWh is claimed by Kroger as zero-carbon energy in our GHG emissions. We also operate two facilities equipped with anaerobic digestion (AD) technology, which processes food waste or food production by-products into biogas, which in turn can be converted to renewable electricity.\n\nIn 2022, Kroger proactively purchased more than 263,000 MWh of zero-carbon power from our energy providers, including from solar and wind projects in Texas and Virginia. We anticipate activating additional renewable power purchases in Cincinnati; the broader Electric Reliability Council of Texas; and PJM Interconnection for the Illinois, Ohio, Maryland and Washington, D.C. geographies by 2024.\n\nKroger is also accounting for the increasing amount of renewable energy in the grid by using utility-specific emissions factors where available.\n\nOur expanding renewable energy purchases are aligned with the company\u2019s internal renewable energy sourcing policy.\n\nElectrifying Vehicles in Our Network\n\nDuring the past several years, all new refrigerated trucks in California serving our Ralphs and Food4Less divisions have been hybrid electric/diesel trailers, which can be plugged in when stationary and can run partially off electricity to reduce diesel emissions. We will test electric on-highway vehicles\u2014including tractors, yard tractors and Kroger Delivery vans\u2014in 2023 and beyond.\n\nKroger is also increasing the availability of electric vehicle (EV) chargers for customers across our retail store footprint. We are working with multiple national service providers to install EV infrastructure in a growing number of states, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Indiana, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming, and will continue to expand to additional geographies in the coming years. Our infrastructure includes a growing percentage of new direct current (DC) super-fast chargers capable of generating 350kW\u2014several times more power than typical fast chargers\u2014in an effort to offer sustainable and convenient services to our customers. Since 2020, EV chargers installed at our stores have provided more than 8,700 MWh of electricity to local consumers through more than 886,000 charging sessions.\n\nIn 2023, Kroger\u2019s Marketing and Media teams, inclusive of our retail media business, Kroger Precision Marketing, joined the Ad Net Zero partnership to help advance the advertising industry\u2019s efforts to reduce GHG emissions. The U.S. chapter of Ad Net Zero is a coalition of more than 60 industry members who are adopting a five-point plan to measure and reduce carbon emissions in the end-to-end advertising process. Participation in this partnership will support Kroger\u2019s commitment to reduce GHG emissions in our value chain, which includes the procurement and sale of media and marketing services.\nResource Conservation\n\nAcross the value chain, our suppliers, facilities and vehicles rely on natural resources to operate. Our commitments to reduce waste, conserve water and protect biodiversity help ensure these resources are available in the future.\n\nFood Waste\n\nAs part of our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social and environmental impact plan, we set a goal to divert 95% or more of food waste from landfill in our retail stores by 2025. Together, leaders in Retail Operations, Manufacturing, Supply Chain and Corporate Affairs have shaped our zero-waste strategy and created the programs that bring it to life.\n\nFirst and foremost, we aim to sell as much food as possible in our stores. We use markdown programs in our key departments to help products sell faster, and recently, our business is testing more dynamic technology solutions to improve results. Food that can no longer be sold is donated to hunger-relief organizations across our communities to benefit those in need. In 2022, we donated 106 million pounds of surplus food to Feeding America\u2019s network of food banks and agency partners through our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Food Rescue program.\n\nFood that cannot be sold or donated is captured in food waste recycling programs currently available in 92% of our stores. Our aim is to have these programs in 95% or more of stores by the end of 2023. Food waste is recycled through a combination of animal feed, composting and anaerobic digestion (AD). We are expanding and adjusting our programs to enable greater coverage across our store footprint and make it easier to participate.\n\nIn 2023, Kroger\u2019s retail divisions are launching new and first-time programs across many stores and expanding de-packaging capabilities with companies like Divert, Inc., a company that creates technology and infrastructure to keep more food out of landfills. The de-packaging technology eliminates the need to remove food from packaging on-site, which simplifies the process for our store associates and makes it easier to recycle food waste and reduce the volume of food going to landfill.\n\nMaterial Topics:\n- Food Waste\n- Waste & Circularity\n- Biodiversity & Conservation\n- Agricultural Practices\n- Product Sustainability\n- Water\n\n2022 Highlights\n\n- 82% waste diversion from landfill company-wide\n- 26.2% cumulative reduction in retail food waste generated since 2017\n- 37% of Our Brands packaging characterized as recyclable\n- 20.4M pounds of Fair Trade Certified ingredients sourced\nWe measure and track food waste annually. With support from WWF, we established our food-waste footprint several years ago using the World Resources Institute\u2019s (WRI) Food Loss & Waste Protocol. In the last year, total food waste generated in Kroger-operated stores decreased by 8.9% to 245,289 tons (from 269,382 tons in 2021), while the percentage of food waste diverted from landfill decreased by 2.9 percentage points to 45.9% (from 48.8% in 2021). These trends illustrate our goal to recycle a greater percentage of a continually diminishing amount of wasted food.\n\nSince 2017, our baseline year, we decreased total food waste generated in our stores by 26.2% and improved our food-waste diversion rate by 18.8 percentage points. As a result of diverting 112,580 tons of retail food waste from landfill in 2022, we are avoiding an estimated 120,469 metric tons of CO\u2082e emissions.\n\nIn 2022, we continued our participation in WRI\u2019s 10x20x30 initiative and the Pacific Coast Food Waste Commitment. These engagements provide pre-competitive forums where members can share best practices, collaborate cross-functionally across the value chain and gain insight from industry experts to support our collective goals.\n\nSince 2017, our baseline year, we decreased total food waste generated in our stores by 26.2% and improved our food-waste diversion rate by 18.8 percentage points.

In our stores, distribution facilities and manufacturing plants, we focus on reducing the waste we send to landfill by implementing waste-reduction programs, reuse and recycling programs. Our sustainable packaging goals for Our Brands are intended to reduce packaging waste by increasing recyclability of materials, using more post-consumer recycled (PCR) content, removing unnecessary packaging, and providing information and means for customers to manage packaging after consumption.\n\n### Operational Waste\n\nOur zero-waste commitments are driven by leaders and associates across the business. Retail store managers oversee zero-waste initiatives in our supermarkets. Each retail division also has an Expense, Sanitation and Sustainability Manager, who supports in-store waste management. Similarly, our Supply Chain and Manufacturing teams have sustainability leads who help guide waste-reduction and waste-recovery initiatives in these facilities.\n\nWe remain focused on achieving a 90% waste-diversion rate across the business by 2025. In 2022, our company-wide waste-diversion rate was 82%, an increase from 79% in 2021. The total waste generated by our operations (before accounting for the use of reusable plastic containers in our supply chain network) increased 2%, while the amount of waste sent to landfill and waste-to-energy decreased by 4%. Food donations increased year over year, while food waste recycling via animal feed, anaerobic digestion, compost and the recycling of used cooking oil decreased slightly. This was partly due to the implementation of a new program for managing cooking oil in many of our stores, which resulted in higher efficiency in cooking oil use and less waste.\n\nWe expect to roll out this system to all stores by the end of 2023.\nTwo factors drove the large increase in compost. In 2022, we saw some stores transition from animal feed recycling programs to compost programs. We also reclassified recycled food waste from our manufacturing plants as compost instead of general recycling. Total recycling weights increased, however, plastic and cardboard recycling weights decreased. In the last year, 30 of 32 Kroger-operated manufacturing plants continued to divert more than 90% of the waste produced in their operations from landfill\u2014our definition of zero waste. We also have an increasing number of stores that achieved zero-waste operations.\n\nIn 2022, we expanded our training resources and revised our back-of-store signage for food rescue and recycling programs to clarify program operations and increase associate engagement. We are also implementing automated solutions to track program impacts and engage our associates and store managers in real time.\n\nKroger\u2019s supply network uses reusable plastic containers and crates to move produce, meat, eggs, milk and other fresh items through our distribution centers and stores. We work with third-party providers to support and expand our adoption of these pooled resources.\n\nKroger responsibly manages hazardous waste where it is generated in our operations. Across our stores, we have processes in place to manage all damaged and unsalable products that have hazardous characteristics, store-use chemicals with hazardous characteristics, non-hazardous liquid wastes. Universal-waste lamps, batteries and all pharmaceuticals are also part of our waste-management programs.\n\nThe UL WERCSmart system allows us to identify hazardous materials in our products to help ensure safe storage, transportation and disposal. Associates use WERCSmart information shared through Kroger\u2019s Hazardous Product Compliance System to identify proper handling procedures. Similarly, our plants and logistics facilities work with third-party providers for safe management of any hazardous materials in their operations.\n\nAdditionally, where markets are available, Kroger uses specialty recyclers to reuse certain unsalable chemical products and electronic waste to avoid disposal and mitigate potential environmental impacts.\n\nKroger remains focused on reducing the amount of plastic in nature as a result of our operations. We are the grocery sector lead for the Beyond the Bag Initiative of Closed Loop Partners\u2019 Consortium to Reinvent the Retail Bag. We are testing innovative internal ideas and Beyond the Bag programs to identify scalable solutions. We seek to identify interventions that will reduce consumption of single-use bags and increase the use of reusable bags, while still preserving convenience and accessibility for our customers.\n\nKroger is one of several retailers that participated in the 2023 Bring Your Own Bag pilot coordinated by the Consortium to Reinvent the Retail Bag to test whether consistent signs, marketing and prompts can help customers build the habit of bringing their bags whenever they shop. Kroger is also developing solutions to reduce or replace single-use plastic bags used in our e-commerce businesses, including Pickup and Delivery.\n\n### Waste Management Data\n\n#### Waste-Management Method\n\n| Waste-Management Method | 2021 Weight (short tons) | 2022 Weight (short tons) | 2021 to 2022 Year-Over-Year Change (%) |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Reuse                   | 134,500                  | 303,339                  | 125.5%                                 |\n| Donation                | 47,249                   | 56,938                   | 18.4%                                  |\n| Animal feed             | 81,712                   | 71,238                   | -12.8%                                 |\n| Anaerobic digestion     | 81,600                   | 80,223                   | -1.7%                                  |\n| Composting              | 41,004                   | 106,011                  | 158.5%                                 |\n| Recycling               | 1,930,830                | 1,957,826                | 1.4%                                   |\n| Cardboard               | 887,604                  | 791,303                  | -10.8%                                 |\n| Plastic                 | 33,187                   | 28,715                   | -13.5%                                 |\n| Waste-to-energy         | 34,783                   | 33,031                   | -5.0%                                  |\n| Landfill                | 560,436                  | 536,341                  | -4.3%                                  |\n\n#### Total Waste Generated (excluding reuse)\n\n| Total Waste Generated (excluding reuse) | 2021 Weight (short tons) | 2022 Weight (short tons) | 2021 to 2022 Year-Over-Year Change (%) |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Total Waste Generated (excluding reuse) | 2,777,614                | 2,840,608                | 2.3%                                   |\n\n#### Total Waste Footprint (including reuse)\n\n| Total Waste Footprint (including reuse) | 2021 Weight (short tons) | 2022 Weight (short tons) | 2021 to 2022 Year-Over-Year Change (%) |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Total Waste Footprint (including reuse) | 2,912,114                | 3,143,947                | 8.0%                                   |\n\n### Diversion-from-Landfill Rate Across Kroger Facilities\n\n- **2020**: 81%\n- **2021**: 79%\n- **2022**: 82%\n\n**Notes:**\n- Data reflects calendar year with the exception of construction waste, which reflects fiscal year.\n- Disposed waste is managed and reported to Kroger by our different waste and recycling haulers.\n- Waste data excludes office locations and salvage centers, which represent very small proportions of our waste footprint.\n- Donation data primarily reflects food donations, with a nominal amount of non-food donations.\n- Total waste generated excludes the reuse of reusable plastic containers (RPCs) in our supply chain network. The weight of RPCs reused in 2022 increased from 2021 partly due to better data tracking and a higher number of units in circulation.\n- Composting weights increased significantly because materials from our manufacturing plants that were previously classified as landfill application were re-classified as composting.\n- Construction project waste and recycling data excludes minor capital projects.\n- Table may not sum due to rounding.\nProduct Packaging\n\nReducing the environmental impacts of Our Brands product packaging remains a focus area for Kroger. Product packaging is designed with multiple purposes in mind, from maximizing freshness and shelf life to communicating product information to customers. Through our sustainable packaging goals, we strive to improve the sustainability of our packaging, including material reduction, use of recycled materials and increasing recyclability.\n\nOur Sustainable Packaging Goals will pave our way to 2030 by:\n\n\u2022 Completing a baseline product packaging footprint to fully understand current packaging impacts\n\u2022 Seeking to achieve 100% recyclable, compostable and/or reusable packaging for Our Brands products\n\u2022 Increasing recycled content in packaging so that the Our Brands product portfolio collectively contains at least 10% PCR content material in packaging\n\u2022 Increasing awareness among Kroger customers about how to properly manage Our Brands product packaging at end of life\n\u2022 Reducing unnecessary packaging\n\nPackaging Baseline\n\nKroger\u2019s first step toward achieving these goals was developing a packaging baseline to assess our current state and prioritize actions on our roadmap to 2030. We conducted this work in 2022, capturing data to reflect the 2021 performance year for both Kroger-manufactured and third-party manufactured Our Brands products. This baseline focused on food products, both grocery and fresh, as well as health, beauty, household supplies and cleaning, while excluding general merchandise products (apparel and home goods). We plan to include general merchandise products in the future.\n\nMoving forward, we will update our baseline on an annual basis, with a focus on:\n\n\u2022 Replacing proxy data with actual supplier-provided data\n\u2022 Adding new products that launched in the reporting year\n\u2022 Removing products no longer active in the reporting year\n\u2022 Capturing updates to product packaging attributes\n\nOur 2022 data update includes 66% actual data (up from 52% in 2021) and reflects 100% of the in-scope product portfolio based on product sales (up from 90% in 2021). Our goal is to have at least 75% of the products in our portfolio represented with actual data in the future.\n\nBelow, we share updated data points that reflect 2022 performance of our packaging assortment:\n\n\u2022 Paper and plastic remain the two most prominent packaging materials by weight\n\u2022 Cans, clamshells and boxes were the most prominent packaging types by weight\n\u2022 37% of packaging by weight met our definition of recyclable, reusable or compostable\n\u2022 Assortment-wide, packaging contains 18% PCR\n\nIn 2023, we are developing a roadmap to prioritize changes and initiatives that will advance progress on our goals.\n\nImproving Packaging Recyclability & Trialing Reusability\n\nKroger\u2019s framework for defining recyclability combines best-practice definitions and requirements of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the How2Recycle program. In this framework, we included the top two levels in our definition of recyclable for Our Brands packaging\u2014reflecting that we aim for packaging to be widely collected for recycling and optimally recycled in practice and at scale.\n\nIn 2022, 37% of packaging met our definition of recyclable, reusable or compostable, which is a slight decrease from 2021. The table on the following page outlines how Our Brands product packaging aligns with the five tiers of recyclability in our definition. The year-over-year decline reflects changes in assortment, variations in product sales and refinement of product packaging data.\n\nImproving the recyclability of single-use packaging will depend on both product packaging redesigns and recycling infrastructure improvements. Kroger participates in multi-stakeholder coalitions focused on building waste-management infrastructure.\n\nThe Kroger Co. Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Foundation is a Recycling Coalition Supporter of The Recycling Partnership. The foundation continues to support the multi-stakeholder Polypropylene (PP) Recycling Coalition, aiming to improve community-level infrastructure to enable curbside PP collection and recycling. Starting in 2022, the foundation also became a supporter of the PET Recycling Coalition, which is seeking to improve recycling outcomes for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) thermoform packaging.\n\nWhile the industry works on longer-term solutions to make flexible plastic packaging recycling more widely available to consumers, we offer our customers other convenient options to divert this packaging from landfill.\nOur in-store plastic film collection and recycling program accepts monolayer plastic films that are not currently accepted in curbside recycling programs. This primarily includes non-food items like plastic grocery bags; plastic overwrap on household tissues, diapers and bottled water; dry cleaning bags; retail produce bags; and packaging that is labeled as acceptable for in-store drop-off programs.\n\nKroger customers can mail any Our Brands flexible plastic packaging to TerraCycle for recycling, free of charge. These materials are recycled to produce composite plastic material used in playground equipment, park benches and other products. Kroger was the first U.S. retailer to offer this type of recycling program across an entire private-label portfolio. Our customers have returned more than 1 million packages\u2014the equivalent of more than 22,000 pounds of plastic\u2014to date.\n\nKroger was the first U.S. grocery retailer to partner with the Loop reusable packaging platform. In 2022, Kroger piloted an alternative to single-use packaging at 25 Fred Meyer stores across Portland, OR. We trialed the new packaging with 21 items from popular brands to gauge customer sentiment. Through the in-store model, customers purchased the Loop products, which are pre-filled in reusable packaging. After using the product, they returned the empty package to a collection bin at the front of participating stores. Returned packages were sent to Loop for cleaning, refill and resale\u2014\u201cclosing the loop.\u201d\n\nWe recently published an overview of the Loop for cleaning, refill and resale\u2014\u201cclosing the loop.\u201d Participating stores. Returned packages were sent to the empty package to a collection bin at the front of packaging. After using the product, they returned the Loop products, which are pre-filled in reusable packaging. There are occasions when packaging is collected through a recycling system but not recycled.\n\nIncreasing Recycled Content\nIn 2022, the Our Brands packaging assortment contained 18% PCR (up from 14% in 2021). Projects like adding 50% PCR PET plastic to a new line of Our Brands spice products increase the amount of PCR material in our footprint. We continue to pilot different levels of PCR material in our packaging, particularly in those products that are subject to packaging legislation. These decisions require evaluating factors such as product function, shelf life and aesthetic.\n\nReducing Unnecessary Packaging\nKroger-operated manufacturing plants continue to reduce plastic use and packaging weights for Our Brands items where feasible. Last year, we reduced the amount of plastic used in our carbonated soft drinks and cultured dairy product packages, saving approximately 450,000 pounds of plastic annually.\n\nCustomer Communication\nWe regularly share information with our customers regarding the Our Brands recycling program with TerraCycle and in-store recycling drop-off program for plastic films. Kroger has added \u201cPlease Recycle\u201d or the How2Recycle logo to several Our Brands products. Recent additions include egg cartons, bottled water, bagged produce, household tissues and kitchen storage bags. Many common package overwraps and other films are among the items eligible for our in-store recycling program.\n\nPackaging Recyclability Definitions and Progress\n\n| Recyclability Level | Brief Description | Example Packaging Types | % of Kroger Packaging* |\n|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|\n| Recycled in practice and at scale | More than 95% of the entire pack weight is recyclable and either remaining components are compatible with the recycling process or non-recyclable components can be separated. The packaging type must achieve a 30% post-consumer recycling rate in multiple regions. | Glass beverage containers; cardboard; paperboard; aluminum beverage cans, pans, trays | 24% |\n| Widely collected for recycling | A majority percentage of the population (at least 60%) has access to a recycling collection system that accepts the packaging (curbside or special take-back schemes). There are occasions when packaging is collected through a recycling system but not recycled. | Plastic bottles, jugs, jars (PET, HDPE), LDPE, PP plastics; aluminum food cans; glass containers | 13% |\n| Sometimes collected for recycling | A significant percentage (20%-59%) of the population has access to a curbside recycling collection system that accepts the packaging. There are occasions when packaging is collected through a recycling system but not recycled. | PET clamshells, tubs, trays; LDPE containers; aluminum trays, aerosol containers | 10% |\n| Recycle ready | Packaging is designed for collection, sorting and recycling using end-of-life processes, but collection, sorting and recycling infrastructure is not yet widely available. | Monolayer plastic film | 2% |\n| Not recyclable | Packaging is unable to be sorted, reprocessed and provide value for end markets without significant challenges. Though it might be technically possible to recycle a packaging item, there are systemic barriers to the collection, sorting and recycling in practice, at scale and with reasonable economics. | Multilayer plastic film | 50% |\n\n29.

We recognize the importance of implementing practices in our supply chains that protect people and the planet, while ensuring we have a wide variety of products available for our customers. As a leading manufacturer, retailer and distributor of food products and other goods, we believe conserving resources and protecting biodiversity is critical to the sustainability of our business.\n\nThrough our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste impact plan and other public commitments, we strive to promote responsible land use and advocate for more sustainable agricultural production methods that protect habitats and wildlife, both on land and in the water. The world produces more than enough food to feed everyone today; however, significant food loss and waste throughout the food system prevents nourishing food from achieving its highest purpose: Feeding people.\n\nWith the emergence of nature-based approaches to sustainability, we are monitoring the ongoing development of the TNFD and Science Based Targets for Nature (SBTN) platforms to understand how Kroger can further develop our work in the areas of conservation and biodiversity.\n\nSeafood Sustainability\n\nFor over a decade, we have been focused on improving the sustainability of our seafood. Our Seafood Sustainability Policy articulates our commitments and supplier expectations. Since 2009, WWF has been a trusted adviser to Kroger with regards to identifying more sustainable sources and contributing to industry efforts to improve fishery practices and conserve aquatic ecosystems.\n\nWe are making solid progress on advancing our seafood sustainability goals. We met and exceeded our goal to source 95% of wild-caught seafood in our Seafood department from fisheries aligned with our policy, while we achieved 99% alignment with our goal to source 100% of farm-raised seafood from farms aligned with our policy.\n\nWe continued to support fishery improvement projects (FIPs) to help fisheries achieve MSC certification. This year, Kroger\u2019s Seafood department assortment included wild-caught seafood from 43 comprehensive FIPs.\n\nKroger remains committed to sourcing all shelf-stable tuna from suppliers participating in the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation, with 98.1% of our suppliers, by volume, aligned with this requirement in 2022. The remaining portion was MSC-certified. We are also committed to sourcing 20% of shelf-stable Our Brands tuna from MSC-certified fisheries by 2025. In 2022, 17.7% of relevant volume came from fisheries meeting this requirement.\n\nBecause traceability is key to ensuring products are sourced responsibly, we will continue to work with WWF and suppliers to improve transparency and traceability for seafood globally.\n\nWe are also sharing information about how the seafood sold by third-party sushi vendors in Kroger\u2019s Deli departments aligns with the requirements in our Seafood Sustainability Policy. As reported by our vendors, in 2022, 89.5% of the seafood in our sushi assortment was aligned with these requirements.\n\nTo learn more, please see the Kroger-WWF Seafood Sustainability Report.\n\nNo-Deforestation Practices\n\nKroger produces and sells a wide range of items, including those with components that could potentially contribute to tropical deforestation. Our No-Deforestation Commitment for Our Brands aims to address deforestation impacts in supply chains where there is a potential risk. We query our suppliers to gain visibility into the origin and characteristics of the palm, soy, beef and paper-based ingredients and products in our assortment, which informs our progress reporting. Our ongoing engagement illuminates that supply chain visibility is important for achieving our goals. We believe that by requesting this information from our suppliers on a regular basis, we can build a culture of transparency.\n\nOur no-deforestation commitments include:\n\n- **Palm:** We will source palm oil, palm kernel oil and palm oil derivatives from sources certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. In 2022, approximately 96% of palm-based ingredients used in Our Brands products came from certified sources, and 93% of reported palm oil in products was certified to the Mass Balance supply chain standard or higher. We will work with our suppliers to advance toward 100% alignment with this goal.\n\n- **Pulp/paper:** We will source paper packaging that is certified to a sustainable forestry standard (including FSC,32 SFI33 and PEFC34) and/or includes recycled content, as measured by weight. In 2022, 95% of paper packaging used in our manufacturing plants met our goal. Today, 93% of Our Brands household paper goods like tissues, paper towels and toilet paper are also aligned. In addition, 45% of Our Brands paper-based packaging is certified or contains recycled content.\n\n---\n\n32 Both Our Brands and national brands\n33 Forest Stewarding Council\n34 Sustainable Forestry Initiative\n35 Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification\nAgricultural Practices\n\nWith a large agricultural supply chain, we aim to adopt more sustainable practices that responsibly use inputs like pesticides, energy and water, protect pollinators; and help regenerate our natural resources. As a dairy processor, Kroger adopted the U.S. Dairy Stewardship Commitment, which seeks to monitor and reduce the environmental impacts of the dairy industry. In 2023, Kroger became a member of Field to Market: The Alliance for Sustainable Agriculture to gain access to science-driven and outcome-based programs and tools and industry collaboration opportunities. As we develop a new SBTi-aligned GHG-reduction goal, we expect agricultural practices to play an increasingly important role in reducing GHG emissions in our supply chain.\n\nPollinator Protection\n\nWe continue to work with the Sustainable Food Group, a branch of the IPM Institute of North America\u2014with input from WWF\u2014to develop a goal to improve agricultural sustainability in our fresh produce supply chain. To develop a baseline of our current practices, we surveyed a sample of our suppliers\u2014representing about 40% of Kroger\u2019s produce spend\u2014on topics like pest management, biodiversity, soil health and water conservation. Many of our suppliers are adopting a variety of integrated pest management (IPM) practices, supporting biodiversity by maintaining pollinator habitats and adopting water conservation measures. We also engaged our stakeholders to help evaluate how a future goal would impact our supply chain and the larger industry. We expect to publish our goal later this year and will continue to find opportunities to advance sustainable agriculture practices in our supply chain.\n\nNatural & Organic\n\nNatural and organic products remain an important element of Kroger\u2019s overall product assortment to continue meeting our customers\u2019 desire for more sustainable products that are free from artificial ingredients, flavors and preservatives. Customers seeking to avoid genetically modified organisms (GMOS) can choose from many products certified to be non-GMO. The average Kroger store contains more than 4,000 natural and organic products, with all stores carrying some assortment.\n\nKroger\u2019s Simple Truth\u00ae product line\u2014the largest \u201cfree-from\u201d organic brand on the market and our second-largest private-label brand\u2014reached over 1,500 unique products and more than $3 billion in sales in 2022. Currently, 18 Kroger-operated manufacturing plants are certified to produce organic Our Brands items.\n\nFair Trade Certified\u2122\n\nKroger has worked with Fair Trade USA\u2122 for several years, sourcing Fair Trade Certified ingredients for several Our Brands products and, in the process, improving the livelihoods of the growers and processors in our supply chain. Fair Trade Premiums support Community Development Funds that help farmworkers improve their unique social, economic and environmental needs.\n\nAs noted above, Kroger is a member of the Sustainable Coffee Challenge. Our Simple Truth\u00ae brand uses 100% Fair Trade Certified coffee in all products, and our Private Selection brand sources 100% Fair Trade Certified coffee from international growing regions. For both brands, all active products were aligned with this goal in 2022.\n\n| Year | Pounds |\n|------|--------|\n| 2020 | 16.2M  |\n| 2021 | 16.9M  |\n| 2022 | 20.4M  |\n\nAs of 2022, Kroger procured more than 20.4 million pounds of Fair Trade Certified ingredients for Our Brands products across categories including coffee, tea, baking ingredients, fruit-based snacks, coconut water and milk, oils and personal care. This 20.8% increase over 2021 was primarily driven by the transition of our Private Selection brand to Fair Trade Certified as a result of committing to the Sustainable Coffee Challenge, as well as the launch of new Our Brands items in produce and seafood. These purchases contributed more than $2.34 million in Community Development Funds in 2022.\nProduct Sustainability\n\nMany Kroger customers are looking for products with lower environmental impacts that support communities in our supply chain, and we offer a wide assortment of products that are plant-based, contain upcycled ingredients, and have achieved certifications like Fair Trade and Organic.\n\nPlant-Based Alternatives\n\nKroger offers a wide range of plant-based options across the store for customers looking for alternatives to traditional animal-based proteins and other products. These planet- and veggie-forward items may offer health, nutrition and sustainability benefits. In 2022, Kroger had about 215 active plant-based Our Brands items, primarily in the Simple Truth\u00ae brand. These products span nearly 60 Kroger merchandising categories, including deli, bakery, dairy, meat, snacks and frozen. Sales of Our Brands plant-based items increased more than 7% in 2022 compared to the prior year.\n\nUpcycled Ingredients\n\nBetween 2022 and 2023, Kroger introduced six new Simple Truth\u00ae products with upcycled ingredients, all of which are Upcycled Certified\u2122 by the Upcycled Food Association (UFA). The UFA, which Kroger joined in 2022, is a first-of-its-kind trade association working to prevent food waste by accelerating the upcycled food economy. UFA is a network of more than 225 businesses from around the world collaborating to empower consumers to prevent food waste when they shop.\n\nProducts with upcycled ingredients reduce the demand on natural resources by reducing emissions, water consumption and waste generation. Our plant-based baking mixes use okara, a by-product of tofu and soy production, and are carbon neutral certified due to the reduction in food waste and other environmental impacts. Our new bread products contain 10% ReGrained SuperGrain+, a blend of upcycled barley, wheat and rye grains.\n\nSustainable Apparel\n\nKroger has steadily increased the presence of materials with sustainable attributes in this assortment. At the end of 2022, 40% of dip\u2122 items across all categories were produced using fabrics with organic cotton, recycled plastic content or certified renewable materials. We expect to steadily increase the adoption of these materials in the coming years.\n\nChemical Management\n\nWe remain focused on product quality and safety, setting high standards for all Our Brands products. Our regulatory compliance and quality assurance programs define product and supplier requirements, such as quality specifications, testing protocols, and reporting and labeling to ensure safe, high-quality products. As reflected in our Safer Chemicals Statement, we proactively identify chemicals to remove from Our Brands products.\n\nExamples of recent progress:\n\n- 100% of Our Brands canned food items remain free of bisphenol A (BPA) liners. Currently, about 80% of Our Brands canned beverage items (by volume) are no longer in BPA liners. We will continue to expand this reach as supply becomes available.\n- Our Apparel Restricted Substances Policy, which includes a robust Restricted Substances List (RSL), establishes requirements about chemicals that are not permitted in Our Brands apparel products.\n- In 2022 and 2023, Kroger is working with a third-party expert to expand our work to develop an RSL and updated Chemicals Policy for formulated products.\n\nWater\n\nSafe, high-quality and abundant water is critical for the health of our associates, customers, communities and the planet. Across our sites, subject matter experts find ways to reduce water use in our day-to-day operations, increasing efficiency, reducing costs and protecting our natural resources.\n\nOver multiple years, Kroger\u2019s stores have been retrofitted to adopt a five-point water efficiency plan that touches multiple parts of the store: pre-rinse spray valves, bathroom faucet aerators, urinal flush valves, commodes and their flush valves, Starbucks dipper wells used for cleaning utensils, and irrigation sprinkler systems.\n\nOur Supply Chain team identified ways to repurpose water in our manufacturing facilities, primarily by recirculating water to cool down air compressors, reducing the need for new water. Our plants also manage the quality of water we discharge to comply with local requirements. We use on-site wastewater treatment at certain plants, including our K.B. Specialty Foods plant in Greensburg, IN, where AD technology converts by-products to renewable biogas and electricity that is used at the facility.\n\nKroger\u2019s periodic water risk assessments for our facilities have assessed location-based water risk across several impact areas, including physical quantity, physical quality, and regulatory and reputational risks. Some of our facilities are in regions with a defined level of water stress; collectively, these facilities account for less than 10% of our total facilities.\n\nDuring 2022, total company-wide water consumption decreased compared to the prior year. Because water consumption is not metered in all stores, we use a detailed estimation process to fill in missing data points, including using proxy data from the previous year and per-square-feet intensity metrics. We also refine the portfolio of sites included in our water inventory based on store closures, site openings and updated information about locations. This process is helpful for providing data points for all facilities when we assess water risk; however, it can also produce some variability in year-over-year comparisons.\n\nWater Consumption\n\n| Year | Gallons |\n|------|---------|\n| 2020 | 6.65    |\n| 2021 | 6.75    |\n| 2022 | 5.69    |\n\nWater data reflects calendar year data for the vast majority of our facilities.\nSystems\n\nBuild More Responsible & Inclusive Global Systems\n\nKroger offers a variety of foods and other essentials to meet our customers\u2019 wide-ranging needs, preferences and budgets. Our strong corporate governance aims to ensure that Kroger operates responsibly in a global supply chain with far-reaching implications and trade-offs for people and our planet.\n\nIn This Section\n\n54 Business Integration\n58 Responsible & Resilient Systems\nBusiness Integration\n\nKroger\u2019s operations reach billions of people in communities near and far. We engage our leaders in our ESG strategy and goals and hold teams accountable for results. Integrating ownership for material ESG topics into our lines of business and corporate functions is a journey. We continue to use the strengths of our centralized structure, vertical integration and responsible supply chain operations to enable our progress.\n\nCorporate Governance\n\nKroger is committed to strong corporate governance, including oversight of material ESG topics. Kroger\u2019s Law Department oversees matters of corporate governance with oversight from the Board of Directors. We manage ESG topics in the context of our business priorities and strategies, balancing the long-term interests of our associates, customers, communities and other stakeholders.\n\nWe maintain an established ESG management approach, informed by a comprehensive, third party-led materiality assessment. In early 2023, we completed our third materiality assessment in alignment with the principles of double materiality and the latest best practices for engaging stakeholders and defining material topics. The results and insights from our double materiality assessment inform our approach to topic management, stakeholder engagement and public reporting.\n\nIntegrating ESG Ownership\n\nWe integrate ESG priorities into our business and corporate governance practices, including oversight of enterprise risk and accountability among senior management and our board. During 2022, we continued to refine internal working groups that help manage key topics. Five board committees have direct oversight of ESG topics, as outlined in the table on the next page. Details of our directors\u2019 areas of ESG expertise, as well as committee composition, are available online in Kroger\u2019s 2023 Proxy Statement and 2022 Annual Report.\n\nSeveral Kroger departments support our management approach to ESG, including:\n\n- **Audit**: Oversees financial reporting and manages independent auditors\n- **Corporate Affairs**: Leads internal and external communications and media relations; manages federal and state government affairs and advocacy; leads sustainability and social impact\n- **Corporate Food Technology**: Oversees food and product safety and quality assurance; manages recalls affecting Kroger-manufactured and -labeled products and national brands; leads animal welfare program\n- **Environmental Compliance**: Oversees Kroger\u2019s compliance with environmental regulations\n- **Ethics & Compliance**: Leads awareness and implementation of corporate policies, including Kroger\u2019s Policy on Business Ethics, Anti-Corruption Policy, Vendor Code of Conduct and Privacy Policy; oversees compliance with relevant laws and regulations\n- **Human Resources & Labor Relations**: Leads human capital management, including hiring, compensation and benefits; leads diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives; engages with labor unions to negotiate collective bargaining agreements\n- **Merchandising & Marketing**: Determines category assortment and promotional strategies; leads Our Brands strategy and assortment; leads supplier engagement together with Sourcing; leads customer engagement, loyalty and rewards\n- **Retail Operations**: Guides standards, policies and program implementation for retail stores; advances operational performance on topics like food access, food waste and operational waste diversion\n- **Sourcing**: Sources raw materials and finished products for Our Brands; purchases national brand items for resale and goods not for resale; implements Responsible Sourcing program; leads supplier engagement with Merchandising\n- **Supply Chain**: Manages our manufacturing operations, distribution network and transportation fleet\n- **Technology & Digital**: Focuses on governance, innovation and digital channels; manages approach to cybersecurity and privacy\n\nMaterial Topics:\n\n- Corporate Governance\n- Business Ethics & Compliance\n- Data Privacy & Cybersecurity\n- Public Policy Practices\n- Marketing Practices & Product Labeling\nWe strive to uphold the highest ethical standards and help our associates, suppliers and vendors do the same. We consistently review company policies and update them as needed to advance ethical and responsible practices.\n\nOur Ethics & Compliance team is responsible for driving internal implementation of Kroger\u2019s Policy on Business Ethics and related policies and monitoring our company helpline, through which associates can anonymously report concerns. Together with our Corporate Affairs and Sourcing teams, the Ethics & Compliance team follows legislative and regulatory changes, shares updates and develops compliance programs as needed.\n\nRegulatory Compliance\nKroger is committed to product safety and quality. Our suppliers must comply with regulatory requirements pertaining to product safety, as well as meet or exceed Kroger\u2019s quality, safety and performance requirements. Our dedicated General Merchandise group maintains a General Merchandise Regulatory Compliance and Quality Assurance Program, which outlines product-testing requirements for Our Brands general merchandise.\n\nTo enhance responsible disposal of select products, our Environmental Compliance team has implemented simpler processes for retail store disposal of unsalable hazardous products and store-use chemicals that are beyond their useful life. Additionally, working with UL WERCSmart, we provide accurate disposal information directly to stores and distribution centers. We use licensed hazardous waste vendors to remove materials from our sites and properly manage disposal, reuse, recycling or destruction.\nData Privacy & Cybersecurity\n\nKroger recognizes the responsibility to protect our customers\u2019 information, our own data and our business systems. We prioritize and invest in strong data privacy and cybersecurity practices and strive to manage information in a way that is transparent, fair and trustworthy.\n\nThe Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer and a dedicated Privacy Officer lead Kroger\u2019s Privacy Office, reporting to an executive-level Privacy Steering Committee that includes our General Counsel, group vice president of Corporate Affairs, Chief Merchandising Officer and Chief Information Officer. The Chief Information Security Officer and Cybersecurity team are responsible for cybersecurity, with board-level oversight from the Audit Committee.\n\nData Privacy\n\nKroger\u2019s Privacy Office oversees the company\u2019s efforts to anticipate and adjust business practices, processes and communications relating to our associates\u2019 and customers\u2019 privacy. Three foundational pillars guide our privacy practices:\n\n- Embedding responsibility and accountability for protecting personal information across our lines of business and functions\n- Aligning with and meeting regulatory requirements to serve our associates and customers\n- Increasing transparency in our policies and practices to clearly explain how and why we collect and process information\n\nWe conduct an annual review of our Privacy Policy to make sure it is clear, easy to understand and accurately reflects our data practices on what privacy rights are available to individuals and how we collect, use and share data.\n\nIn the absence of a federal privacy law, we saw continued changes in the state privacy landscape in 2022 and early 2023. So far, states with comprehensive privacy legislation include California, Colorado, Connecticut, Indiana, Iowa, Montana, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Virginia. Kroger\u2019s Privacy Office, Law Department and Corporate Affairs team monitor policy developments at federal and state levels to inform internal policies and processes that meet or exceed compliance standards. Last year, the Kroger team invested considerable effort to prepare for new laws and regulatory requirements.\n\nIn 2022, we also introduced a new customer-facing Privacy Center, a portal embedded in our websites where consumers can find everything they need to know about our privacy practices in one convenient location. The initial version of our Privacy Center includes various privacy policies and notices, terms and conditions, frequently asked questions, and links to change marketing and communication preferences, make a privacy rights request, or find support and contact information.\n\nThis work builds on progress from the prior year to increase the reach of compliance processes and cross-team collaboration to consider potential privacy impacts when designing new business processes or solutions. We also improved privacy operations by automating tasks, measuring practice maturity and implementing more efficient methods for enabling privacy rights fulfillment and privacy impact assessments.\n\nAll corporate and technology associates and retail store associates in affected states who handle personal information complete general privacy awareness training. Associates working in certain areas of the business, such as Kroger Health, are required to complete additional privacy training to improve awareness and compliance when managing personal health information.\n\nCybersecurity\n\nWe implement cybersecurity practices appropriate to the nature of the information we collect and use\u2014including technical, administrative and operational procedures\u2014to prevent loss, misuse or alteration.\n\nIn 2022, we introduced a new operating model and cybersecurity transformation program centered on key competencies to enhance security. The company also expanded the Cybersecurity team to maintain appropriate oversight of the cybersecurity environment and threat landscape. As part of these changes, we streamlined and integrated our management approach with embedded Business Unit Information Security Officers who connect business priorities with core cybersecurity competencies.\n\nWhen personal information is entrusted to a third-party service provider, we thoroughly review and supervise how the information is handled through appropriate contractual and security controls. In 2022, we established a more robust management program to oversee third-party relationships in which data is shared.\n\nAll associates with access to personal information are assigned cybersecurity training on management best practices. In 2022, we asked all corporate, technical and retail store associates to complete a data security awareness training course. In addition, corporate and store associates who work in areas regulated by the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) are assigned applicable training courses such as HIPAA Security, a HIPAA Refresher course, and HIPAA Privacy Compliance for Non-Pharmacy Associates.\nPublic Policy Practices\n\nKroger actively engages in public policy and advocacy in ways that support the interests of our associates, customers, communities and company. We recognize that public policy and legislation at the federal, state and local levels can affect our business operations and our future ability to provide economic opportunities in our communities and create value for our shareholders.\n\nA centralized Corporate Affairs team leads the government relations strategy and management approach to align with responsible business practices and reflect Our Values, with oversight from the Public Responsibilities Committee of the board. Advocacy efforts cover a wide range of topics, including ESG topics affecting people and our planet and reflecting our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste impact plan. These include policies that increase food safety, access and security while preserving affordability for our customers.\n\nIn 2022, we expanded Kroger\u2019s Washington, D.C.-based team to focus on federal policy and established a new leader of state government relations to monitor and manage expanding state legislative activity.\n\nKroPAC\n\nKroPAC is the company\u2019s federal political action committee (PAC) funded by voluntary contributions from salaried management associates. All PAC contributions are conducted in compliance with Federal Election Committee regulations governing solicitations. KroPAC makes contributions, where allowed, to federal, state and local political candidates, initiatives and organizations.\n\nTo fulfill our brand promise\u2014Fresh for Everyone\u2122\u2014we promote healthy options like fresh, natural and organic choices across all customer segments and geographies. We work with national, regional and local media and advertising companies to connect with customers through traditional, digital and social media channels.\n\nA defined request for information (RFI) process governs how we select media companies. We ask specific questions to understand their privacy practices and how they create models and expand audiences without bias. In the increasingly complex media landscape and digital ecosystem, we seek to work with vendors that align with our Investment Guidelines and ask vendors to share best practices in communicating organically with multicultural audiences.\n\nAcross our operations, we avoid targeted marketing to minors of products intended for adult purchase and consumption, including adult beverages and nicotine products.\n\nMarketing Practices & Product Labeling\n\nKroger develops marketing communications and integrated campaigns to help customers make purchase decisions that are right for them. We follow applicable laws, regulations and best practices and strive to work with others that do the same. Our Brands, Marketing, Media Services, 84.51\u00b0 and Merchandising teams lead this work in partnership with the Kroger Technology & Digital team, Ethics & Compliance and our Privacy Office.\n\nOur customers tell us they value receiving personalized recommendations that deliver savings on items they purchase regularly. We use information from our loyalty program to develop personalized recommendations every week to save our customers time and money and to enhance their shopping experience. We clearly share why and how we may collect and use this information in our customer-facing Privacy Policy and new Privacy Center.\n\nOther Contributions\n\nOccasionally, and where permitted by law, Kroger may make political contributions directly to state or local candidates using corporate funds and following relevant laws and regulations. We do not use corporate funds to air advertisements or finance specific activities in favor of or opposition to particular candidates. For more details, see our Political Contribution Policy.\n\nWe comply with all laws and required reporting governing political contributions, and we publish a Political Contribution Report that outlines the source of funds for contributions, giving by political party, and giving by state. This report also includes a list of national trade associations of which Kroger is a member. These associations help represent the company\u2019s perspectives to legislators and regulators; however, we do not always share the same perspectives on policy matters as these associations.\n\nProduct Labeling\n\nKroger adheres to the food labeling requirements outlined by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), including the USDA\u2019s Agricultural Marketing Service, which oversees the National Organic Program and food grading system, and the Food Safety Inspection Service, which regulates the labeling of meat, poultry and shelled egg products. New requirements to label sesame as a known food allergen were implemented in 2022.\n\nWe also adhere to the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, which requires that package labels identify the commodity, the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer or distributor, and the net quantity in weight, measure or numerical count. For general merchandise items like bedding and furniture, Kroger is a member of the International Association of Bedding and Furniture Law Officials and aligns relevant labels with these guidelines.\n\nLabeling practices for items we sell in stores and online are overseen by teams including Ethics & Compliance, Corporate Food Technology, Our Brands and Merchandising. Our primary focus on products in the Our Brands portfolio, including Kroger-manufactured items and other items sourced or produced under contract with third-party manufacturers. For Our Brands, Kroger aims to develop accurate on-pack messages and labels that include required information and, where relevant, clear and supported claims to help inform customers of product safety information and benefits, such as allergens or health, nutrition or environmental attributes.\n\nWe expect consumer packaged goods and national brand suppliers to be responsible and accountable for complying with relevant labeling requirements.\n\nAdditional information about product nutrition and sustainability is available in the Health & Nutrition and Product Sustainability sections.\nResponsible & Resilient Systems\n\nKroger is part of\u2014and dependent on\u2014an interconnected global food system and consumer goods supply chain. We are committed to using our scale to help build more responsible, resilient systems for our collective future.\n\nResponsible Supply Chain & Sourcing\n\nKroger is committed to helping create a more sustainable, resilient and responsible global supply chain to offer our customers a wide range of affordable products for years to come. We lead with a systems approach to addressing the multiple topics affecting people and our planet. We manage sourcing topics and issues within the context of our business and ESG strategies, recognizing the need to contemplate potential trade-offs and unintended consequences of specific single-topic policy changes.\n\nOur management approach is led by a cross-functional Responsible Sourcing Steering Committee comprising leaders in Sourcing, Ethics & Compliance, Merchandising and Corporate Affairs. Additional oversight is provided by Kroger\u2019s executive leadership team and the board\u2019s Public Responsibilities Committee.\n\nAdditional information about supplier-focused sustainability goals is included in the Planet section.\n\nSupplier Diversity & Inclusion\n\nKroger set a goal to spend over $10 billion annually with diverse suppliers by 2030 as part of our Framework for Action: Diversity, Equity & Inclusion. We actively pursue collaborations with minority-owned and women-owned business enterprises, including companies owned by individuals who are veterans, disabled or members of the LGBTQ+ community. We value these relationships because they contribute to the local economy and community, and their products and services are often unique and popular among customers.\n\nIn 2022, total spend with diverse-owned suppliers was $3.9 billion, consistent with the prior year. During the year, Sourcing and DEI teams conducted a thorough review of the portfolio of diverse suppliers to validate the certification status for all minority- and women-owned businesses. This new baseline will help inform development of our roadmap and milestones to achieve the $10 billion goal by 2030.\n\nMaterial Topics:\n- Responsible Supply Chain & Sourcing\n- Human Rights\n- Animal Welfare\n\n2022 Highlights\n\n- $3.9B annual spend with diverse-owned suppliers\n- 2 human rights impact assessments completed in U.S. agriculture & shrimp aquaculture in India\n- 16.5K people engaged in Worker Voice Survey at suppliers\u2019 global facilities\nSourcing Principles\nOur customers trust that the products we offer come from reputable suppliers who operate responsibly. We have relationships with many strategic, long-standing suppliers, and we also welcome new suppliers to bid for business. Kroger\u2019s Sourcing and Merchandising teams lead processes to identify, evaluate and onboard new suppliers to the Kroger ecosystem.\n\nA risk-based approach informs program management and responsible sourcing policies, practices and oversight. We use a corrective action plan process to help suppliers build capacity, improve operating performance and correct issues wherever possible. If necessary, we stop doing business with suppliers who repeatedly violate our Code of Conduct and fail to follow through on timebound corrective action plans.\n\nAll suppliers, including those providing Our Brands ingredients and finished products, are expected to:\n\n- Follow the Kroger Vendor Code of Conduct, including establishing effective management systems to maintain safe, fair working environments in all facilities and manage risks\n- Accurately disclose and update production facilities and locations in Kroger\u2019s Supplier Hub centralized vendor management system\n- Respond promptly to Kroger requests for information about potential allegations and issues\n- Complete and submit required documentation, audits and certifications upon the required schedule and agree to additional compliance audits upon request\n\nResponsible Sourcing Program\nKroger\u2019s approach to responsible sourcing continues to evolve over time to further advance supply chain oversight and accountability. This program includes auditing suppliers\u2019 production facilities to assess whether they are complying with the Kroger Vendor Code of Conduct and supporting the use of resources and self-assessments to build programs that respect the rights of workers at all levels of the supply chain.\n\nWhen the company started this program, we believed suppliers\u2019 international production facilities posed the greatest potential human rights risks. As a result, Kroger focused its audit program on international facilities. Going forward, we are expanding the scope of the program to include more suppliers\u2019 locations in the U.S. and North America.\n\nVendor Code of Conduct\nAll suppliers are expected to comply with Kroger\u2019s Vendor Code of Conduct as a condition of doing business with us. We recently updated the Code of Conduct, which is informed by internationally agreed-upon standards, including the United Nations Guiding Principles (UNGPs) on Business and Human Rights, the International Bill of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.\n\nWe are developing a Vendor Guide that will provide Code of Conduct implementation guidelines and context to help suppliers build their responsible sourcing practices. We are also developing new training for suppliers and for Kroger associates involved in the selection and oversight of suppliers.\n\nIncreased Accountability\nKroger carefully monitors known and emerging risks across product categories and global supplier networks. A cross-functional Responsible Sourcing Steering Committee meets at least monthly to discuss and manage critical topics. An extended team provides subject matter expertise on key areas of enhanced monitoring and engagement, including human rights, animal welfare, chemical safety and apparel production.\n\nWe use our Supplier Hub to gather detailed information on supplier compliance with our goals, relevant company initiatives and U.S. food safety standards. It provides a mechanism for alerting our teams and preventing payment to suppliers not in compliance. Planned enhancements to the system will increase oversight of items in production at suppliers\u2019 global facilities.\n\nFramework & Policies\nKroger\u2019s Responsible Sourcing Framework encompasses our public commitments, policies, requirements and expectations for suppliers and others who do business with our company. In 2022, we began the process of updating supply chain governance and expectations, including reporting progress toward goals.\n\nWe anticipate sharing updated guidance and resources with suppliers in 2023 and 2024, particularly regarding human rights, animal welfare, GHG emissions reduction, sustainable packaging, food waste reduction, and agricultural production methods in our supply chain, among other topics.\nSocial Compliance\n\nKroger\u2019s Social Compliance Program helps verify suppliers\u2019 alignment with our Vendor Code of Conduct. Among other expectations, the Code of Conduct informs vendors that the facilities they operate can be subject to third-party social compliance audits. Kroger\u2019s Social Compliance Program Requirements outline the legal requirements and high ethical standards to which we hold our suppliers, and our published Social Compliance Audit Content guides third-party audits.\n\nTo determine audit scope and frequency, we evaluate our supplier base against multiple criteria, including where facilities are located, what products they produce and inherent industry risks. At a minimum, we require social compliance audits for all Our Brands food and non-food products and unbranded products (such as bulk produce) processed at facilities outside the U.S. We also require audits for direct-import national brand products where Kroger is the importer of record. In 2022, we saw a gradual easing of pandemic-related travel restrictions and began resuming on-site third-party compliance visits.\n\nOur social compliance program is an essential part of supply chain accountability, and we continue to evolve our scope and approach over time. We implement comprehensive programs that communicate expectations, hold our suppliers accountable for meeting Kroger\u2019s standards and support continual improvement in our supply chain. We build strong supplier relationships during onboarding and maintain them through regular meetings, site visits, surveys and audits. We recognize the need to measure performance beyond compliance audit results in the future; however, the industry is still developing outcome-based frameworks and metrics for human rights.\n\nSocial Compliance: Worker Voice\n\nOur social compliance program is designed to monitor and help improve working conditions for people in our global supply chain. In 2022, LRQA helped facilitate an expanded Worker Voice Survey to capture workers\u2019 direct feedback and insights about working in our suppliers\u2019 production facilities. The scope included:\n\n- 16 countries\n- 401 international production sites\n- 16.5K workers\n- 63% women (37% men)\n- 18\u201349 age range for survey respondents\n\n37 ELEVATE was acquired by LRQA in April 2022\nRisk-Based Approach\n\nKroger engages consultant LRQA (formerly known as ELEVATE) to regularly assess Kroger\u2019s supply chain and apply segmentation based on social and environmental risk. Through the process, we classify primary product and commodity categories in our supply chain based on two dimensions:\n\n- Risk level\n- Kroger\u2019s ability to influence risk in the supply chain\n\nThe assessment draws on various indices, compiling information on labor, health and safety, environmental, ethics and management systems to assign risk and influence levels. This helps refine our approach to prioritizing social compliance audits in areas of higher concern.\n\nWe continually review incoming audits for violations of our Vendor Code of Conduct, Human Rights Policy and other key policies. Our Social Compliance team developed a Traveler\u2019s Checklist to raise internal awareness about indicators of supply chain human rights issues. Travel has been limited in the past three years due to the pandemic; however, this resource is available to associates as travel resumes.\n\nWhere potential issues or allegations are identified, the Responsible Sourcing Steering Committee and/or Human Rights Working Group activates the relevant policy framework and defined escalation paths to evaluate the situation and take appropriate action.\n\nWe continue to refine expectations for suppliers operating in areas of higher potential human rights risks. We believe long-term change will happen through coalitions of stakeholders working together to understand the risks and provide means to mitigate, monitor and provide remedy where appropriate.\n\nCorrective Action Plans\n\nIn the spirit of continual improvement, when audits identify critical issues, we require suppliers to develop time-bound corrective action plans (CAPs) and report progress.\n\nLack of transparency during the audit process may be an indicator of more egregious issues, so we make our expectations of transparency clear to all suppliers. When suppliers have repeated non-transparency findings in their audits, we work with them directly to resolve the issue or terminate the supply agreement if the issue persists.\n\nFindings that fall into the most severe category include evidence of forced labor, child labor or attempted bribery. Depending on the situation, we may suspend or terminate the supply contract if alerted to these findings, following our established escalation paths.\n\nIn 2022, approximately 34% of completed audits resulted in approved facilities with minor violations to be fixed within 12 months, while 54% resulted in conditional approval with a CAP required to be completed over either six or 12 months. Additionally, 12% of audits identified issues requiring significant improvement and, if permitted, the suppliers corrected violations immediately. Our objective is to reduce the number of facility audits with this level of findings in our supply chain over time. Of this category of audit findings, most facilities make the required improvements; in fact, less than 1% result in termination.\n\nSocial Compliance Audit Findings\n\n| Year | Approved Facilities | Approved with CAPs | Significant Improvement Required |\n|------|---------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|\n| 2020 | 32%                 | 53%                | 15%                             |\n| 2021 | 31%                 | 59%                | 10%                             |\n| 2022 | 34%                 | 54%                | 12%                             |\nHuman Rights\n\nAs a U.S. food processor and retailer with a global supply network, we recognize our role and responsibility to respect human rights throughout our operations and value chain, particularly among vulnerable populations. We continue to evolve our policies to embed human rights as a key element of our responsible sourcing practices.\n\nWe outline Kroger\u2019s commitment to\u2014and governance of\u2014human rights in our updated Human Rights Policy and Vendor Code of Conduct, as well as our Responsible Sourcing Framework and Social Compliance Program Requirements. The Public Responsibilities Committee of the board oversees progress on human rights.\n\nWe continually review our approach and processes to help advance positive change for people throughout our operations and global supply chain. In 2021, Kroger committed to more closely align our human rights policies and framework with the UNGPs on Business and Human Rights. Since then, we have advanced progress by:\n\n\u2022 Developing an internal human rights due diligence (HRDD) framework\n\u2022 Conducting two human rights impact assessments\n\u2022 Developing plans to expand the scope of our social compliance program\n\u2022 Defining best practices for managing and escalating issues through cross-functional working groups\n\nWe cannot do this alone and recognize the importance and power of collective action and pre-competitive collaboration with others in the private and public sectors. We remain committed to working with our suppliers to build capacity and improve their management systems to achieve lasting change.\n\nHuman Rights Policy\n\nKroger\u2019s work is grounded in our Human Rights Policy, which was developed in collaboration with LRQA. We followed a multi-step process to develop the policy, including:\n\n\u2022 A policy gap analysis to evaluate how our prior statement on human rights aligned with expectations outlined in the UNGPs\n\u2022 Benchmarking to analyze recognized leaders\u2019 and industry peers\u2019 policies as well as scoring methodologies for third-party organizations\n\u2022 Stakeholder interviews with investor coalitions, NGOs, representatives of our associates, trade associations and others\n\u2022 A supply chain risk assessment to map sourcing countries and commodities with potential risks of human rights impacts using LRQA\u2019s EiG supply chain due diligence platform\n\u2022 A risk prioritization workshop with internal cross-functional leaders and subject matter experts to review the supply chain risk assessment, discuss geographic areas of risk and align on a list of most salient human rights risks. This workshop was facilitated and conducted in a manner that aligns with the UNGPs\n\nStatement of Salient Risks\n\nKroger identified a list of the company\u2019s most salient human rights risks\u2014the highest potential risks to people\u2019s human rights as a result of our activities or business relationships. This statement of awareness of salient risks is available in our Human Rights Progress Update.\n\nDue Diligence\n\nWe recognize the need for human rights due diligence to verify that Kroger and our suppliers are upholding policies to respect human rights, including the company\u2019s Policy on Business Ethics and Vendor Code of Conduct. In the past year, we developed an internal framework for managing the topic of human rights and conducting due diligence in our own operations and global supply chain. We continue to engage internal stakeholders and obtain feedback on the framework in 2023.\n\nOur due diligence framework specifically:\n\n\u2022 Assigns ownership and accountability for specific tasks across key departments\n\u2022 Documents escalation paths to review human rights risks when identified\n\u2022 Outlines expectations for conducting human rights impact assessments\n\u2022 Establishes and/or updates policies and decision-making systems to assess suppliers\u2019 performance and provide feedback\n\u2022 Includes efforts to mitigate risks and consider remedy for workers as appropriate\n\u2022 Acknowledges the need to engage relevant stakeholders to listen and learn from others\u2019 perspectives on human rights\n\nEthical Charter: Produce & Floral Supply Chain\n\nKroger\u2019s approach to human rights due diligence also reflects the recommendations and best practices outlined in the Ethical Charter on Responsible Labor Practices to responsibly source fresh fruits, vegetables and flowers. The Ethical Charter was published in 2018 by the Produce Marketing Association and the United Fresh Produce Association\u2014now merged as the International Fresh Produce Association\u2014and has been adopted and endorsed by many of its members, including Kroger.\n\nKroger is among a group of produce buyers leading the follow-up development and adoption of the Ethical Charter Implementation Program (ECIP) to assist the produce industry in upholding the principles of the Ethical Charter. The focus of ECIP is capacity-building within the industry to drive continuous improvement and strengthen the management systems that produce and floral suppliers and their growers need to have in place to uphold the principles of the Ethical Charter. The ECIP is informed by insights gathered during a collaborative pilot of Ethical Charter principles and practices with four buyers, involving Kroger and three other food buyers, 20 suppliers and 40 growers.\n\nBased on feedback regarding the pilot, the Equitable Food Initiative and The Sustainability Consortium plan to include a worker-voice component in the technology platform development process for the ECIP. As a next step, Kroger will begin onboarding select suppliers to the ECIP and platform as it begins to roll out in late 2023.\nHuman Rights Impact Assessments\n\nAs part of our human rights due diligence framework and commitment to upholding the UNGPs, we initiated two human rights impact assessments (HRIA) in 2022: One on mixed greens produced in the U.S. and one on shrimp aquaculture operations in India.\n\nBoth HRIs were conducted by third-party researchers and included site visits, interviews with rightsholders and a gender-equity lens to assess unique risks for female workers. We anticipate conducting a third impact assessment in 2024.\n\nImpact Assessment: Mixed Greens in California\n\nArea of focus: The first HRIA focused on human rights risks for farmworkers producing mixed greens at suppliers\u2019 farms in the Salinas Valley of California. We selected this topic and region based on sourcing volume and stakeholder input about labor risks for farmworkers. The suppliers we approached for inclusion in the impact assessment agreed and provided access to farms, managers, workers and records.\n\nPrimary research finding: Despite risks to farmworkers that may be present in farming operations, this third-party impact assessment did not reveal significant or severe human rights violations within the scope of the research. The primary finding, based on input from rightsholders and in light of changing weather patterns in the U.S., is related to heat exposure and protections during peak summer months. We are currently developing recommendations for suppliers to improve heat protection for farmworkers.\n\nSee the full published HRIA Report on Mixed Greens.\n\nImpact Assessment: Farmed Shrimp in India\n\nArea of focus: We conducted a second HRIA focused on shrimp aquaculture operations in the Andhra Pradesh region of India. We selected this topic because of sourcing volume, stakeholder input about labor risks in shrimp production and the opportunity to add to the global body of knowledge on this topic. Kroger worked collaboratively with LRQA and two other retailers\u2014with controls in place to prevent competitive concerns\u2014that also buy farmed shrimp from this region in India.\n\nPrimary research finding: Researchers identified concerning human rights issues in the supply chain at each of the 11 sites visited (shrimp farms or processing facilities for different suppliers for each retailer). This included a lack of transparency and/or attempts to limit access at several sites, discrepancies in workers\u2019 records and timesheets, and poor living conditions in dormitories. As a result, we engaged Kroger\u2019s participating suppliers to discuss the findings and identify opportunities for remediation.\n\nReflecting prior stakeholder input about potential human rights risks in this region, the retailers had included plans for a collaborative remediation pilot as part of the initial HRIA project scope. This six-month pilot will focus on expanding the reach, quality and effectiveness of grievance mechanisms for workers at these facilities as a critical next step.\n\nSee the full published HRIA Report on Farmed Shrimp.\n\nHRIA Lessons Learned\n\nThe process of conducting HRIs provided opportunities for the Kroger team to continue learning about effective supplier oversight and accountability and the challenges of navigating a global supply chain with facilities outside of our direct control. These insights will help inform the evolution of our responsible sourcing and social compliance programs, including risk-based assessments for countries and commodities that pose higher risks.\n\nAs stated in the HRIA reports, we acknowledge there are limitations to the findings. In the case of mixed greens, our assessment did not reveal evidence of the potential issues identified during the research phase. We are grateful to the participating suppliers for providing access to their farms and facilities, and the results indicate they are upholding Kroger\u2019s Vendor Code of Conduct.\n\nWe recognize that worker voice and grievance mechanisms may not fully address human rights risks or prevent issues. However, we believe they are a foundational element of supplier accountability; to that end, the remediation pilot in India aims to provide a more robust and accessible method for workers to report concerns. We are committed to working collaboratively with suppliers, retailers, other buyers and groups with local knowledge and expertise to help advance meaningful positive impacts for workers in India.\nAnimal Welfare\n\nThe welfare of animals in our protein supply chain has long been a priority for Kroger. We aim to advance the welfare of animals that produce food while balancing other strategic priorities that affect people and our planet. We work with suppliers, animal welfare experts and other stakeholders to advance standards that protect workers and animals and that preserve access to affordable proteins for our customers.\n\nThe company\u2019s Corporate Food Technology (CFT) team leads our approach to animal welfare in the context of animal agriculture and sustainable protein production, with oversight from senior leaders and the Public Responsibilities Committee of the board.\n\nOur Approach\n\nKroger is not directly involved in raising or harvesting any animals in our protein supply chain. We require suppliers to adopt industry-accepted animal welfare standards and provide required welfare audit results. We comply with all relevant state legislation and regulations. An internal Animal Welfare Working Group of leaders from CFT, Ethics & Compliance, Merchandising, Sourcing and Corporate Affairs oversees policies and progress and provides regular updates to leaders.\n\nWe participate in industry groups and collaborative platforms to stay informed of key developments in animal welfare and protein production. This includes membership and participation in the Global Coalition for Animal Welfare (GCAW), a multi-stakeholder group of protein producers, foodservice companies, restaurants and retailers. GCAW is administered by a secretariat and has dedicated working groups to advance welfare for laying hens, broiler chickens and pigs.\n\nAdvancing Progress\n\nWith a commitment to continual improvement, we evaluate our Animal Welfare Policy as needed, based on input from global experts. In 2022, we updated the policy and shared a detailed Animal Welfare Update to provide additional context on our objectives, goals and interim milestones for specific proteins.\n\nWe also continued efforts to transition the foundation of our policy from the Five Freedoms to the Five Domains of Animal Welfare, an internationally respected approach that emphasizes current animal science and welfare outcome-based standards. In general, we seek to align with common industry frameworks or metrics that subject matter experts endorse and the industry can support. Shifting to outcome-based measures prioritizes metrics that indicate animal health and welfare (mortality, injury rates, scratches, etc.) more than prescriptive system inputs (size of enclosures, enrichments, type of feed, etc.) and compliance audits.\n\nTo inform our approach, we engaged internal leaders, protein suppliers and external subject matter experts for input on the feasibility of moving to outcome-based measures of animal welfare. We asked suppliers to provide specific outcome-based key welfare indicators that they measure in their operations or supply chain for each species. We plan to engage Kroger\u2019s Animal Welfare Advisory Council members to provide another review and offer recommendations for next steps.\n\nOur primary focus remains advancing animal welfare for laying hens, pigs, broiler chickens, and beef and dairy cattle in ways that preserve affordability for our customers.\n\nLaying Hens\n\nKroger continues to work with suppliers, animal welfare experts and other stakeholders to support the transition to higher-welfare laying hen housing systems.\n\nGoal: Given the current rate of industry progress and our customers\u2019 desire for affordability, Kroger plans to transition about 70% of eggs sold (by units) to cage-free or higher-welfare standards by 2030. We will determine whether continued progress beyond 2030 is feasible and if so, by when, based on customer insights and industry transition. Kroger anticipates investing about $45 million to support this roadmap to 2030, including investments in sourcing agreements, pricing, promotions and merchandising.\n\nWe are transitioning our reporting to align with SASB disclosure guidelines for food retailers. In 2022, cage-free eggs represented 32.3% of total egg revenue company-wide (2021: 45.9%). This decline reflects higher-than-expected sales of conventional eggs during a period of inflation and continued supply chain disruptions in 2022, including the impacts of avian influenza on hen populations. On a volume basis, Kroger achieved its 2022 milestone to increase units of shell eggs sourced from laying hens in cage-free housing systems or better to 33.6% (2021: 27%).\n\nWe continue to encourage customer engagement by investing in prices and promotions, featuring cage-free eggs in weekly advertising circulars and dedicating preferred shelf space to cage-free or higher-welfare options.\n\nWe encourage suppliers to adopt cage-free or higher welfare standards for egg production, based on demand and in ways that preserve affordability for our customers. Our updated roadmap for laying hen housing reflects the impact of continued price investments, advancing state legislation and the continued rollout of next-level cage-free, carbon-neutral Simple Truth\u00ae + Kipster eggs across retail divisions.\n\nGoing forward, we will continue to offer a variety of eggs to ensure that affordable, healthy protein options are accessible for all Kroger customers.\nSimple Truth\u00ae + Kipster Eggs\n\nKroger and Kipster Farms, the innovative egg production system founded in the Netherlands, continue to collaborate to bring the world\u2019s first carbon-neutral, cage-free eggs to more customers. Simple Truth\u00ae + Kipster eggs are produced in a circular system that is better for people, animals and our planet.\n\nMPS Egg Farms, a long-standing Kroger supplier, operates four Kipster Farms barns on its property in North Manchester, IN. Chickens in the Kipster system help upcycle surplus food scraps into eggs, meat and fertile manure. Kipster is the only egg farmer in the world to achieve such a high level of circularity.\n\nWe introduced Simple Truth\u00ae + Kipster eggs to customers in late 2022 and continued expanding distribution in 2023. The eggs are available at select Kroger stores in eight states and in the following supermarket divisions: Food 4 Less, Fred Meyer, Fry\u2019s Food Stores, King Soopers, QFC, Ralphs and Smith\u2019s. Kroger and Kipster are using advertising and promotional strategies to encourage customer engagement.\n\nThe system:\n- Offers laying hens a cage-free, natural-like wooded environment with daylight, outdoor foraging space and enrichments\n- Uses chicken feed made from a majority of surplus food from bakeries and other food producers, reducing climate impacts compared to standard feed\n- Raises roosters for chicken meat\n- Minimizes fine particle emissions, resulting in better air quality for farmers and animals\n- Uses rooftop solar panels to produce clean energy\n- Kipster was recently designated a Certified B Corporation, a globally recognized certification for companies demonstrating high social and environmental performance\n\nPigs\n\nWhile there is no single agreed-upon standard for sow housing, we encourage suppliers to use the minimum time necessary in individual stalls to enhance sow health and welfare, protect workers and preserve access to affordable fresh pork.\n\nGoal: Our goal is to achieve 100% of fresh pork volume from sows in group housing systems by the end of 2025. Group housing refers to systems where sows are moved to group pens for the middle phase of gestation as early as possible, no later than six weeks after breeding.\n\nTo inform our fresh pork offering within the context of our ESG strategy, we conducted a detailed customer insights and supply chain review in 2022. Our roadmap to 2025 reflects input from customers, suppliers, animal welfare experts and other stakeholders.\n\nGiven our suppliers\u2019 expected transition to group housing systems over time, we remain focused on achieving the following milestones toward our goal: 65% by 2023; 75% by 2024; and 100% by 2025.\n\nIn 2022, we clarified our requirements for group housing systems for fresh pork suppliers and added specific terms to contracts to advance progress toward our 2023 milestone. Challenges include available supply and affordability for the volume of fresh pork we source for customers.\n\nBroiler Chickens\n\nWe strive to promote higher-welfare practices among suppliers raising chickens as an affordable fresh protein option. We aim to achieve the following welfare enhancements for at least 50% of our Simple Truth Organic\u00ae and Simple Truth Natural\u00ae fresh chicken by 2024:\n- Prohibit broiler cages (2022: 100%)\n- Maximum stocking density of 6.0 pounds per square foot (2022: 17.9%)\n- Enriched environments, including litter and lighting (2022: 41.9%)\n- Processing in a manner that avoids pre-stun handling and uses a controlled atmosphere system (CAS) to induce an irreversible stun (2022: 10.9%)\n\nWe continue to work with animal welfare experts and suppliers to determine next steps on these goals and to measure progress over time. The industry\u2019s pace of transition to CAS continues to limit our ability to achieve that element of our goal. We do not include breed changes as part of our goal at this time.\n\nOther Welfare Updates\n\nDairy: Cooperatives supplying milk to Kroger\u2019s manufacturing plants and Our Brands grocery assortment must be in good standing with the National Dairy Farmers Assuring Responsible Management (FARM) Program, supporting our goal to sell 100% FARM-sourced milk. Kroger takes proactive steps to improve animal welfare oversight through sourcing contracts with milk cooperatives, using measures such as more frequent welfare audits. We are also a signatory to the U.S. Dairy Stewardship Commitment, supporting efforts to measure and improve dairy production impacts on people and our planet.\n\nBeef: Suppliers of regular fresh beef and beef-based ingredients going into Kroger plants advised that to the best of their knowledge, over 95% of cattle were harvested in North America, where there is a low risk of deforestation, and over 78% of cattle were born, raised and harvested in North America. We continue to work with suppliers to advance animal welfare for cattle in our beef supply chain.\n\nFish: We recognize the growing body of work related to advancing fish welfare in farm-raised and wild-caught operations and processing. Kroger is engaging animal welfare experts, industry groups and other stakeholders to monitor developments on this topic.\n\nFor more details, please see our Animal Welfare Update.\n## Material Topics Summary Table\n\n### Environmental Topic\n\n| Topic Definition                                                                 | Tier |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|\n| Promoting responsible pesticide, fertilizer and soil management practices, including efforts to reduce negative impacts on pollinators.

The energy intensity calculation reflects total energy consumed within the organization.\n\n### Carbon Emissions\n\n| Source                                      | Amount       | Unit       | Change vs. 2021 |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------------|------------|-----------------|\n| Direct (Scope 1) emissions                  | 2,335,900    | tCO\u2082e      | 1%              |\n| Stationary                                  | 578,392      | tCO\u2082e      | -4%             |\n| Mobile                                      | 420,020      | tCO\u2082e      | 32%             |\n| Fugitive                                    | 1,337,488    | tCO\u2082e      | -3%             |\n| Indirect (Scope 2) emissions (location-based) | 2,695,641    | tCO\u2082e      | -2%             |\n| Indirect (Scope 2) emissions (market-based) | 2,958,805    | tCO\u2082e      | -13%            |\n| Total corporate (Scope 1 and 2) emissions (location-based) | 5,031,641    | tCO\u2082e      | -0.4%           |\n| Total corporate (Scope 1 and 2) emissions (market-based) | 4,694,705    | tCO\u2082e      | -7%             |\n| Indirect (Scope 3) emissions (partial)      | 2,390,614    | tCO\u2082e      | -0.3%           |\n\n44. We used the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting Standard, the Operational Control approach and Global Warming Potentials from the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5 \u2013 100 year). The base year for our footprint is 2006, when we first started measuring it.\n45. Scope 1 and 2 emissions reflect CO\u2082, CH\u2084, N\u2082O and HFC gases. Details are disclosed in our CDP Climate response. Offsets were not used in our calculations.\n46. Scope 3 emissions reflect the following categories: fuel- and energy-related activities (not included in Scope 1 or 2 emissions), waste generated in operations, business travel, employee commuting, processing of sold products and investments. The latter two categories have not been reported in earlier inventories.\n\n### Carbon Intensity\n\n| Metric                                      | Amount       | Unit       | Change vs. 2021 |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------------|------------|-----------------|\n| Total corporate carbon emissions intensity per square foot | 21.84 | tCO\u2082e/1,000 ft\u00b2 | -4.8%          |\n| Normalizing factor: facility footprint      | 224,131      | 1,000 ft\u00b2  | -               |\n\n47. Our normalized emissions (per 1,000 square feet) decreased from 22.94 to 21.84. This calculation reflects market-based Scope 2 emissions.\n\n## Health & Safety\n\n### Metric\n\n| Metric                                      | Associates | Contractors |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------|-------------|\n| Injury rate (OSHA injuries/100 full-time employees (FTE)) | 3.34       | 2.91        |\n| Lost day rate (OSHA lost time rate/100 FTE) | 2.72       | 1.63        |\n\n48. Injury rate includes injuries greater than minor injuries (first aid) per OSHA reporting requirements.\n49. We classify lost days as calendar days. Lost days begin the day after the injury.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-04-27", "created": "2025-04-27", "metadata": {"Source-File": "climate_reports/tp_reports/kroger_2022.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.1.59", "pdf-total-pages": 71, "total-input-tokens": 184562, "total-output-tokens": 52906, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 4111, 2], [4111, 6022, 3], [6022, 7061, 4], [7061, 7439, 5], [7439, 10639, 6], [10639, 12539, 7], [12539, 12927, 8], [12927, 15616, 9], [15616, 18535, 10], [18535, 22077, 11], [22077, 23748, 12], [23748, 24890, 13], [24890, 29949, 14], [29949, 32035, 15], [32035, 35144, 16], [35144, 37703, 17], [37703, 41188, 18], [41188, 43412, 19], [43412, 43751, 20], [43751, 46023, 21], [46023, 51000, 22], [51000, 55473, 23], [55473, 60442, 24], [60442, 62374, 25], [62374, 66551, 26], [66551, 69351, 27], [69351, 73594, 28], [73594, 76410, 29], [76410, 80528, 30], [80528, 83786, 31], [83786, 87651, 32], [87651, 89991, 33], [89991, 92509, 34], [92509, 97226, 35], [97226, 102514, 36], [102514, 105973, 37], [105973, 107269, 38], [107269, 112797, 39], [112797, 113166, 40], [113166, 116051, 41], [116051, 120919, 42], [120919, 125264, 43], [125264, 129562, 44], [129562, 132046, 45], [132046, 137352, 46], [137352, 144076, 47], [144076, 148612, 48], [148612, 153923, 49], [153923, 158973, 50], [158973, 162894, 51], [162894, 168530, 52], [168530, 168967, 53], [168967, 173058, 54], [173058, 174651, 55], [174651, 179653, 56], [179653, 185825, 57], [185825, 188308, 58], [188308, 192736, 59], [192736, 195016, 60], [195016, 198538, 61], [198538, 204100, 62], [204100, 208479, 63], [208479, 213771, 64], [213771, 218963, 65], [218963, 223071, 66], [223071, 228698, 67], [228698, 234129, 68], [234129, 238659, 69], [238659, 240628, 70], [240628, 245585, 71]]}}
