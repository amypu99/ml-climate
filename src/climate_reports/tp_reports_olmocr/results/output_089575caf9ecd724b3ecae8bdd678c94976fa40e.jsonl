The report also references the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Hardware Standard and the SASB Semiconductors Standard. Furthermore, we have aligned our disclosures with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Please reference this report\u2019s indices for additional information.\n\nTo reflect the increasing importance of sustainability to our business, our FY2021 report aligns the reporting period of our annual sustainability reporting with our fiscal year. Western Digital\u2019s FY2021 Sustainability Report builds on the work completed since our last report and further reinforces our commitment to sustainability as an industry leader and global corporate citizen. While this report provides transparency to our stakeholders on our sustainability progress, it also reflects our ongoing efforts to assess the company\u2019s greatest environmental, social and governance (ESG) impacts, risks and opportunities to further enhance our practices in the future.\n\nThis report is organized into three parts. The first section, Our 2021 Story, offers significant highlights from FY2021. A general disclosure section provides a deeper, more technical look at our approach to sustainability and our progress. And a set of indices provides a comprehensive look at the data that informs our sustainability efforts.\n\nWe are always looking for opportunities to improve our transparency and better demonstrate our performance; if you have any feedback about this report or other disclosures, please contact sustainability@wdc.com.\nDear Fellow Stakeholders,\n\nThe digital transformation has created a more technology-enabled and technology-dependent world than ever before, leaving businesses with a great opportunity and an enormous responsibility. We must balance how we deliver innovation to meet new demands with how we respond to critical issues facing the world today, whether it\u2019s our focus on the environment and our people or how we address the challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Customers, employees and investors expect us to act on these topics. When we focus on sustainability, we address stakeholder interests and position our people, communities, the environment and business to thrive.\n\nLaying the Foundation\n\nIn recent years, our teams have completed important work to build a foundation for sustainability leadership at Western Digital. We\u2019ve established data-driven targets and metrics to manage and improve performance and efficiency throughout our operations and supply chain. We know that we must continually adapt to address the issues that impact our business and our world.\n\nProtecting the Environment\n\nWestern Digital is a large, global corporation, and our products are used by customers throughout the world, so each improvement we make to reduce environmental impact is multiplied by the scale of our international footprint. In FY2021, we formally adopted science-based targets that will help us cut Western Digital\u2019s emissions by 42 percent by 2030. With data from Life Cycle Assessments, we seek to minimize our products\u2019 environmental footprint. And we seek to use resources efficiently and transparently disclose information about our performance.\n\nSupply Chain\n\nThe past few years have shined a spotlight on global supply chains, as the supply processes that consumers rely on for everyday products were adversely affected by the pandemic. Customers, employees and investors expect us to act on these topics. When we focus on sustainability, we address stakeholder interests and position our people, communities, the environment and business to thrive.\n\nInvesting in People\n\nWe are (and always have been) outspoken about the value of our employees. Our team of innovators is our biggest asset, and the success of our business is fundamentally connected to employee well-being. In FY2021, we continued to partner with the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) to protect human rights, uphold leading labor practices and reduce risks. We also remain committed to championing diversity, equity and inclusion and investing in the future of our communities.\n\nIntegrity and Governance\n\nCustomers are more interconnected than ever before, data is being generated at unprecedented speeds and customers\u2019 expectations have never been higher. During FY2021, we launched Western Digital\u2019s Privacy Portal, where customers can read about our data privacy practices in the midst of a rapidly changing world of data. We also emphasized the importance of high ethical standards to our employees. As global leaders in data infrastructure, we must always maintain stakeholder trust.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nThis report highlights many of the steps we\u2019ve taken to become a more sustainable business\u2014but there is more work to be done. We believe in the power of data\u2014and the data-driven sustainability metrics we have established will allow us to continue to refine our approach in the future. As we seek to help solve some of the world\u2019s biggest challenges, we will continue to weave the value of sustainability into the core of our business.\n\nThank you for your interest in Western Digital and our FY2021 Sustainability Report.\n\nDavid Goeckeler, CEO\nOUR 2021 STORY\nWho We Are\n\nArchitecting how data enables the world to solve its biggest challenges.\n\nWe believe in the promise of data and are committed to architecting the infrastructure to unlock its potential. At Western Digital, when we innovate across our portfolio\u2014from products and devices to data center platforms and infrastructures\u2014we enable the world to solve its biggest challenges.\n\nTo be recognized as the world\u2019s leading data infrastructure company.\n\nWestern Digital is\u2014and always has been\u2014a company of engineers, inventors, makers and innovators. Our responsibility and mission is to enable others to unlock the intrinsic value of data for people, for organizations and for the advancement of society. By coming together, globally, as One Western Digital to address a market that is far bigger, more sophisticated and more complex than at any other time, we will achieve our mission.\n\nSILICON-TO-SYSTEM INNOVATION AND ENGINEERING\n\n- **Integrated Storage Platforms**\n- **Platforms Innovation** (electrical and mechanical design, firmware and diagnostics)\n- **Device Innovation** (mechanical, packaging, testing, software, firmware and controllers)\n- **Advanced Media, Controller, Head, Firmware/FTL**\nScience-Based Targets\nWe committed to an ambitious set of GHG emissions reduction targets that will reduce our emissions by 42 percent by 2030, putting us on a trajectory to meet or exceed the guidance of the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\nRead more\n\nLife Cycle Assessments\nWe completed life cycle assessments of six of our high volume products. This data helps quantify the environmental impacts of our products and will help us create better, more sustainable products in the future.\n\nRead more\n\nResponsible Business Alliance Supplier Trainings\nWe rolled out an e-Learning program from the Responsible Business Alliance to educate our suppliers. The program allows us to connect specific suppliers with appropriate e-Learning content, encouraging compliance, sustainable initiatives and reducing risk in our supply chain.\n\nRead more\n\nCOVID-19 Response\nTo keep our team moving forward in the midst of a global pandemic, we implemented health and safety measures in our facilities, let employees work from home whenever possible, provided emergency leave to those who could not work and provided opportunities for vaccination.\n\nRead more\n\nSupply Chain Resiliency\nWe developed and deployed unique artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities to predict risks to our supply base. Using these technologies, Western Digital was able to minimize significant risks and disruptions.\n\nRead more\nOur ESG Approach\n\nWe believe that being an industry leader means creating shared value\u2014both for our business and for those around us. Across our global operations, Western Digital\u2019s focus on sustainability helps keep our communities and environment vibrant while supporting our business. We believe that sustainability:\n\n- Leads to more efficient and resilient business operations\n- Helps us meet our customers\u2019 efficiency targets\n- Reduces risks of misconduct and legal liability\n- Helps increase our investor pool with demonstrable ESG performance\n- Enhances the reliability of our supply chain\n- Improves the health, well-being, engagement and productivity of our employees\n- Helps us meet our customers\u2019 efficiency targets\n- Reduces risks of misconduct and legal liability\n\nOur sustainability strategy focuses on issues that are material to our stakeholders and our business. By setting goals and monitoring progress, including science-based targets, we can promote vibrancy and resiliency in the communities where we live and work and promote better business performance.\n\nMateriality, as used in this report, and our materiality assessment process, is different than the definition used in the context of filings with the SEC. Issues deemed material for purposes of this report may not be considered material for SEC reporting purposes.\nCOVID-19 Response\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically accelerated all things digital \u2014 from e-commerce to e-learning to online healthcare. Consequently, data infrastructure is being strained in unprecedented ways. As a company that designs and supplies much of the world\u2019s essential data infrastructure, Western Digital has played a vital role in the world\u2019s adaptation to COVID-19. To keep our business moving forward, our people have risen to meet the ongoing challenges brought about by the pandemic.\n\nTo prioritize the health and safety of our employees, we quickly transitioned all possible employees to work from home. When specific responsibilities required team members to work onsite, we adopted leading safety measures to safeguard employee health, including implementing PPE, health screenings and reduced business travel. We provided regular wellness updates and expanded access to health and wellness resources. And we provided regular, proactive communication to our employees through town halls, weekly videos and other communication channels. We continue to encourage our employees to be vaccinated and have facilitated vaccine drives in many of our global locations, including India, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines. We provide paid leave for employees to get vaccinated or for those suffering from effects of COVID-19 (in addition to those who are sick or quarantined due to COVID-19 exposure).\n\nIn addition to supporting our employees, we also support the communities in which we operate through cash contributions to organizations providing support during COVID-19.\n\nOur response to COVID-19 remains agile. We continue to review our site protocols, including health and safety screening and continued enhanced cleaning. We continually adapt and implement location and geography-specific measures in response to the latest knowledge and recommendations. And we seek to ensure our products remain available to support the world\u2019s data infrastructure.\n\nAddressing Systemic Racism\n\nWe also acknowledge that persistent, systemic racism remains a serious, tragic barrier for many in the United States and beyond. When it comes to racism or discrimination, we do not mince words: racism must end. It erodes human dignity, hampers talented individuals from making valuable contributions in their communities and interferes with the success of societies and institutions. No one should be denied the opportunity to develop their potential because of their race.\n\nAt Western Digital, we seek to do our part to promote equity and equality, and to expand opportunities for advancement around the world. Internally, we believe we can achieve the best business outcomes by developing a diverse, inclusive working environment that empowers all of our talented employees to make an impact, together. Externally, we have implemented targeted Giving initiatives to address issues of inequality in regions where we operate.\n\nLearn more about our diversity and inclusion efforts here.\nAWARDS AND RECOGNITIONS\n\nWorld Economic Forum\nWestern Digital\u2019s Penang and Prachinburi sites have been designated as \u201cAdvanced Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) Lighthouses\u201d by the World Economic Forum\n\n2021 Best Company for Millennials and Best Company for Diversity\nWomen\u2019s Choice Award recognized Western Digital as a Best Company for Millennials and a Best Company for Diversity (2021)\n\nWorld\u2019s Most Ethical Companies\u00ae\nWestern Digital is recognized as One of the World\u2019s Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere (2021)\n\n2020 Pro Patria Award\n2020 Pro Patria Award from the Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR), a Department of Defense program\n\nMAALA ESG INDEX 2021: Platinum Plus\nWestern Digital achieved the top Platinum Plus rating for corporate social responsibility\n\nOne of America\u2019s Most Responsible Companies\nNewsweek recognized Western Digital as One of America\u2019s Most Responsible Companies (2021)\n\nFactory of Choice Award\nWestern Digital\u2019s Shanghai facility received a Responsible Business Alliance Factory of Choice Award\n\nNewsweek recognized Western Digital as One of America\u2019s Most Responsible Companies (2021)\nExpectations for our products are changing. Data at scale is putting new demands on infrastructure and customers are increasingly demanding more sustainable products and solutions. We continue to focus on innovation in order to create the world\u2019s most advanced, sustainable data infrastructure products.\n\nOur Performance\n\nLife Cycle Assessments\n\nWestern Digital embraces the importance of data. When it comes to delivering products designed and manufactured with long-term sustainability in mind, we let data lead our efforts.\n\nLife cycle assessment (or LCA) is a methodology for assessing environmental impacts associated with all the stages of a product\u2019s life cycle \u2014 from raw material extraction through materials processing, manufacture, distribution, use and end-of-life.\nIn FY2021, we completed ISO-conformant life cycle assessments (LCAs) of six high-volume products to quantify their environmental impacts and we publicly disclosed summaries of those assessments. These LCAs will serve as a baseline for product impact and will influence future decisions related to design, manufacturing and logistics as we move into a more sustainable future.\n\n**Case Study: Easy Recycle**\n\n**Making it easier for customers to recycle data storage devices**\n\nLaunched on Earth Day 2020, our Easy Recycle product take-back program helps customers easily recycle old data storage devices. Rather than sending old or broken devices to landfills, customers can ship them for free to our recycling partner by dropping them off at any UPS store. Western Digital covers all shipping costs and rewards customers for their participation with a discount coupon that can be used for a future purchase in the Western Digital online store. The program covers all storage devices\u2014both internal and external HDDs and SSDs\u2014and even applies to devices made by other manufacturers. In line with our commitment to data safety and security, all drives are safely recycled through a certified process that protects all customer data.\n\nTo date, the Easy Recycle program has:\n\n- recycled more than 13,500 drives.\n- diverted more than six metric tons of waste from landfills.\n\n---\n\n1 eHDD and eSSD end-of-life and distribution phase impacts are less than 1%.\nOur Performance\n\nScience-Based Targets\n\nIn June 2021, we announced our commitment to set science-based targets for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions that are in line with what the latest climate science says is needed to prevent the worst impacts of climate change.\n\nIn September 2021, the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) approved our reduction goals. With a focus on reducing operational emissions by 42 percent by 2030, our goals will put us on a trajectory to meet or exceed the guidance in the Paris Climate Agreement. Our targets align with the ambitious SBTi goal to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0 C above pre-industrial levels. We have already accelerated our investments in meaningful emissions reductions in order to meet these ambitious targets.\n\nMINIMIZING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT\n\nWestern Digital\u2019s long-term success depends on reliable access to raw materials, good relationships with communities and governments, the health of our workforce and innovation to meet or surpass the evolving expectations of our customers. For each of the above considerations, environmental sustainability is essential to the future of our business and our world.\n\nThe SBTi represents a partnership between CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute and the World Wide Fund for Nature. See our latest CDP Climate Change disclosure here.\nENERGY EFFICIENT PRODUCTS\n\nAs data becomes an increasingly essential part of life, new demands are being put on data infrastructures. These changes can lead to increases in energy consumption, driving our customers to commit to product energy reductions.\n\nAt Western Digital, we work to meet these demands by investing in the engineering required to continuously reduce our HDD and flash-based product energy needs. We strive to reduce the power consumption of our devices and raw materials usage on a per-byte basis and to increase capacity of our devices in a given form factor\u2014which results in better energy and materials management per byte of storage. For example, our focus on improving HDD power efficiency resulted in an estimated 300,000 MWh of product-level power savings from FY2020 to FY2021. Our continued innovation in design enables significant greenhouse gas emission reductions during the customer use phase of our product life cycle.\n\nCase Study: Thailand\n\nRemoving more than 45 tons of waste from our waste stream\n\nIn FY2021, our team in Thailand continued efforts to reduce their waste stream with an aggressive waste reduction program. The program\u2019s original goal was to divert 19 tons of waste from landfills. However, our Thailand operations more than doubled their target, removing approximately 45 tons of waste from their waste stream.\n\n45 tons\nOF WASTE REMOVED FROM OUR WASTE STREAM\n\nCase Study: San Jose\n\nUpgrading recycled water quality at our Great Oaks facility\n\nIn FY2021, we made significant improvements to the wastewater treatment plant at our Great Oaks campus in San Jose. We added a crossflow filtration system to the industrial wastewater treatment plant, which acts as a pre-filter for a downstream Reverse Osmosis (RO) system. The two systems work together to provide the on-site cooling tower with high quality recycled water. Higher quality water resulted in a notable improvement to cooling tower efficiency, to the point that the system now also provides water to on-site boilers and chillers. Better water quality has significantly reduced chlorine demand in the cooling tower and saves an estimated 50,000 cubic meters of water from entering the sanitary sewer per year.\n\nLearn more about our approach to the Environment.\nWestern Digital has an extensive in-house manufacturing network of more than 40,000 factory employees and hundreds of global production parts suppliers and contract manufacturers. We believe that transparency and accountability leads to more responsible, resilient supply chains, better working conditions and improved environmental performance.\n\n**Our Performance**\n\n**Capacity Building and Training**\n\nSince 2007, Western Digital has been a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA). As part of this membership, RBA completes regular audits of our suppliers to identify labor issues and risks to our business.\n\nTo engage suppliers found to be in non-conformance during these audits, we adopted RBA\u2019s e-Learning program in FY2021. The program allows us to tailor appropriate e-Learning content for specific suppliers or to address the details of specific non-conformance events.\n\nOnce suppliers complete the e-Learning curriculum, they are encouraged to come up with the appropriate corrective actions and implement them. To date, adoption and engagement with the RBA e-Learning program has been positive.\n\n| RBA Validated Assessment Program Score Improvement Initiative (e-Learning) |\n|---|---|\n| 9 suppliers | 158 |\n| Number of Suppliers | Number of Courses Completed |\n| 27 | 84% |\n| Number of Participants | % Courses Completed |\n| 188 | 84% |\n| Number of Assigned E-Learning Courses |\n## SUPPLY CHAIN TRANSPARENCY\n\n### Western Digital's Supply Chain\n\n| OVERALL SUPPLIER DATABASE | NUMBER OF SITES/FACILITIES\u00b9 | NUMBER OF REGIONS\u00b9 |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|\n| 14,445                    | 952                         | 80                |\n\n### Top 10 Region List\u00b9\n\n| SITES AND FACILITIES | NUMBER |\n|----------------------|--------|\n| China                | 215    |\n| Hong Kong            | 109    |\n| India                | 80     |\n| Japan                | 134    |\n| Malaysia             | 198    |\n| Singapore            | 183    |\n| Taiwan               | 137    |\n| Thailand             | 130    |\n| United Kingdom       | 126    |\n| United States        | 327    |\n\n\u00b9 Includes all direct and indirect material suppliers.

We believe we can achieve the best business outcomes by empowering our diverse and talented employees to make an impact, together. We work diligently to foster a working environment where our employees and the employees of our suppliers are treated with respect and dignity and provided with fair and safe working conditions.\n\nOur Performance\n\nProtecting Human Rights\n\nWestern Digital is unequivocally committed to human rights. In FY2021, we conducted a global Human Rights Impact Assessment, consistent with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. That detailed assessment, which was performed by an independent third party and included input from both internal and external stakeholders, analyzed potential upstream, operational and downstream human rights impacts of our business. The results of that assessment are helping us allocate resources appropriately to strengthen our ongoing efforts to protect and preserve human rights throughout our operations and business footprint.\nSUPPORTING OUR PEOPLE DURING COVID-19\n\nWe continue to proactively protect the health and safety of our employees through a phased return-to-site plan based on local guidance and global best practices, by encouraging employees to get vaccinated, including through vaccine drives in India, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand, and by providing paid leave for employees impacted by COVID-19.\n\nCOVID-19 VACCINATIONS\n\nWestern Digital Guiding Principles\n\n- Ensure vaccines are available at no cost to employees\n- Educate employees about vaccines\n- Assist with access to vaccines\n- Provide emergency leave for time off related to vaccine\n- Educate employees on when and where to get vaccinated\n- Offer easy access to help employees schedule appointments\n- Arrange transportation for mass off-site vaccination events when needed\n\nVaccination Progress\n\nWestern Digital teams have been working with local government, industry networks and hospitals to provide vaccine offerings to employees. As of 11/1/21, we\u2019ve achieved the following progress:\n\n- In Thailand, 97% of employees and on-site contractors are fully vaccinated.\n- 7,774 works in the United States have attested their vaccination status with 90.7% fully vaccinated.\n- More than 97% of employees in Malaysia are fully vaccinated.\n- 72% of full-time employees have received at least the first dose in India.\n- In Japan, 87.1% of employees are fully vaccinated.\n- In the Philippines, 73% of employees have been fully vaccinated, with the combined partial and fully vaccinated at 92%.\n- In China, 90.7% of employees have been fully vaccinated, with the combined partial and fully vaccinated at 92.6%.\n\nCase Study: Fujisawa\n\nUtilizing HDD simulation technology to manage COVID-19\n\nAt our Hard Drive facility in Fujisawa, Japan we used simulation technology to help control the spread of COVID-19. Simulations of the working environment helped us develop a hood that controls the diffusion of air between workstations, with the objective of protecting the health and safety of employees.\n\nLearn more about our approach to Workforce, Workplace and Community.\nPay Equity\n\nWe believe people should be paid for what they do and how they do it, regardless of their gender, race, or other personal characteristics. To fulfill that commitment, we benchmark pay using technology market data, set pay ranges based on market data and consider factors such as an employee\u2019s role and experience, the location of their job, and their performance. We regularly review our compensation practices, both in terms of our overall workforce and individual employees, to ensure our pay is fair and equitable.\n\nAnnually, we review our pay practices to ensure consistency and equitable treatment. We use an independent firm and domain expert to assist in this analysis. The annual review is critical because our workforce changes constantly \u2013 in each year, employees are hired, move between roles, receive pay adjustments, and some leave. It is our objective to ensure that no bias finds its way into our system even with these ongoing changes. This year, our review included 75% of our total global employee population, including employees based in the United States, Israel, Malaysia, Thailand and India.\n\nWhen we find any discrepancies between actual compensation and our policies, we work quickly to remedy them. Our most recent pay equity review, which we started at the end of fiscal year 2021, identified that women, after accounting for role, experience, location and performance, were paid 99.4 cents for every dollar earned by men. In the United States, we also review pay equity across race/ethnicity groups and found as a result of the latest review, after accounting for role, experience, location and performance, that non-white employees were paid 100.6 cents on every dollar earned by white employees. After identifying these gaps, we made pay adjustments to close all identified gaps. We will continue to review compensation and engage in a range of initiatives aimed at increasing diversity and ensuring equal pay and opportunity for all employees.\n\nWE ARE COMMITTED TO TRANSPARENCY IN THIS PROCESS AND NEXT YEAR WE WILL EXPAND THE PAY EQUITY ANALYSIS TO REVIEW ALL OF OUR MAJOR MARKETS.\nWe can help address the social, environmental and economic challenges that affect our world by investing in the future of our communities. We give back in strategic areas that affect our communities and our business: providing access to enriching STEM education opportunities to underprivileged and underrepresented youth; working to eliminate world hunger and preserving the planet that we all share.\n\nOur strategy is global, but is executed at a local level, leaving room to tailor implementation of strategy to meet the needs of local communities where we live and operate. For example, STEM education in Thailand looks quite different than it does in the United States, so a one-size-fits-all approach to community giving doesn\u2019t work. This approach is especially vital in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, which impacted communities in every region where we operated. Flexibility in our approach to Global Giving allowed us to adapt and respond to needs as they arose.\nCase Study: Israel\n\nWestern Digital Israel Maala ESG \u201cPlatinumPlus\u201d Award\n\nMaala\u2019s CSR/ESG Index is an assessment tool that benchmarks the social and environmental responsibility of Israeli companies. One hundred and fifty companies were rated for the 2021 Index, and Western Digital was ranked and measured in comparison to leading high tech companies in Israel. In 2021, we received the highest possible score.\n\n\u201cMitchashvim\u201d: A Computer for Every Student\n\nMore than 200,000 Israeli households with children in the education system did not have computer access at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, many students could not study from home. Western Digital\u2019s Israel team decided to take action and began to collect local equipment donations. The project developed into a national initiative (\u201cMitchashvim\u201d), which was embraced by Israel\u2019s President and saw collaboration between the business sector, NGOs, Government and Local Authorities. Western Digital volunteers collected, sorted and upgraded thousands of computers that were delivered to students in need.\n\nUltra.Code Bootcamp Program\n\nOur Israel team initiated the Ultra.Code Bootcamp to bring talented ultra-Orthodox women into the high tech industry. In collaboration with the Kamatech organization, the Bootcamp has taken place each year since 2018 at Western Digital\u2019s Israeli offices. Participants go through a unique 3-month blended learning program and dozens of program graduates are directly recruited and successfully integrated each year into Western Digital development teams and other tech companies. The program continued even during the pandemic and we expect another successful course to complete in 2022.\n\nWe are proud to help drive social change and promote multiculturalism and diversity in Israel.\n\nLearn more about our approach to Global Giving and Doing.\nWestern Digital\u2019s business depends on trust\u2014from our employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders. But trust must be earned\u2014and constantly upheld. Every Western Digital employee must act with integrity in everything we do to protect and maintain our stakeholders\u2019 trust, an expectation that is clearly articulated in Western Digital\u2019s Global Code of Conduct.\n\nOur Performance\n\nLeading with Integrity\n\nIn October 2020, our CEO kicked off the company\u2019s annual Compliance Awareness Month with a one-hour global, all-hands event focused on the importance of ethics at Western Digital. Our Chief Compliance Officer joined the executive leaders of Sales, Engineering and Operations in a panel discussion with the CEO. The discussion addressed business integrity, trust and the experiences they\u2019ve had in driving an ethics culture. The event saw leadership setting a clear tone for all employees on the value and importance of ethics and integrity in our business.\n\nThe Ethisphere Institute, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices, recognized Western Digital for the third consecutive year as one of the World\u2019s Most Ethical Companies. This recognition reflects Western Digital\u2019s continued commitment to lead with integrity.\n\nPrivacy Center\n\nComplying with privacy regulations and effectively managing privacy risk is fundamental to the well-being of our customers and Western Digital\u2019s success. As data continues to grow in impact and importance, the way we protect data and maintain customer privacy has grown more important too. Our customers trust us to protect their personal information, and we don\u2019t take their trust lightly.\n\nIn FY2021, we launched our Privacy Center, a portal for customers to learn more about our data privacy practices. The site lays out our core privacy principles, explains the policies and practices that we use to protect customer privacy and describes what personal information we use and why.\n\nLearn more about our approach to Integrity.\nOur Company\n\nWestern Digital creates environments for your data to thrive.

Customers, investors and business leaders are increasingly demanding that sustainability be woven into the core of business. We know that operating sustainably protects our people, our communities and our planet\u2014and it creates value and opportunities for our company in the long-run. As Western Digital further embeds sustainable business practices into our business strategy, we increasingly look to data and metrics to inform our priorities and initiatives.\n\nWe acknowledge that data and metrics are most effective when they are openly disclosed. We embrace transparency with our customers, partners and peers through regular sustainability reporting and other communications in order to advance sustainable business practices and have a more positive impact on the world around us.\n\nMateriality and Stakeholder Engagement\n\nWestern Digital conducted a materiality assessment in 2019 (informed by GRI\u2019s Stakeholder Inclusiveness and Materiality Principles) to identify, assess and prioritize our most important ESG topics. The process helped us understand our most significant impacts, risks and opportunities to better inform our business decision-making.\n\nIn 2020, we re-evaluated our materiality assessment to validate our current priority ESG topics and potentially introduce new topics based on updated stakeholder input. For example, we collected new data through additional customer interviews, shareholder outreach, employee surveys and market research. The new data elevated the materiality of several key issues while showing global consistency with results from the previous materiality exercise.\n\n1 Materiality, as used in this report, and our materiality assessment process, is different than the definition used in the context of filings with the SEC. Issues deemed material for purposes of this report may not be considered material for SEC reporting purposes.\nThis report focuses on the highest-prioritized topics for our company:\n\n- Anti-Corruption\n- Chemicals and Hazardous Substances\n- Climate Change\n- Critical Minerals and Metals\n- Data Privacy and Security\n- Diversity and Inclusion\n- Energy and Emissions\n- Global Giving and Doing\n- Health and Safety\n- Human Rights and Labor Practices\n- Labor and Management Relations\n- Life Cycle Impacts\n- Product Quality and Safety\n- Talent Attraction, Engagement and Retention\n\nSustainable Development Goals\n\nFulfilling the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 will require action from businesses like ours. We have identified three SDGs that align directly with our material sustainability priorities and opportunities for impact. To see how our initiatives connect to additional SDGs, view our full SDG index here.\n\nSDG 13\nTAKE URGENT ACTION TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE AND ITS IMPACTS\n\nA continued focus on data and efficiency has helped us achieve notable reductions in energy usage and emissions, even as we increase shipments of our products.\n\nActions taken in FY2021:\n\n- Our ambitious carbon reduction goals have been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative. We have committed to reduce Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 42% by FY2030 and reduce Scope 3 use-phase emissions/petabyte by 50% by FY2030, both from an FY2020 base year.\n- Year-over-year progress with product energy intensity improvements and Scope 1 and 2 emissions reductions.\n- We completed a TCFD-aligned climate scenario analysis. As a result of the analysis, we identified possible risks and opportunities for our business that relate to climate change. We are reviewing and incorporating those insights into Western Digital\u2019s strategy and risk management processes as appropriate. View our TCFD index here to learn more about Western Digital\u2019s climate-related disclosures.\n\nSDG 8\nPROMOTE SUSTAINED, INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH, FULL AND PRODUCTIVE EMPLOYMENT AND DECENT WORK FOR ALL\n\nWe work diligently to foster a working environment where Western Digital employees, and employees of our suppliers, are treated with respect and dignity and are provided with fair and safe working conditions.\n\nActions taken in FY2021:\n\n- We partnered with BSR, a global nonprofit organization, to complete an independent human rights impact assessment (HRIA) of our footprint and business model. Western Digital plans to use the results from this assessment to refine human rights policies, procedures and practices to enhance our protection of human rights and to mitigate potential risks.\n- In response to COVID-19, we have adopted leading health and safety practices to prioritize the health and safety of our employees and suppliers. As knowledge and recommendations related to the pandemic evolve, we continually adapt response measures to keep our people safe.\n\nRead more about our human rights and labor practices.\nSDG 12\nENSURE SUSTAINABLE CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION PATTERNS\n\nWe seek to provide our customers with the most advanced, innovative and sustainable data infrastructure products in the world. We aim to minimize the environmental impact of our products throughout their life cycle to adapt to evolving market demands.\n\nActions taken in FY2021:\n\n\u2022 We completed life cycle assessments (LCAs) for six Western Digital products. These LCAs will be used to understand environmental impacts associated with each of our products at different phases of their life cycle and will inform creation of future products.\n\n\u2022 Our Easy Recycle program enables customers to safely and easily recycle old data storage devices. To date, the program has recycled more than 13,500 drives and diverted more than six metric tons of waste from landfills.\n\nRead more about our products\u2019 life cycle.\n\nGovernance\nGRI 102-18, TCFD Governance A\n\nWhile delivering business results is always a driving focus at Western Digital, we believe how we achieve results is equally important. Western Digital is committed to ethical conduct in our business at every step, everywhere.\n\nWestern Digital\u2019s strong corporate governance demonstrates accountability and a high level of integrity in management practices across the organization. Our Board of Directors has standing Audit, Compensation and Talent and Governance committees; each committee operates in accordance with a written charter. Our Board and its standing committees are responsible for oversight of the company\u2019s strategic planning and risk management, and regularly receive updates about the company\u2019s overall sustainability initiatives and performance.\n\nThe Governance Committee is responsible for assisting our Board in overseeing our corporate responsibility and sustainability policies and programs. The committee provides Board-level input on our social, environmental and human rights policies and programs. In addition, the Compensation and Talent Committee periodically reviews our human capital management policies, programs and initiatives, including those focusing on culture, diversity and inclusion. Additionally, our Audit Committee oversees Western Digital\u2019s enterprise risk management process, including assessments and policies and has oversight of the Ethics and Compliance program too. The Governance Committee receives updates from our sustainability group and management two to three times each year and discusses implementation of new sustainability initiatives.\n\nOur executive leadership team sets and oversees our global sustainability strategy, with our Corporate Sustainability function directing the implementation of that strategy, including public reporting. A cross-functional Sustainability Working Group drives specific sustainability initiatives throughout the company and includes representatives from Corporate Sustainability, Human Resources, Supply Chain Management, Quality, Sales and Marketing, Operations, Research and Development, Corporate Strategy and Ethics and Compliance.\n\nOur Board comprises a majority of independent directors, including an independent Chair of the Board and a Lead Independent Director. Each director is elected annually by a simple majority of shareholder votes. As the strategic direction of Western Digital evolves, we remain committed to ongoing Board refreshment and diversity. Our Board of Directors recently adopted a provision requiring the Governance Committee to include, and instruct any search firm it engages to include, women and members of underrepresented communities in the pool from which the committee selects director nominees. This provision reflects our Board\u2019s continued commitment to diversity in the boardroom. For more information, please refer to our 2021 Proxy Statement and Corporate Governance Guidelines.\nEnergy and Emissions\n\nWhy it Matters\n\nGRI 103-1\n\nClimate change is one of the most significant concerns facing our world today. As a global enterprise with operations in several particularly vulnerable regions of the world, Western Digital is especially sensitive to the effects of climate change. We are committed to doing our part to decrease GHG emissions, reduce energy consumption, lower our climate impacts and improve climate resiliency.\n\nManagement Approach\n\nGRI 103-2, TC-SC-110a.2\n\nOur Global Operations and Corporate Real Estate (CRE) organizations are responsible for our Energy and Resource Management (ERM) and environmental programs. The Global ERM Program Management Office (PMO) analyzes trends in manufacturing production and associated energy consumption to recommend our corporate-level reduction targets and strategy. Each of our manufacturing sites uses this target as the basis for establishing their energy conservation projects and initiatives. These projects are the basis for our GHG reduction program. Each site provides status reports to the ERM PMO and corporate management team semi-annually.\n\nAdditionally, the Global ERM Committee analyzes near-term energy efficiency improvement project performance against targets, meeting semi-annually to report progress and share best practices. Representatives from each manufacturing site are responsible for identifying and monitoring energy efficiency improvement projects.\n\nINTEGRATED MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nWestern Digital uses an Integrated Management System (IMS) to manage corporate quality, environmental, health and safety and business continuity standards. Our IMS continually evolves, helping us more effectively measure and disclose our commitment to protecting the environment, our people and our business sustainability. Our IMS Policy includes our commitment to protect the environment. The IMS Policy is underpinned by industry-recognized environmental certification for all sites on a global multi-site certificate to ISO14001:2015. Visit our Corporate Responsibility Resource Center webpage for more information on certifications earned through the IMS.\n\nTARGETS AND GOALS\n\nWe have committed to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 42% by FY2030, from a FY2020 base year, consistent with the goal to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. We have also committed to reduce Scope 3 GHG emissions from use of sold products 50% per petabyte capacity sold by FY2030 from an FY2020 base year. These targets have been approved by the Science-Based Targets initiative. Western Digital is in this for the long game, and we hope you will join us.\n\nTo achieve these goals, we will focus primarily on energy reductions through increased operational efficiencies, adoption of on-site solar and direct procurement of renewable energy. We are making progress in several areas:\n\n- As of mid-2021, Western Digital\u2019s facilities in Northern California run on 100% renewable energy.\n- Western Digital is exploring renewable energy options at global sites.\n- Western Digital has implemented on-site solar at multiple facilities around the world.\n- From FY2020 to FY2021, Western Digital reduced the energy intensity to manufacture its products by more than 43%.\n- From FY2020 to FY2021, Western Digital reduced aggregate Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 emissions by more than 6%.\n\nAdditionally, we completed an analysis of our FY2020 Scope 3 Greenhouse Gas inventory to better understand our value chain impacts and to support the development of the science-based target. The results of this inventory have been published in Western Digital\u2019s response to the 2021 CDP Climate Change Questionnaire. We will also complete the analysis of our FY2021 Scope 3 emissions and disclose those results publicly in the 2022 CDP Climate Change Questionnaire.\n\nFurthermore, Western Digital remains focused on energy conservation. In FY2021, we set an aggressive target for energy conservation measures corresponding to >1.5% energy reduction as compared to the prior fiscal year. We exceeded this annual target and completed planned energy conservation measures corresponding to >3.0% energy reduction.\nENERGY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nWe reduce the amount of energy and carbon in our operations through various Energy Resource Management (ERM) Program initiatives. Since 2007, we have saved approximately $45 million in energy costs by reducing our energy consumption while collecting critically important information and data.\n\nWestern Digital\u2019s CRE and Global Operations organization conduct regular assessments with local energy management experts to review current operational processes and identify opportunities for higher energy efficiency. For example, we increased reliance on high-efficiency machines and further promote energy efficiency through cost-neutral, procedural or behavioral changes. Additionally, we completed a renewable energy survey at manufacturing locations globally and leveraged it in order to develop a company GHG reduction strategy.\n\nINTERNAL AUDITS\n\nGRI 103-3\n\nWestern Digital conducts IMS audits of our Environmental Management System as part of our broader IMS implementation. All Western Digital sites use IMS procedures for internal self-assessments, controlled at the corporate level through our Central IMS Program Office, which allows us to apply corrections and lessons learned across our numerous sites.\n\nCLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT AND RESILIENCY\n\nTCFD Governance B, Risk Management A, B and C\n\nAt Western Digital, we actively monitor and manage our impact on the environment, as well as the environment\u2019s potential impact on our business. Our executive leadership team reviews and evaluates our enterprise risks each year in conjunction with our Enterprise Risk Management Program. Several risks\u2014including climate-related risks\u2014are assessed as a matter of course. Risks identified during this process are assigned to functional or regional leaders for management and/or mitigation, depending on the characteristics of the risk. Where appropriate, our business continuity team develops a strategy and process to manage the risk across our various sites. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors reviews the risks identified through the enterprise risk management process, along with our strategy for managing those risks, at least annually, with additional updates provided as needed based on changes in our risk profile.\n\nCLIMATE SCENARIO ANALYSIS\n\nTCFD Strategy C\n\nIn 2021, Western Digital partnered with BSR, a global nonprofit that works with its network of over 250 member companies to build a just and sustainable world, to develop three scenarios for 2030 which explored climate-related risks and opportunities, third-party climate data points and other key uncertainties relevant to Western Digital\u2019s business. The scenario analysis was completed in alignment with TCFD expectations.\n\nThe scenario analysis process involved the following steps:\n\n- **Understanding Context:** BSR interviewed internal stakeholders to identify key trends that are shaping Western Digital\u2019s future operating context. BSR conducted complementary research on trends (environmental, economic, social, political and technological) relevant to Western Digital\u2019s industry and geography.\n- **Scenario Development:** Western Digital leveraged a set of three 2030 scenarios developed by BSR for the We Mean Business coalition, with extensive input from the climate community. The scenarios were augmented with industry and geography trends and incorporated credible climate projections (from ~1.5\u00b0C \u2013 ~4\u00b0C) for emissions reductions and climate impacts, as shown in Figure 1. Furthermore, third-party climate projections consider a small range of variables, e.g. fuel mix, GDP growth, etc., whereas the scenarios used by Western Digital augmented these with consideration of additional factors such as political developments, emerging technologies and new business.\n\n**Strategic Implications:** A workshop was conducted with internal Western Digital stakeholders to identify the potential risks and opportunities for each scenario and identify ideas to enhance Western Digital\u2019s resilience and refine its strategy.\n\n### SCENARIO NAME\n\n| SCENARIO NAME | AUTOMATION ACCELERATION | WALLDED WORLD | RESILIENT REBIRTH |\n|---------------|-------------------------|---------------|-------------------|\n| Key Parameters | A geopolitically fragmented world, a slow global economy and ramping-up climate impact | A geopolitically fragmented world, a challenging economic situation and scaled environmental shocks | A recovering economy fully embracing the low-carbon transition in a cooperative way, still subject to environmental shocks |\n| Temperature Assumptions (above pre-industrial levels by 2100) | +3\u00b0C Slowly declining emissions | +4\u00b0C Rising emissions | +1.5\u00b0C Strongly declining emissions |\n| Emissions Reduction Models | Representative Concentration Pathway 6.0 | Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 | Representative Concentration Pathway 2.6 |\n| Physical Climate Impact Models | The World Bank Climate Knowledge Portal | The World Bank Climate Knowledge Portal | The World Bank Climate Knowledge Portal |\n\n1 The Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) represent different emissions, concentration and radiative forcing projections leading to a large range of global warming levels from continued warming rising above 4\u00b0C by the year 2100 to limiting warming well below 2\u00b0C as called for in the Paris Agreement (RCP Database - Version 2.0). These were used in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report. The Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) build upon the RCPs by modeling how socioeconomic factors, such as economic, population and technology developments, may impact actual emissions reductions (SSP Database - Shared Socioeconomic Pathways - V 2.0). These will be included in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report.\nAs a result of this process, we identified three areas of our strategy that may incur risks and opportunities across all scenarios. These scenario insights will be reviewed by Western Digital\u2019s Sustainability and Enterprise Risk Management teams and incorporated into Western Digital\u2019s strategy and risk management processes as deemed necessary.\n\nWe disclose additional TCFD-aligned information, including information to support climate-related governance, strategy, risk management and metrics and targets in our annual response to the CDP Climate Questionnaire. Our recent CDP Climate Change responses can be found on our Corporate Responsibility website. To view how our disclosures demonstrate alignment with TCFD, view our TCFD Index linked here.\n\n**Key Metrics**\n\n**GRI 102-56**\n\nWe are proud of our efforts to minimize operational energy use and the resulting emissions. Our GHG emissions inventory is externally verified by Cameron Cole, LLC for FY2021. For the full verification report, please visit the Corporate Responsibility Resource Center on our corporate website. We also communicate our efforts with external stakeholders through our annual response to CDP\u2019s climate change questionnaire.\n\n**TCFD Metrics and Targets A and C**\n\nWestern Digital commits to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 42% by FY2030 from a FY2020 base year. Western Digital also commits to reduce Scope 3 GHG emissions from use of sold products 50% per petabyte capacity sold by FY2030 from a FY2020 base year.\n\nThe targets covering greenhouse gas emissions from company operations (Scopes 1 and 2) are consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\n**ENERGY CONSUMPTION WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION**\n\n|                      | FY2019 | FY2020 | FY2021 |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total fuel consumption from nonrenewable sources (gas/oil) | 173.3  | 168.2  | 159.6  |\n| Total fuel consumption from renewable sources | 0.0    | 0.0    | 0.0    |\n| Total Electricity consumption | 1,951.1 | 1,865.6 | 1,941.4 |\n| Electricity consumption from renewable sources | 139.0  | 145.1  | 279.9  |\n| Electricity consumption from nonrenewable sources | 1,812.1 | 1,720.5 | 1,661.5 |\n| **TOTAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION** | 2,124.4 | 2,033.8 | 2,101.0 |\n\n1 Data includes the main research, development and manufacturing facilities owned by Western Digital Corporation in each fiscal year. These facilities are located in the United States, China, India, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand. Western Digital continues to reference the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol), the most widely used international accounting tool for government and business leaders, to understand, quantify and manage greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n**ENERGY INTENSITY**\n\n|                      | FY2019 | FY2020 | FY2021 |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Energy intensity ratio (kWh/PB) | 5,316.3 | 3,936.6 | 2,219.0 |\n\n1 The energy intensity ratio is based on energy consumed within the organization and is measured in kilowatt-hours per petabyte.

Partnering with our customers at every step, we aim to minimize the environmental impact of our products throughout their life cycle and adapt to evolving market demands.\n\n**Management Approach**\n\nGRI 103-2\n\nWestern Digital\u2019s engineering teams\u2014including Research and Development (R&D), Manufacturing and Quality Management\u2014are responsible for managing our product life cycle impacts. Our R&D team helps ensure product efficiency by design. In collaboration with our Corporate Sustainability function, the Product Environmental Compliance (PEC) team under our Quality Management organization manages Western Digital\u2019s overall life cycle assessment (LCA) process.\n\n**DESIGN**\n\nMaximizing functional storage produced on a materials\u2013used basis starts with efficient product design. Our product channels and vertical integration allow us to exactly match our storage to product cost and performance needs from stringent original equipment manufacturer (OEM) requirements to consumer products, while maximizing manufacturing efficiency. We strive to reduce the power consumption of our devices and raw materials usage on a per-byte basis and to increase capacity of our storage devices in a given form factor\u2014which results in better energy and materials management per byte of storage.\n\n**LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENTS**\n\nWestern Digital continued our progress with product LCAs, in accordance with ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 to understand impacts associated with each of product life cycle phases. In FY2021, we completed a total of six LCAs for our high volume products and we\u2019ve published summary carbon...\nfootprint data on our Corporate Responsibility website. We are using the LCA data to identify the most significant opportunities to reduce our impacts.\n\n**PRODUCT ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND EMISSIONS**\n\nOngoing growth in demand for data storage can lead to increases in product-related energy consumption, driving our customers to commit to product energy reductions. Western Digital works to meet these demands by investing in the engineering required to continuously reduce our HDD and flash-based product energy needs.\n\nWe extensively test our HDDs as part of the manufacturing process to confirm integrity and energy performance. To reduce manufacturing energy and minimize capital expenditures for test equipment, we continuously work to improve our testing efficiency and reduce overall test time. While market demands require larger drive sizes, which tend to increase per-product test times, our engineering teams work to keep energy intensity for such tests trending downward. Western Digital realized an estimated over 100 million kWh savings in power required to test our HDDs in FY2021, compared to an FY2020 baseline.\n\n**PRODUCT END-OF-LIFE**\n\nWe are committed to making product recyclability easy. We support the European Union Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive. We label all Western Digital products and/or packaging with the appropriate end-of-life symbols for their respective regions. Additionally, we established global minimum requirements for handling and disposing electronic waste (e-waste) from our own facilities and offices to eliminate or minimize negative environmental impact. For more information, see Western Digital\u2019s WEEE Statement.\n\n**PACKAGING**\n\nPackaging is an essential part of any product. Aside from providing a positive first brand touchpoint or great out-of-the-box experience for the customer, packaging protects products during shipping and warehousing and (when done right) can dramatically reduce storage, handling and shipping costs.\n\nAs a company of innovators, we seek to constantly push boundaries in all aspects of our products\u2014and packaging is no exception. In FY2021, we continued our years-long effort to make our packaging more sustainable and efficient. We are actively increasing the usage of recycled content in our packaging and innovating to reduce packaging materials generally.\n\nThese multi-year efforts resulted in the following impacts in FY2021:\n\n- Redesigned retail packaging to reduce our annual blister paper usage by over 411,000 kilograms (kg).\n- Adopted thinner blister paper in our packaging to save over 236,000 kg of paper per year.\n- Replaced a portion of the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) used in our packaging with recycled PET, reducing new PET consumption by over 9,000 kg per year.\n- Reengineered trays used in our manufacturing process to reduce our annual use of PET by more than 233,000 kg.\n\n**Key Metrics**\n\nTo underscore our commitment to minimizing the environmental impacts of our products, we track specific metrics that align with our strategic objectives. We are proud to report consistent year-over-year reductions in GHG emissions intensity for both HDD and SSD products since 2016. We also include the SASB Hardware Accounting Standard and SASB Semiconductor Standard metrics related to our product life cycle impacts.\n\n**ELECTRICAL POWER SAVINGS**\n\n|                      | FY2019 | FY2020 | FY2021 |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Annual electrical power savings due to HDD power efficiency innovations (million kWh) | 1,172.7 | 1,732.0 | 2,040.8 |\n\n1 The annual electrical power savings for FY2019 and FY2020 have been restated from previously published data due to an update of the supporting data.\n\n**GHG EMISSIONS INTENSITY**\n\n|                      | FY2020 | FY2021 |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|\n| GHG emissions intensity ratio\u2014HDD (Tons/PB) | 1.7 | 0.9 |\n| GHG emissions intensity ratio\u2014SSD (Tons/PB) | 4.3 | 2.9 |\n\n1 The denominator used to calculate the GHG emissions intensity ratio is shipped memory capacity.\n\n2 Includes Scope 1 and Scope 2 market-based GHG emissions and all gases CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, and NF3. Due to the transition to include the Scope 2 market-based, rather than location-based, GHG emissions in this calculation, our disclosure is limited to the last two fiscal years.\nChemicals and Hazardous Substances\n\nWhy it Matters\n\nGRI 103-1\n\nThe manufacturing process for storage drives requires the use of chemicals. Our workers may come into contact with chemicals during product manufacturing, so we strive for risk-free worksites and products, innovating to minimize the use of hazardous chemicals as we seek safer alternatives.\n\nManagement Approach\n\nGRI 103-2\n\nTwo teams are responsible for managing chemicals and hazardous substances in our operations and products:\n\n- Global Environmental Health and Safety team: Sets corporate environmental, health and safety management requirements for operational use of chemicals in Western Digital\u2019s research, development and manufacturing operations.\n- Product Environmental Compliance team: Ensures products meet worldwide environmental regulations, including the EU Directive on the Restriction of the use of certain Hazardous Substances (RoHS), the EU Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), the EU WEEE, the EU Packaging and Battery Directives and our OEM customer requirements.\n\nPOLICIES\n\nWestern Digital\u2019s IMS Policy describes our commitment to environmental compliance for all of our products and operations, including chemicals and hazardous substances management. For more information on our IMS, please see the Energy and Emissions section of this report.\n\nAdditionally, our PEC Engineering Specification and Requirements for Materials, Parts and Product Protective Packaging identifies the product requirements of the PEC team. We send the specification to all relevant suppliers and update the specification regularly.\n\nRESPONSIBLE MANUFACTURING PRACTICES\n\nWe believe in a proactive approach to managing product chemicals and hazardous substances in our operations and our products.\n\nOur Global Environmental Health and Safety Operational Control Requirements Manual sets the our minimum corporate requirements for chemical management within Western Digital\u2019s\n\nEND-OF-LIFE MATERIAL\n\n| FY2019 | DISPOSED (METRIC TONS) | RECOVERED (METRIC TONS) | PERCENTAGE RECYCLED |\n|--------|------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|\n| NMP2   | 1,371.1                | 1,302.5                 | 95%                 |\n| IPA (material)3 | 8.3                  | 8.3                     | 100%                |\n| Aerosol cans (material) | 0.04                | 0.00                    | 0%                  |\n| Batteries4 | 4.5                  | 3.9                     | 85%                 |\n| E-waste4 | 73.6                  | 72.1                    | 98%                 |\n| TOTAL   | 1,457.5                | 1,386.8                 | 95%                 |\n\n| FY2020 | DISPOSED (METRIC TONS) | RECOVERED (METRIC TONS) | PERCENTAGE RECYCLED |\n|--------|------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|\n| NMP2   | 1,460.0                | 1,387.0                 | 95%                 |\n| IPA (material)3 | 12.8                 | 12.8                    | 100%                |\n| Aerosol cans (material) | 0.03                | 0.0                     | 0%                  |\n| Batteries4 | 5.2                  | 4.4                     | 85%                 |\n| E-waste4 | 52.6                  | 51.5                    | 98%                 |\n| TOTAL   | 1,530.6                | 1,455.7                 | 95%                 |\n\n| FY2021 | DISPOSED (METRIC TONS) | RECOVERED (METRIC TONS) | PERCENTAGE RECYCLED |\n|--------|------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|\n| NMP2   | 940.6                  | 893.5                   | 95%                 |\n| IPA (material)3 | 9.6                  | 9.6                     | 100%                |\n| Aerosol cans (material) | 0.02                | 0.0                     | 0%                  |\n| Batteries4 | 0.8                  | 0.7                     | 85%                 |\n| E-waste4 | 19.3                  | 18.9                    | 98%                 |\n| TOTAL   | 970.3                  | 922.7                   | 95%                 |\n\n1Data only includes Great Oaks facility.

We enforce specific site-level procedures and regulations for safe chemicals management and storage during all stages of chemical use.\n\nAll of Western Digital\u2019s global operations follow the United Nations Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals to protect our manufacturing workers from chemicals and hazardous substances. We provide routine training to workers using this framework.\n\nKey Metrics\n\nGRI 103-3, 307-1\n\nDuring FY2021, Western Digital saw zero dollars in fines for product environmental non-compliance. Though Western Digital products generally contain IEC 62474 declarable substances, we meet all legal requirements for those substances. The main IEC 62474 declarable substances used in Western Digital products\u2014lead and nickel\u2014are fully compliant with regulations wherever our products are sold:\n\n- Lead is exempted under the EU\u2019s RoHS regulations and Western Digital\u2019s use of lead is consistent with those regulations.\n- Nickel is used as a component plating, which does not come into contact with consumers/users.\n\nOur PEC team monitors our company-specific key performance indicators and reports them to the Vice President, Center of Excellence in Corporate Quality, quarterly. We are proud to report we met our FY2021 target to respond to 100% of customer product environmental inquiries on-time.\n\n| IEC 62474 DECLARABLE SUBSTANCES | FY2019 | FY2020 | FY2021 |\n|----------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Percentage of products by revenue that contain IEC 62474 declarable substances | 100% | 100% | 100% |\n\n1 Though Western Digital\u2019s products generally contain IEC 62474 declarable substances, we meet all legal requirements for those substances. The main IEC 62474 declarable substances used in Western Digital products\u2014lead and nickel\u2014are fully compliant with regulations wherever our products are sold.\n\nBecause our employees are our most valuable asset, we take specific measures to oversee their working conditions and protect their long-term well-being. And we take steps to employ new predictive procurement tools and processes that can enable us to more easily avoid supply chain risk and disruption.\n\nHuman Rights and Labor Practices\n\nWhy it Matters\n\nGRI 103-1\n\nRespecting and upholding human rights is a foundational aspect of how we do business. We work diligently to ensure that Western Digital employees, and employees of our suppliers, are provided with a working environment where they are treated with respect and dignity and are provided with fair and safe working conditions.\n\nManagement Approach\n\nGRI 103-2\n\nOur human rights and labor approach includes policies, due diligence, stakeholder engagement, grievance mechanisms and remedies.\n\nPOLICIES\n\nWestern Digital has a set of tiered policies regarding human rights. First and foremost, Western Digital\u2019s Global Human Rights Policy outlines the company\u2019s commitment to respecting human rights, both in its operations and supply chain.\nIn addition, we set forth expectations for all Western Digital employees in our Global Code of Conduct\u2014published in 11 languages\u2014on which all employees receive annual training. Human Rights and Labor Practices Country-specific Work Rules and policies and factory-level policies, reinforce our commitment to treat all employees with dignity and respect.\n\nEach factory\u2019s general manager commits to abiding by our Global Code of Conduct, the Responsible Business Alliance\u2019s (RBA) Code of Conduct and country-specific Work Rules. Our company policies adhere to applicable local labor laws and conform to the RBA Code of Conduct. Our collective set of policies help create an environment with strong labor practices where all our manufacturing workers can thrive.\n\nDUE DILIGENCE\n\nWestern Digital both proactively and reactively assesses human rights-related risks and potential impacts in connection with our policies, practices and management approach. We conduct human rights due diligence and impact assessments at regular intervals and whenever appropriate based on circumstances or reports. Specifically, we monitor our human rights and labor practices in both owned and supplier facilities through audits and risk assessments. The RBA requires audits of factories generating finished goods biennially and these thorough assessments help us ensure our practices are aligned with our deep commitment to protect the rights of our workforce and supply-chain workers and create a positive and safe working environment for everyone. This process includes conducting human rights impact assessments (HRIs) from time to time, consistent with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. For example, in FY2021 we partnered with BSR, a global nonprofit that works with Western Digital employees in our Global Code of Conduct\u2014published in 11 languages\u2014on which all employees receive annual training. Human Rights and Labor Practices Country-specific Work Rules and policies and factory-level policies, reinforce our commitment to treat all employees with dignity and respect.\n\nWe also conduct periodic enterprise-wide risk assessments to specifically cover forced and child labor and consider the types and locations of our operations, among other factors. These assessments help us ensure our practices are aligned with our deep commitment to protect the rights of our workforce and supply-chain workers and create a positive and safe working environment for everyone. This process includes conducting human rights impact assessments (HRIs) from time to time, consistent with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. For example, in FY2021 we partnered with BSR, a global nonprofit that works with its network of over 250 member companies to build a just and sustainable world, to conduct an assessment. This HRI was an independent analysis of Western Digital\u2019s potential human rights impacts based on our footprint and business model. The risks identified were consistent with our expectations and with risks common within our industry, including forced labor and health and safety, especially in our supply chain. We are preparing to use the results and recommendations from the assessment to enhance our policies, procedures and practices to mitigate potential risks.\n\nSTAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND COLLABORATION\n\nWe proactively engage with internal and external stakeholders as we evaluate our impacts and work to improve the effectiveness of our Human Rights Program:\n\n\u2022 Since 2010, Western Digital has collaborated with other major electronics companies to launch supply chain capacity-building seminars and workshops. The seminars and workshops cover topics such as human rights, responsible hiring, foreign worker management, GHG emissions/carbon footprint, energy efficiency management, process chemical management and water stewardship.\n\n\u2022 Western Digital works closely with several partners to reduce the risk of forced labor. We continue to work closely with our suppliers and the RBA to audit practices to ensure suppliers are at all times following appropriate recruiting practices and that any necessary reimbursements are promptly provided to impacted employees. When we have found issues regarding recruitment fees, we have worked quickly to remediate them. Through our partnership with the RBA, we were made aware of three suppliers with reimbursement fee issues during FY2021. We worked with the RBA and other member companies to see that over USD 523,000 was reimbursed to employees within the supply chain.\n\n\u2022 We have actively participated in the Responsible Labor Initiative (RLI) since its founding in 2017. Through the RLI, we discuss best practices, collaborate with peers to develop cross-industry standards for healthy and sustainable working conditions and utilize shared resources to monitor our own practices and the practices of our suppliers.\n\nGRIEVANCE MECHANISMS\n\nAs detailed in the Integrity section of this report, Western Digital provides multiple avenues for employees to speak up concerning conduct contrary to our policies, including human rights violations, with the option to report concerns directly to their manager, Ethics and Compliance, Human Resources or Legal or through our global Ethics Helpline. We offer the Helpline to anyone who suspects misconduct, whether employed by Western Digital or not which includes suppliers\u2019 workers and their legitimate representatives.\n\nREMEDIES\n\nIf Western Digital learns of potential human rights abuses or other conduct contrary to our policies committed by our employees or suppliers, we take remedial action proportionate to the offense. Such remediation may include conducting an investigation, coordinating and tracking progress against corrective action plans, requiring additional audits (suppliers only) or possible suspension or termination of the relationship.\n\nSUPPLIER VETTING AND AUDITING\n\nWestern Digital leverages the RBA Code of Conduct, along with our own Global Human Rights Policy, to reduce the risks of human rights abuses and forced or child labor throughout our supply chain. We disclose our supply chain practices in accordance with the U.K. Modern Slavery Act of 2015 and the California Transparency in Supply Chain Act. Each year, we send letters to each of our suppliers about our commitment to the RBA Code of Conduct and the U.K. Modern Slavery Act and we require suppliers representing 90% of our cumulative spend plus strategic and single-source suppliers\u2019 facilities to conduct annual self-assessments and biennial RBA VAP audits.\n\nRBA assigns a third-party auditing firm based on its VAP manual and audit protocol to complete announced supplier audits. RBA releases its\nWestern Digital\u2019s manufacturing workforce is predominantly composed of directly-hired employees whom we employ and manage ourselves. This gives us direct control over their working conditions, so we can ensure that they are treated with dignity and respect and experience fair and sustainable working conditions. We work closely and carefully with the labor brokers that source our manufacturing employees in Malaysia (the only location where we source employees from outside the country) and we prohibit labor brokers and their agents from collecting recruitment fees from prospective employees. We regularly audit the brokers\u2019 practices and only collaborate with brokers who strictly uphold our full commitment to fair labor practices. If we become aware of a labor broker who does not meet our high standards, we terminate the relationship with that broker.\n\nCritical Minerals and Metals\n\nWhy it Matters\n\nWestern Digital relies on a variety of raw and subsidiary materials\u2014including 3TG or \u201cconflict minerals\u201d\u2014as key inputs to our finished products. We indirectly source 3TG from mines, smelters or refiners and, in most cases, are several steps removed from these market participants in the supply chain, making transparency a challenge. Long before the adoption of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) Conflict Minerals Rule, we began working with our suppliers to verify responsible sourcing of 3TG.\n\nManagement Approach\n\nGRI 103-2\n\nWestern Digital maintains a cross-functional team of senior staff for our Responsible Minerals Steering Committee, which oversees our Responsible Minerals Program. Our Senior Vice President of Procurement and Supply Chain leads this program, comprised of representatives from Legal, Procurement and Quality Management. The team reports to senior leadership on a regular basis and reports the findings of our compliance efforts to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\nWe are committed to supporting responsible sourcing of conflict minerals and their derivatives, cobalt and other minerals from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) region and other Conflict Affected and High-Risk Areas (CAHRAs). Our outlines responsible sourcing practices, which are reviewed regularly. As part of our ongoing commitment to transparency, we added cobalt to our policy and program and we continually endeavor to practice responsible sourcing from the DRC region and other CAHRAs. This policy, updated in March 2021, demonstrates Western Digital\u2019s expectations of our suppliers:\n\n- Responsibly source all minerals, including cobalt, from the DRC region and other CAHRAs.\n- Require their own suppliers to adopt similar policies.\n\nINDUSTRY PARTNERSHIPS\n\nWestern Digital actively participates in the RBA\u2019s Responsible Mineral Initiative (RMI), allowing us to use best practices in responsible minerals sourcing:\n\n- Collaborate with customers, suppliers and industry working groups on a regular basis, including the Due Diligence Practices Team, Smelter Engagement Team, Responsible Minerals Initiative Plenary Call and RMI Material Insight User Group, a platform to study and research prioritizing minerals in supply chain.\n- Gain access to relevant data and tools, including the Country Risk Map, Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry (RCOI) data, smelter database and risk readiness assessment.\n- Conduct ongoing due diligence and stay up-to-date on smelter status changes, industry trends and key insights.\n- Use RMI\u2019s e-Learning academy to provide training internally to employees and externally to suppliers.\n\nRESPONSIBLE MINERALS RISK MITIGATION PROGRAM\n\nSASB TC-HW-440a.1, TC-SC-440a.1\n\nWestern Digital\u2019s Responsible Minerals Risk Mitigation Program involves a five-step due diligence process aligned with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidance.\nIdentify Risks\nTo identify risks in our supply chain, we use three main resources from the RMI:\n\n1. Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT): Facilitates the transfer of information through the supply chain regarding mineral country of origin and smelters and refiners used; we require all in-scope suppliers to complete and submit the CMRT.\n\n2. Cobalt Report Template (CRT): Facilitates the transfer of information through the supply chain regarding cobalt country origin and smelters and refiners used; we require all in-scope suppliers to complete and submit the CRT.\n\n3. Country Risk Map Tool: Provides a framework and guidance to monitor high-risk suppliers and smelters and allows our program manager to develop a country risk indicator to monitor risk levels by country with an 80% and above confidence level.\n\nConduct Supplier Risk Assessments\nWe conduct risk assessments based on multiple factors, including smelter or refiner certification status, \u201cred flags\u201d identified and the supplier relationship. Western Digital escalates suppliers in higher-risk categories in accordance with our risk mitigation procedures. We use a formal tracking mechanism to track the supplier risk assessment and the risk mitigation activities performed.\nEXECUTE RISK MITIGATION ACTIVITIES\nWe execute appropriate risk mitigation actions to build awareness and capacity to reach our goal of conflict-free sourcing. The table below outlines different actions in order of severity.\n\n| RISK MITIGATION REFERENCE | REQUEST OR INQUIRY CONDITION | INTENDED EFFECT |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------|\n| 1.                        | Inquiry related to Critical Minerals | To align Western Digital\u2019s Responsible Minerals Policy and expectations |\n| 2.                        | Follow up + adding in subsidiary procurement/commodity manager | To support the urgency of the request |\n| 3.                        | Escalate to higher management (suppliers and internal) | To support the urgency of the request |\n| 4.                        | Formal complaint | To demonstrate Western Digital\u2019s commitment to adhering to the responsible minerals initiative |\n| 5.                        | Temporary reduction or suspension of trade | To encourage suppliers to source responsibly and mitigate high risk identified within supply chain |\n\nBelow is a summary of our conflict minerals risks in 2020\n\n| HIGH RISK (SMELTER STATUS \u2013 CONFORMANT) | LOW RISK (SMELTER STATUS \u2013 CONFORMANT) | RISK SHIFT | TOTAL SMELTER |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------|---------------|\n| 25 conformant smelters                  | 216 conformant smelters                | 1 smelter  | 241           |\n\n1 Possible Country of Origin from High Risk, Covered Country and / or DRC\n2 Smelter Status Change other than conformant\n\nFor more detailed information on our Responsible Minerals Program measures, including commitments and steps taken to mitigate the risk that the 3TG in our products does not benefit armed groups, please see our 2021 SEC-filed Conflict Minerals Report.\n\nAwards And Recognition\nGRI 103-3\nIn the Responsible Sourcing Network\u2019s (RSN) most recent Mining the Disclosure Report (2019), Western Digital ranked first in the HDD manufacturing industry and fourth in the overall computer hardware industry for the third consecutive year. Our overall performance again scored within the \u201cGood (60+)\u201d threshold when compared to all industries. We use this ranking as an indicator for us to maintain and improve our performance year-over-year. For more information on the RSN, please visit their website. As a supplier ourselves, Western Digital is subject to similar performance assessments from our customers. Multiple customers have consistently acknowledged our excellent performance, citing numerous key indicators such as energy efficiency, emissions reduction, conflict-free smelters, voluntary sustainability reporting and RBA audit compliance.\n\nSMELTER STATUS BY METALS\n\nWestern Digital Update as of February 2021\n\n| SN | 100% |\n| TA | 100% |\n| W  | 100% |\n| AU | 97%  |\n\nIndustry update as of February 2021\n\n| SN | 82% |\n| TA | 97% |\n| W  | 92% |\n| AU | 65% |\n\n1 This chart compares the conformance status of the smelters in Western Digital\u2019s supply chain to the broader industry smelter conformance status by metal type.\nIn 2020, we audited 100% of our in-scope suppliers for conflict minerals. We identified 4% of those suppliers using smelters of concern. By the end of 2020, 96% of the in-scope suppliers successfully reported sourcing from conformant smelters. The remaining 4% reported the active smelter. Additionally, we directly or indirectly engaged with 48 smelters out of 241 total in our supply chain to participate in a Responsible Mineral Assurance Process (RMAP) Program.\n\n### Responsible Sourcing Score Overview\n\n| Commodity          | Responsible Sourcing Score | Meeting Expectation |\n|--------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|\n| Electronics        | 4.3                       | 4.5                 |\n| Head and Media Component | 4.2                     |                     |\n\n### Key Metrics\n\n**GRI 414-2**\n\nIn 2020, we audited 100% of our in-scope suppliers for conflict minerals.

Additionally, we directly or indirectly engaged with 48 smelters out of 241 total in our supply chain to participate in a Responsible Mineral Assurance Process (RMAP) Program.\n\n### Supply Chain Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)\n\nStarting in 2020, we engaged with our supply partners to have them participate in reporting CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) data. They were encouraged to disclose environmental impact information through CDP\u2019s Climate Change and Water Security questionnaires. These disclosures enable our supply partners to measure and understand their environmental impact and take actions to improve performance and build a more sustainable economy. We initially invited 150 in-scope suppliers to provide responses to both questionnaires, of which 95% and 86% participated for climate and water, respectively. We further expanded the number of in-scope suppliers in 2021.\n\nIn April 2021, we provided CDP refresher training for suppliers who reported to CDP and introduction training for first-time reporting suppliers. 111 participants from 66 suppliers attended these trainings. We also held trainings specific to Western Digital\u2019s Science-Based Targets in June 2021 to help our supply partners to set their own emission reduction targets. 74 participants from 52 suppliers attended. Recordings of both training sessions mentioned above were made available to supply partners who could not attend the trainings.\n\n### SASB Codes: TC-HW-430A.1, TC-HW-430A.2\n\n| SUPPLIERS ASSESSED USING RBA VALIDATED ASSESSMENT PROGRAM | FY2019 | FY2020 | FY2021 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Percentage of all Tier 1 supplier facilities audited in the RBA Validated Assessment Program or equivalent | 96%    | 58%    | 62%    |\n| Percentage of all Tier 1 supplier facilities audited in the RBA Validated Assessment Program or equivalent | 0%     | 0%     | 0%     |\n| Tier 1 suppliers\u2019 non-conformance rate with the RBA Validated Assessment Program or equivalent | 6%     | 9%     | 8%     |\n| Tier 1 suppliers\u2019 associated corrective action rate for priority non-conformances | 100%   | 91%    | 93%    |\n| Tier 1 suppliers\u2019 associated corrective action rate for other non-conformances | 93%    | 76%    | 84%    |\n\n1 Total supplier facilities for FY2019 encompass 80% of direct material spend.

To position our business for future success, we are working to build more sustainable, resilient supply chains by implementing analytics-driven procurement processes and widening our supply base by qualifying additional suppliers. By taking these steps now, we are working to protect our business from supply chain disruptions and creating more widespread business opportunities.\n\nAnalytics Driven Predictive Procurement Process\nIn FY2021, we redesigned our supply chain approach and process to improve resiliency and balance the focus on social, economic and environmental factors within Western Digital\u2019s supply base. Our supply chain is large and complex. We rely on hundreds of direct (and thousands of indirect) suppliers to create our products.\n\nWe developed and deployed unique and exclusive advanced predictive capabilities that enable us to predict and detect probable risk and disruptions. Armed with data about suppliers\u2019 and their suppliers\u2019 locations, past performance and potential risk factors, we were able to use artificial intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing capabilities to predict COVID-19 peaks, monitor and consider alternate suppliers, detect potential disruptions and mitigate risks.\n\nRESULTS DELIVERED\n\nPredictive Risk Management\n\nPredictive PO Capability is live in the risk management system, beta testing in progress\n\nTime to react and respond to supply chain disruptions reduced from 10 days to 1-2 days on average\n\nPREDICTIVE PEAK\n\nIn response to COVID-19 we accelerated the development of the predictive risk model to create predictive peak which was utilized to:\n\n- Predict lockdowns and divert PO\u2019s\n- Accelerate qualifications in cases where we had single source suppliers\n\nThe model predicted within a few days:\n\n- The lockdown of Jakarta\n- Lockdown of Kyoto and Aichi in Japan\n\nPROBLEMS ADDRESSED\n\n- Limited supply chain visibility and resiliency\n- Delayed disruption reaction time\n- Inefficient allocation of inventory\n- Constrained manufacturing agility\n- Inefficient production schedules\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nWhy it Matters\n\nAt Western Digital, we believe that our employees, more than bits and drives, are absolutely our most valuable resource. It\u2019s the people of Western Digital\u2014and their myriad of talent and experiences\u2014that give us our competitive edge.\n\nAs we say in our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) Statement, we\u2019re convinced that the fusion of various ideas results in greater innovation and better business outcomes. We know we\u2019re at our absolute best when we leverage the diversity of our more than 65,000 employees in 30 countries around the world. So, from our factories in Thailand, to our R&D centers in Israel and our engineering sites in Silicon Valley, we are committed to an inclusive environment where every individual can thrive.\n\nManagement Approach\n\nWestern Digital\u2019s Chief People Officer is responsible for the execution of our global diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and commitments. She partners closely with our CEO and executive leadership team and reports progress to the Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors has achieved gender parity, with five out of 10 women Directors as of FY2021, and diversity and inclusion has become a priority focus area.\n\nAt Western Digital, we apply our efforts globally. The Diversity, Equity and Inclusion team communicates our initiatives to representatives at our international sites and receives updates on regional progress. Additionally, each country-specific employee handbook discusses how Western Digital is working to promote workforce diversity. See our key highlights from 2020-2021:\n\n- Completed unconscious bias and anti-discrimination training for all of our United States people managers and all United States non-factory employees (Feb-June 2021).\n- Enabled our Business Resource Groups (BRGs) to increase their business impact and developed a best practices toolkit.\n- Developed a University Ambassador Program to cultivate a more diverse talent pipeline.\n- Provided training in Inclusive Interviewing and Best Practices in Inclusive recruitment.\n- Selected a diversity-focused platform to expand our sourcing channels.\n- Expanded our Advancing Women in Leadership program, graduating 64 women from 14 countries.\n- Expanded our annual pay equity analysis beyond the United States to include five countries and cover approximately 75% of our total global employee population.\n\nThese beliefs are anchored in our core value: \u201cWe All Belong\u201d. This year, our Executive Leadership Team affirmed this core value as an enterprise-wide strategic imperative.\n\nTo be sure, we\u2019re not there yet. We have more work to do, for example, to promote women into coveted tech and leadership roles. We also have a lot more work to do in recruiting Black and Hispanic/LatinX people to the company, but we\u2019re hard at work taking the steps necessary to make progress.\n\nWe know becoming a sufficiently diverse and inclusive company is a journey and we\u2019re determined to develop a culture in which underrepresented groups, and all the employees of Western Digital, feel they truly belong.\n\nMANAGING BIAS LEARNING\n\nOur organization is committed to unconscious bias training to build an inclusive culture that supports diversity. In 2021 we successfully delivered unconscious bias training to more than 1,500 of our people managers in the United States, equipping them to lead inclusively and building their ability to identify unconscious bias. In addition, we trained 99% of our United States employees in unconscious bias and anti-discrimination. This training is now required of all new hires in the United States.\nBUSINESS RESOURCE GROUPS\nWe expanded Western Digital\u2019s employee-based resource groups internationally, with 15 global chapters at sites in India, China, Israel, Thailand, Malaysia, Japan and the Philippines.\n\nOur BRGs not only serve as a platform for employees to build relationships and foster a sense of belonging, they also actively focus on ways to support our business \u2013 from recruiting talent, driving awareness, mentoring under-represented youth in our communities, delivering innovative product suggestions. All Western Digital BRGs are open to any employee interested in joining. This year, Global Giving and Doing provided corporate grants to organizations selected by our BRGs to support equality in their communities of interest.\n\nWOMEN\u2019S DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS\nWestern Digital is committed to increasing the number of women in technical fields and leadership positions at our organization. We plan to accomplish this by developing from within, as well as recruiting externally to hire more women to leadership roles. In 2021, we expanded our strategic partnerships to include: Ascend, AnitaB.org, The Clayman Institute for Gender strategic partnerships to include Fairygodboss, into leadership roles. In 2021, we expanded our well as recruiting externally to hire more women to accomplish this by developing from within, as leadership positions at our organization. We plan the number of women in technical fields and Western Digital is committed to increasing WOMEN\u2019S DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS communities of interest.\n\nselected by our BRGs to support equality in their provided corporate grants to organizations in joining. This year, Global Giving and Doing innovative product suggestions. All Western Digital BRGs are open to any employee interested in joining. This year, Global Giving and Doing provided corporate grants to organizations selected by our BRGs to support equality in their communities of interest.\n\nAdditionally, each participant\u2019s leader participates in the program to demonstrate their personal engagement in and accountability for each woman\u2019s career development. Western Digital offers our women employees several development opportunities through organizations such as our Women\u2019s Impact Network, Women in IT and Women in Head, Analysis and Media Operations. These employee-led organizations highlight challenges for women and advocate for women\u2019s advancement and professional development by offering internal and external conference opportunities for learning, networking, coaching and internal leadership experiences. Our Women\u2019s Impact Network brought #IAmRemarkable to Western Digital. This program empowers women to bring their unique perspectives into decision-making. And the voices of women of color were highlighted through an internal blog series called #ShareTheMicNow, which had each of our executive leaders use their blog to share the career journey of a Black or Hispanic woman at the company.\n\nGROWING OUR DIVERSE TALENT PIPELINE\nWe actively work to increase the diversity of our talent pool, from interns to executive leadership roles. The Diversity, Equity and Inclusion organization partners with our Talent Acquisition (TA) team, Human Resources Business Partners (HRBP) and other centers of excellence on approaches to growing a more diverse candidate pipeline and recruiting the best and brightest globally. The DE&I team has also expanded our strategic partnerships to include: Ascend, DisabilityIN, Fairygodboss, National Center for Women & Information Technology, Jopwell, DisabilityIN, Fairygodboss, National Center for Women & Information Technology, Jopwell, Work for Warriors, National Society of Black Engineers, National Black MBA Association SF Chapter, Out & Equal and the Society of Hispanic Engineers.\n\nIn December 2020, Western Digital identified two vendors to enhance learning and education for our Talent Acquisition (TA) team, HRBPs and Hiring Managers. In FY2022, Heidrick & Struggles will provide Inclusive Recruitment Training to our TA team and HRBPs to identify and implement best practices for inclusive recruitment. Ken Blanchard Companies will provide best practices on inclusive interviewing for a pilot group of hiring managers, with plans to expand after the pilot and process flows have been determined. Both of these sessions are illustrative of our intent to embed diversity best practices throughout the enterprise. In FY2022, we are also looking to expand our employee referral program with a heightened focus on diversity-focused talent.\n\nIMPLEMENTING OUR ANTI-HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION POLICY\nWestern Digital\u2019s Global Anti-Harassment and Anti-Discrimination Policy explicitly prohibits harassment in the workplace from any employee, customer, vendor, supplier, business partner or third party. The policy provides numerous avenues to report instances of harassment and discrimination and allow for appropriate action to be taken. Relevant Western Digital employees are required to participate in online harassment and discrimination training to support the policy.\n\nAwards and Recognition\nGRI 103-3\nWomen\u2019s Choice Award for Best Company for Millennials and Best Company for Diversity\nThe Women\u2019s Choice Award recognized Western Digital as a Best Company for Millennials in 2019, 2020, and again in 2021 and a Best Company for Diversity in 2021. Our focus on investing and helping millennials and women grow professionally to advance their career while also catering to their lifestyle led to these awards. Women\u2019s Choice Award recognizes companies based on a gathering of external data from the general population, analyzing over 300,000 sources of data\u2014including Fortune 300 Companies, Survey Monkey, Working Mothers Best Place to Work reports, Glassdoor, annual reports and press releases.\n### GENDER REPRESENTATION OF GLOBAL EMPLOYEES\n\n|        | FY2019 | FY2020 | FY2021 |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n|        | FEMALE | MALE   | OTHER  |\n|        |        |        |        |\n| Management | 26.1%  | 73.8%  | 0.0%   |\n| Technical staff | 20.2%  | 79.8%  | 0.0%   |\n| All other employees | 67.3%  | 32.7%  | 0.0%   |\n| Factory employees | 69.0%  | 31.0%  | 0.0%   |\n| Non-factory employees | 50.4%  | 49.5%  | 0.1%   |\n\n### AGE REPRESENTATION OF GLOBAL EMPLOYEES\n\n|        | FY2019 | FY2020 | FY2021 |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n|        | UNDER 30 | 30-50 | 50+    |\n|        |        |        |        |\n| Management | 1.1%  | 70.4%  | 28.5%  |\n| Technical staff | 18.3%  | 63.3%  | 18.4%  |\n| All other employees | 33.1%  | 61.7%  | 5.2%   |\n| Factory employees | 35.0%  | 61.5%  | 3.5%   |\n| Non-factory employees | 14.7%  | 63.9%  | 21.5%  |\n\n1 Data is based on the headcount at the end of the indicated fiscal year.

Additionally, our partnerships around the globe continue to be a key strategic initiative for future talent pools, including growing our diverse candidate pipeline. See the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion section of this report for more information.\n\n### Turnover rates\n\nTurnover rates indicate the health of our workforce culture, and we monitor these metrics carefully in support of our business strategy and execution. We are proud that our worldwide voluntary turnover rate in FY2021 was 9.7%, which was below the industry average of 13.8%.\n\n### Engagement\n\nIn FY2021, we implemented a continuous employee listening platform to collect feedback to better understand and improve the employee experience and identify opportunities to strengthen employee engagement. Our inaugural survey had a 92% employee participation rate and identified key strengths including that employees felt that their work was meaningful, that they felt a sense of belonging at the company and that they were excited about our future.\n\nTo promote our culture journey and our 11 global culture attributes, we designated approximately 100 culture advocates representing our employees around the world and 20 culture champions selected by members of our executive leadership team to represent our culture attributes at the leadership level. With the support of our culture advocates and champions, our business leaders and employees have been embracing the attributes and bringing them to life.\n\n- Paid time off\n- Maternity, paternity and/or parental leave\n- Retirement provision\n- Stock ownership\n- Tuition reimbursement\n- Employee Assistance Program\n\n### To retain top talent\n\nWestern Digital offers eligible employees a competitive and comprehensive compensation package. In each country, Western Digital offers competitive benefits, which typically include the following:\n\n- Life insurance\n- Health care\n- Disability and invalidity coverage\nFollowing our work in 2020 in activating our newly launched culture attributes, we launched our inaugural pulse engagement survey in early 2021 across Western Digital. We asked a series of 20 questions, ranging from topics on collaboration, feedback, empowerment, employee satisfaction and culture, to establish an internal baseline on employee sentiment. Within our professional/technical employees we had a response rate of 84%, establishing a baseline engagement score of 74. We saw even greater participation within our factories, reaching a fantastic 95% response rate and establishing a baseline engagement score of 79. In both instances we met and/or exceeded external industry benchmarks.\n\nLeaders are currently focused on at least one opportunity that can positively impact their engagement results. The second Pulse survey was launched in the fall of 2021 and will be used to measure progress and provide accountability.\nLearning and Development\n\nGRI 404-2\n\nWe are on a multi-year journey to deliver a world-class experience for our employees here at Western Digital. By helping employees realize great moments in their careers, we make our company an exceptional place to work. We have built great momentum over the last two years through the One Western Digital Culture Journey, the Leader Essentials Program, an integrated learning platform, the new Career Development approach and suite of tools and the Pulse Engagement Survey. We are committed to continuously gathering insights directly from our employees and leveraging those insights to evolve our people strategy and investments in development.\n\nGRI 404-3\n\nAll manufacturing employees receive performance assessments based on specific manufacturing tasks. The remainder of the organization, comprising the technical and professional employee population, receives quarterly check-in meetings and annual reviews.\n\nGRI 401-1\n\n| EMPLOYEE ATTRACTION, RETENTION AND ENGAGEMENT | FY2019 | FY2020 | FY2021 |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| **EMPLOYEE HIRES**                            |        |        |        |\n| #                                             | RATE1  | #      | RATE1  |\n| Hires by age group                            |        |        |        |\n| \u2022 Under 30                                    | 5,950  | 27.5%  | 10,160 | 55.3%  |\n| \u2022 30\u201350                                       | 2,516  | 6.3%   | 3,889  | 9.8%   |\n| \u2022 50+                                         | 297    | 5.2%   | 300    | 5.2%   |\n| Hires by gender                               | 4,298  | 15.5%  | 4,833  | 17.9%  |\n| \u2022 Male                                        | 4,465  | 11.2%  | 9,510  | 26.0%  |\n| \u2022 Female                                      | 213    | 17.0%  | 232    | 18.1%  |\n| Hires by region                               | 1,043  | 12.5%  | 1,125  | 14.0%  |\n| \u2022 United States                               | 7,507  | 13.0%  | 12,992 | 23.9%  |\n| \u2022 Asia                                        | 213    | 17.0%  | 232    | 18.1%  |\n| Total Employee Hires                          | 8,763  | 13.0%  | 14,349 | 22.5%  |\n\n1 Hire rate is calculated as the total number of hires divided by the average headcount over the time period.

Through Western Digital\u2019s You Matter program, we invest in the well-being of our diverse employee population. The program has 4 pillars:\n\nHealth\nFocusing on prevention and resources for managing and improving overall physical health\n\nFinancial\nSupporting employees in meeting current and future financial obligations\n\nEmotional\nOffering employee resources to be, stay and become mentally and emotionally fit\n\nLifestyle\nHelping employees create and sustain healthy habits to fuel every-day life\n\nThe program is implemented on a global scale so that initiatives can have a global reach, while also being tailored to local contexts. Activations occur through a combination of solutions, on-site services, initiatives, trainings, classes and campaign events. For example, in FY2021:\n\n\u2022 Our employees in several countries had access to an employee assistance program, which provides confidential counseling for support with a wide range of personal issues and concerns at no cost. We are expanding this program to cover all employees globally in FY2022.\n\n\u2022 All of our support, professional and management employees had access to on-demand mental health training.\n\n\u2022 Pre-COVID-19, 65% of our employees globally had access to on-site gyms. Today, we have moved to virtual classes that are available to 100% of our employees globally.\n\n\u2022 85% of our employees have access to onsite health clinics that provide primary care, immediate care and chronic disease management. Some of our clinics also include behavioral health, laboratory services, specialist services and dental services.\n\n\u2022 In September 2020, we hosted 12 webinars to bring awareness to mental health and suicide prevention. These webinars were attended by 1,000+ employees globally.\n\n\u2022 In October 2020, we launched a cancer awareness campaign that reached over 1,600 employees globally.\n\nHealth and Safety\nWhy it Matters\nGRI 103-1\nHealth and safety are foundational to Western Digital\u2019s business. We take employee, contractor and visitor health and safety seriously because we care about our people and understand how thoroughly we depend on each other. We believe that safety is everyone\u2019s business and aim to create a culture that supports best-in-class health and safety workplace standards and processes. This includes safety education, safe working conditions and employee wellness and health resources.\n\nManagement Approach\nGRI 103-2\nAll Western Digital employees are responsible for maintaining a safe and healthy work environment. We expect every manager to establish and reinforce our health and safety culture through three commitments:\n\n\u2022 Implementing and enforcing Western Digital\u2019s Environmental, Health, Safety and Security (EHS&S) Program requirements and leading by personal example.\n\n\u2022 Encouraging worker involvement in the structure and implementation of EHS&S Programs.\n\n\u2022 Communicating and assigning responsibility for EHS&S Program implementation and evaluating performance against Health and Safety expectations.\n\nPOLICIES\nWestern Digital\u2019s IMS Policy addresses Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) in support of our integrated management approach. Additionally, we require all employees to adhere to Western Digital\u2019s Global Code of Conduct, which includes the expectation to follow site safety rules, use necessary safety equipment and report actual or potential safety hazards.\n\nOCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\nGRI 403-1, TC-SC-320a.1\nOur certified OHS Management System is part of our company-wide IMS and applies to all operations, all employees and anyone acting on our behalf globally (including contractors).\n\nGRI 403-5\nEach site\u2019s OHS Management Program identifies job-specific and task-specific training to employees and meets Western Digital\u2019s objectives:\n\n\u2022 Ensuring all workers understand the hazards they may be exposed to and how to prevent harm to workers and the environment.\n\n\u2022 Ensuring on-time periodic worker training updates as required within specific programs.\n\n\u2022 Ensuring all managers and workers understand their obligations to provide a safe, healthful and compliant work environment.\n\n\u2022 Ensuring timely, appropriate responses when workers notify management about conditions that appear unsafe or hazardous.\n\nWestern Digital trains our Emergency Response Teams (ERTs) to respond to an incident such as a fire, medical crisis, earthquake and minimize its impact. ERTs assist in developing plans to organize an effective response and minimize injury and damage in the event of an incident. Western Digital\u2019s global recordable and lost time injury and illness incident rates are less than 15% of the U.S industry averages.\u00b9\n\nHEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS\nAll Western Digital factories are certified to the Occupational Health and Safety Management System. In FY2021, all manufacturing sites were included on a new multi-site ISO 45001 certificate. Eight factories have been audited to the ISO45001:2018 standard; five remaining\n\n\u00b9 According to the most recent United States Bureau of Labor Statistics data (2019) for Lost Time Incident Rate and Total Recordable Incident Rate.\nfactories will complete the transition from the OHS Assessment Series (OHSAS) 18001 standard to the ISO 45001:2018 standard during FY2022. Western Digital also conducts both internal and external audits to evaluate compliance with applicable health and safety laws, regulations and standards.\n\nAs part of our transition to ISO 45001, Western Digital formalized the processes related to consultation and participation of workers. Through our global IMS, we establish the general requirements and expectations and sites further define and implement location-appropriate methods for effective engagement with workers on health and safety matters. A common approach is to form safety committees at each worksite, comprised of cross-functional teams that meet regularly to discuss hazards observed in their work areas and implement preventative actions. Safety committee members work with health and safety personnel to keep track of injuries and illnesses, assess their root causes and recommend corrective actions to avoid future recurrences. Committee members also conduct periodic facility inspections and organize safety activities.\n\nHAZARD IDENTIFICATION, RISK AND OPPORTUNITY ASSESSMENT AND CONTROL IMPLEMENTATION\n\nGRI 403-2\n\nOur IMS involves a two-tiered approach for identifying hazards and assessing risks and opportunities. At the corporate level, we analyze performance trends to identify the top three to five focus areas globally based on risk levels, which are determined by severity, likelihood and existing control measures. We set overarching procedures we expect sites to follow using the hierarchy of controls.\n\nAt the facility level, sites reference hazards identified at the corporate level and customize their approach based on high-risk areas in the specific location. Certain sites go beyond this initial level of assessment, further assessing equipment, tools, chemicals and processes. Each hazard is scored on its level of severity, likelihood and existing control measures to calculate a composite risk rating. We prioritize risks rated high and immediately seek to mitigate them to a lower level.\n\nAll employees have a right to stop work when they believe such work could cause injury or ill health and all Western Digital manufacturing processes have a standard Emergency Power-Off (EPO) or Emergency Machine Off (EMO) switch if an employee identifies an on-site hazard that can cause imminent danger. Additionally, employees have multiple avenues through which to report work-related hazards:\n\n- Human Resources business partner\n- Manager\n- EHS representative\n- Safety Good Catch submission\n- Western Digital\u2019s Ethics Helpline\n\nOur management team also conducts worksite analysis on a regular basis by:\n\n- Conducting periodic \u201cwalk-through\u201d of assigned areas, observing worker behaviors and identifying potential unsafe conditions.\n- Conducting periodic, systematic EHS&S assessments and ensuring we correct discrepancies in a timely fashion.\n- Ensuring new processes, facilities rearrangements and equipment receive EHS&S reviews and approval prior to use.\n- Investigating accidents and \u201cnear misses,\u201d identifying and correcting root causes.\n- Including results and trends of hazard identification and risk control in the Management Review process in addition to the worksite analysis.\n\nIn FY2021, Global EHS focused on improving our health and safety culture by improving EHS knowledge and promoting increased worker participation through safety good catch reporting and ensuring all safety good catches are reviewed and addressed in a timely manner. Another significant focus was on improving root cause analysis to increase identification of undesirable outcomes and implement appropriate corrective actions and improvement plans as needed. By promoting increased worker participation in location safety good catch programs, we identified over 19,000 safety good catches \u2013 nearly three times more than the prior year.\n\nThrough these and other health and safety program improvements, we achieved a recordable injury and illness incidence rate reduction of 31% compared to the prior year.\n\nGRI 403-7\n\nWestern Digital hires contractors and third parties for specific projects or jobs requiring expertise outside our employees\u2019 skills or based on business strategy. Our OHS planning process includes evaluating and mitigating potential hazards and risks related to a specific job or project, reviewing the activity area and checking licenses of all operators. We require employees to complete rigorous driver certifications before transporting chemicals or waste.\n\nIn FY2021, all Western Digital sites were affected by the COVID-19 global pandemic. Global EHS partnered with other functions in Western Digital to review pandemic response guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC), revelation location occupational and public health agencies and other reliable sources. Western Digital crisis management teams evaluated the pandemic response situation in all our sites globally. Location and geography-specific pandemic response plans are regularly updated and continuously implemented as the pandemic knowledge and response recommendations evolve. Through the dedicated effort from all teams involved, to date there have been no identified work-related COVID-19 infections in any of our sites in the United States in FY2021.\n\nCOMMUNICATION AND TRAINING\n\n403-4\n\nWestern Digital communicates with employees on general health and safety policies, procedures and instructions through many avenues:\n\n- In-person training and web-based training\n- On-the-job training\n- Periodic communications on IMS via Western Digital\u2019s intranet\n- Promotional materials on our internal broadcast system, ConnectTV\n- Internal blogs\n- Monthly newsletters\n- Email communications\nWe also communicate with employees on the topics of emergency preparedness, injury or illness prevention, industrial hygiene, physically demanding work, wellness, machine guarding and living conditions.\n\n**Health and Wellness**\n\n**GRI 403-3, 403-6**\n\nWestern Digital prioritizes the long-term health and wellness of our employees by continuously improving the quality of our health and wellness services. Our site management, with EHS&S support, performs regular evaluations of the work environment to minimize exposures to chemical, physical, biological hazards and ergonomic stressors.\n\nWestern Digital\u2019s manufacturing and development sites in Asia have in-house medical clinics meeting licensing requirements with certified or licensed healthcare professionals where workers can obtain immediate treatment.\n\n**GRI 403-8, 403-9**\n\n| HEALTH AND SAFETY | FY2019 | FY2020 | FY2021 |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| **EMPLOYEES**     |        |        |        |\n| #/rate of employee fatalities | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| #/rate of high-consequence work-related injuries (excluding fatalities)\u2014employees | 2 | 0.0029 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 0.006 |\n| Employee Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR) | 37 | 0.05 | 49 | 0.08 | 29 | 0.04 |\n| #/rate of recordable work-related injuries (including fatalities)\u2014employees | 79 | 0.11 | 82 | 0.13 | 61 | 0.09 |\n| Employee Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) | 79 | 0.11 | 82 | 0.13 | 61 | 0.09 |\n| Main types of work-related injury\u2014employees | Slip/Trip/Fall, Struck on/by, Machine safety, Material Handling/Ergo |\n| Total number of hours worked\u2014employees | 138,407,687 | 127,453,523 | 131,495,058 |\n\n| NON-EMPLOYEE WORKERS |        |        |        |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| #/rate of non-employee worker fatalities | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| #/rate of high-consequence work-related injuries (excluding fatalities)\u2014non-employee workers | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n\n**GRI 403-8, 403-9 (Continued)**\n\n| HEALTH AND SAFETY | FY2019 | FY2020 | FY2021 |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| **EMPLOYEES**     |        |        |        |\n| #/rate of recordable work-related injuries (including fatalities)\u2014non-employee workers | 21 | N/A | 13 | N/A | 6 | N/A |\n\n**KEY METRICS**\n\n**GRI 103-3**\n\nWestern Digital actively tracks our occupational safety and health performance to evaluate the effectiveness of our management approach. We are pleased to report industry-leading safety performance.\n\n**GRI 403-8, 403-9**\n\n1 Employee LTIR and TRIR are Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standards.\n\n2 These values are restated for FY2020 due to the status change of a small number of injury cases.\nOur Approach\n\nOur Global Giving and Doing initiatives focus on four core pillars: STEM Education, Hunger Relief, Environmental Preservation and Equality. In FY2021, Western Digital provided 140 grants to nonprofits and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in support of their work in these imperative cause areas.\n\nCOVID-19 prevented employees from gathering in person for most of FY2021, but our employees were as committed as ever to giving back to our communities. 128 company-sponsored virtual volunteer events engaged employees at 28 Western Digital sites around the globe. To augment opportunities for our employees to give back while in-person volunteering was not possible, we offered a number of special matching campaigns in support of our pillars and COVID-19-related relief efforts. These campaigns resulted in a 46% increase in employee giving and a 110% increase in company matching from FY2019-FY2021.\n\nSTEM Education\n\nOur goal is to provide increased access to STEM Education to underrepresented and underprivileged youth on a global scale.\n\nScholarships\n\nSince 2019, the Western Digital Scholarship Fund has awarded more than $2.6 million in scholarships to students pursuing their educational aspirations. Our 2020-2021 program awarded scholarships to 256 future scientists, technologists, engineers and mathematicians, as well as the dependents of our talented workforce. We are proud to report these awards went to students in 10 different countries, and 56% of the scholarships were awarded to women.\n\nHunger Relief\n\nWe focus on alleviating the immediate need for food on a local level and supporting organizations that seek to eradicate hunger through strategic initiatives.\n\nOur Approach\n\nIn FY2021, our employees contributed more than 2,100 hours of volunteer time to support hunger relief, and we provided more than $295,000 in grants to our global hunger relief partners. Our annual Global Hunger Relief campaign was not deterred by COVID-19. We shifted and offered employees the opportunity to continue this tradition virtually. The result of their efforts brought our running total of meals provided to the world through our partners Rise Against Hunger and Latet to more than 9 million.\n\nEnvironmental Preservation\n\nWe support nonprofit and nongovernmental (NGO) partners with an environmental focus, including those that provide public education of local and global environmental issues and supporting relief efforts in times of natural disaster.\n\nOur Approach\n\nIn FY2021, we participated in 16 environmentally focused volunteer events. Employees spent 3,006 hours supporting environmental preservation and virtual conservation projects, earning $145,000 in volunteer grants for our global partners. A few highlights:\n\n- 22,360 trees planted.\n- Nearly 3,000 virtual research classifications provided by employees in support of conservation projects on the Zooniverse global research platform.\n- Employees from 15 countries challenged themselves to take on eco-friendly habits in the Earth Month Ecochallenge. More than 450 new habits were adopted by our colleagues who participated.\n- Nearly 150 colleagues in EMEA learned how pollinator health is a predictor of environmental, social and economic impacts for the planet in partnership with the World Bee Project.\n- 200 seed balls were handmade by colleagues at home to help reforest areas left bare by deforestation in Thailand.\nEquality\n\nWe seek to promote equality around the world through focused Giving initiatives. When all members of society are treated with dignity and respect, individuals, communities and businesses like ours are better positioned to thrive.\n\nOur Approach\n\nIn FY2021, we responded to global cries for social justice by adding a fourth pillar to Western Digital\u2019s Global Giving & Doing strategy. Focused on addressing Equality, this new pillar will support marginalized groups across the cultures and geographies that we serve.\n\nAs a United States-based company with operations throughout the world, we seek to understand local mores and values, and will put this pillar to work to address issues of inequity within local contexts. For example, during FY2021 the United States experienced a heightened focus on racial justice due to the tragic killings of George Floyd and others. However, in many regions of the world where we operate, gender equality and disability awareness\u2014not racial justice\u2014were issues that affected local communities most.\n\nDuring this inaugural year of our new pillar, we acted to advance equality in tangible ways:\n\n\u2022 We invested more than $550,500 in groups and initiatives working to promote equality globally.\n\u2022 We offered special donation matching opportunities, raising an additional $27,862 for nonprofits and NGOs addressing the issues most important to our employees.\n\u2022 We spent time listening to groups of employees around the world to determine how to best extend Western Digital\u2019s deep commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion into the philanthropic support of our communities.\n\nWe worked closely with our Business Resource Groups (BRGs) and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion team to determine ways to advance Equality within our business and in our Giving and Doing strategies.\n\nOur Culture of Ethics\n\nGRI 102-16\n\nOur Global Code of Conduct is a unifying guide anchored in Western Digital\u2019s core values. It explains our ethical and legal obligations to our colleagues, our company, business partners and our communities. A copy of the Code is available in 11 languages and is accessible to Western Digital employees, business partners and the public at large. Additionally, our Code of Business Ethics sets out a framework for ethical business conduct for our directors, officers and employees. A copy of the Code is available in 11 languages and is accessible to Western Digital employees, business partners and the public at large. Additionally, our Code of Business Ethics sets out a framework for ethical business conduct for our directors, officers and employees. Collectively, our codes, charters, policies and procedures require all of our more than 65,000 employees around the globe to safeguard our company\u2019s valuable reputation and act with ethics and integrity in business dealings.\n\nOur Chief Compliance Officer oversees the global ethics and compliance program. With a secondary reporting relationship to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, the program operates with significant independence and autonomy. The program focuses on strategic risk areas identified through periodic enterprise-wide evaluations and assessments. Our ethics and compliance team covers numerous risk areas including, among others, anti-corruption, fair competition, data privacy and global trade. We regularly conduct trainings and compliance initiatives across these risk areas.\n\nANNUAL TRAINING\n\nWestern Digital has established a unique and effective annual tradition of celebrating and promoting its focus on ethical conduct during a Compliance Awareness Month. During this time, we require professional staff and people managers to complete online training promoting multiple avenues of speaking up and our celebrated speak up culture, highlighting our strict prohibition against retaliation and broad-based compliance topics. For example, in FY2021, our online training covered confidential information, data privacy, software compliance, insider trading, antitrust and anti-corruption. We also train our factory workers each year on speaking up, accessing reporting channels and other Global Code of Conduct topics important to their jobs.\n\nONGOING TRAINING\n\nThe ethics and compliance team trains our employees throughout the year, focusing on targeted risk factors, legal and regulatory changes and requirements, business requests and/or changes in circumstances. For example, we train people managers regularly on how to promote a \u201cSpeak Up\u201d culture within their teams and other ethics-related topics relevant to their managerial responsibilities. This year\u2019s instructor-led training included sessions on business courtesies, accurate books and records,\nanti-corruption, trade compliance, conflicts of interest, antitrust, data privacy, charitable donations, proper handling of reported concerns and protecting confidential information.\n\nCERTIFICATIONS\nUnder oversight from our Chief Compliance Officer, we require several thousand specially designated employees, including all senior members of management, to complete an annual online questionnaire, certifying compliance with provisions of the Global Code of Conduct and requiring necessary disclosures.\n\nRaising Concerns\nWestern Digital values and promotes a \u201cSpeak Up\u201d culture in which any person may report potentially improper conduct without fear of retaliation. Our Ethics Helpline is available to all and is at times used by employees and external parties, including business partners, suppliers and members of our communities.\n\nWe promote the Ethics Helpline and strict prohibition against retaliation across all company locations around the world. Our Ethics Helpline is available 24 hours a day online at www.ethicshelplinewdc.com in nine languages, or by phone, in all countries of operation in over 200 languages. Anyone who suspects misconduct, has feedback, or wants to inquire about our ethics and compliance rules and expectations can raise their concern through the Helpline.\n\nA third party administers the Ethics Helpline for intake of reports, then transfers reported concerns to our Global Ethics and Compliance team. Dedicated and well-trained investigations staff work with appropriate internal (or external) resources to investigate concerns, remediate misconduct and help enhance controls to minimize risk of recurrence. The Audit Committee receives regular updates on reports of misconduct and related remediation.\n\nGLOBAL CODE OF CONDUCT TRAINING\n\n|                      | FY2019 | FY2020 | FY2021 |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Number of professional and managerial workers assigned online Global Code of Conduct training | 27,888 | 20,326 | 20,435 |\n| % of training completion by month-end deadline | 99.9% | 99.8% | 99.8% |\n| Number of employees not finished by deadline | 27 | 39 | 43 |\n| Time required to reach 100% training completion (days) | 11 days | 12 days | 4 days |\n| Number of employees receiving instructor-led training | 3,521 | 2,239 | 5,819 |\n\n1 Includes Western Digital employees and contractors.\n2 Change in assignment methodology; APAC technician population was trained by instructor-led rather than via online training.\n\nAnti-Corruption\n\nWhy it Matters\n\nGRI 103-1\nWestern Digital is committed to doing business the right way, every day. We pride ourselves on operating lawfully and expect the same of our business partners. As members of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), Western Digital complies with and expects its business partners to comply with the standards described in our Global Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct.\n\nManagement Approach\n\nGRI 103-2\nWestern Digital performs periodic compliance risk assessments, enterprise risk management reviews and where appropriate, risk-based audits of internal processes and business partners to ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations, including those on anti-corruption.\n\nWestern Digital has a comprehensive enterprise-wide anti-bribery and corruption program, including policies, procedures and internal controls. The program applies to all Western Digital employees, contractors and business partners and includes extensive broad-based anti-corruption training for employees. The training takes place at onboarding, annually and via targeted in-person trainings. Western Digital\u2019s management regularly communicates with employees on various anti-corruption tenets, laws, regulations and initiatives.\nIn addition to our Global Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct, our policies include, among others, a comprehensive Global Anti-Corruption Policy, a Charitable Donations of Company Funds and Assets Policy and a Global Business Courtesies Policy. We prominently outline our anti-corruption commitments in our Global Code of Conduct and regularly evaluate and update our program, including setting of annual goals reported to Western Digital\u2019s Board of Directors.\n\n**Management Approach**\n\n**GRI 103-2, 103-3, SASB TC-HW-230a.1**\n\nOur comprehensive approach to data management involves two business functions:\n\n1. **Data Security**: Groups that help manage data security risks in the organization include our Intellectual Property Compliance, Information Security and Physical Security teams. Our Information Security team, responsible for protecting company data, is led by our Chief Information Security Officer / Vice President, IT Infrastructure and Operations, who delivers quarterly reports to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\n\n2. **Data Privacy**: Our Privacy Steering Committee serves in an advisory capacity to our Data Privacy Program. Committee members are senior management representing a cross section of the organization, whose functions involve privacy responsibilities. We have a dedicated team of certified data privacy experts that manage privacy, including a Data Protection Officer and full-time privacy professionals.\n\nWestern Digital routinely evaluates our data privacy and security management systems, measuring and testing them on a regular basis. Data security is monitored, measured and reported to appropriate leadership. For data privacy, we report to the Audit Committee quarterly on privacy regulation updates and our program readiness. The Privacy Steering Committee also receives reports on the evolving landscape of laws, our privacy operating module, assessment data and reports and privacy program activities.\n\n**POLICIES**\n\nOur policies reflect our commitment to help ensure the privacy of our data infrastructure and customers:\n\n- **Global Confidential Information Policy**: Outlines rules for protecting sensitive information generally, including personal information.\n- **Information Technology Acceptable Use Policy**: Governs how our employees may utilize technology and devices attached to our network.\n- **Enterprise Cyber Security Policy**: Provides guidance to employees and IT personnel on protecting our infrastructure from cyber-attacks, including a comprehensive incident response plan.\n- **Privacy Statement**: Provides clear terms for how Western Digital collects, uses and protects personal information and provides customers with a mechanism to raise privacy concerns and exercise any data subject rights such as the right to access, correct or delete personal information.\n- **Global Privacy Policy**: Describes roles, requirements and best practices to employees for handling personal and sensitive information.\n\nWe design our policies to comply with privacy laws throughout the world, including requirements of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and other applicable privacy laws. These policies make clear Western Digital\u2019s commitment to collect, use and share personal information based on consent or other legitimate legal purposes. Our Privacy Statement notifies customers how we use data and we are committed to following laws that may require additional disclosures related to sharing data with third parties. Third parties that process personal information on our behalf commit to appropriate laws and standards through our contracting process.\n\nWe review our data privacy and security policies regularly. In 2021, we updated our Privacy Statement. We are committed to notifying our customers of material changes to our Privacy Statement and we did so with email notifications to our customers in 2021. Beyond the data privacy and security policies discussed above, Western Digital protects sensitive and/or personal data through additional policies and guidelines:\n\n- **Global Code of Conduct**\n- **Patch Management and Malware Prevention Policy**\n- **Privileged Account Policy**\n- **Corporate Password Policy and Guidelines**\n- **Guidelines for Handling Confidential Information**\n- **Guidelines for Handling Business Partner Information**\n- **Guidelines for Secure Document Shredding**\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT AND SYSTEM TESTING**\n\nWestern Digital conducts regular risk assessments and testing of our systems and procedures. In 2021 we are conducting a company-wide compliance risk assessment (including privacy) and a tabletop exercise to test\nthe company\u2019s response to a potential privacy incident. The goals of these activities are to identify opportunities for improving security and privacy strategy, systems and efficiency.\n\nINCIDENT MANAGEMENT\nWestern Digital\u2019s information technology and privacy teams partner to avoid and respond to incidents. With a comprehensive Incident Response Plan, we have defined roles and responsibilities for numerous possible scenarios, such as a privacy incident.
