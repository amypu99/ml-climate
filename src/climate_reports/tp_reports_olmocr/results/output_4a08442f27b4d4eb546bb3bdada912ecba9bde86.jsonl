This includes our performance on environmental, social and governance issues that are priorities to our company, employees, partners, communities and stakeholders.\n\nWe are proud to note that this report marks two decades of consistent, transparent reporting on our company\u2019s efforts to protect the environment, empower our people and get results the right way.\n\nThe issues we are addressing include some of the most complex challenges facing our sector and society. The people of Chevron approach these issues with passion and determination, believing our leadership is both a great responsibility and a profound source of pride.\n\nour workforce\n\nChevron\u2019s 43,800 employees around the world are essential to shaping the actions we take and in achieving our goals. We invest to develop their full potential by building strong leaders at every level, cultivating a culture of empowerment and inclusion, and shaping talented, global teams with the skills needed to succeed.\n\nAt the same time, we continue to focus on protecting the health and safety of our people and the communities in which we operate. The most important responsibility we have is to operate safely and reliably to ensure that everyone goes home safe every day. Sadly, in 2022 we fell short, with five contractor fatalities and 20 serious injuries. We are committed to learning from these incidents and improving our safety performance through focused work that is actively underway around the world.\n\noperating with integrity\n\nLowering the carbon intensity of our business begins with aiming to make our oil and natural gas production among the most efficient and responsibly produced in the world. We\u2019re pleased to report that since 2016 we have reduced our oil production Scope 1 and 2 carbon intensity by nearly 40% and our methane intensity by more than 50%. We\u2019re actively working to end routine flaring by 2030, and we\u2019re sharing what we\u2019ve learned with others through the Global Methane Pledge and the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative\u2019s Aiming for Zero Methane Emissions Initiative.\n\nMeeting a growing world\u2019s need for more energy \u2013 and more low-carbon options \u2013 requires advancing and scaling promising technologies. We are developing solutions for sectors with few viable alternatives for electrification, like aviation, shipping, heavy-duty transportation and manufacturing, and intend to grow lower carbon businesses in renewable fuels; carbon capture, utilization and storage; hydrogen; offsets; and other emerging technologies.\n\u201cat chevron, we approach the world\u2019s energy challenges with optimism and confidence\u201d\n\u201cwe believe affordable, reliable, ever-cleaner energy is essential to enabling human progress\u201d\n\nRenewable fuels, for example, offer the potential to reduce lifecycle emissions in heavy-duty transportation. Our 2022 acquisition of Renewable Energy Group makes us the second-largest producer of biodiesel and renewable diesel in the United States. We\u2019re advancing renewable fuels production capacity toward our target of 100,000 barrels per day by 2030.\n\nWe believe carbon capture, utilization and storage will be a critical technology in helping many industrial sectors mitigate their emissions. We are funding projects to lower the cost of carbon capture, using our own assets to test new technologies, while investing to advance large, regional storage hubs along the Texas Gulf Coast and offshore Australia to store CO\u2082 underground.\n\nprotecting the environment\n\nChevron\u2019s approach to responsible leadership extends beyond our efforts to respond to climate change and includes a variety of projects designed to protect habitats and benefit sensitive species.\n\nOur efforts include responsible water use and a focus on biodiversity, especially in ecologically sensitive areas where we operate. To minimize freshwater use in a high water stress area in Western Australia, we operate two onshore permanent seawater reverse osmosis desalination facilities. In St. Charles Parish, Louisiana, we are working with Restore the Earth Foundation to plant approximately 3.7 million trees. This nature-based solution is expected to help restore up to 18,800 acres of cypress forest and swamp habitats and benefit dependent plant and wildlife species.\n\nThese actions, among others, demonstrate our commitment to doing business the right and responsible way.\n\nleading with focus and commitment\n\nAt Chevron, we approach the world\u2019s energy challenges with optimism and confidence.\n\nHuman ingenuity and the power of innovation can solve any challenge and overcome any obstacle. We believe affordable energy to create prosperity, reliable energy for security and ever-cleaner energy to protect the environment is essential to enabling human progress.\n\nThis report details our approach to delivering on these ambitions.\n\nThank you for your engagement, trust and partnership.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael K.

Various elements of strategy are discussed at every regular Board meeting, as well as at meetings of the Board\u2019s Committees. At least one Board meeting each year is dedicated to strategy. To assess performance against the plan, the Board receives regular updates on progress and execution and provides oversight and direction throughout the year. Meetings can also include updates from external subject matter experts on a range of issues pertinent to Chevron\u2019s strategy.\n\nPresentations at Board and Committee meetings and tours of our operations facilitate ongoing Director education. Directors are encouraged and provided opportunities to talk directly to employees. Highlights in 2022 included a Board visit to operations in Israel and a key supplier in Italy and Dr. Austin\u2019s site visit to Southern California to learn about technology to detect and measure methane emissions.\n\nCommittees of the Board\n1 Audit: Debra Reed-Klages, Chair\n2 Board Nominating and Governance: Wanda M.

Hernandez received his law degree from Harvard Law School, beginning his career as an attorney before leading Inter-Con Security Systems\u2019 growth into one of the largest security system providers worldwide.\n\nTo learn more about our leadership and corporate governance, visit chevron.co/corporate-governance.\n\nlooking back on the past year as chair of the board\u2019s PPSC, what stands out for you?\n\nFrom the COVID-19 pandemic to geopolitical events, we\u2019ve overseen an evolving landscape of social, political, environmental, human rights and public policy issues. These events remind us that economies need affordable energy to create prosperity and countries need reliable energy to enable progress. Quite simply, energy security and national security are linked. Against these myriad changes, the Committee continues to reflect The Chevron Way \u2013 acting with integrity and operating with ethical standards \u2013 to assist the Board in overseeing risks to Chevron\u2019s business and activities.\n\nwhat is chevron\u2019s approach to leading in lower carbon energy?\n\nChevron\u2019s primary objective is to safely deliver higher returns, lower carbon and superior shareholder value in any business environment. We are building on our capabilities, assets and customers. Chevron has long been committed to transparency and will continue to communicate progress on our performance through publications and reports like this Corporate Sustainability Report.\n\nhow does the PPSC support board oversight of business threats and opportunities?\n\nThe PPSC assists the Board in identifying, evaluating and monitoring public policy trends and environmental issues. We review and make recommendations for Chevron\u2019s strategies related to corporate responsibility and reputation management. The work of the PPSC informs the full Board\u2019s approach to these issues. External speakers provide independent perspectives to the Board on pertinent topics during expanded annual strategy discussions. In 2022, the Board received an external briefing on macroeconomic trends and geopolitical issues affecting the global energy markets and commodity price cycles. Board members are also encouraged to visit Chevron operations around the globe to discuss matters specific to those locations. In 2022, the Board visited our operations in Israel, where we engaged with stakeholders and employees on issues relevant to Chevron\u2019s business in the Middle East. These engagements, in addition to regular reports and briefings, inform the Board\u2019s direction to management.\n\nlooking ahead, how is chevron positioned to navigate a rapidly evolving geopolitical landscape, such as the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine?\n\nThe military conflict between Russia and Ukraine created global supply and demand imbalances. Our hearts are always with the people, families and communities directly impacted by conflict. The events of the past year have defined the energy challenge: meeting the energy demands of today while building the lower carbon energy system of tomorrow. Chevron\u2019s leadership is ready to meet this challenge. The Directors\u2019 depth of expertise and broad range of experience across so many disciplines will continue to be invaluable in providing oversight and advice to address evolving business and geopolitical environments and further Chevron\u2019s efforts to safely deliver lower carbon energy to a growing world.\nfocusing on what matters\n\nengaging with stakeholders\n\nour sustainability reporting focuses on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues that matter to our business and our stakeholders\n\nThoughtful engagement on priority issues (sometimes called \u201cmaterial issues\u201d in the context of ESG reporting frameworks\u00b9) helps Chevron assess and, where necessary, refresh our ESG focus areas.\n\nshaping our reporting\n\nWe identified the content for our 2022 Corporate Sustainability Report through monitoring of issues and trends, supplemented by engagements with stakeholders throughout the year.\n\nTo gain insight into ESG issues and reporting trends, we engage with numerous third-party groups, including: the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, Business for Social Responsibility and Ipieca. We also work with Datamaran, an ESG risk identification and monitoring software company that uses artificial intelligence to identify, prioritize and monitor ESG issues. Their tool aggregates trends in ESG issues across a wide array of inputs, including: company financial filings and sustainability reports; global regulations; policy and framework proposals; Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards; and online news.\n\nChevron actively engages with investors and other stakeholders on ESG issues, including our customers for whom we participate in numerous surveys as a supplier. We engage external consultants to benchmark our prior year\u2019s reporting and participate in peer sustainability report reviews. Our ESG Rater performance is used to identify opportunities for potential disclosure enhancements. These interactions and survey results help us learn what matters to our stakeholders and refine our thinking on which topics to include in each year\u2019s report.\n\nMembers of the Enterprise Leadership Team and senior management, the Global Issues Committee and the Board\u2019s Public Policy and Sustainability Committee have opportunities to provide input for our Corporate Sustainability Report.\n\n\u00b9 For purposes of this report, the concept of \u201cmaterial issues\u201d generally refers to ESG reporting guidance such as Ipieca and SASB and does not correspond to the concept of materiality used in the securities laws and disclosures required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). With respect to the term \u201cmaterial,\u201d individual companies are best suited to determine which information is material under the long-standing U.S. Supreme Court definition of that term, and whether to disclose this information in SEC filings.\nthe table below provides select examples from 2022 of how we engaged with our key stakeholder groups and responded to important issues\n\n| stakeholders          | how did we engage?                                                                 | how did we respond?                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| employees             | \u2022 Global Office of Ombuds  \n                        \u2022 Town halls  \n                        \u2022 Employee surveys                                                                 | \u2022 Piloted an equity review committee to review employees\u2019 concerns with promotion or job selection decisions  \n                        \u2022 Expanded access to well-being resources  \n                        \u2022 Sponsored additional leadership development programs |\n| contractors           | \u2022 Maintained supplier relationship and service quality programs                   | \u2022 Advanced our deployment of Contractor Operational Excellence Management         |\n| communities           | \u2022 Local staff dedicated to community engagement  \n                        \u2022 Community advisory panels  \n                        \u2022 Employee network volunteering                                                                 | \u2022 Social impact strategy for people, environment and prosperity responsive to community engagement |\n| governments           | \u2022 Membership in industry and trade associations  \n                        \u2022 Engagement with all levels of government policymakers                                                                 | \u2022 Advocated for carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) and hydrogen policy enablement  \n                        \u2022 Advocated for sound energy market policy for stable supply and energy security |\n| customers             | \u2022 Customer councils  \n                        \u2022 Customer Connection Center  \n                        \u2022 Industry trade conferences                                                                 | \u2022 Value chain strategy responsive to supply/demand  \n                        \u2022 Signed memoranda of understanding to help build an ecosystem for lower carbon technology  \n                        \u2022 Continued to develop lower carbon value chains |\n| investors             | \u2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders  \n                        \u2022 Quarterly analyst calls  \n                        \u2022 Executive and management engagements  \n                        \u2022 Chevron Investor Day  \n                        \u2022 Director engagements                                                                 | \u2022 Issued Methane Report disclosing our ongoing work to reduce methane intensity and improve methane emissions inventories  \n                        \u2022 Held first Chevron Exchange, providing retail investors a venue to engage with management |\n| nongovernmental       | \u2022 United Nations working groups and other multistakeholder initiatives  \n                        \u2022 Think tanks and institutional organizations                                                                 | \u2022 Influenced our positions on items ranging from CCUS to carbon pricing |\n| organizations         |                                                                                   |                                                                                  |\nThrough our membership in Ipieca, we worked with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) to create a Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Roadmap for the oil and gas sector.

As a MACC Champion for the El Segundo Refinery, I lead the collaborative efforts of a cross-functional team. The team is tasked with delivering projects from ideation to execution, prioritizing projects that return the largest reduction in carbon emissions for every dollar invested.\n\nOne of our team\u2019s key successes was identified through a project lookback in 2022. We updated the crude unit\u2019s heat exchangers to improve waste heat utilization and reduce furnace firing. The project targeted furnace inlet temperature improvements with the goal of decreasing energy use and GHG emissions while improving preheat exchanger run times for long-term reliability. It was the first large-scale crude preheat deployment for our El Segundo plant. Results confirmed that there was an emissions reduction of approximately 20,000 tonnes CO\u2082 per year.\n\nI look forward to coming to work every day to advance these projects, which are reducing CO\u2082e emissions and advancing Chevron\u2019s strategy.\n\nOptimizing carbon reduction opportunities\nWe seek to optimize carbon intensity reduction opportunities for our assets and operations by leveraging our cross-functional capabilities and using the MACC process. This approach provides Chevron with a methodology to identify and prioritize a portfolio of GHG abatement opportunities across operations. Utilizing this process, we identified over 120 reduction projects for development and plan to spend more than $350 million on these projects in 2023. In 2022, we made progress on 90 projects and completed 13. We expect to spend approximately $2 billion total on similar projects through 2028.\naddressing methane emissions\n\nChevron\u2019s ambition is to be a global leader in methane emissions performance. Our goal is simple \u2013 keep methane in the pipe. We believe addressing methane emissions is a key part of being a responsible producer of oil, products and natural gas.\n\nImproving detection to prevent methane emissions\n\nSince 2016, we have conducted 13 advanced detection technologies trials. \u201cFind and fix\u201d campaigns in Argentina, the Denver-Julesburg Basin, the Gulf of Mexico, the Permian Basin and Kazakhstan provided opportunities to test different methane emissions detection and measurement options. Detection results were used to validate performance and inform repairs. In 2022, Chevron contracted with GHGSat to monitor 22 onshore assets worldwide. We believe advanced technologies can help drive overall reduction in methane intensity.\n\nReducing methane intensity\n\nTo evolve facility designs, we\u2019re reengineering process controls and systems to help remove, reduce or prevent methane venting as part of normal operations. In 2022, we committed to designing, where possible, new upstream facilities without routine methane emissions. We anticipate that our monitoring and detection program will provide additional insights to improve how our facilities are operated and maintained.\n\n2.0 kg CO\u2082e/boe\n\nTarget upstream methane intensity by 2028\n\nglobal methane pledge\n\nChevron supports the effort to reduce global human-made methane emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030.\n\nAdvancing methane measurement\n\nChevron is taking actions to improve the quality and transparency of our methane emissions disclosures. As quantitative technologies become more widely available and protocols are developed to reconcile current inventories with actual measurements, we are working to incorporate field measurement into existing emission factor based-inventories. For example, we have joined GTI Energy\u2019s Veritas, an initiative to develop measurement, reconciliation and assurance protocols, to help provide a widely accepted methodology for incorporating field-informed methane quantification into emissions inventories.\n\n64% lower methane intensity\n\nthan the U.S. upstream production sector average as of 2022 for Chevron U.S. upstream operations\n\nChevron\u2019s 2022 Methane Report discusses our strategy, goals and action plan to prevent, detect and reduce methane emissions.\nportfolio carbon intensity\n\nWe believe the most effective approach to estimating the total emissions intensity associated with the activities of companies, like Chevron and their customers, should cover the full value chain inclusive of all emission types (Scope 1, 2 and 3).\n\nFor Chevron, Scope 3 emissions result principally from customers\u2019 use of the products we sell and are the largest category of emissions associated with our activities. Chevron expresses the emissions intensity per unit of energy.\n\nOur portfolio carbon intensity (PCI) methodology facilitates calculation transparency and replicability by using information from financial statements and emissions disclosures. This approach enables validation of reporting and the comparison of carbon intensities of companies that may participate in different parts of the value chain. The PCI metric encompasses upstream and downstream businesses, as well as growth of lower carbon business lines in renewable fuels; carbon capture, utilization and storage; hydrogen; offsets; and other emerging technologies.\n\n71 g CO\u2082e/MJ\n\ntarget portfolio carbon intensity (Scope 1, 2 and 3) by 2028\n\nchevron supports\n\n- A price on carbon through well-designed policies, see page 54\n- Transparently reporting Scope 3 emissions from the end use of our products (Category 11)\n- Assisting customers to achieve their lower carbon ambitions through our renewable products and by offering offset-paired products\n\nA PCI calculator is available on our website for anyone to use and compare energy companies\u2019 carbon intensities.

We continue to build momentum by actively pursuing opportunities around the globe that we believe will position us as a future leader in this space.\n\n2030 targets\n\n| 100 mbd | renewable fuels |\n| 25 mmtpa | carbon capture and offsets |\n| 150 mtpa | hydrogen\u00b9 |\n| 40,000 mmbtu/d | renewable natural gas |\n\naccelerating actions on renewable fuels targets\n\nRenewable fuels can help reduce the lifecycle carbon intensity of transportation fuels while meeting the world\u2019s growing energy needs. Chevron intends to grow our renewable fuels production capacity to 100,000 barrels per day by 2030. Bunge Chevron Ag Renewables, a joint venture between Bunge North America, Inc. and Chevron, is expected to help develop renewable fuel feedstocks by leveraging Bunge\u2019s expertise in oilseed processing and farmer relationships and Chevron\u2019s expertise in fuels manufacturing and marketing. With the acquisition of Renewable Energy Group, Inc. (REG), in 2022, we increased renewable fuels production capacity toward our renewable fuels target. By combining REG\u2019s growing renewable fuels production and leading feedstock capabilities with Chevron\u2019s large manufacturing, distribution and commercial marketing position, we are positioned to be a leader in the renewable fuels space.\n\nWe aim to grow production of renewable natural gas (RNG) to 40,000 mmbtu/d by 2030. In 2022, Chevron and California Bioenergy LLC announced a joint investment in their second holding company to produce and market dairy biomethane as an RNG transportation fuel in California. Chevron also has a joint venture with Brightmark LLC to construct dairy biomethane projects to produce RNG in multiple states. With our acquisition of Beyond6 in 2022 and its network of compressed natural gas (CNG) stations across the United States, we can market the RNG we produce or procure through a nationwide network of CNG locations.\n\nhydrogen solutions for hard-to-abate sectors\n\nChevron continually evaluates opportunities to grow our hydrogen business line. We believe we are well positioned to participate across the value chain to supply industrial, power and heavy-duty transportation customers.\n\nLeveraging existing strategic partnerships and building new ones will be the foundation to meet hydrogen demand growth. An example is our ongoing collaboration with long-standing liquefied natural gas (LNG) partner JERA. We are working together to identify lower carbon solutions such as carbon capture and sequestration, liquid organic hydrogen carriers, and the production of lower carbon fuels.\n\nIn 2022, our technology ventures group announced an investment in Aurora Hydrogen. Aurora is developing a hydrogen production technology that uses microwave energy without generating any CO\u2082 emissions or consuming water. Hydrogen production using Aurora\u2019s technology has the potential to reduce global CO\u2082 emissions.\n\nhydrogen from green waste\n\nChevron is collaborating to develop a waste-to-hydrogen production facility in Richmond, California. The facility is expected to use up to 99 wet tons of green and food waste per day and produce up to 2,400 tonnes of hydrogen per year. The hydrogen is intended to supply transportation fuel markets in Northern California.\n\n\u00b9 Chevron\u2019s approach to hydrogen envisions the use of green, blue and gray hydrogen.\nCCUS as a lower carbon business\n\nWe\u2019re building on decades of experience handling CO\u2082 to become a full-service carbon capture solution provider, enabled by foundational projects and working with partners across the value chain. CCUS is the process of capturing CO\u2082 emissions to use as a feedstock (utilization) or permanently store in geological formations deep underground (storage). We see CCUS opportunities in two areas: reducing the carbon intensity of our existing assets and building a carbon capture business, primarily through hubs with third-party emitters as partners and customers.\n\nWe plan to reduce the carbon intensity of our central California operations by installing post-combustion carbon capture equipment to capture CO\u2082 and store it thousands of feet underground. This potential CCS project will begin at Chevron\u2019s Kern River Eastridge cogeneration plant in Kern County, California.\n\nIn 2022, Chevron entered into the Bayou Bend joint venture with Talos Energy and Carbonvert. Bayou Bend is a CCS project along the Texas Gulf Coast. In early 2023, the project was expanded to cover nearly 140,000 acres of geological formation both onshore and offshore, which could provide storage for over 1 billion tonnes of CO\u2082. The expansion helps position Bayou Bend to be a CO\u2082 transportation and storage provider for industrial emitters in and around the Houston Ship Channel and the Beaumont/Port Arthur area.\n\ncarbon capture to storage\n\nImplementing CCS at scale\n\nIn Australia, we operate Gorgon, one of the world\u2019s largest integrated CCS projects. Since the system started up in mid-2019, almost 7 million tonnes of CO\u2082 emissions have been injected as of 2022. We expect to capture and store more than 100 million tonnes of CO\u2082 over the life of the project.\n\nIn Canada, we have a 20% nonoperated working interest in the Quest CCS project, the world\u2019s first commercial-scale CCS project to tackle carbon emissions in the Canadian oil sands. The Quest project safely captures and stores 1 million tonnes of CO\u2082 per year, sequestering approximately 7 million tonnes of CO\u2082 as of 2021.\n\nCommercializing investments in technology\n\nChevron has invested in multiple carbon capture technologies, including startup companies Svante and Carbon Clean, to help drive down costs and develop these technologies at scale.\n\nIn collaboration with Svante and the U.S. Department of Energy National Energy and Technology Laboratory,\u00b2 we are piloting technology that captures CO\u2082 from our Kern River facility in San Joaquin Valley, California.\n\nThe carbon capture trial at our McKittrick facility, also in California, combines two technologies, Caterpillar\u2019s CarbonPoint Solutions\u2019 semi-closed cycle CO\u2082 concentration technology and Carbon Clean\u2019s fully modular CycloneCC technology. Other examples include:\n\n\u2022 In 2022, we signed a joint agreement with Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Ltd. to study the feasibility of transporting liquefied CO\u2082 from Singapore to permanent storage locations offshore Australia.\n\n\u2022 A consortium of Chevron, Air Liquide, Keppel Infrastructure and PetroChina International intends to evaluate and advance the development of large-scale CCUS solutions and integrated infrastructure in Singapore.\n\n\u2022 Chevron Australia participates in joint ventures that have been granted an interest in three offshore GHG assessment permits. These new permits have the potential to expand Chevron\u2019s portfolio of CCS assets in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n\u00b2 Under award number DE-FE00031944.\ngenerating offsets and achieving lower carbon ambitions\n\nChevron believes offsets, along with other lower carbon solutions, will be needed to achieve global net zero. Offsets can be generated through avoidance, reduction and removal activities. We believe that high-integrity carbon offsets can help companies, like Chevron, and our customers achieve their respective lower carbon ambitions. Chevron believes a large, transparent, verifiable and robust voluntary carbon market is key to the integrity of offsets. As global demand grows, we expect to be a supplier of offsets and provide customers with offset-paired products. For example, in 2022, we safely delivered our first cargo of offset-paired LNG.\n\nWe\u2019re also planning to invest directly in scalable, nature-based solutions. In St. Charles Parish, Louisiana, we are working with Restore the Earth Foundation to plant approximately 3.7 million trees, primarily bald cypress. Almost half a million trees have been planted for this carbon offset project, with more planting underway. This nature-based solution is expected to help restore up to 18,800 acres of cypress forest and swamp habitats and benefit dependent plant and wildlife species.\n\nemerging technologies\n\nChevron has a long history of fostering innovation through research and development, innovation ecosystems and university partnerships. We are currently exploring opportunities to commercialize and scale the next generation of emerging technologies to grow our offering of lower carbon solutions.\n\nIn 2022, Chevron and Baseload Capital announced a joint venture to develop geothermal projects in the United States. Leveraging our combined experience and technical strengths, we aim to advance scalable, novel geothermal technologies and tap into the Earth\u2019s core heat, an important renewable power source. Traditional oil and gas sector competencies, including subsurface, wells, drilling and completions, are especially relevant in this effort. The first project is in Weepah Hills, Nevada, where previous geothermal research and advanced exploration data already exist. With the potential to provide reliable, baseload power, we believe geothermal energy will be a contributing element in the energy system of the future.\n\nin a growing world faced with complex energy challenges, innovative solutions are required to advance a lower carbon future\n\nTechnology and innovation\n\nChevron Technology Ventures (CTV) identifies, invests in and integrates externally developed technologies and new business solutions. CTV targets innovation and transformational technology in areas like CCUS, hydrogen and emerging power, among others. For example, Chevron Studio is a collaboration between CTV and the U.S. Department of Energy National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Launched in 2022, the $10 million program links entrepreneurs with national labs and universities to scale up and commercialize innovative, early-stage technologies that have the potential to enable a lower carbon future.\n\nTo learn more, visit chevron.co/growingnewenergies.\nfueling a lower carbon future, today\n\nAs one of the first companies to build commercial-scale biodiesel plants in the United States, Renewable Energy Group, Inc. (REG) has been at the forefront of the evolving biofuels industry. Established in Iowa in 1996, REG was acquired by Chevron in 2022. The new organization, Chevron Renewable Energy Group (CREG), based in Ames, Iowa, will help us achieve our renewable fuels production capacity target of 100,000 barrels per day by 2030.\n\nBalancing economic prosperity, energy security and environmental protection is important to us. We expect CREG to position us to create an ever-stronger renewable fuels business that meets evolving customer needs.\n\nCREG aims to leverage our feedstock aggregation capabilities and operational technology to help provide lower carbon solutions for hard-to-abate sectors, such as rail, marine and heavy-duty transportation. In pursuit of innovative and sustainable solutions, we have established vertical integration opportunities with regional partners.\n\nflexible feedstock\n\nIn 2022, 69% of our feedstock was from waste and residual streams and 31% was from vegetable oils.\n\ncommunity\n\nWe were awarded the 2022 Volunteer Business of the Year by the Ames Foundation for our work planting nearly 400 trees over the past two years.\n\nrenewable diesel\n\nRenewable diesel meets the same standard as petroleum diesel (ASTM D975) but with lower lifecycle carbon emissions and lower exhaust emissions.\nmanaging renewable feedstocks\n\nThe primary inputs for producing biodiesel and renewable diesel are fats, oils and greases. We utilize a flexible sourcing strategy to manufacture products with lower lifecycle carbon emissions.\n\nOne of our priorities is supply chain compliance, which helps promote integrity in the business. We screen potential feedstock partners, assessing factors such as environmental and human rights impacts, and expect suppliers to adhere to our Vendor Code of Conduct. We work to ensure that all feedstocks can be traced to the point of origin or aggregation. Independent third-party verification bodies validate our internal control processes for sustainability program compliance.\n\nOur investment in CoverCress, Inc. (CCI) is an example of our pursuit of innovative feedstock solutions. CCI is developing CoverCress\u2122, a winter oilseed cash crop that could be grown like a cover crop during the off-season. Besides having the potential to augment our supply of lower carbon feedstock, CoverCress offers the typical benefits of a cover crop, like mitigating soil erosion, improving soil health, and reducing water and nutrient movement.\n\nexpanding production\n\nIn 2022, our Emden, Germany, biorefinery broke ground on a pretreatment system that will allow us to refine a broader variety of lower carbon intensity feedstocks to produce biodiesel. In addition, the improvement and expansion project at our Geismar, Louisiana, renewable diesel facility continues. Started in 2021, the expansion is intended to raise the biorefinery\u2019s annual capacity from 95 million gallons to approximately 348 million gallons.\n\nsupplying the rail sector\n\nCREG is working to help rail companies meet their lower carbon ambitions. Union Pacific continues to test the performance of our 80% renewable diesel, 20% biodiesel blend. They also use 100% bio-based diesel in locomotives at the Colton, California, rail yard. In 2022, the Canadian National Railway Company commenced a two-year test to evaluate how our biodiesel and renewable diesel perform, especially in cold weather conditions.\n\nTo learn more, visit regi.com.\n\nbiodiesel\n\nTo deliver strong performance and lifecycle carbon reduction, biodiesel could be blended with both petroleum diesel and renewable diesel.\n\ncircularity\n\nFor over 10 years, Restaurant Technologies has supplied feedstock to our facilities and now uses our renewable fuels in their own fleet.\n\npartnership\n\nWith Iowa State University, we are evaluating new lower carbon feedstocks for production of renewable diesel.\nenvironment strategy\n\nChevron\u2019s Environment strategy underscores our commitment to protect the environment. By embedding this into enterprise business planning, we aim to enhance environmental performance across the globe. The strategy promotes systematic consideration of business risks and environmental performance alongside external stakeholder expectations.\n\nfocus on environment\n\nThe Environment strategy shapes enterprisewide processes and procedures to influence environmental metrics, workforce training, technology investments and external partnerships.\n\nIn addition to focusing on our climate and carbon objectives, we also endeavor to:\n\n- Conserve fresh water in water-stressed regions\n- Protect biodiversity\n- Manage waste generation and waste stream circularity\n- Reduce non-GHG\u00b9 air emissions\n\n\u00b9 Non-greenhouse gas air emissions include sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds, excluding methane.\n\nevironment risk management process\n\nFor Chevron, getting results the right way is important throughout the life of a project \u2013 from planning and construction through operation and decommissioning. We employ long-standing risk management processes to evaluate facility, activity and product-related risks across the lifecycle of the business. Our Environment Risk Management Process helps business units identify and evaluate their environmental risks alongside safety risks and asset integrity. Risks and safeguards identified through the process are integrated into individual business unit risk profiles and inform the Environment strategy.\n\ngrowing workforce capabilities\n\nWe continue to build environmental fluency and competency within our broad workforce and strengthen coordination between our technical center and businesses. To promote data quality and consistency, our environmental experts offer biannual training on reporting data for air and energy and for waste and water.\n\nIn 2022, we trained environmental risk assessors and launched a digital tool to evaluate risks across the enterprise. This information is used to inform long-term vision and business planning for the Environment strategy.\n\nThe OEMS Environment strategy seeks to protect the environment through responsible design, development, operations and asset retirement. The Environment Risk Management Process is our systematic approach to identify, manage and assess environmental risks and safeguards.\nemployee spotlight\n\nAs an avid surfer, I value protecting the environment. At Chevron, I work to apply environment risk management practices that contribute to the safety of our daily operations and the success of new projects. The Environment Risk Management Process is designed to be fit-for-purpose so that it can be applied to activities with a broad range of complexity, including large projects and ongoing operations.\n\nChevron recently proposed the Kern River Eastridge carbon capture and storage project in the Kern River field, where Chevron has been operating for over 100 years. When assessing projects, our process seeks to strengthen our safeguards and apply lessons learned across Chevron. We bring together a variety of technical and business function experts with a broad range of viewpoints. Identifying environmental risks, across an asset lifecycle, guides selection and implementation of safeguards that can protect people and the environment.\n\nI believe using the Environment Risk Management Process can help set projects on a strong path to success.\n\nmetrics and performance\n\nAt Chevron, we aim to achieve results and enhance transparency by annually reporting environmental metrics and performance data.\n\nIn the 2021 Corporate Sustainability Report, we expanded reporting of freshwater metrics. We shared data on fresh water withdrawn within water-stressed areas as well as water intensity metrics for the upstream and refining sectors.\n\nThroughout 2022, we have engaged upstream and refining operations to better understand environmental performance and develop insights into improvement opportunities. We also continue to work to better understand non-greenhouse gas air emissions and waste data.\n\nunderstanding data\n\nPerformance data may vary from year to year or across multiple years. Variations may result from causes such as methodology updates, portfolio changes, economic conditions, and business performance and initiatives. The decreases identified below are primarily driven by expirations related to the Rokan concession in Indonesia and Erawan concession in Thailand, divestments, updates to calculation methodologies and flaring reductions.\n\n>50% decrease in upstream oil discharges to surface water since 2018\n\n25% decrease in nitrogen oxides emissions since 2018\n\n44% decrease in volatile organic compounds emissions since 2018\nChevron Phillips Chemical Company (CPChem), a 50-50 joint venture between Chevron and Phillips 66, is a founding member of Cyclyx International, a consortium-based feedstock management company with a mission to help increase the recycling rates of post-use plastic from 10% to 90%. In 2022, Cyclyx launched 10 to 90 Challenge, a consumer engagement effort to divert plastics from landfills and into the Cyclyx supply chain. Cyclyx also signed an agreement to advance development of a plastic waste sorting and processing facility in Houston, Texas. The facility aims to connect community recycling programs to new recycling technologies that have the potential to accept a wider variety of plastics.\n\n**innovation**\n\nChevron targets innovation and transformational technology development through participation in external interdisciplinary, multi-institution research programs designed to improve environmental performance. As a member of Rice University\u2019s Carbon Hub, a zero-emissions research initiative, we are supporting research to explore the potential use of methane-derived carbon for sequestration in soil. Within NEWT, an engineering research center for nanotechnology water treatment also headquartered at Rice University, we are exploring efficient modular water treatment systems to facilitate access to clean water.\n\n**targeting innovation**\n\nWe participate in zero-emissions and sustainable research initiatives\n\nIn 2022, Chevron Technology Ventures invested in a sustainable industrial innovation fund, by Emerald Technology Ventures, focused on sustainable packaging. The fund provides access to novel technology and partnerships aimed at operationalizing higher-yield and lower-cost recycling approaches. It targets innovation along the full packaging value chain in categories such as lower carbon footprint feedstocks; functional and smart materials; design for reuse and recycle, collection, sorting, cleaning and recycling technologies; digital and connected solutions; and new business models.\n\n**addressing plastic waste**\n\nTo reduce waste and develop circularity opportunities, we seek to learn from industry peers and sustainability leaders. Circularity opportunities include recycling, reusing or repurposing post-use plastic. We\u2019re working to leverage partnerships to share best practices, drive innovation and develop industry standards.\n\n**our partnerships are taking steps to reduce plastic waste and to develop a circular economy**\n\nIn 2022, Chevron joined the Ipieca Circular Economy Task-force, which aims to improve understanding of circularity in oil, gas and alternative energy industries. We also joined the U.S.-based National Lubricant Container Recycling Coalition, an industry-led technical coalition focused on developing a national market-sustaining program to drive the recovery and recycling of plastic packaging used to transport lubricants and related products for commercial and consumer use.\n\nWe are partnering on sustainability-related initiatives through our joint-venture companies, CPChem and GS Caltex. Using KBR and Mura\u2019s Hydro-PRT\u00ae (Hydrothermal Plastic Recycling Technology) process, GS Caltex is establishing a 50,000 ton/year unit in South Korea to convert waste plastics into raw materials for conversion into new plastics.\n\nTo learn more, visit chevron.co/environmental.\nBiodiversity, or variation of living things from genetics to ecosystems, is essential to a healthy biosphere and human welfare. The foods we eat, shelters we rely on and medicines we use are direct benefits of biodiversity. We also benefit indirectly through natural functions such as pollination, climate regulation, water purification and nutrient cycling. Chevron recognizes the importance of biodiversity and works with communities, universities, regulatory agencies, industry groups and conservation organizations to take action to help protect and enhance it.\n\n**screening for biodiversity**\n\nWe are creating a global geospatial database of our upstream onshore operations and have overlaid protected area data sets provided through the Proteus Partnership and the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool. The combination allows us to screen operating sites and potential new projects against multiple biodiversity resources, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Protected Area Management Categories I\u2013IV, the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas.\n\nScreening of our 2022 portfolio identifies no upstream onshore operating sites in IUCN I\u2013IV areas, except for Barrow Island, Australia. There, we have several decades of operating within an Australia-designated Class A nature reserve (IUCN category Ia \u2013 strict nature reserve). Through the exclusion of invasive species on Barrow Island, our environmental stewardship has contributed to the conservation of rare and threatened species, such as the spectacled hare-wallaby and golden bandicoot.\n\nOur geospatial database helps us understand potential biodiversity impacts and benefits at the site level. Screening is intended to strengthen risk assessments through our Environment Risk Management Process and quality decision making.\n\n**employee spotlight**\n\nI grew up on a farm in Western Australia, which set me up well for a career in environmental rehabilitation. With an interest in soils, nature and biodiversity, I gravitated toward studies in natural resource management, which led to my current position as a rehabilitation specialist for Chevron Australia.\n\nI am currently focused on restoration and revegetation of 82.5 acres on Thevenard Island, Western Australia. To help protect the area\u2019s unique biodiversity, my team has been collecting and propagating 14 target species of indigenous seeds and cuttings from the island. The island environment is predominantly coastal beach sand with low rainfall, so the chance for seeds to naturally germinate is compromised. We spent time to understand the soil physics and chemistry of the rehabilitation area to identify a preferred planting method. In a controlled nursery on the mainland, we give the vegetation a head start before transporting it back to the island for planting.\n\nI\u2019m proud of the results that we\u2019ve achieved. Fairy terns, a vulnerable bird species, are now roosting in the rehabilitation area. It\u2019s fantastic to see native species inhabiting the area and to know that I\u2019m working on something for future generations.\n\n**The OEMS Environment strategy** seeks to protect the environment through responsible design, development, operations and asset retirement. The Environment Risk Management Process is our systematic approach to identify, manage and assess environmental risks and safeguards.\napplying the mitigation hierarchy\n\nThe Environment Risk Management Process incorporates Chevron\u2019s Protective by Design concept, which underpins the mitigation hierarchy and is used when evaluating projects or design changes.\n\npreventive\n\navoidance\n- Site selection\n- Design\n- Scheduling\n\nreduction\n- Physical controls\n- Operational controls\n- Abatement controls\n\nremediative\n\nrestoration\n- Reestablishment of habitat types\n- Reestablishment of biodiversity\n- Reestablishment of ecosystem services\n\noffsets\n- Restoration offsets\n- Averted loss offsets\n\npreventive measures\n\nTo protect biodiversity during planning stages, Chevron prioritizes preventive measures to avoid or reduce potential impacts. Avoidance measures may include site selection, design and scheduling. Reduction measures may include physical, operational and abatement controls.\n\nCalifornia harbor seal rookery protection\n\nIn 2017, Chevron established the West Coast Decommissioning Program to complete the decommissioning of five oil platforms and related facilities in federal waters off the central coast of California. The Carpinteria Gas Plant pier provides shore-based support to two of the platforms. This pier is adjacent to an active harbor seal rookery.\n\nIndependent volunteers watch over the rookery year-round, particularly during pupping season from December through May when the city of Carpinteria closes the beach to the public. Working with the volunteers, we allow monitoring from an overlook on plant property.\n\nWherever possible, the West Coast Decommissioning team takes great care to avoid and reduce disturbances to the seals and their pups. We are able to adjust pier lighting and reduce the public address system noise levels to reduce disturbances to the rookery.\n\nWork plans eliminate routine activities on the beach during pupping season. When work is unavoidable, we coordinate with the city and dedicate onsite wildlife monitors to reduce potential impacts to the seals. Our personnel also undergo marine mammal training, specific to their responsibilities, to remain sensitive to the seals and the surrounding environment.\n\nAustralia solar-powered mobile lighting\n\nTo reduce the potential effects of diesel-powered mobile lighting towers on biodiversity, we began trials on four solar-powered mobile lighting towers in 2020 at our Gorgon operations in Australia. Solar-powered lights remove or reduce many of the environmental impacts of diesel-powered lights, such as noise, odors, vibration and carbon emissions. The solar-powered LED lights maintain wavelengths at 590 nanometers. This is ideal for reducing impacts to turtle hatchlings and other nocturnal fauna, which tend to be less attracted to this wavelength. Based on the success of the trials, Chevron has leased an additional 27 units, for use in Australia, and is evaluating wider use in our global efforts to monitor and prevent impacts to biodiversity.\nremediative measures\n\nChevron may also implement remediative measures, such as restoration and offsets, that can help achieve a net positive impact on local biodiversity. Restoration may include reestablishment of habitat types, biodiversity or ecosystem services. Offsets may include restoration offsets or averted loss offsets to compensate for biodiversity impacts.\n\nNew Mexico wetlands restoration\n\nRegulatory-required remediation activities at the Questa Mine in New Mexico triggered the need to offset 2.74 acres of wetlands. In consultation with stakeholders, Chevron elected to restore wet meadows and mountain fen, which is a high-altitude peat-forming wetland unique to the area.\n\nRestoration in the Cabresto Creek watershed of New Mexico\u2019s Sangre de Cristo Mountains began in 2019. By 2021, we had restored approximately 6.7 acres of wetland habitat through the installation of corrective structures.\n\nSite monitoring has confirmed a reduction in erosion and a rise in the water table. Vegetation is responding to the hydrology improvements, and characteristic mountain fen and wet meadows plant species are returning.\n\nprotecting habitat and species\n\nChevron is involved in a variety of projects designed to protect habitat and benefit sensitive species, which can help us achieve a net positive impact on biodiversity within certain regions.\n\nGnatcatcher habitat preservation\n\nFor nearly a century, the West Coyote Hills property in Fullerton, California, operated as a 2,000-acre oil field until operations ceased in the early 1990s. The property is one of the few large, contiguous tracts of natural lands south of the San Gabriel Mountains. It is home to a variety of wildlife species and protected vegetation, including the California gnatcatcher, an endangered bird, and its habitat, the coastal sage scrub. In 2021, we sold 24 acres to the city of Fullerton. The sale allowed remediation of the site and a link to the Robert Ward Preserve, an area we had previously donated to the city. Additionally, Chevron converted two miles of roads in the preserve to nature trails for public use.\n\nSociable lapwing conservation\n\nOur Tengizchevroil LLP (TCO) joint venture continues to sponsor the Association for the Conservation of Biodiversity of Kazakhstan (ACBK) and their work on the Sociable Lapwing Conservation Project. While this critically endangered migratory bird is not present in TCO\u2019s operational area, it does breed in Kazakhstan. This conservation project is an important biodiversity offset for TCO to achieve no net loss of terrestrial natural habitat.\n\nIn May 2022, the ACBK conservation team discovered the bird in locations where it had not been witnessed nesting for more than seven years. The team was able to satellite-tag, for the first time, an adult female bird in addition to 17 more birds. ACBK will analyze migratory paths and identify where these individual birds spend their wintering time, which will support additional conservation programs, such as habitat protection.\n\nnature-based solutions\n\nWe launched Chevron New Energies (CNE) to advance lower carbon solutions in our own businesses and to serve our customers\u2019 lower carbon goals. CNE is evaluating a variety of opportunities, including nature-based solutions, which encompass actions that increase carbon sequestration through environmental conservation, restoration and improved land management practices.

We aim to drive efficient and responsible water use, reuse, recycling and conservation. Chevron recognizes that collaboration with the communities where we operate is fundamental to strengthening water stewardship.\n\nTo advance our vision for water stewardship, Chevron aims to:\n\n\u2022 Evaluate, implement and maintain safeguards designed to prevent or mitigate potential impacts to the environment, including water resources, and surrounding communities throughout the lifecycle of our assets\n\u2022 Identify solutions to reduce water withdrawals for our operations, especially in high water stress areas\n\u2022 Assess water treatment technology solutions to mitigate wastewater-related impacts to the environment\n\u2022 Measure the effectiveness of our management practices, drive accountability within our operations and communicate performance to stakeholders\n\u2022 Build partnerships with stakeholders and participate in industry water resources initiatives to share best practices in water management and support the development of industry standards and related policy\n\npercentage of total fresh water withdrawn in stressed vs. non-stressed areas in 2022\n\n24% water-stressed areas\n76% water non-stressed areas\n\nusing nonfresh water in high or extremely high water stress areas\n\nWe use the World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct tool to map operated assets in water-stressed areas. In 2022, seven upstream facilities, one biorefinery, one oil refinery and one additives facility were located in areas of high or extremely high water stress, according to the WRI tool.\n\nThe OEMS Environment strategy seeks to protect the environment through responsible design, development, operations and asset retirement. The Environment Risk Management Process is our systematic approach to identify, manage and assess environmental risks and safeguards.\nTo avoid using fresh water in a high water stress area, our business in Australia operates two onshore permanent seawater reverse osmosis desalination facilities with a combined maximum capacity of approximately 1.8 million cubic meters per year. Throughout the commissioning and operation of these facilities, comprehensive effluent ecotoxicology analyses have been undertaken to reduce potential impact to the marine environment and protect biodiversity.\n\n**water-stressed areas**\n\nOur operated assets are mapped using the WRI Aqueduct tool. Visit chevron.co/watermap.\n\n**recycling and reusing produced water to reduce shale and tight freshwater use**\n\nOur operations in Northeast Colorado conducted a pilot study on produced water recycling in late 2021, which led to the construction of a recycling facility catering to our shale and tight operations. The facility started up in August 2022 and will run for slightly over two years, diverting almost all produced water flow for recycling and eventual reservoir reinjection. The expected recycled volume is up to 17 million barrels throughout the facility\u2019s lifetime, which translates to approximately a 12% reduction in freshwater volume usage.\n\nPermian Basin operations continue to increase the use of recycled produced water to displace the use of fresh and nonfresh water for completions. In 2022, 99% of water demands for well completions were met using brackish or recycled water. By using nonfresh, brackish or recycled water, we help preserve fresh water in the Permian Basin, a drought-prone area.\n\nAris Water Solutions provides produced water gathering and recycling services infrastructure in the Permian Basin. Under our agreement with Aris Water Solutions, we will contribute to the development and piloting of an integrated system of technologies to treat produced water for potential reuse in applications outside of the oil field.\nwe are seeking innovative solutions to increase produced water recycling and reuse in our operations\n\nenhancing environmental safeguards\n\nProcessing crude with a higher nitrogen content is challenging because wastewater with higher nitrogen loads can be harder to reliably and consistently treat. To better manage these issues and achieve required treatment levels, the Pascagoula Refinery implemented a series of improvements. Improvements included upgrading the bioreactors with a new bioreactor inlet and aeration system in 2021. This infrastructure upgrade enables the refinery to process nitrogen-rich crude and enhance environmental safeguards by improving wastewater treatment performance.\n\nAt Chevron, we seek opportunities to advance our water management acumen through our partnership in research consortia and industry participation. In 2022, we piloted the Wastewater Impact Assessment Tool developed by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development at four U.S. refineries. We also hosted a series of training sessions to improve our understanding of water footprint methodologies at site and product levels.\n\nTo learn more, visit chevron.co/water.\n\nemployee spotlight\n\nIn 2003, I joined Chevron in my home country of Colombia and spent my first 14 years on multiple assignments within the Latin America business unit and Chevron Technical Center. Over the years, I gained fluency in environmental management topics, including risk-based assessment of operations activities.\n\nNow as a senior environmental engineer at Angola LNG (ALNG), my focus is to help local practitioners deploy OEMS processes, including the Environment Risk Management Process. For example, we are using this risk-based approach to help us prioritize critical actions to improve wastewater management.\n\nPartnering with our waste and water team has been invaluable. In 2019, the team guided us through an extended plantwide wastewater monitoring program to characterize risk and develop a risk profile. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed a detailed water management plan for ALNG\u2019s 2022 turnaround. While working remotely, the technical experts in Houston collaborated with us to develop a day-by-day plan to successfully and safely manage water and process waste throughout the turnaround.\n\nI am proud of my contributions to growing the capabilities of others and am gratified to see the members of my team using their technical skills to provide effective wastewater management solutions.\n\nnew mexico produced water research consortium\n\nIn 2022, Chevron participated in the New Mexico Produced Water Research Consortium. Through this engagement, we helped to advance scientific research and technology solutions for the treatment and fit-for-purpose reuse of oil and gas produced water. We were involved in conducting a demonstration of treatment technologies, formulating risk and toxicology approaches, and evaluating potential economic impacts related to the beneficial reuse of produced water. We also provided input to guide the development of state policies and regulations.\n\nAt Chevron, we seek opportunities to advance our water management acumen through our partnership in research consortia and industry participation. In 2022, we piloted the Wastewater Impact Assessment Tool developed by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development at four U.S. refineries.

Fatalities and injuries have a profound impact on our families, communities and company. Protecting the health and safety of all those who work on our behalf is a core value. Chevron is committed to preventing serious incidents and fatalities.\n\nEnabling safe work\nTo prevent serious injuries and fatalities (SIFs), we focus on the planning and execution of high-risk activities. We identify and initiate action plans at both the local and enterprise levels to engage front-line leaders and workers and enable safe work. Cross-functional teams work to implement and scale our SIF prevention efforts. Lessons learned are shared throughout the company and applied in our daily practices. We believe the application of these practices and the execution of the Operational Excellence Management System (OEMS) are key to the continuous improvement of our safety performance.\n\nMaintaining contractor safety\nOur Contractor Operational Excellence Management (COEM) process establishes clear accountabilities, promotes active partnership and provides a consistent approach to help prevent SIFs. Best practices and early-adopter experiences are shared through our COEM Community of Practice. In addition, a complementary digital application, eCOEM, enables Operational Excellence (OE) diligence during each phase of the contracting lifecycle.\n\nCollaborating for safety improvement\nChevron partnered with other international energy companies and the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP) to host Safety Collaboration Forum 2022, Projects and Wells. The forum assembled strategic contractor partner companies with capital project and wells expertise. Agenda items included leadership\u2019s influence on safety performance, proactive learning and Start-Work Checks as a verification tool for front-line worker SIF prevention. After the sessions, attendees discussed how they can drive changes within their organizations. This forum set a foundation for safety collaboration and emphasized improvement and human performance principles as a key to industry risk resiliency.\n\nEmbracing human performance\nHuman and organizational performance (HOP) principles and concepts help mitigate the risk of human errors. They encourage the workforce to capture and share innovations and key lessons learned from the field to accelerate continuous improvement. In November 2022, Saudi Arabian Chevron conducted a two-day SIF awareness and prevention workshop with industry peers and contractor companies. The workshop introduced HOP principles, such as a verification and validation program and coaching front-line workers performing high-risk work or potential high-consequence work.\n\nIOGP\nChevron participated in an IOGP Safety Committee task force to understand the mechanisms that lead to serious injuries, referred to by IOGP as fatality and permanent impairment. In November 2022, the committee published definitions and concepts to support consistent reporting and measurement of actual and potential serious injuries. We believe the benchmarking data will help the industry further understand injury incidents and promote continued safety performance improvements through the provision of both lagging and leading metrics.\n\nThe OEMS Workforce Safety and Health and Process Safety, Reliability and Integrity expectations enable consistency and standardization across the company. Everyone in the workforce contributes to our Operational Excellence culture and performance.\nexamples of how we collaborate with nonoperated joint ventures to manage risk\n\n| knowledge sharing | For risk-based assessment and prioritization of nonoperated joint ventures (NOJV), Chevron utilizes an NOJV health, safety and environment (HSE) process. The associated tools and guidance apply consistency in the assessment of partners\u2019 HSE capabilities. Where practical, Chevron seconds employees to NOJV operations to partner and share best practices. Chevron influences partners to: (1) eliminate fatalities, serious injuries and illnesses; (2) eliminate high-consequence process safety incidents and operate with industry-leading reliability; and (3) assess and manage significant environmental and social risks. |\n| partnership | Brightmark RNG Holdings LLC, an NOJV partnership between Chevron and Brightmark Fund Holdings LLC, captures biomethane from dairy operations and updates it to renewable natural gas (RNG) used for transportation fuel. To influence safe and reliable operations, the Environmental, Health, Safety & Security (EHSS) committee, which includes members from both companies, reviews EHSS strategies, programs, compliance and performance. Together we work to mitigate potential risks through effective collaboration and best-practice sharing. |\n\nprocess safety\n\nConsistent execution in operations\nConduct of Operations (COO) encompasses the standards and practices used to structure operational practices and operations management tasks. Through COO, we can influence the performance of work activities in a deliberate way, reducing variation in outcomes to improve safe, reliable and consistent operational performance. We harmonized existing practices into an enterprisewide business improvement network (BIN) to reinforce strong COO, enable effective input on new standards development and promote sharing of best practices. COO BIN membership comprises operations specialists and process safety experts from across Chevron business units and technical functions.\n\nsafety technology\n\nReal-time air modeling\nPart of being a good neighbor is being ready to act should an incident occur in a community where we operate. To maintain our vigilance, Chevron systematically tests technologies designed to keep the public and our workforce safe. The El Segundo Refinery piloted Industrial Scientific Corporation\u2019s SAFER One\u00ae solution, a plume-dispersion modeling software that uses live meteorological and gas detection readings to update plume projections in real time. Incident managers can assess the immediate downwind impact from a point of release to make decisions and deploy resources that reduce potential risk to personnel and the surrounding community.\n\nproduct stewardship\n\nChemical management through technology\nChevron manages over 1,500 chemicals in product formulations as part of our Operational Excellence Product Stewardship process. In 2022, we created more than 70,000 safety data sheets in 39 languages. Digital dashboards prioritize the chemicals based on concentration in the product, region of distribution and hazard classification. This provides our business units with the information needed to analyze how and where potentially hazardous chemicals exist in the value chain. It also allows our business partners to make informed decisions about the chemicals they use.\nemployee spotlight\n\nThe Chevron Way has enabled me to deliver results aligned with my own values. After growing up in Trinidad, I completed undergraduate studies in London and postgraduate studies in California before joining Chevron as an environmental professional. In the 20 years since, I\u2019ve worked in many different countries across Chevron\u2019s global business, including Indonesia, Australia and Kazakhstan. These experiences have given me the ability to understand risk identification and management with different asset types, geographical settings and cultures.\n\nIn my current role, I support Chevron\u2019s business development efforts. When pursuing a potential acquisition opportunity, I bring together a cross-functional team that will conduct due diligence and evaluation from an OE risk perspective. Our approach assesses all OE aspects \u2013 health, safety, environment, reliability, process safety and stakeholder issues. Our objective is to identify the risks so that we can develop safeguards and manage them responsibly as part of the integration into our operations.\n\nAcquisitions and investments can present new opportunities and risks. The OEMS provides a systematic process to manage risk to people and the environment across all stages of the asset lifecycle.\n\nworkforce well-being\n\nChevron is proud to be named among the Healthiest 100 Workplaces in America in 2022 by Healthiest Employers\u00ae, honoring organizations that prioritize employee well-being.\n\nChevron received the 2023 Platinum Bell Seal for Workplace Mental Health by Mental Health America. The Bell Seal is a first-of-its-kind workplace mental health certification that recognizes employers who strive to create mentally healthy workplaces for their employees.\n\nOur mental health campaign strategy focused on setting boundaries at home and the workplace to establish balance and expectations that may mitigate stress and burnout. In 2022, many of our employee networks organized mental, emotional and physical well-being events and highlighted work-life services. Our Women\u2019s Employee Network focused on burnout, and our XYZ Employee Network highlighted the importance of emotional and physical well-being.\n\nTo help reduce employees\u2019 anxiety about returning to office locations, the Chevron Health & Medical team addressed stigma and other emotional well-being factors through masking and vaccination messaging. The team also continued to provide COVID-19 testing and contact tracing services. The ergonomics team conducted workstation evaluations for both in-office and at-home workspaces to address physical discomfort and satisfy corporate standards.\n\nhealth\n\nPromoting workforce well-being\n\nChevron recognizes that mental, emotional and physical health is paramount to workforce well-being. Our aim is to have resources proactively and readily available to the entire workforce and their family members prior to an individual experiencing an elevated emotional strain or a diagnosis of a mental or physical health condition. The meQuilibrium (meQ) app has been expanded to include employees\u2019 adult dependents and made available in more languages, making a stress management resource more accessible to our global workforce and their families.\n\nOur annual Enterprise Health Index collects anonymized employee health measurements over eight different dimensions, including individual health and well-being. Overall scores increased as we returned to office locations and adopted hybrid schedules after the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, individual well-being scores have decreased in the stress management and work-life balance areas.\npartnering for health equity\n\nHealth equity can be described as the state when every person can attain full health potential without being disadvantaged because of social and other factors.\n\nChevron Health & Medical considers health equity when assessing workforce health strategies and in supporting prevention, education and treatment that may benefit the communities where we operate. We believe programs that are accessible, affordable, prevention-focused, and culturally and globally relevant can go a long way toward addressing equity issues.\n\n**culturally adapted well-being**\n\n**health equity in the workforce: ambassadors**\n\nWellness Ambassadors created within our employee networks encourage health equity by partnering with Health & Medical to provide targeted health awareness programming that is culturally adapted.\n\nInclusion as a driver of well-being was a focus of Black Employee Network (BEN) panel discussions. BEN raised awareness of mental health issues among people of color and provided a space to discuss topics related to emotional and mental well-being.\n\nResponding to uncertainty experienced by employees returning to office locations, our Hispanic and Latin American employee network (Somos) hosted emotional well-being sessions. Sessions addressed cultivating healthy boundaries at work and home, embracing change and similar topics.\n\n**assisting underserved populations**\n\n**health equity in the community: CAL-PEP**\n\nChevron recognizes that there are opportunities to foster health equity through programs in the communities where we operate. For example, we are a decades-long sponsor of the California Prevention & Education Project (CAL-PEP), a program that assists marginalized and underserved populations in the Oakland/East Bay area.\n\nCAL-PEP connects community members to lifesaving resources, including infectious disease testing, vaccination, and mental health and wellness support. Mobile units provide hot showers and hygiene and triage services to those without access to basic resources. In addition to continued funding from the company, Chevron volunteers assembled and delivered over 2,500 personal hygiene kits in 2022.\n\n**reaching children in need**\n\n**health equity in the community: PATH**\n\nWith a grant from Chevron, the international nonprofit organization PATH is supporting Nigeria\u2019s decision-making processes for the potential phased introduction of a malaria vaccine. Introduction would be through the National Primary Health Care Development Agency and the Nigeria Federal Ministry of Health.\n\nWe believe equity-focused interventions with partnerships that support health systems can significantly improve public health outcomes. Nigeria\u2019s evidence-based vaccine adoption processes and the country\u2019s proposed plans to introduce the malaria vaccine to reach children in greatest need reflect this priority of Chevron and PATH.\n\n**Combating infectious disease**\n\nSoutheast Asia One Health University Network (SEAOHUN) universities are working together to develop the next generation of health professionals with the right set of skills and mindset to respond to infectious disease threats. We are collaborating with SEAOHUN on a program called \u201cStrengthening One Health Education in Southeast Asia.\u201d This program aims to improve public health literacy in children and lays the foundation for effective public responses to future infectious disease threats. The program provides opportunities for Chevron to engage with an extensive network of national, regional and international One Health stakeholders in the areas where we operate.\n\nTo learn more, visit chevron.co/healthsafety.\npeople and culture\nwe invest in people and foster a culture of belonging\n\ndiversity and inclusion at chevron are enabled by our strong corporate culture, empowering our employee workforce, advancing racial equity, and focusing on talent recruitment and development\n\nour corporate culture\n\nChevron invests in its workforce and culture, with the objective of engaging employees to develop their full potential to deliver energy solutions and enable human progress. A compelling employee experience supports the pursuit of meaningful careers. We promote resources for good health, well-being and work-life balance. Our focus is on strengthening the attraction of future employees and retention and upskilling of our current employees. We promote a culture of feedback within the workforce and develop leaders to sustain and strengthen our culture for the future.\n\nEmployee engagement is an indicator of employee well-being and commitment to the company\u2019s values, purpose and strategies. Chevron regularly conducts employee surveys to assess the health of the company culture. Recent surveys indicate high employee engagement. Our survey frequency enables us to better understand employee sentiment throughout the year and gain insights into employee well-being.\n\nempowering our employees\n\nAt Chevron, employee networks are voluntary groups of employees that come together based on shared identity or interests. These networks seek to foster an inclusive and supportive work environment for all employees.\n\nOur Chairman\u2019s Inclusion Council provides employee network presidents with a direct line of communication to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Human Resources Officer, the Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer, and the Enterprise Leadership Team. The council allows executives and network presidents to collaborate and discuss how employee networks can reinforce Chevron\u2019s values of diversity and inclusion.\n\nchevron employee networks in 2022\n\n11 networks\n\n~19,000 network members\n\nAs employees\u2019 needs change, we evolve to meet those changing needs. In 2022, our Boomers Employee Network became the Stages Employee Network, recognizing the need to shift from a generation-based network to one that spans the stages of an employee\u2019s career. In support of Chevron\u2019s long-term employment model, the network is dedicated to sharing knowledge and experience among employees as they transition through their careers and lives.\n\nChevron established an Equity Review Committee to review employee concerns with promotion or selections. The committee, which includes external experts, will offer external perspectives on whether our promotion and selection processes are yielding equitable results.\nattracting underrepresented, new and early talent\n\nChevron pursues the talent of underrepresented groups, including women and minority groups, through programs and partnerships. This includes developing strong relationships with universities and diversity associations. Our approach begins with our refreshed external careers website, including 21 country pages to highlight our diversity and inclusion efforts and attract multigenerational talent around the globe.\n\nOur intern program serves Chevron\u2019s early-career talent pipeline. In 2022, the internship program was hybrid, providing virtual and in-person work opportunities. Our intern and full-time campus hires from underrepresented talent pools increased between 2020 and 2022.\n\nLooking beyond traditional talent sourcing channels, such as specific schools and universities, we\u2019ve collaborated regionally with Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc.\u00ae and Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.\u00ae This expansion allows us to attract underrepresented candidates from historically African American organizations. Through these efforts we hired our first Corporate Compliance Law Function intern, who after their summer internship experience was offered and accepted a full-time position.\n\nChevron\u2019s University & Partnerships team hosted \u201cGetting to Know Chevron\u201d virtual sessions for our partners from historically Black colleges and universities. Over 2,200 students demonstrated interest in Chevron, and 215 attended sessions on energy transition, technology and Chevron\u2019s Horizons early-career development program.\n\nemployee spotlight\n\nI\u2019ve been fortunate to have opportunities for global collaboration and leadership at Chevron since 2001, both in Pricing and through volunteering with Somos. Somos is Chevron\u2019s Latin American and Hispanic employee network. As their Integration Officer, I\u2019ve focused on driving communication and professional development among chapters since 2019.\n\nSomos aims to help Chevron employees access equal career development opportunities. To support this goal, in 2022 we piloted an early career mentoring program in Argentina, where motivated Chevron leaders and employees were matched to develop their organizational capability and build relationships. Participants praised the program, commenting on the immediate value this mentorship provided for their current roles and near-term career planning.\n\nOur work with the Hispanic Outreach and Language Assimilation (HOLA) initiative, in collaboration with Chevron\u2019s social investment efforts, supports community outreach and volunteering in the Hispanic communities where we operate. One area we\u2019re passionate about promoting is science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Somos members in Central America have volunteered with a nongovernmental organization to implement STEM programs.\n\nIn September 2022, we held our Global Somos employee network conference, which brought together Somos network leaders from across our business to meet in person and build leadership skills. Within Somos we apply a \u201cFamilia\u201d or \u201cone team\u201d approach to our work. We believe collaboration across the enterprise helps us to achieve our full potential.\n\ninternship talent pipeline\n\nIn 2022, 90% of the full-time offers extended to previous interns were accepted\n\nLooking beyond traditional talent sourcing channels, such as specific schools and universities, we\u2019ve collaborated regionally with Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc.\u00ae and Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.\u00ae This expansion allows us to attract underrepresented candidates from historically African American organizations.

Our development programs are designed to help people achieve their full potential, accelerate leadership capabilities, and cultivate a diverse and robust talent pipeline in an ever-changing work environment.\n\nBecause Chevron believes in developing leaders at all levels, we introduced a new coaching program to reach deeper into the organization, including front-line supervisors, managers and, more recently, individual contributors. The BetterUp platform offers live, one-on-one coaching sessions and Coaching Circles\u2122 with small groups of peers. Since its launch in 2020, Chevron has provided coaching to over 2,900 supervisors, managers and individual contributors in 45 countries and 18 languages.\n\nChevron also offers multiple leadership development programs with a focus on self-reflection, continuous learning and strategic networking. Specifically for women, the Transformational Leadership\u00ae for Multicultural Women Program addresses headwinds faced by multicultural women in their leadership journeys. The Global Women\u2019s Leadership Development Program, now in its third year, promotes acceleration of women\u2019s leadership development and experience. Almost 100 women have participated in these two programs.\n\nIn 2022, nearly 135 employees participated in Asian American, Asia-Pacific, Black, and Latino-focused leadership programs that address topics unique to each demographic group and enhance leadership and other skill sets essential to success.\nhuman rights\n\nenabling human progress begins with respecting human rights\n\nstrengthening processes\n\nWe operationalize our commitment to respecting human rights by implementing processes, procedures and tools that enable us to identify and manage potential human rights impacts. This includes guidance on conducting risk and impact assessments as well as engaging with suppliers, contractors and other business partners.\n\nWithin our Operational Excellence Management System (OEMS), our Stakeholder Engagement and Issues Management process continues to be the primary mechanism to put into action our respect for human rights in the communities where we operate. Most Chevron business units undergo an OEMS audit every three to five years and conduct annual assurance activities. Through our OEMS audit and assurance program, subject matter experts review the effectiveness of process and safeguard implementation.\n\nSafeguards such as grievance mechanisms and plans for stakeholder engagement, issue management, emergency response and social investment are systematically reviewed alongside the other OEMS focus areas. Where a business unit has a resettlement plan or engagement with Indigenous Peoples, these plans are also in scope for an audit.\n\nSince 2021, stakeholder-related safeguards have been formally audited across 18 business units and specific actions have been identified to continue improving their design, effectiveness and execution.\n\nThe OEMS Stakeholders Focus Area and Security Focus Area expectations state the desired outcomes to manage associated risks, of which human rights is a subset. The Stakeholder Engagement and Issues Management process identifies and manages social, political and reputational risks to the company and addresses potential business impacts.\n\nemployees\nWe treat all employees with respect and dignity and promote diversity in the workplace\n\nsecurity\nWe protect personnel and assets and provide a secure environment for business operations\n\ncommunities\nWe commit to regularly engage communities near our operational and project areas in meaningful conversations\n\nsuppliers\nWe expect our suppliers and contractors to respect human rights and adhere to applicable international principles\n\nother business partners\nWe encourage our customers and business partners to respect human rights and to adhere to applicable international principles\n\nChevron 2022 Corporate Sustainability Report 42\nchevron commits to respecting human rights as set out in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Labour Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work\n\nJose Palacio\nBusiness Strategic Advisor, Latin America business unit\n\nemployee spotlight\n\nFor the past 16 years, I have supported the implementation of Chevron\u2019s social investment model for Indigenous communities. In my capacity as a Strategic Advisor, I coordinated Chevron\u2019s initiative to promote maternal and child health among the Indigenous Wayuu people in the La Guajira region of Colombia. I also oversaw a plan aimed at spurring greater acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination among the Wayuus.\n\nWe partnered with Texas Children\u2019s Hospital and the Baylor College of Medicine International Pediatric AIDS Initiative to assess the Wayuus\u2019 health needs and develop a public-private partnership to treat maternal and child health. The program included training for bilingual nursing assistants, arranging transportation for vaccination campaigns in scattered areas and obtaining adequate supplies of the vaccine.\n\nThe program continues to have positive results. Maternal and infant mortality in the region continues to decline, COVID-19 vaccination coverage in La Guajira has risen from 0.52% to 71% of the Wayuu population, and more professionals have been trained to administer the vaccine. I am proud of my role in helping to establish trust among the Wayuus and supporting their medical needs.\n\nindigenous peoples guidance\n\nChevron aims to collaborate with Indigenous Peoples and their communities to build trusting and mutually beneficial relationships in a way that respects their history, culture and customs. In 2022, we reviewed our Indigenous Peoples Guidance and reaffirmed its alignment with The Chevron Way vision and values, Chevron\u2019s Human Rights Policy, and our OEMS.\n\nChevron\u2019s Indigenous Peoples Guidance provides an approach for effective engagement and its incorporation into Chevron\u2019s Stakeholder Engagement and Issues Management process and social investment plans. The guidance allows fit-for-purpose approaches to manage local Indigenous groups\u2019 concerns.

Against this background, Chevron Australia commissioned a voluntary review of behaviors in its workplaces.\n\nA specialist consultant, Intersection, conducted workforce engagements across upstream worksites in the Pilbara and Perth, examined potential barriers to reporting and provided 24 recommendations across four key focus areas:\n\n\u2022 Addressing the prevalence of any form of bullying, harassment and discrimination\n\u2022 Uplifting leadership accountability\n\u2022 Increasing diversity and inclusion\n\u2022 Improving the response to reports of inappropriate behaviors\n\nChevron Australia has accepted the recommendations and appointed a project manager, reporting directly to the Managing Director, to oversee implementation. Chevron Australia has also held business unit-wide \u201cStand Up for Respect\u201d events to discuss the importance of everyone contributing to a workplace free from bullying, harassment and discrimination.\nenvironmental justice\n\nIn 2022, we published our Environmental Justice Principles. Since then, a cross-functional team has worked to advance our environmental justice approach. The team seeks to understand emerging environmental justice policy and related issues. In addition, the team offers tailored support to business units, which are assessing local context around environmental justice to engage with communities, lawmakers and regulators.\n\nSubject matter experts from our legislative and regulatory affairs and health, safety and environment functions continue to participate and engage externally. For example, they engage with API\u2019s Environmental Justice Coordination Team and state and local trade associations. Our efforts to support our neighboring communities demonstrate our continued focus on environmental health and social performance.\n\nA group of employees has been trained to serve as qualified environmental and social facilitators. Facilitators aim to look across environmental, social and community health parameters to assess cross-cutting impacts, promoting conversations that help us better understand how social and environmental issues are interconnected.\n\nTo learn more, visit chevron.co/humanrights.\n\ninnovative community engagement\n\nChevron Nigeria Limited (CNL) operations are in the Niger Delta region, home to multiple ethnic groups and known to be conflict-affected. In 2003, a violent interethnic conflict resulted in significant damage to company infrastructure. To move forward, CNL pursued a new approach to stakeholder engagement, leading to a global memorandum of understanding (GMoU).\n\nThe GMoU is a multistakeholder partnership model. Clusters of ethnically similar communities organize into regional development committees that govern how CNL funding is allocated for the socioeconomic development of the area. The GMoU model is based on accountability, transparency and unity among communities and demonstrable positive impact. Since its adoption in 2005, the model has been acknowledged globally for addressing community restiveness and peace building, and facilitating rapid, sustainable socioeconomic development.\n\nwe can learn from the Nigeria model as we advance our approach to operating in conflict-affected areas\n\nNigeria\u2019s Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) of 2021 requires allocation of a percentage of operating expenditure to host communities\u2019 development trusts. A key objective of the Act is to enhance peaceful and harmonious coexistence between companies and host communities. Leading up to and after enactment of the law, CNL broadly communicated our experiences working under the GMoU model. CNL shared the model with industry peers and the government.\nour focus on people, environment and prosperity allows us to give back to our communities\n\npeople\n\nProviding disaster relief\nChevron provides aid to communities where we operate when they are impacted by natural disasters. When Bangladesh was affected by severe flooding in late spring 2022, our support of Bangladeshi communities included funds for food relief and water purification. After Hurricane Ian in Florida, we donated to the Volunteer Florida Foundation, Team Rubicon, the American Red Cross and the Fuel Relief Fund to assist in immediate relief and recovery. Chevron also matched employee donations to Hurricane Ian relief and provided grants to nonprofit organizations where employees have volunteered.\n\nemployee spotlight\n\nI have always believed that education is the fundamental way to enhance people\u2019s lives \u2013 to teach them to catch fish for themselves. In today\u2019s world, that equates to teaching young girls they can master science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects that will help them compete for job opportunities.\n\nMy main role has involved coordinating with the Corporate Affairs team on the logistics in Egypt. In Egypt, engineering has too often been seen as a males-only profession. Chevron introduced a \u201cGirls Make\u201d program to teach STEM to young girls. This program is not only about educating and inspiring the girls who participate, it\u2019s also about changing mindsets to see daughters as innovators. Our Corporate Affairs team in Houston initiated the program, which our company in Egypt supports in collaboration with the Egyptian government.\n\nThe selective program generated high interest and reached more than 150,000 individuals on social media. I\u2019m excited by how this program can help give girls the confidence and skills to progress in this competitive field.\n\n1,233 charitable organizations benefited from volunteer time\n\n$34M+ contributed to U.S. nonprofits through a combination of employee and retiree giving and company matching funds\nPartnering for maternal and pediatric care\nWe are proud of our collaboration with the United Nations Population Fund to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality in Equatorial Guinea. Workers at 23 health facilities have received reproductive-health training focused on reducing maternal mortality.\n\nAssisting local schools\nChevron\u2019s willingness to help took on sudden urgency in August 2022 when schools near our Richmond Refinery were vandalized. Over the summer, six schools were significantly damaged and lost valuable teaching supplies. Through our longtime DonorsChoose partnership, Chevron quickly provided supplies to teachers in the school district to begin repairs and progress teacher-requested projects ahead of the new school year.\n\nTo learn more, visit chevron.co/creatingprosperity.\n\nenvironment\nConserving coastal wetlands\nChevron has teamed with Ducks Unlimited to help preserve over 45,000 acres of wetlands in Louisiana. Many of the projects entail the construction of marsh terraces that will encourage the growth of aquatic vegetation, the food chain foundation for ducks, shorebirds, fish and other coastal wildlife. Our investment aims to fortify communities and protect the livelihoods of residents in South Louisiana.\n\nContributing to nature-based solutions\nIn 2022, we continued our partnership with Conservation Volunteers Australia in the Revive our Wetlands campaign, which seeks to protect and restore wetland environments through targeted conservation. Our sponsorship through 2024 will also finance community volunteer and education events, such as local wetland and biodiversity restoration.\n\nprosperity\nSupporting young engineers\nChevron partners with and donates to the Heznek for Practical Engineers program to benefit underprivileged students in Israel. Aiming to advance workforce diversity and inclusion, the program has had more than 1,500 student participants to date. We also support a school for practical engineers, known as the Chevron-Ruppin Center for Energy and Natural Gas. The program emphasizes careers in oil and gas, which helps complement the work of Heznek. Most of Ruppin\u2019s graduates go on to work in Israel\u2019s energy industry, which needs certified practical engineers.\n\nDeveloping community spaces\nBuilding relationships in the communities where we operate is at the core of Chevron\u2019s values. Through Tengizchevroil, our joint venture in Kazakhstan, and Eurasia Foundation of Central Asia, we sponsor the Public Spaces program. The program helps municipalities develop and construct shared spaces, such as playgrounds, sports grounds and recreation areas. Over 275 residents have participated with local governments in project development and management training with the aim to increase local partnerships. In 2022, 65 public space projects were implemented, directly and indirectly benefiting more than 21,000 residents.\n\nAsia Venture Philanthropy Network\nChevron is funding the Asia Venture Philanthropy Network (AVPN), which brings together companies, investors and foundations to foster innovation and strengthen the nonprofit, social investment ecosystem in Asia. Our contributions to AVPN pooled funds include support for health care in vulnerable communities and gender equity in STEM education for girls and women.\n\nAssisting local schools\nChevron\u2019s willingness to help took on sudden urgency in August 2022 when schools near our Richmond Refinery were vandalized.

As part of its responsibility, the Board oversees risk management policies, practices and systems that are applied throughout the company.\n\nBoard members regularly consider critical risk topics as part of their oversight responsibility. Annually, through Chevron\u2019s Enterprise Risk Management process, they review financial, operational, market, political and other risks inherent in our business and oversee the safeguards and mitigations that are put in place. The Board also oversees Chevron\u2019s strategic and business planning process.\n\nboard oversight\n\nThe Board has four standing Committees, all composed entirely of independent Directors: Audit; Board Nominating and Governance; Management Compensation; and Public Policy and Sustainability. Each Committee fulfills important responsibilities to assist the Board\u2019s oversight of risks with the goal of building long-term shareholder value. The Board and its four Committees also oversee related climate and sustainability issues.\n\nComing from various industries and backgrounds, our Board members bring diverse skills, experience and expertise. Their range of knowledge and experience spans operational, environmental, policy, regulatory and geographical arenas. New members are added, as appropriate, to ensure Board refreshment. For example, Cynthia \u201cCJ\u201d Warner, formerly president and CEO of Renewable Energy Group, Inc., joined the Board in 2022 and brings depth of experience across both the traditional and renewable energy sectors.\n\nexecutive-level committees\n\nThe Executive Committee comprises corporate officers and is chartered by the Board of Directors to carry out policies in managing the company\u2019s business. The Executive Committee has two subcommittees, the Enterprise Leadership Team and the Global Issues Committee, that specialize in various matters important to the company, including strategy and climate and sustainability issues.\n\nemployee spotlight\n\nChevron Corporation has many subsidiaries throughout the world. Managing them properly requires a strong team within corporate governance that is well-versed in governance requirements and internal policies, as well as the subsidiaries\u2019 processes and histories.\n\nI\u2019m one of three liaisons who each supports a different region where Chevron subsidiaries operate. Countries within regions have their own rules and regulations, and it can be challenging to determine how governance should function in each jurisdiction.\n\nMy role involves ensuring the proper governance of the subsidiaries and advising and coordinating with key internal stakeholders, such as Tax, Finance, Law and other departments. We must have knowledge of the governance regulations in every jurisdiction in which Chevron does business and be able to collaborate with stakeholders.\n\nI also help to implement the governance integration, reorganization and corporate structure of companies we acquire, most recently Noble Energy, Inc. and Renewable Energy Group, Inc. I\u2019ve learned the importance of involving stakeholders early in the integration process so that we can continue to improve our best practices in this area.\n\nI am fortunate to have colleagues and mentors who share their knowledge to help protect the company and shareholder value.\nchevron\u2019s governance structure relevant to ESG-related matters\n\nBoard-level committees composed of non-employee directors\n\n- **audit committee (AC)**\n  - Assists the Board in overseeing accounting and financial reporting processes, including:\n    - Internal controls over financial reporting\n    - Relationship with independent auditor\n    - Implementation and effectiveness of compliance programs\n    - Financial risk management\n    - Cybersecurity risks as they relate to financial risk exposures\n    - Sustainability and climate change risks as they relate to financial risk exposures\n    - Operational Excellence audit and assurance\n\n- **board nominating and governance committee (BNGC)**\n  - Assists the Board in overseeing governance practices and processes, including:\n    - Board succession planning\n    - Board skills, experiences and qualifications\n    - Stockholder engagement program (in conjunction with PPSC)\n    - Board, Committee and Director evaluation process\n\n- **management compensation committee (MCC)**\n  - Assists the Board in overseeing compensation programs and practices, including:\n    - Executive retention and diversity strategies and supporting processes\n    - Compensation program design and goals\n    - Alignment of compensation with stockholders\u2019 interests, including those related to sustainability and climate change risks and opportunities\n\n- **public policy and sustainability committee (PPSC)**\n  - Assists the Board in overseeing policy issues and potential risks in areas such as:\n    - Environmental matters, including those related to sustainability and climate change\n    - Legislative and regulatory initiatives\n    - Community relations\n    - Political contributions and lobbying\n    - Chevron\u2019s global reputation\n    - Stockholder engagement program (in conjunction with BNGC)\n\nCommittees of executive officers operating under direction of the Board\n\n- **executive committee\u2020 (EC)**\n  - Manages the composition, resource allocation and strategic direction of Chevron\u2019s portfolio in the following areas:\n    - Operational Excellence\n    - Performance improvement\n    - Energy transition\n    - Enterprise Risk Management process\n    - Market and price forecasts\n  - Receives briefings on these topics from internal subject matter experts and consults with outside experts to discuss energy transition and climate change issues.\n\n- **enterprise leadership team\u2020 (ELT)**\n  - Oversees management of sustainability issues and practices, including:\n    - Energy transition\n    - Lobbying and trade association activity\n    - ESG reporting\n    - Revenue and tax transparency\n    - Human capital management\n    - Human rights\n  - Receives regular updates on these issues from internal subject matter experts in advance of quarterly meetings.\n\n- **global issues committee (GIC)**\n  - Additionally, events may be handled via ad hoc, cross-functional Crisis Management and Issue Management teams, which report regularly to members of the ELT, and if appropriate, provide updates to the Board.\n\n* Chaired by Chairman of the Board\n\u2020 Chaired by Chief Executive Officer\n\nChevron 2022 Corporate Sustainability Report\n## Board Composition\n\n| Director                  | CEO/Senior Executive/Leader of Significant Operations | Science/Technology/Engineering/Research/Academia | Government/Regulatory/Legal/Public Policy | Finance/Financial Disclosure/Financial Accounting | Global Business/International Affairs | Environmental | Leading Business Transformation | Tenure\u00b9 | Age\u00b9 | Gender | Race/Ethnicity Diversity | Independent |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------|---------|-----|--------|--------------------------|-------------|\n| Wanda M.

The Code reinforces our compliance commitment and the responsibility of each employee to ensure that Chevron\u2019s activities adhere to legal and policy requirements everywhere we operate. Chevron maintains internal accounting, administrative and operational controls to manage these standards of conduct and compliance. We communicate the Code to our business partners through our contractual requirements and through ongoing engagement. Chevron employees and contractors receive training on Chevron\u2019s Business Conduct and Ethics Code every two years. For 2022, the enterprisewide completion rate was 97%.\n\nOur compliance program addresses detailed compliance requirements on many important subjects, including anti-corruption, internal controls, international trade, anti-boycott, Operational Excellence (OE), data privacy and competition law. For each subject, senior-level Chevron leaders provide risk-based guidance on the company\u2019s compliance requirements and training.\n\nacross chevron, compliance is everyone\u2019s responsibility\n\nWe take pride that our employees are constantly mindful of the company\u2019s stringent compliance requirements. And in that spirit, Corporate Compliance issues a quarterly award celebrating meaningful efforts to do business the right way.\n\nThe Chevron Hotline operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week and is available for anonymous reporting in multiple languages if someone suspects that anyone in Chevron or at our affiliates has violated any company policy or local laws or has information on any activity that could damage the company\u2019s reputation. Chevron does not tolerate any form of retaliation for reports made in good faith. Retaliation includes blatant actions, such as firing, transferring, demoting or publicly undermining someone, as well as more subtle actions, such as avoiding someone or excluding them from professional or social activities. It includes actions taken by managers and employees alike.\n\n24/7 chevron hotline\n\nTo reinforce our Business Conduct and Ethics Code, the Chevron Hotline operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week and is available for anonymous reporting in multiple languages.\n\ndoing work the right way\n\nWe contribute to the communities where we work and live by creating jobs, developing and sourcing from local suppliers, and giving back in the form of social investment partnerships and programs. We pay taxes (chevron.co/taxes) in jurisdictions around the world and comply with all applicable tax laws. We support the public finances of host countries by paying what we owe, in full and on time. Over the past decade, Chevron reported on our financial statements over $58 billion of income taxes and over $43 billion of non-income taxes, such as property taxes, severance taxes and payroll taxes.\n\nTo learn more, visit chevron.co/governance.\nlobbying\nwe\u2019re committed to transparency and disclosure of information\n\napproach to lobbying\n\nLobbying is an important way for Chevron to participate in the political process. In the United States, Chevron engages with executive and legislative branches of federal, state and local governments to provide perspective on energy issues affecting the nation and the world.\n\nChevron strives to maintain positive, constructive relationships with policymakers and their staffs. In our engagements, we talk about the economy, regulations, energy security, foreign policy, research and energy development. Chevron also works with trade associations to advocate for effective, responsible and nonpartisan standards, regulations and energy policies.\n\nupdated disclosures\n\nWe\u2019ve updated Chevron\u2019s lobbying and trade association webpage (chevron.co/lobbyingandtrade) to be responsive to stakeholders\u2019 increasing interest in how we engage with policymakers. The webpage outlines our political engagement strategies; our governance, policies, processes and training; our five-year history of corporate political and Chevron Employees Political Action Committee (CEPAC) contributions, including oversight of these activities by Chevron\u2019s Executive Committee, the Board\u2019s Public Policy and Sustainability Committee, and the CEPAC Board; and disclosure details. The webpage also includes links to all Chevron external reports representing the jurisdictions where we lobby and comprehensive trade association membership lists and disclosure of information, including semiannual updates of membership in U.S.-based organizations and lobbying expenditure ranges for each organization.\n\nemployee spotlight\n\nChevron\u2019s reputation, integrity and trustworthiness as a company are the main reasons I have continued my career here for 37 years. I have held various roles within Chevron, from operations to marketing. My background in cross-functional collaboration and business optimization and my childhood passion for politics inspired me to pursue my current role as a senior analyst for the Political Compliance team.\n\nTransparency and accountability are important aspects of corporate political activity. My colleagues and I are responsible for responding to increasing stakeholder interest in how we engage with policymakers. On our lobbying and trade association webpage, Chevron provides extensive disclosure of our processes, tools and systems, which is intended to promote integrity and reflect good governance. A recent example of our increasing transparency is the biannual publication of the range of lobbying expenditures attributed to Chevron\u2019s contributions to each U.S.-based trade association.\n\nFor the first time, Chevron was designated as a \u201cTrendsetter\u201d \u2013 the highest recognition \u2013 within the 2022 CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability. The index benchmarks U.S. companies in the S&P 500 and Russell 1000 for their disclosure and oversight of political spending.\n\nI am grateful to be part of the team responsible for that recognition and to be surrounded by colleagues and leaders who embody The Chevron Way values.\n**trade associations**\n\nChevron holds memberships in industry and other associations that provide expert perspectives on safety, business, technical and industry best practices and a broad range of issues. While Chevron does not control, and may not always agree with, positions taken by trade associations of which we are a member, trade associations provide a unique venue to engage other companies and industry experts.\n\n---\n\n**select climate-related engagement with trade associations**\n\n| Trade Association | Description |\n|-------------------|-------------|\n| **American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM)** | AFPM represents high-tech American manufacturers and midstream companies that enable the production and delivery of nearly all U.S. gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, home heating oil, critical petrochemicals and other refined products. Chevron engages with AFPM to encourage support of our climate principles and positions, such as an economywide carbon price and innovative breakthrough technologies. Our past engagements with AFPM helped create a Carbon Steering Committee in 2020. In addition, the engagements encouraged AFPM from historic opposition to carbon pricing to evaluating proposals on a case-by-case basis. |\n| **American Petroleum Institute (API)** | API represents all segments of the oil and gas industry in the U.S. Chevron engages with API to support the development of climate policies that advance market-based approaches and innovation to support the goals of the Paris Agreement. API supports economywide carbon pricing, World Trade Organization-compliant mechanisms to mitigate carbon leakage and well-designed performance-based methane regulations on new and existing sources. API also supports policies and laws advancing research, development and deployment of critical early-stage technologies, such as the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and specific provisions in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act related to clean hydrogen and carbon capture. |\n| **Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI)** | OGCI is a CEO-led initiative that is aiming to accelerate the oil and gas industry\u2019s response to climate change. Chevron joined OGCI in 2018 and pledged $100 million to the $1 billion+ OGCI Climate Investments fund, which invests in technologies to reduce GHG emissions within the oil and gas value chain. OGCI member companies support the aims of the Paris Agreement. OGCI engages in policy-supported activities and contributes to the conversation on climate change. Chevron and other members reduced the group\u2019s aggregate absolute upstream methane emissions by 40% and aggregate upstream carbon emissions (Scope 1) by 18% over the past five years. We also work closely with OGCI members to promote the development of carbon capture, utilization and storage industrial hubs. |\n| **U.S. Chamber of Commerce (U.S. Chamber)** | The U.S. Chamber develops and implements policy on major issues affecting U.S. businesses of all sizes across many sectors of the economy. Chevron works with the U.S. Chamber to encourage support for market-based approaches to climate policy, innovative breakthrough technologies and streamlined, efficient regulations. For example, the U.S. Chamber has long advocated for policies and laws providing for greater federal support of technology and innovation, such as the 2021 U.S. Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and specific provisions in the 2022 U.S. Inflation Reduction Act. Similarly, the U.S. Chamber\u2019s long-standing support for phasing down the use of hydrofluorocarbons, an especially potent greenhouse gas, helped secure bipartisan U.S. Senate ratification of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol in 2022. |\nclimate policy framework\n\nour overarching vision\nWe support policy that enables the realization of a lower carbon future at least cost to society.\n\nwe believe policymakers should\n\n- Ensure global engagement and action\n- Encourage investment in technology, research and innovation\n- Take a balanced and measured approach\n- Promote transparency and equity\n\nelements of well-designed policy\n\n- Include all sectors of the economy\n- Complement and reinforce rather than hinder market efficiency\n  - Utilize a price on carbon as the primary policy tool\n  - Enable linking with other markets\n- Recognize and account for negative emissions technologies and offsets\n- Support early-stage pre-commercial activity and research and development for breakthrough technologies\n\noversight\n\nChevron has both executive management and Board oversight of our lobbying and trade association activities. Chevron\u2019s Public Policy and Sustainability Committee (PPSC) of the Board is the Committee primarily responsible for assisting the Board in overseeing climate and lobbying policy and reporting, as well as Chevron\u2019s response to stockholder concerns regarding such activities. The Committee annually reviews the policies, procedures and expenditures related to the company\u2019s political contributions and lobbying to assess the value of these activities and alignment with Chevron\u2019s positions and interests, including those related to climate.\n\nAt the management level, oversight of climate policy and lobbying is done through the Global Issues Committee (GIC). Chevron\u2019s Corporate Officer responsible for climate change issues is a member of the GIC and serves as the secretary of the PPSC, enabling efficient sharing of information and guidance.\n\nTo learn more, visit chevron.co/governance.\nwe aim to protect personnel, facilities, information, systems, business operations and our reputation\n\nmanaging vulnerabilities\n\nA vulnerability is an exploitable weakness in a system or device. At Chevron, we seek to preemptively remove vulnerabilities before they have a chance to become a threat. We create automated threat intelligence feeds from security experts to increase vulnerability awareness, taking action to mitigate the highest risks. Our cyber risk organization schedules weekly meetings with business units to raise vulnerability risk awareness and keep diverse cybersecurity skill sets connected across the enterprise.\n\nEach day that goes by without patching a vulnerability leaves a system or device exposed and increases the risk of exploitation. For mobile devices, we enforce iOS upgrades while protecting communication channels, tailoring mobile security to enable business with little impact. We leverage market intelligence as well as internal and external expertise to monitor operating systems and third-party software. We complete security scanning of acquisitions, like Renewable Energy Group, Inc., before bringing them into our technology environment.\n\npreparing for cyber threats\n\nOur Business Continuity Planning Operational Excellence (OE) Process, a component of the enterprise OE Management System (OEMS), prepares Chevron to continue operations during an unplanned event or disruption, which aligns with our OE objective to prevent high-consequence security and cybersecurity incidents. To maintain continuity of critical business processes in the event a cybersecurity incident results in significant loss of IT systems, our Business Continuity Plans account for cyber conditions. We work to identify critical business processes and dependent IT applications and document the processes for continuing operations without IT systems. Cross-functional teams conduct regular multidisciplinary exercises to test and continually improve our plans. For example, in 2022, over 100 employees and senior leaders from varying disciplines and locations participated in an exercise to test and experience the impact of a large-scale outage.\n\nimplementing guardrails\n\nCybersecurity guardrails are high-level-technology, secure-by-design rules built into digital solutions. Their use at Chevron aligns with our imperative to \u201cSecure Our Digital Future.\u201d In 2022, we began updating our cybersecurity guardrails by migrating from a highly customized in-house technology environment to a more flexible cloud-based solution, Modern Desktop. It is largely an off-the-shelf software as a service solution that takes advantage of contemporary, standardized industry products with built-in security. This approach allows for better integrations, scalability within our organization, and collaboration with business partners and industry peers.\n\nprotecting personal data\n\nData privacy is a set of rules that promotes the processing of personal data in a way that protects individuals\u2019 rights and freedoms and that follows all applicable regulatory requirements. Chevron\u2019s comprehensive privacy program is central to the success of our overall information risk\n\nThe OEMS Security Focus Area expectations enable consistency and standardization across the enterprise. Security Management seeks to proactively identify security risks, develop personnel and sustainable programs to mitigate those risks and continually evaluate the effectiveness of these efforts.\nmanagement strategy. Sound privacy practices promote trust and integrity. We promote privacy by design and by default, which reduces privacy risks in systems, technologies, applications and business processes.\n\n**cultivating IT talent**\n\nChevron aims to be a destination for top IT talent by providing superior career opportunities. Our focus on cultivating IT talent includes recruitment and retention strategies that seek a diverse mix of employees by targeting experienced, university and intern talent. For example:\n\n- We actively recruit from seven historically Black colleges and universities, nine Hispanic-serving institutions, and several minority engineering and computer science organizations.\n- In 2022, we recruited from our Welcome Back Returnship Program, which supports and develops experienced professionals reentering the workforce following a career break. Several offers for IT positions were extended and accepted.\n- Our Neurodiversity Hiring Program, an intern-to-hire program targeting neurodiverse talent, was expanded in 2022 and seeks to fill more than 11 IT positions across the United States, Buenos Aires and Manila.\n\nOur Cyber Talent Management team has developed detailed training activities and career mapping to support recruitment and retention strategies. Competency development activities help build top-tier talent with the technical, professional and leadership skills required to meet enterprise business objectives.\n\n**executive women\u2019s forum**\n\nChevron supports the advancement of women into cybersecurity and cyber risk roles. We encourage participation in communities like the Executive Women\u2019s Forum (EWF), whose mission is to engage, develop and advance all women in the information security, IT risk management and privacy industries through education, leadership development and relationship building. We believe the EWF\u2019s cross-company mentoring and lessons sharing can benefit Chevron\u2019s members, who in turn can inspire and empower women in our workforce to achieve leadership positions in cybersecurity.\n\nOur career development maps cultivate engaged and motivated IT employees and provide opportunities to grow professionally and personally throughout their career. We are proud to note that three members of our Data Privacy team were selected as Fellows of Information Privacy by the International Association of Privacy Professionals. This designation will help support employee mentorship and keep Chevron aligned with software industry protocols and standards.\n\nTo learn more, visit [chevron.co/cybersecurity](http://chevron.co/cybersecurity).\nperformance\n\nwe increase transparency by reporting metrics and performance data annually\n\nPhoto: Albert Lea, Minnesota. A wind turbine at our renewable fuel facility reduced carbon electricity emissions by 94% between 2021 and 2022.\nChevron is working with peers, stakeholders and voluntary framework developers to foster increasingly consistent and comparable information for investors and other stakeholders.\n\nWe consider reporting guidelines, indicators and terminology in the frameworks of Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), the Sustainability Reporting Guidance for the Oil & Gas Industry (2020) by Ipieca, the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP) and the American Petroleum Institute (API), as well as other reporting frameworks, to determine which data to include in our tables.\n\nTo promote comparability, we map our reporting data to the relevant SASB and Ipieca frameworks to help provide information for investors and other stakeholders.

Variability in Enabled Reductions may occur due to Chevron's current practice of reporting offsets in the calendar year in which they were retired. See endnote 22 for more information on offsets.\n5 Unless otherwise noted, Scope 1 and Scope 2 data collected as of February 9, 2023. Data include estimates.\n6 Scope 1 includes direct emissions. For reporting, Chevron may include indirect sources of GHG emissions within Scope 1 that are outside of the traditional Scope 1 definition such as GHG emissions from processes like drilling and completions, and tolling agreements up to the point of third-party custody transfer of the oil or gas product. Direct GHG emissions related to production of energy in the form of electricity or steam exported or sold to a third party are included in the reported Scope 1 emissions to align with Ipeca\u2019s Sustainability Reporting Guidance for the Oil & Gas Industry (2020). Chevron\u2019s Scope 1 includes emissions of six Kyoto GHGs \u2013 carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), methane (CH\u2084), nitrous oxide (N\u2082O), sulfur hexafluoride, perfluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons, as well as nitrogen trifluoride (NF\u2083).\n7 Calculation methods for Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions are based on the American Petroleum Institute\u2019s Compendium of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Methodologies for the Oil and Natural Gas Industry (2021) or, where relevant, local regulatory reporting methodologies.\n8 When a nonoperated joint venture (NOJV) provides consolidated emissions data, Chevron seeks to allocate its equity share of those emissions to the most representative scope and GHG based on best available knowledge of the NOJV\u2019s operations.\n9 Consistent with our financial accounting, Venezuela NOJV emissions are not included for 2022 emissions reporting.\n10 We provide methane emissions data and intensity performance as a mass of methane as well as its conversion under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) 100-year global warming potential (GWP) to a CO\u2082e. Although we strive to provide consistent data from our operated and nonoperated assets, some nonoperated assets may provide their data only on a CO\u2082e basis. Given the common industry practice of using the AR4 100-year GWP, we have assumed that nonoperated assets that did not provide methane mass data use a 100-year GWP of 25. We continue to work with our joint-venture partners to provide information on a standardized basis to increase transparency.\n11 Where flaring emissions are calculated based on mass or reported in aggregate, volumes are not included.\n12 Downstream includes emissions from refineries, terminals, marketing and distribution, including renewable fuels. Chemical and base oil facilities located within refineries are included in refinery emissions.\n13 Chemicals includes emissions from stand-alone chemical, additive and lubricant facilities.\n14 Chevron Phillips Chemical Company (CPChem.com) LLC data received April 4, 2023.\n15 Other emissions include GHG emissions from Corporate Aviation, Chevron Environmental Management and Real Estate Company, energy management and power from Chevron Pipeline and Power, and the North American Data Center.\n16 Exported emissions are direct GHG emissions related to production of energy in the form of electricity or steam that are exported or sold to a third party. Direct GHG emissions related to production of energy in the form of electricity or steam exported or sold to a third party are included in the reported Scope 1 emissions for each segment.\n17 Scope 2 includes indirect emissions from imported electricity and steam. CO\u2082, CH\u2084, and N\u2082O are accounted for in Chevron\u2019s Scope 2 emissions. Scope 2 emissions are accounted for using the market-based approach as described in the World Resources Institute\u2019s GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance (2015), including calculating Scope 2 emissions net of contractual instruments such as renewable energy credits (RECs).\n18 Chevron calculates emissions from third-party use of sold products in alignment with methods in Category 11 of Ipeca\u2019s Estimating Petroleum Industry Value Chain (Scope 3) Greenhouse Gas Emissions (2016). Emissions are based on aggregate production, throughput and sales numbers that include renewable fuels.\n19 For assurance statements, visit chevron.co/GHGassurance-library. Figures in assurance statements may vary from figures reported in each subsequent Corporate Sustainability Report due to restatements and assurance scope. 2022 assurance excludes Renewable Energy Group, Inc. and Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, LLC data.\n20 Carbon capture, utilization and storage includes both CO\u2082 sold to third parties and CO\u2082 (and other gas) injected for carbon storage.\n21 RECs are credits generated from renewable electricity generation within the United States that are retired by Chevron. Reported Scope 2 emissions are net of contractual instruments such as RECs.\n22 Offsets are credits generated from the avoidance or reduction of GHG emissions or the removal of GHGs from the atmosphere that are retired by Chevron, excluding RECs. Includes offsets retired in compliance programs. For programs with multiyear compliance periods, offsets are reported in the calendar year they are retired.\n23 Total Energy Consumption includes energy generated from Chevron\u2019s operations and imported energy. Exported energy is not subtracted from the total.\n24 Manufacturing Energy Index (MEI) (Refining) is an analysis of Chevron\u2019s refining energy performance based on the Solomon Energy Intensity Index methodology. Chevron\u2019s MEI includes the refining assets at Chevron\u2019s operated and nonoperated joint-venture refineries. Energy Consumption from Renewable Energy Group, Inc. is not included in this metric.\n25 2022 Upstream Energy Intensity reflects continued updates to Chevron\u2019s calculation methodology.\n26 Pipeline Energy Intensity covers assets operated by Chevron Pipe Line Company.\n27 Chevron\u2019s Non-Manufacturing Energy Index includes operations from Chevron\u2019s chemicals and additives, products and services, and lubricants businesses. It reflects the energy required to produce Chevron\u2019s products compared with the energy that would have been required to produce the same products in 1992 (the index\u2019s base year). Energy Consumption from Renewable Energy Group, Inc. is not included in this metric.\n28 For compiling and reporting air emissions data, Chevron follows regulatory definitions of VOC. SO\u2082 emissions include SO\u2082 and SO\u2082, reported as SO\u2082-equivalent. NOx emissions include NO and NOx (reported as NO\u2082-equivalent) and exclude N\u2082O.\n29 Emissions decreased in 2022 relative to 2021 due to divestments, concession returns, operatorship transfers, and sour gas flaring reductions resulting from improved reliability and decreased well development.\n30 Renewable Energy Group, Inc. data are not included in water management or wastewater metrics.\n31 Fresh water withdrawn from the environment is defined per local legal definitions. If no local definition exists, fresh water is defined as water extracted, directly or indirectly, from surface water, groundwater or rainwater that has a total dissolved solids concentration of less than or equal to 2,000 mg/L. Fresh water withdrawn does not include effluent or recycled/reclaimed water from municipal or other industrial wastewater treatment systems, as this water is reported under nonfresh water withdrawn. Nonfresh water withdrawn could include: seawater; brackish groundwater or surface water; reclaimed wastewater from another municipal or industrial facility; desalinated water; or remediated groundwater used for industrial purposes. Produced water is excluded from fresh water withdrawn, fresh water consumed and nonfresh water withdrawn. Water quantities may be determined using direct measurement techniques or engineering estimation methods.\nRefining includes data from refineries, including chemical and base oil facilities located within refineries.\n\nOther includes, but is not limited to, chemical and lubricant facilities, as well as Chevron Environmental Management and Real Estate Company.\n\nChevron calculates fresh water withdrawn intensity for upstream using gross operated production.\n\nChevron calculates fresh water withdrawn intensity for refining using total refinery inputs, which comprise all feeds into the refinery. This includes purchased crudes for crude units and third-party feeds for other processing units.\n\nChevron reports fresh water withdrawn and consumed in water-stressed regions according to the World Resources Institute\u2019s definition and categorization of \u201cbaseline water stress.\u201d Baseline water stress measures the ratio of total water withdrawals to available renewable surface and groundwater supplies. Water withdrawals include domestic, industrial, irrigation and livestock consumptive and nonconsumptive uses. Available renewable water supplies include the impact of upstream consumptive water users and large dams on downstream water availability. Higher values indicate more competition among users.\n\nChevron\u2019s fresh water withdrawn and consumed in high and extremely high water stress areas excludes Chevron\u2019s Fuels and Lubricants businesses and Chevron Environmental Management Company. Freshwater withdrawals for the Fuels and Lubricants businesses and Chevron Environmental Management Company are minimal (1% of the total) compared with the overall use in the corporation. For purposes of this reporting, Chevron categorizes all of the water withdrawn and consumed by Chevron\u2019s Mid-Continent business unit as being in a high-stress or extremely high-stress region.\n\nFreshwater use in water-stressed areas increased in 2022 due to completion activity increases.\n\nOil concentration is determined by the sampling of effluent streams, using methods required or recommended by regulatory agencies or authorities, where applicable. Chevron reports the total cumulative amount of oil discharged to surface water excluding spills, which are reported separately.\n\nChevron reports petroleum spills to land and water to conform to the 2020 Ipieca Reporting Guidance. Spills to land and water that are greater than or equal to one barrel are included. Spills to secondary containment, chemical spills and spills due to sabotage are excluded. Renewable Energy Group, Inc. data are not included in accidental release prevention and response metrics.\n\nTo conform to 2015 and 2020 Ipieca Reporting Guidance, and where appropriate information and data exist, our hazardous waste numbers starting in 2015 exclude remediation waste generated, disposed of, and recycled, reused or recovered. Hazardous waste amounts are quantified using methods required or recommended by regulatory agencies or authorities, where applicable. In other instances, similar methods are used, including direct measurement onsite or at the point of shipping, engineering estimates and process knowledge. Chevron follows the regulatory definitions of hazardous waste applicable to the jurisdictions in which we operate, including de minimis specifications (below which hazardous waste quantities do not need to be reported). Renewable Energy Group, Inc. data are not included in waste metrics.\n\nThe 2022 data are based on information received from government entities and recorded internally as of March 10, 2023. Renewable Energy Group, Inc. data are not included in fines and settlements metrics.\n\nDiversity percentages have been rounded to the nearest whole number. Data for each year are measured in December. We do not have sufficient information on gender identities other than men/women to meet data thresholds for reporting. Our most recently filed Federal Employer Information Report EEO-1 is available for download at chevron.com/eeo-1. EEO-1/EEOC counts differ slightly from those in the Global Employee Diversity table due to differences in methodologies. These data may not include a small number of employees from recent acquisitions.\nportfolio carbon intensity\ngrams CO\u2082e/megajoule\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sum_i ((\\text{GHG intensity})_i \\times (\\text{Energy})_i) - \\sum_j (\\text{Net GHG removals})_j}{\\sum_i (\\text{Energy})_i}\n\\]\n\nWhere: (GHG intensity)_i is the simplified value chain GHG intensity of marketed product_i, (Net GHG removals)_j is the net volume of GHG emissions stored, or offset, and (Energy)_i is the energy of the marketed product_i.\n\nportfolio carbon intensity methodology note\n\nIntroduction: The portfolio carbon intensity (PCI) methodology is designed to facilitate carbon intensity accounting of a company\u2019s portfolio. It uses a representative value chain that includes emissions associated with bringing products to market, including the Scope 3 emissions from their use. The PCI methodology facilitates transparency in calculations and data with information taken from financial statements and emissions disclosures. This approach enables comparison of companies that may participate in different parts of the value chain and the use of real data.\n\nIntent: The PCI methodology provides a framework for transparent and consistent comparisons of the mix of energy products provided by a company, inclusive of elements of Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. The methodology is broadly applicable to oil and gas companies involved in exploration and production, refining, or marketing activities.\n\nPCI definition: Estimated energy-weighted average GHG emissions intensity from a simplified value chain from the production, refinement, distribution and end use of marketed energy products per unit of energy delivered.\n\nUnits: Grams of carbon dioxide-equivalent GHG emissions per megajoule of energy delivered (g CO\u2082e/MJ) on a higher-heating-value basis to align with prior frameworks on gas value chain emissions and with heating values commonly used in commercial contracts.\u2020\n\nScope: The PCI is calculated on an annual basis as the weighted-average GHG intensity of energy delivered across gas, natural gas liquid (NGL), oil, biofuel, hydrogen and lower carbon power products. Carbon removals are deducted from total lifecycle emissions estimates.\n\n\u2020 Several prior product-intensity frameworks have used lower heating value for intensity calculations.\n\nThe following energy products (i) are included in the PCI methodology:\n\n- **Gas**: piped gas, LNG and third party-traded volumes\n- **Natural gas liquids**: NGLs from upstream, refining and third party-traded volumes\n- **Oil**: crude oil, refined products (gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, fuel oil and other petroleum products) and third party-traded volumes\n- **Biofuels**: ethanol, renewable diesel, biodiesel, sustainable aviation fuel and renewable natural gas\n- **Hydrogen**: gray hydrogen, blue hydrogen and green hydrogen that are externally marketed\n- **Lower carbon power**: external sales of wind, solar and geothermal power\n\nThe following removals (j) are included in the PCI methodology calculation:\n\n- **Carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS)** removes CO\u2082 either directly from the atmosphere or from streams that would be released to the atmosphere. It does not include CO\u2082 produced from naturally occurring reservoirs that is used for enhanced oil recovery.\n- **High-integrity offsets** include nature-based solutions.\n\nFor traditional hydrocarbon products (gas, NGL and oil), marketed volumes are based on the business segment (production, refined products or marketing) with the largest overall commodity volume, inclusive of all traded volumes.\n\nChemicals and other business lines that do not primarily supply energy products are excluded from this calculation.\nmethodology and data sources\n\nTraditional hydrocarbon products: The intent of the framework is to capture value chain emissions associated with the maximum hydrocarbon product volume for a company among its production, refining and marketing activities. For all products that a company produces or refines, the PCI methodology uses the company\u2019s equity GHG emissions and corresponding GHG intensity. To estimate the emissions for marketed products that the company does not produce or refine, the PCI methodology uses industry-average segment factors from the International Energy Agency\u2019s World Energy Outlook. Hydrocarbon transportation emissions are estimated in the PCI using IEA World Energy Outlook estimates for transportation emissions from oil and gas. Emissions associated with end use of marketed products are based on industry-standard combustion factors and assume all sold energy products are combusted, although this is not the case (e.g., plastics and lubricants). The graphic below is a depiction of the value chain approach for the refined-product value chain.\n\nBiofuels, hydrogen and lower carbon power: GHG emissions are calculated based on third-party lifecycle assessments and the energy provided by Chevron in the most recent year. Lifecycle assessment data sources include California Air Resources Board (CARB) Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) Pathway Certified Carbon Intensities for similar feedstocks and pathways, a Hydrogen Council report on a lifecycle assessment for hydrogen pathways, and harmonized lifecycle assessments of electricity generation from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working Group 1.\n\nThe model does not adjust for the energy efficiency gains associated with some applications of electricity and hydrogen relative to existing hydrocarbon infrastructure. For example, CARB estimates that energy provided as electricity to an electric vehicle is 3.4 times more efficient than energy provided by gasoline to an internal combustion engine. Model updates could be made in the future, if supported by the end use of electricity or hydrogen products.\n\nInputs are collected from financial disclosures and public GHG reporting, with the exception of the biofuels component. Biofuel volumes are based on purchase data for ethanol, renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel, and biodiesel and production volumes for renewable natural gas in the United States, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Australia. Volumes from international GS Caltex operations in South Korea are assumed to be zero. For 2016\u20132022, aggregate biofuel volumes used in the PCI calculation are 60,000, 61,000, 62,000, 68,000, 61,000, 70,000 and 105,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day, respectively. Biofuel carbon intensity values are based on CARB LCFS default pathway values. For 2016\u20132022, the weighted-average biofuel carbon intensity values used in the PCI calculation were 52, 52, 51, 50, 48, 47 and 38 grams carbon dioxide-equivalent GHG emissions per megajoule, respectively.\n\nCCUS: Net GHG removal emissions associated with CCUS represent the volume of emissions that would be permanently sequestered underground or utilized in other products with a deduction for supply chain emissions associated with capture, transport or storage. CCUS projects that reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions would reduce the production, refining or other sectoral intensity and would not be double-counted as removals; for example, CO\u2082 captured by an integrated CCS plant would already be accounted for in the facility\u2019s Scope 1 emissions intensity.\n\nOffsets: Offsets that are retired by the company or on behalf of customers for use of product provided by the company are deducted from the total emissions in the metric.\n\nImprovements over time: Methodologies and emissions factors may be updated in future years to reflect additional information or data that become available. For example, updates may include updated industry averages, primary data from third-party producers/refiners and adjustments to energy efficiency assumptions, if warranted, based on the end-use applications for volumes of energy marketed by the company.\n\nthe graphic below depicts the PCI approach for the refined-product value chain\n\n| activity | production | transportation | refining | transportation | end use |\n|----------|------------|----------------|----------|----------------|--------|\n| % of total | 10% | <1% | 15% | <1% | 75% |\n\nPercentages shown are based on data from IEA, World Energy Outlook 2018, November 2018, [iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2018](http://iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2018).\nupstream carbon intensity\nkilograms CO\u2082e/boe\n\nupstream oil intensity\n\n\\[\n\\text{Net production of liquids} = \\left( \\text{Direct emissions (Scope 1)} + \\text{Indirect emissions associated with imported electricity and steam (Scope 2)} - \\text{Emissions associated with exported electricity and steam} \\right)\n\\]\n\nupstream gas intensity\n\n\\[\n\\text{Net production of gas (including LNG and GTL)} = \\left( \\text{Direct emissions (Scope 1)} + \\text{Indirect emissions associated with imported electricity and steam (Scope 2)} - \\text{Emissions associated with exported electricity and steam} \\right)\n\\]\n\nupstream flaring intensity\n\n\\[\n\\text{Direct flaring emissions as CO\u2082e (Scope 1)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Net production of gas and liquids (including LNG and GTL)}\n\\]\n\nupstream methane intensity\n\n\\[\n\\text{Direct methane emissions as CO\u2082e (Scope 1)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Net production of gas and liquids (including LNG and GTL)}\n\\]\n\nEmissions reported are net (Scope 1 and 2). The emissions included in the metrics generally represent Chevron\u2019s equity share of emissions from upstream, including LNG, which are emissions from operated and nonoperated joint-venture assets based on Chevron\u2019s financial interest. For reporting, Chevron may include indirect sources of GHG emissions within Scope 1 that are outside of the traditional Scope 1 definition, such as GHG emissions from processes like drilling and completions, and tolling agreements up to the point of third-party custody transfer of the oil or gas product. For oil and gas production intensity metrics, production is aligned with net production values reported in the Chevron Corporation Supplement to the Annual Report, which represent the company\u2019s equity share of total production after deducting both royalties paid to landowners and a government\u2019s agreed-upon share of production under a Production Sharing Agreement. Chevron\u2019s equity-share emissions include emissions associated with these excluded royalty barrels in accordance with the Ipieca Guidance. Also in accordance with the Ipieca Guidance, Chevron\u2019s equity-share emissions do not include emissions associated with royalty payments received by the company. Allocation of emissions between oil and gas is based on the fraction of production represented by liquids or gas. Flaring and methane intensities use the total of liquids and gas production. Oil and gas production intensities use liquids production and natural gas production, respectively.\nrefining carbon intensity\nkilograms CO\u2082e/boe\n\n\\[\n\\text{Refinery direct GHG emissions (Scope 1)} + \\text{Refinery indirect GHG emissions associated with imported electricity and steam (Scope 2)} + \\text{Third-party processing emissions associated with imported feedstocks* (a type of Scope 3)} - \\text{Emissions associated with exported electricity and steam (a type of Scope 3)}\n\\]\n\nCrude + Other feedstocks, including bio-based feedstocks\n\nThe refining carbon intensity (RCI) metric provides a measure of GHG released during the transformation of raw materials into refined products.\n\nThe RCI is throughput-based and includes GHG emissions from Chevron\u2019s own refining operations and estimates of emissions associated with third-party processing of imported feedstocks such as hydrogen.\u2020\n\nThe metric is on an equity basis.\n\nenabled reductions\nmillion tonnes CO\u2082e/year\n\n\\[\n\\sum_i [(\\text{GHG intensity}_{\\text{fossil fuel}} - \\text{GHG intensity}_i) \\cdot (\\text{Energy}_i)] + \\sum_j (\\text{Net GHG removals}_j)\n\\]\n\nWhere: (GHG Intensity)_{fossil fuel} is the average intensity of displaced fossil fuel that is calculated in the PCI methodology, (GHG intensity)_i is the simplified lifecycle GHG intensity of energy product_i, (Energy)_i is the energy of the marketed low-carbon product, (e.g., biofuels, hydrogen), and (Net GHG removals)_j is the net volume of GHG emissions stored.\n\nenabled emissions reductions methodology note\n\nEnabled emissions reductions are the estimated avoided emissions relative to fossil fuel use primarily associated with biofuels, hydrogen, CCUS and offsets that the company has marketed in the most recent calendar year, regardless of whether the company retained rights to the emissions reduction attributes.\n\nOver time, new energy products may be added to the calculation, along with associated volume information. Avoided emissions associated with natural gas-fired power generation via co-generation or coal-fired power generation displacement are excluded from this calculation for purposes of simplicity.\n\nFor biofuels and hydrogen products, the enabled emissions reductions are calculated based on the lifecycle GHG savings relative to the same amount of energy provided by diesel fuel. Where appropriate, energy efficiency factors are used to calculate the volumes of displaced fossil fuels. More details on emissions factors and calculation assumptions are available in the PCI methodology note (see pages 75\u201376).\n\nNet GHG removal emissions associated with CCUS and offsets represent the volume of emissions that would be sequestered or utilized in other products. GHG emissions associated with CCUS or offset value chains would be netted from the reductions associated with the activity.\nNet positive impact Defined by Ipieca as a target for project outcomes in which the impacts on biodiversity (i.e., the variety of ecosystems and living things) caused by the project are outweighed by the actions taken to avoid and reduce such impacts, rehabilitate affected species/landscapes and offset any residual impacts.\n\nNet zero upstream aspiration (Scope 1 and 2) Chevron aspires to reach net zero upstream emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 2050. Accomplishing this aspiration depends on continuing progress on commercially viable technology, government policy, successful negotiations for carbon capture and storage and nature-based projects, availability of cost-effective, verifiable offsets in the global market, and granting of necessary permits by governing authorities.\n\nPortfolio carbon intensity (PCI) represents the estimated energy weighted-average greenhouse gas emissions intensity from a simplified value chain from the production, refinement, distribution and end use of marketed energy products per unit of energy delivered.\n\ndefinition of selected energy terms\n\nBarrels of oil-equivalent (boe) A unit of measure to quantify crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas amounts using the same basis.

Chevron believes the use of blue and green hydrogen as a fuel source can help reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions entering the atmosphere. While gray hydrogen is viewed as not directly supporting decarbonization of the energy sector, Chevron believes that early-use cases of gray hydrogen can provide key opportunities to de-risk technology, enable development of supporting infrastructure, including fueling stations, and contribute to learning.\n\nLiquefied natural gas (LNG) Natural gas that is liquefied under extremely cold temperatures to facilitate storage or transportation in specially designed vessels.\n\nLower carbon energy includes a variety of existing and emerging energy solutions and services, including traditional energy sources linked with renewables or abatement technologies or measures, carbon capture and sequestration, offsets, blue and green hydrogen, geothermal and nuclear.\n\nLower carbon intensity oil, products and natural gas includes oil, natural gas and hydrocarbon-based products that are produced and sold to customers with a carbon intensity below that of traditional oil, natural gas and hydrocarbon-based products.\n\nNature-based solutions, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), include afforestation and reforestation. These involve the repurposing of land use by growing forests where there was none before (afforestation) or reestablishing a forest where there was one in the past (reforestation). Other nature-based solutions include restoration of coastal and marine habitats to ensure they continue to draw CO\u2082 from the air.\n\nNet positive impact Defined by Ipieca as a target for project outcomes in which the impacts on biodiversity (i.e., the variety of ecosystems and living things) caused by the project are outweighed by the actions taken to avoid and reduce such impacts, rehabilitate affected species/landscapes and offset any residual impacts.\n\nNet zero upstream aspiration (Scope 1 and 2) Chevron aspires to reach net zero upstream emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 2050.
