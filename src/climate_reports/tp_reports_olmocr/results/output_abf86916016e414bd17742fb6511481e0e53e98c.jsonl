At Abbott, we\u2019re strengthening the resilience of our company so we can continue to shape the future of healthcare \u2014 to help more people live better, healthier lives.\n\nIn this report, we detail our progress against the goals of our 2030 Sustainability Plan. The data presented reflects 2022 performance unless otherwise stated.\n\nWe have aligned our reporting with the requirements of leading environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings and sustainability indices (available in the Appendix), seeking stakeholder feedback to drive continuous improvement.\n\nOn the cover: In 2021, Abbott established an ongoing partnership with Real Madrid and the Real Madrid Foundation, working together to educate, support, nourish, and develop kids around the world across all geographies, cultures, and backgrounds. In July 2022, we hosted a youth soccer clinic in Stockton, California, reinforcing the importance of regular exercise as part of a healthy life.\nDEAR ABBOTT STAKEHOLDER\n\nThis is Abbott\u2019s 135th anniversary year, which speaks to our relationship to sustainability. We understand, and deeply value, the stewardship mentality and commitment needed to support resilience and thriving for the long term.\n\nThat history, and the culture that has made it possible, were critical to Abbott\u2019s successful navigation of the global environment over the three years of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our company was built for moments like this one. The result of our long experience and deep expertise was the rapid creation of 12 different COVID-19 diagnostic tests to help the world meet its most severe health challenge in a century.\n\nWhile COVID-19 is moving to the endemic level, it leaves us a health agenda for the future. The pandemic forcefully demonstrated the long-standing challenges in our global health systems. Disparities in access to care widened dramatically and undeniably, underscoring the need for action to close these gaps.\n\nAddressing this need is the primary focus of Abbott\u2019s 2030 Sustainability Plan, which we created before COVID-19 highlighted it so vividly. While Abbott is advancing its performance across the ESG spectrum, we recognize that our greatest opportunity to impact the world\u2019s future lies in improving the health of the greatest number of people.\n\nTo do so, we\u2019re very consciously innovating for access and affordability. We\u2019ve implemented Design Principles to make our new products and technologies easier to use and available to more of the people who need them in more places around the world. This is how we intend to meet our ambitious goal of helping 3 billion people annually by 2030, an increase of 50% over the course of our Plan.\n\nOur aim is not just to serve more people, but to do so better than ever before. Our Abbott Customer Pledge commits us to \u201cmake our products and services as if they\u2019re for our own families.\u201d Abbott people take that obligation seriously and personally.\n\nAt Abbott, we carry our purpose of helping people live fuller lives through better health into our efforts to aid communities in need around the world, for example:\n\n- For more than two decades, we\u2019ve partnered with the government of Tanzania to strengthen the country\u2019s healthcare system.\n- Our Future Well Communities program works with partners in Stockton, California to remove barriers that prevent people with diabetes from living healthy lives.\n- And we\u2019ve provided almost $16 million in aid to people impacted by the war in Ukraine.\n\nIt\u2019s this belief in our purpose that keeps our company strong and growing through generations of success. We\u2019re inspired by our vision of a better, healthier future, and determined to keep Abbott at the forefront of healthcare for the next 135 years.\n\nThank you for your support of our work.\n\nRobert B.

Our 2030 goals guide the delivery and democratization of these life-changing technologies and products.\n\n| 2030 GOAL | PROGRESS AND NOTES |\n|-----------|--------------------|\n| Make access and affordability core to new product innovation | \u2022 More than 2 billion lives improved* due to Abbott\u2019s products and services.  \n\u2022 Integrated our Innovate for Access and Affordability Design Principles into our R&D processes across all businesses, evolving the way we develop and bring technologies to people who need them.  \n\u2022 Introduced the FreeStyle Libre 3 system in the United States, the most accurate 14-day continuous glucose monitor. Designed for access and affordability, the FreeStyle Libre 3 system will be available at the same price as previous versions, which is about one-third the cost of other competing continuous glucose monitoring systems available today.  \n\u2022 Launched an improved version of our NeuroSphere myPath digital health app, helping doctors more easily access data and improve their patients\u2019 response to therapy.  \n\u2022 The FDA approved the Eterna spinal cord stimulation system, the smallest implantable, rechargeable spinal cord stimulator currently available for the treatment of chronic pain. Eterna can be recharged less than five times a year under normal use, making it the lowest recharge burden platform available.  \n\u2022 The FDA approved an expanded indication for the CardioMEMS HF System, meaning that an additional 1.2 million U.S. patients who have earlier-stage heart failure have the potential to use advanced monitoring with the CardioMEMS sensor, which provides an early warning system for worsening heart failure. |\n\n*Total number of lives improved was adjusted for indirect overlap between businesses using a binomial probability model, and only adjusted for direct overlap within a business where data is currently available to support the adjustment.\nINNOVATE FOR ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY (CONTINUED)\n\n2030 GOAL\n\nTransform care for chronic disease, malnutrition, and infectious diseases\n\nSupport global efforts to address noncommunicable diseases, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n\n- Innovate to transform the standard of care for diabetes and support efforts to bend the diabetes curve through innovative technology, prevention and education, early diagnosis, treatment, and nutrition.\n- Deliver breakthrough technologies, improve clinical outcomes, and impact the lives of people with or at risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nPROGRESS AND NOTES\n\n- Announced our collaboration with WeightWatchers (WW International Inc.) through which we\u2019ll work together to allow our FreeStyle Libre continuous glucose monitoring systems and the WeightWatchers mobile app to share information so that people living with diabetes can see their glucose data alongside WeightWatchers\u2019 diabetes-tailored program.\n- Delivered the Future Well Kids program to more than 2,000 students across five countries. Performed 310 in-person/virtual visits to 73 classrooms and offered a virtual field trip.\n- Partnered with University of the Pacific to develop a sub-specialization in diabetes management within their social work and nursing schools, and provided scholarships for those students committed to working in Stockton, California, post-graduation.\n- Sponsored a pilot initiative designed by the American Diabetes Association with the goal of reducing health inequities and barriers to tools and technology for diabetes management regardless of income level or insurance status.\n- Established the Center for Malnutrition Solutions, a global partnership that focuses on addressing global malnutrition through gathering real-world evidence and applying sustainable, resilient models that address local needs and work to improve access to care.\n\nDeliver scalable, integrated solutions to help reduce preventable deaths and infectious diseases (malaria, hepatitis B/C, HIV, COVID-19, and others) with diagnostics, treatment, and education programs, especially in high-prevalence areas.\n\n- Received regulatory approvals for Panbio HIV SELF TEST in 14 countries. Rapid self-tests enable fast, private, convenient, and accurate testing, enabling people to start treatment earlier. HIV self-testing increases patient autonomy, combats stigma, and can help increase overall testing for HIV.\n- The Abbott Pandemic Defense Coalition, a global network dedicated to identifying emerging viral threats to help prevent future pandemics, expanded its geographic footprint with six new sites: two in the U.S., plus Egypt, Pakistan, Peru, and Sierra Leone. We also contributed to SARS-CoV-2 surveillance, mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) prototype test development, hepatitis biomarker research, national serosurveys, and hepatitis elimination studies.

Available in Europe since 2020, and cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2022 for use by people four years and older living with diabetes, this innovative technology enables people to:\n\n\u2022 Manage their health in real time \u2014 the sensor automatically sends minute-by-minute glucose readings directly to a person\u2019s smartphone\n\u2022 Connect to the FreeStyle Libre digital ecosystem for remote monitoring\n\u2022 Set up alerts for serious medical events\n\nThe system is available at the same price as previous generations \u2014 but at one-third the cost of other CGM systems available today.\n\nFreeStyle Libre 3 is a smaller and more discreet sensor with a one-piece applicator. It uses 40% less plastic and requires 43% less carton paper than previous FreeStyle Libre systems.\nViruses never stop \u2014 and neither can we. From Omicron variant surges to mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) cases and high rates of RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), the power of viruses and their ability to disrupt our world is evident. That\u2019s why the Abbott Pandemic Defense Coalition (APDC) was established in 2021 \u2014 to stop viruses before they stop us. The coalition, which builds on Abbott\u2019s decades-long viral surveillance efforts, is a first-of-its-kind, industry-led partnership that includes 20 scientific and public health organizations on five different continents to identify, track, and respond to known and emerging viral threats to help prevent the next pandemic.\n\nDuring 2022, representatives from the coalition were invited to the White House to discuss the issue of mpox and how Abbott could help expedite test production to monitor the spread. We received FDA emergency authorization for mpox tests in the U.S. in October 2022, making Abbott the first company with an authorized test against the pathogen.\n\nAPDC partners Karl Guadens, Ph.D., of the One Health Genomic Lab Universidad Nacional de Colombia (left) and Jorge Osorio, DVM, Ph.D., of the University of Wisconsin-Madison (right) checking a mosquito trap as part of a study examining the ways viruses move from animals to people.\nINCREASING REPRESENTATION IN CLINICAL TRIALS\n\nGOAL\nInnovate for access and affordability: Advance health equity through partnership\n\nPeople from diverse racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds are disproportionately impacted by some chronic conditions but are underrepresented in clinical trials. This impedes access to life-changing and life-saving treatments, and limits insights into group responses to new therapies.\n\nIn 2022, we established a Diversity in Research Office to help standardize our approach to ensuring diverse representation in our own clinical trials when we can.\n\nWe also partnered with Norton Healthcare to develop clinical research infrastructure models for underserved communities. And to increase representation and support diverse clinical trialists, we are expanding training for diverse physicians and trial leaders by partnering with Women as One to deliver skills training to female cardiologists. Approximately 40 doctors have participated in the organization\u2019s CLIMB training program.\n\nIn 2021, we committed $5 million in scholarships to HBCUs and minority nursing schools. In 2022, we awarded over 50 scholarships.\n\nMore information on how we\u2019re advancing health equity can be found on page 32.\nADVANCING DIVERSE CYBERSECURITY TALENT\n\nGOAL\nSustainability in everything we do: Build the diverse, innovative workforce of tomorrow\n\nSkilled cybersecurity workers are critical to ensuring the security of our enterprise, as well as that of the products and technologies we provide to help people live better, healthier lives. At Abbott, we understand that cybersecurity professionals need to represent a wide swath of the population to adequately address the challenges facing the field; that\u2019s why we joined the HBCU Cybersecurity Industry Collaboration Initiative Pilot, a partnership between Abbott, Raytheon, Microsoft, and four HBCUs designed to advance cybersecurity curricula and the development of diverse talent for growing industry demand.\n\nThis pilot program represents just one part of the wider AMIE mission\u2014a nonprofit coalition of corporations, government agencies, and 15 HBCU schools of engineering of which Abbott is a founding member. Following a successful launch with four HBCUs, Abbott will continue supporting the initiative as it expands to the others.\n\nMore information on how Abbott is creating a pipeline of more diverse talent within research can be found on page 43.\nSTRENGTHENING CONNECTED-CARE TECHNOLOGIES\n\nGOAL\nSustainability in everything we do: Responsibly connect data, technology, and care\n\nConnected technologies are key to enabling continuous monitoring capabilities, remote control of healthcare solutions, and improved health outcomes. For patients living in remote areas, these technologies can also greatly increase access to care while reducing their carbon footprint by eliminating the need to travel to receive treatments.\n\nIn 2022, Abbott launched the next generation of our NeuroSphere myPath digital health app to improve communication between patients and their doctors as they trial Abbott neurostimulation devices.\n\nThis enhanced functionality creates a virtual environment for patients to share responses to chronic pain treatment with their doctors \u2014 specifically spinal cord stimulation and dorsal root ganglion therapy devices. NeuroSphere myPath puts people back in control of their health, bringing greater visibility to progress and pain-relief response.\n\nFind out more about how we are using data and technology to advance healthcare solutions on page 34.\nIn 2022, we announced a collaboration with LISC, a nonprofit committed to connecting under-invested people and places to private resources. Starting in 2022, we pledged $37.5 million in investments for diverse small business in the U.S., splitting funding across growth capital grants, business loans, and technical assistance.\n\nTo date, we have engaged with over 370 businesses through the initiative and have invested $2.4 million in growth capital and loans to diverse businesses. In addition, LISC\u2019s efforts have translated into 20 jobs created and 57 jobs retained for people in under-resourced communities.\n\nOur funds have made it possible for LISC to support TDG Scientific \u2014 a Black-, woman-owned business supplying laboratory equipment, chemicals, personal protective equipment (PPE), and other items to the corporate and government sectors. Through a $100,000 LISC working capital loan and $140,000 growth capital investment, TDG is able to invest in its IT infrastructure to achieve full integration across various management systems. This funding will enable TDG to double the size of its bid department and pursue significantly more contracts.\n\nRead more about how we\u2019re working to strengthen our supply chain on page 75.\nPart of optimizing our packaging is finding ways to do more with less material. In 2022, we initiated a total package redesign to reduce package weight and materials, as well as improve transport efficiency.\n\nAbbott\u2019s Rapid Diagnostics business launched the BinaxNOW home-use COVID-19 test kit under extraordinary circumstances in December 2020. Its packaging has since been optimized and is now up to 27% smaller and 58% lighter.\n\nThe team achieved this by:\n- Consolidating two information sheets into one\n- Eliminating a high-impact polystyrene tray\n- Resizing the paperboard carton and corrugated case\n\nWith more than 497 million BinaxNOW tests manufactured in 2022, these changes eliminated approximately 26.7 million pounds of packaging,* including more than 9.8 million pounds of plastic.\n\n* Savings based on annualized reductions.\nSUPPORTING OUR GLOBAL COMMUNITIES\n\nWe are committed to serving the communities where we live and work, supporting them with expertise, products, funding, and volunteer time.\n\nFUTURE WELL COMMUNITIES\n\nOur Future Well Communities program in Stockton, California, takes a new approach to removing barriers that prevent people with diabetes from living healthy lives.\n\nWorking in close partnership with community groups and leading institutions, our goal is to improve the health of 10,000 people facing the greatest impact of health disparities and diabetes. By providing people with customized, connected health and social services \u2014 and tracking what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not \u2014 we aim to transform health for those who need it most. Through the program, we\u2019re helping to deepen understanding of the underlying causes of noncommunicable diseases, helping people build healthy habits and healthier diets.\n\nWe\u2019re also working to build the capacity of the future healthcare workforce by partnering with the University of the Pacific to develop a sub-specialization in diabetes management within their social work and nursing schools. And, through the Abbott Fund, we\u2019re providing scholarships for Stockton residents committed to working in their communities post-graduation, to build a pipeline of diverse, local healthcare professionals.\n\nIn 2022, the second cohort of 10 Master of Social Work (MSW) scholars graduated, with nine scholars from the first cohort currently employed in Stockton. The first cohort of nursing scholars will graduate in May 2024. Since 2019, 35 MSW and nursing students have received scholarships.\n\nFUTURE WELL KIDS\n\nFuture Well Kids teaches kids about noncommunicable diseases and how they can stay healthy and reduce their risk of developing chronic diseases later in life. Our employee volunteers encourage students to put their lessons to use by making simple changes in their own lives.\n\nDuring the 2021\u20132022 school year, the program was delivered to more than 2,000 students, working with 23 partner schools across five countries. In 2022, we integrated our Future Well Kids curriculum into our Real Madrid Foundation partnership, delivering a total, along with our standard curriculum, of 11,000 hours of programming to more than 12,300 children in nine countries.\n\nIn addition to performing in-person visits to over 300 classrooms, we continue to deliver accessible content for educators and families through our virtual field trip, in partnership with Discovery Education. This lets students explore the structure and function of the heart. The video has reached more than 1 million students around the world since its launch.\n\nFor more examples of the program in action, see the Advancing Health Equity section.\n\nBOOSTING BLOOD DONATIONS\n\nOn World Blood Donor Day, Abbott supported blood drives in 10 U.S. locations to help address the national blood shortage exacerbated by COVID-19. Through these drives, more than 2,000 lives were impacted. In August, we hosted two blood drives with Chipotle \u2014 one in their Newport Beach, California, headquarters, the other in their Columbus, Ohio, offices.\n\nAbbott and Blood Centers of America have teamed up to boost blood donations through our ongoing \u201cGive Blood. Get Back.\u201d campaign. Started in 2021, the partnership is designed to attract younger participants and cultivate a new generation of regular blood donors.\n\nIn early 2023, Abbott and Blood Centers of America unveiled an immersive mixed-reality experience designed to improve the blood donation process, attract new donors, and motivate a younger generation to give blood.\n\nBecause research has shown that natural settings are the most preferred environment as donors give blood, this technology uses lightweight headsets to immerse participants in a garden while they listen to soothing music. The technology allows donors to remain fully aware of their surroundings, helping ensure a seamless, convenient, and safe donation.\nDISASTER RELIEF\n\nWhen natural disasters like hurricanes hit, there is always an immediate need for food, water, and medical supplies. However, organized disaster-relief efforts can take days to ramp up \u2014 putting communities in danger, especially residents facing ongoing health challenges and food insecurity.\n\nWe know product donations are not enough to build capable and reliable disaster response systems. Building community resilience means constantly thinking ahead, identifying and taking preventive measures to avoid and lessen the impact of disasters, adapting to unforeseen circumstances, and listening closely to specific community needs.\n\nAbbott and the Abbott Fund are implementing targeted disaster resilience strategies to help prevent and mitigate the impact of hurricanes on communities in New Orleans, Dallas, Orlando, and Puerto Rico, all areas where Abbott has established partnerships with two organizations \u2014 Feeding America and Direct Relief \u2014 to help communities to prepare for hurricane season. These efforts demonstrated their value in Puerto Rico and Florida when Hurricanes Fiona and Ian hit: staff were equipped to respond, protocols were in place, and our pre-positioned products were distributed immediately to vulnerable populations, including homebound patients. In addition, refrigerators, critical operations, and communications systems remained functional. We are now developing short- and long-term measures to gauge community and overall program-level impact.\n\nSupporting the Humanitarian Crisis in Ukraine\n\nSince the start of the war, we have provided almost $16 million in aid to Ukraine. This has included $5 million in grants to International Medical Corps (IMC), CARE, Project HOPE, and Americares to build infrastructure, procure and distribute critical medicines and supplies, and to provide training, employment, and education for women and their families forced to relocate to bordering countries.\n\nThrough our IMC grant, three hospitals are now equipped and have served more than 45,000 people with critical services. By fall 2023, all three hospitals are expected to have built fully equipped and functional underground care capability.\n\nWe have also donated almost $11 million in medicines, nutritional products, cardiac devices, and diabetes care products through relief partners and the Ukrainian Ministry of Health.\n\nEMPLOYEE GIVING\n\nWe know our employees want to give back to the places they call home. It\u2019s why we offer a comprehensive Employee Giving Program, through which Abbott:\n\n- Matches employees\u2019 donations to eligible nonprofit organizations\n- Matches 100% of eligible donations\n- Pays all processing fees, so every cent goes to the charity of choice\n\nThe program includes an annual donation drive \u2014 part of Abbott\u2019s long-standing Employee Giving Campaign. During the 2022 campaign, 87% of employees in the U.S. and Puerto Rico pledged more than $15 million* to over 9,300 charitable organizations in a single month.\n\nEMPLOYEE VOLUNTEERING\n\nWe provide U.S. employees eight hours per year of paid time to volunteer in their local communities. Through ongoing partnerships with schools, educational organizations, and nonprofits, our employees help promote science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) engagement, inspiring young people today to be the healthcare innovators of tomorrow.\n\n2022 SOCIAL INVESTING\n\n| Description                                      | Amount   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Cash contributions                               | $36.6M   |\n| In-kind giving, product or service donations*    | $30.7M   |\n| Administrative costs                             | $5.6M    |\n| Time, employee volunteering                      | $1.3M    |\n| **TOTAL**                                        | **$74.2M**|\n\n* Abides by WHO guidelines for product donation.\nOperating sustainably is key to the future of healthcare. Our 2030 Sustainability Plan formalizes our commitment to improve lives; embedding sustainability into our governance structure sets this Plan as a priority, making it a shared responsibility.\n\n**OUR PRINCIPLES OF SUSTAINABILITY**\n\nWe seek to uplift people, society, and the planet through better health. Four principles inform how we maximize impact:\n\n- Apply our unique business strengths to identify and invest in life-changing innovations, evolving to meet emerging needs and finding impactful ways to address challenges\n- Identify our top ESG priorities and determine how best to address the growing needs of those we serve\n- Embed sustainability throughout the business through robust governance\n- Partner with stakeholders\nESG-LINKED COMPENSATION\n\nOur 2030 Sustainability Plan is integrated into our business plans, financial planning processes, and existing governance structures, including oversight from our Board of Directors. Overall responsibility for sustainability sits with management and our leadership covenant reinforces this by explicitly stating that corporate officers are accountable for the achievement of Abbott\u2019s 2030 Sustainability Plan goals. All officers, including our Chairman and CEO, also carry a Human Capital Metrics goal.\n\nOur leadership covenant is considered the minimum requirement of being an officer at Abbott. Any officer who does not fulfill the covenant can receive a reduction of up to 100% of their annual incentive and/or long-term incentive awards.\n\nAs stated in our leadership covenant, each senior leader is responsible for taking actions in their organization that help achieve our targeted priority goals, including:\n\n- Making access and affordability core to new product innovation\n- Transforming care for chronic disease, malnutrition, and infectious diseases\n- Advancing health equity through partnerships\n- Protecting a healthy environment\n- Building the diverse, innovative workforce of tomorrow\n- Responsibly connecting data, technology, and care\n- Creating a resilient, diverse, and responsible supply chain\n\nTo learn more, visit the Executive Compensation section in our 2023 Proxy Statement.\nAbbott is on a mission to improve the lives of 3 billion people a year by 2030. To achieve this, we\u2019re designing access and affordability into our products from the start, creating life-changing technology like the FreeStyle Libre system, which provides continuous glucose monitoring for millions of people around the world.\n\nPaloma Kemak was one of the first people to try the FreeStyle Libre system when it became available in the U.S. in 2017.\nOUR APPROACH TO ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\n\nWe drive innovation to help ensure people can access the products and services they need to live fuller, healthier lives.\n\nAccess and affordability considerations are embedded throughout our product design, development, manufacturing, and commercialization processes. We leverage novel technologies \u2014 as well as our global presence, strategic partnerships, and community insights \u2014 to create measurable, real-world change.\n\nTHE SCIENTIFIC GOVERNING BOARD\n\nAbbott\u2019s Scientific Governing Board, a 16-member team that includes the R&D head from each Abbott business, oversees product and service innovation. The Board meets regularly to discuss Abbott\u2019s innovation progress, health technology developments, and areas for cross-business collaboration on product design. It is also responsible for driving the implementation of our Innovate for Access and Affordability Design Principles across the company.\n\nABBOTT\u2019S DESIGN PRINCIPLES\n\nWe have outlined three Design Principles to embed innovating for access and affordability in how we develop and bring technologies and products to the people who need them:\n\n- **Design for broader reach and equity:** Build an innovative portfolio that reaches more people, including new geographies and communities with limited access to care.\n\n- **Design for access:** Identify and overcome barriers to access and adoption, prioritizing inclusive design as well as manufacturing, distribution, and technology strategies to reduce costs across the value chain.\n\n- **Design to optimize reach and value:** Make intentional decisions throughout the design process to optimize four factors: people reached, consumer benefit, business value, and societal value.\n\nIn 2022, we integrated these principles across all of our businesses, helping evolve the way we develop and bring technologies to people who need them. Refreshed documentation outlines requirements for identifying and documenting barriers to access for the new product, and is scoped to address opportunities to further optimize reach.\n\nOUR 2022 PROGRESS\n\n>2B lives improved from Abbott products and services\n\nINTEGRATED our Innovate for Access and Affordability Design Principles across our businesses\n\n1M+ people globally who were provided decentralized healthcare services\n\nESTABLISHED Diversity in Research Office to standardize our approach in clinical trials\n\n6 NEW SITES added to the Abbott Pandemic Defense Coalition, strengthening our ability to identify viral threats\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY THROUGH PRODUCT INNOVATION\n\nOur R&D processes integrate access and affordability into our products and services, so we can deliver solutions that reach more of the people who need them.\n\nDRIVING VALUE\n\nOur Approach\nBefore we can design, we must first understand. From patients and healthcare professionals to policymakers and those who fund development, all of our stakeholders define value through their own lens. Our Design Principles help ensure that we\u2019re considering those varied perspectives as we develop our products.\n\nThis analysis is done in our Medical Devices business through our Early Value Assessment (EVA) process, a key tool that helps us understand and respond to the needs of different healthcare stakeholders. The EVA process continuously refreshes our understanding of dynamic care pathways globally, identifies our stakeholder value expectations, and allows us to design solutions with increased access and affordability in mind.\n\nThrough the EVA, we proactively seek insights that allow us to drive economic and clinical value through our innovation funnel, ultimately paving the way for broader coverage and access for patients.\n\nAnd in our diagnostics business, we look for ways to improve costs by increasing efficiency in our manufacturing, supply chain, and product support areas.\n\nINNOVATING FOR ACCESSIBILITY\n\nOur Approach\nTo help as many people as possible, we know we must work to remove barriers to care for patients around the world. To help ensure we deliver effective, responsible, and equitable solutions, during product development we also consider:\n\n\u2022 Supply resilience\n\u2022 Environmental sustainability\n\u2022 Value\n\nRead more on how we\u2019re designing for supply resilience on page 71.\n\nSAVING TIME AND MONEY WITH REVOLUTIONARY PLASMA TESTING FOR TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES (TBIs)\n\nA 2022 study has uncovered the role two blood-based biomarkers play in predicting recovery following a TBI. Published in The Lancet Neurology, the research used Abbott\u2019s i-STAT TBI Plasma test \u2014 and our core laboratory ARCHITECT instrument \u2014 to test for biomarkers within 24 hours of an injury.\n\nIn addition to providing a clearer image of severity, biomarker testing supported predictions of recovery times, long-term implications of the TBI, and optimal treatment plans. The first rapid test on a portable analyzer to receive FDA 510(k) clearance, the i-STAT TBI Plasma test can help quickly determine if a more expensive CT scan is needed, saving both time and money during diagnosis. In March 2023, we received FDA clearance for a TBI blood test that runs on our Alinity i core laboratory system.\nOUR 2022 PERFORMANCE\n\nBy 2030, we aim to improve the lives of one in every three people on Earth each year. In 2022, we improved the lives of more than 2 billion people through our products and services. In addition to building access and affordability into new products and services, we continually work to increase access to our existing products. Over the last 10 years, our organic business growth has been driven by expanding access rather than price increases, with volume growing at an average of 8.9% per year while prices have declined by an average of 0.8% per year. For further information, including data showing how our annual net sales price change compares to the rate of inflation, see page 128.\n\nIncreasing Access to Fast, Reliable, and Discreet HIV Testing at Home\n\nToday, more than 38.4 million people have HIV \u2014 an estimated 15% of these individuals don\u2019t know. Testing remains the first step to ending HIV/AIDS as a public health threat. To make HIV testing more accessible, Abbott launched Panbio HIV SELF TEST, an over-the-counter, fingerstick blood test that detects antibodies to HIV-1 and HIV-2 \u2014 the two types of HIV virus that can develop into AIDS. It delivers results in 15\u201320 minutes, and recognizes patients as positive 1\u201314 days earlier than previous second-generation tests from exposure to HIV infection.\n\nWe have received regulatory approval in 37 countries for a similar self-test called CheckNOW HIV SELF TEST, available to governments and public health authorities.\n\n* Excludes the impacts of business acquisitions/divestitures and foreign exchange.\n\n2022 AWARDS AND RANKINGS\n\nWe develop solutions to advance people\u2019s health. Throughout 2022, we were honored to have that commitment to innovation externally recognized.\n\nPrix Galien International Awards:\n- FreeStyle Libre receives Golden Jubilee Award for Best Medical Technology of the last 50 years\n- MitraClip receives Prix Galien International Award for Best Medical Technology 2022\n\nEdison Awards:\n- FreeStyle Libre 3 \u2014 Gold\n- NeuroSphere Virtual Clinic and i-STAT TBI Plasma test \u2014 Silver\n\nCES 2023 Innovation Awards for Advancements in Health Technology:\n- Aveir VR Leadless Pacemaker\n- Proclaim Plus SCS System\n- Alinity Mpox PCR test\n\nBRINGING HEART MONITORING CAPABILITIES TO MORE PEOPLE\n\nToday, more than 6.2 million Americans suffer heart failure. In February 2022, Abbott was granted FDA approval to expand use of our CardioMEMS HF System, bringing early-stage heart-failure-monitoring technology to a wider pool of patients.\n\nThe CardioMEMS sensor, a small device inserted into the pulmonary artery during a minimally invasive procedure, detects changes in pressure that could indicate worsening heart failure. It wirelessly transmits readings to the patient\u2019s physician, informing treatment updates to help mitigate late-stage heart failure and giving patients information they need to help manage their condition.\n\nData gathered during the clinical trial known as GUIDE-HF indicated improved outcomes for patients with mild heart failure when treatment was guided by pulmonary pressure monitoring \u2014 including a 34% reduction for hospitalizations, emergency visits, and death. With increased access to the CardioMEMS HF System, we\u2019re supporting better outcomes for millions of people living with heart failure.\nTRANSFORMING CARE\n\nWe are committed to transforming standards of care for people with chronic health conditions, malnutrition, and infectious diseases.\n\nOUR APPROACH\n\nInnovating new solutions for disease management is just one aspect of enhancing quality of care. Abbott is also working to expand capabilities in disease detection and prevention. And we\u2019re partnering to educate more people to help them live more balanced, healthier lives.\n\nOUR 2022 PERFORMANCE\n\nWe have developed various solutions and partnerships to combat noncommunicable diseases.\n\nNew Hope for Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD)\n\nAnnually, 2.8 million Americans are diagnosed with TRD. In July 2022, we received FDA Breakthrough Device Designation to expedite the review of our deep brain stimulation (DBS) system and how it can help people living with TRD.\n\nDBS involves implanting thin wires into targeted brain areas, deploying electrical impulses that moderate brain activity. Traditionally used to alleviate symptoms of movement disorders, evidence shows DBS could help regulate mood.\n\nQualifying for Breakthrough Device Designation highlights the system\u2019s potential role in effectively treating an irreversibly debilitating condition. It also enables us to accelerate development, assessment, and review \u2014 while maintaining regulatory standards \u2014 thereby shortening time to market for our potentially transformational TRD treatment.\n\nPreventing Antimicrobial Resistance\n\nWe are committed to doing our part to counter the growing risk of drug-resistant bacteria. For example, our Test Target Treat initiative empowers healthcare providers to make targeted treatment decisions sooner \u2014 reducing inappropriate antimicrobial use and the spread of resistance.\n\nIn our medicines business, our holistic approach with our teams, healthcare professionals, and patients aims to encourage responsible prescription and use of antibiotics. In the 2021 Access to Medicines Foundation\u2019s AMR Benchmark report, Abbott received the second-highest score of all generic medicines manufacturers assessed.\n\nTransforming Outcomes With Leadless Implants\n\nAbbott\u2019s investigational Aveir DR dual-chamber pacemaker \u2014 the world\u2019s first dual-chamber leadless pacemaker \u2014 could be a game-changer for restoring normal heart rhythm. Implant-to-implant technology supports communication between two pacemakers, enabling heart chamber synchronicity.\n\nSUPPORTING HEALTHY CHOICES\n\nSince August 2022, we\u2019ve been working with WeightWatchers (WW International Inc.) to develop a tool to help people manage diabetes through weight loss and glucose control. Combining WeightWatchers\u2019 diabetes-tailored weight management program with our FreeStyle Libre products, we can offer mobile access to the nutritional information people need to control their health. And, by combining glucose insights with empirically validated nutritional guidance, people can track the impact of each food choice they make.\na:care \u2014 Advancing Medicine Adherence\n\nFor some, the best way to improve health is not through creating new drugs or treatments, it\u2019s through improving how people stick to their treatment \u2014 also known as adherence. It\u2019s why we launched a:care, an initiative that bridges behavioral science with digital tools to help patients and healthcare professionals improve adherence.\n\nIn 2022, we hosted our second a:care Congress, creating a virtual forum for approximately 15,000 healthcare professionals from more than 70 countries to learn more about medication adherence and behavior. Endorsed by over 65 international and national medical societies, the event explored cultural and local factors that can create challenges for adherence and provided practical solutions to help people take charge of their health and live healthier lives by better adhering to their treatment.\n\nADVANCING WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH AND WELL-BEING\n\nMenopause can bring a variety of challenging physical and emotional symptoms. Despite 47 million women entering menopause each year, this natural part of growing older is still something few people talk about. As one participant commented, \u201cIf 51% of the world\u2019s population goes through menopause, why is it such a taboo? I think about this more and more. Who decided that it was uncomfortable to talk about a process that all women go through? Hopefully this silence will soon end.\u201d\n\nAbbott is committed to supporting women during this stage of their lives and empowering them to get the information and support they may need to continue living fulfilling lives.\n\nWe recently took on the challenge to debunk misconceptions and spark more conversations about menopause. Abbott invited women from different countries of the world to share their experiences in The Next Chapter, a collection of stories from women living in China, India, Mexico, and Brazil. From the impact of hormonal changes on relationships and careers to the toll on health and self-esteem, each woman\u2019s unique story voices the hidden worries and surprising joys that can accompany this new life stage.\n\nWe also reached over 1,700 International Menopause Society Congress participants with our campaign, and we shared information on The Next Chapter in nearly 1,900 independently run menopause and women health centers in India. In addition, we continue to drive educational efforts in nearly 450 menopause centers in China, and have supported the establishment of over 1,200 menopause centers across China and India \u2014 spaces with continuous care and education for women going through menopause.\n\nDimple Bhatnagar, shown here with her daughter, Shaliga, takes Abbott\u2019s Femoston Conti to help her manage the symptoms of menopause. She shared her experience with women around the world as part of Abbott\u2019s The Next Chapter initiative.\nADVANCING HEALTH EQUITY\n\nTo reach as many people as possible, we must remove barriers standing in the way of good health. We\u2019re partnering to decentralize infrastructure and deliver resources tailored to local, real-world needs.\n\nOUR APPROACH\n\nWe\u2019re working across our business and in partnership with others to advance health equity, removing barriers that prevent people from living healthy lives, with a special focus on programs that support children and women in underserved areas.\n\nTo deliver results, we\u2019ve laid out long-term targets for our business as part of our 2030 Sustainability Plan and made equitable care a key principle for our community partnerships.\n\nDiagnostics for Mothers and Children\n\nTo drive improved treatment for certain at-risk groups, we have established three diagnostic panels: groups of medical tests designed to enhance disease care.\n\n\u2022 Antenatal Care (ANC) Panel \u2014 In progress\n  To improve lives and reduce mortality among children and mothers in high-burden countries through regular screening and hotspot maps for HIV, HBV, and syphilis infections.\n\n\u2022 Malnutrition Panel \u2014 In development\n  To improve child and pregnant women well-being, using biomarkers to identify micronutrient deficiencies.\n\n\u2022 Fever Panel \u2014 In development\n  To help identify root causes of fever. Particularly important for pregnant women and young children, as well as patients with fever-like and other \u201cgeneric\u201d symptoms.\n\nThe Abbott Center for Malnutrition Solutions\n\nMalnutrition affects one in three people around the world \u2014 all ages, all geographies, and all socioeconomic classes. The Center for Malnutrition Solutions focuses on addressing global malnutrition through gathering real-world evidence and applying sustainable, resilient models that address local needs and improve access to care. With our partners, we\u2019re building capacity within communities to identify, treat, and prevent malnutrition.\n\nThe MUAC (mid-upper arm circumference) z-score tape is an example of an innovative tool. This simple, inexpensive paper device gives health workers and caregivers the ability to identify malnutrition risk in children in homes, schools, and communities throughout the world.\n\n\u2022 In Kenya, we\u2019re partnering with local groups to train community health workers and have donated MUAC z-score tapes to enhance identification of malnutrition in the context of climate and health.\n\n\u2022 In Ecuador, we\u2019re partnering to help identify malnutrition risk in children between six months and five years of age through the donation of 2,000 MUAC z-score tapes and training of 600 healthcare professionals and teachers from the Cuenca Cantonal Health Council and the Cuenca Municipal Foundation for Women and Children. A similar donation of tapes and training took place in Manta, Ecuador, in partnership with the Universidad Laica Eloy Alfaro de Manab\u00ed.\n\nOUR 2022 PERFORMANCE\n\nSupporting Children\u2019s Health\n\nIn 2021, we signed a three-year agreement to be the Health Sciences and Nutrition Partner for Real Madrid Football Club. We also signed on as Global Partner of the Real Madrid Foundation (RMF), launching our first initiative to tackle malnutrition among children in participating programs. In 2022, we integrated our Future Well Kids curriculum into the partnership, training 350 RMF coaches in nine countries and reaching over 12,300 children.\n\nWe also established a three-year partnership with Easterseals to pilot the Project on Education and Community Health Equity \u2014 part of the Easterseals Black Child Fund, launched in 2021. The project is creating an integrated system that aims to address barriers to quality education and healthcare experienced by children and families in under-invested communities. It will be implemented at Easterseals Childhood Development Centers in California, Georgia, and the greater Washington, D.C., area.\nOUR LONGEST-STANDING PARTNERSHIP\n\nFor more than two decades, Abbott and the Abbott Fund have partnered with the government of Tanzania to strengthen the country\u2019s healthcare system. With nearly $155 million invested to date, this partnership is finding sustainable solutions to critical healthcare challenges \u2014 elevating testing, treatment, and care across the country.\n\nIn 2010, Abbott supported development of the country\u2019s first emergency medical department at the Muhimbili National Hospital in Dar es Salaam. The department has since trained 79 specialty emergency physicians and more than 6,000 medical, nursing, and paramedic providers \u2014 helping approximately 1.2 million patients nationwide.\n\nWe have helped extend access to treatment through the construction of three regional hospitals and the equipping of one zonal hospital. In 2022, we completed the first models in Tanzania for emergency care at a district hospital emergency department and at a village emergency dispensary in Bantu village. We are now exploring how we can use this partnership as a model for other countries, and our Bantu dispensary as a model for other regions.\n\nMeruth Seladi Wilson, a healthcare worker in Bantu Village in Tanzania, is a graduate of the Kimberly & Miles White Primary School in Bantu, which was renovated and built by the Abbott Fund. Meruth works at the Bantu dispensary, also built by the Abbott Fund, which is the country\u2019s first model for emergency care in the village setting.\nExtraordinary innovation is often powered by technology. From the clinic to the cloud, data is changing healthcare\u2014including how, when, and where it is accessed and delivered\u2014and never before have people been empowered with so much information to make better decisions about managing their health. Our products provide data that helps people learn more about themselves and take action. This information also helps doctors understand how to better treat people, and fuels new innovations that can help unlock the power of health for future generations.\nRESPONSIBLE DATA MANAGEMENT AND PRIVACY\n\nData is a powerful tool for enabling scientific innovation. Technology is transforming healthcare, and the opportunities to learn how to better manage health, wellness, and human performance through data are limitless.\n\nWe believe data and trust go hand in hand, and the people who allow access to their data deserve to have it fiercely protected and secured every step of the way. Our goal is to make sure Abbott devices, products, and systems meet the highest security standards, and that commitment guides our approach to data privacy, protection, and ethical data use across all of our businesses.\n\nTHE PRINCIPLES OF DATA USE\n\nEach day, people trust us with information about their health \u2014 which is some of the most personal. We recognize that it is a privilege to learn from our customers, and our goal is to be transparent, responsible, and intentional in our approach to data collection and use.\n\nDATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY, MANAGEMENT, AND GOVERNANCE\n\nWe have strong centralized cybersecurity and privacy governance, which helps ensure that the organization embraces our security and privacy processes, standards, and principles related to data collection, use, sharing, and security. Executive management, as well as the Board of Directors, takes an active role in reviewing cybersecurity and privacy progress updates.\n\nPrivacy and Security by Design\n\nTo identify potential privacy and cybersecurity risks, we conduct privacy and security risk assessments and embed data protection into the products and services we design and develop. Our company-wide data protection framework is supported by standards, processes, and training designed to drive compliance, consistency, and employee understanding of the importance of building and maintaining appropriate data protection controls throughout the product development life cycle.\n\nPRODUCT CERTIFICATIONS\n\nAchieved 16 cybersecurity certifications for key connected Abbott products, including Merlin.net, CardioMEMS, and NeuroSphere Virtual Clinic\n\nCUSTOMER CYBERSECURITY PORTAL\n\nLaunched to provide healthcare delivery organizations direct access to key cybersecurity information on Abbott products\n\nENHANCED TRAINING\n\nOn company-wide cybersecurity awareness and skills for key roles\n\nPRIVACY POLICY\n\nUpdated to align with customer expectations\nWe also actively engage in the healthcare community and inform new standards and best practices to remain at the forefront of cybersecurity and privacy leadership, drawing on multi-stakeholder partnerships to collaborate on new standards and share best practices.\n\nWe can only deliver more personalized technologies if people trust Abbott with their personal data. Throughout 2021 and 2022, Abbott supported development of the World Economic Forum\u2019s Digital Trust Framework \u2014 a resource to establish global consensus on what digital trust means and how it can be achieved. As part of the wider Digital Trust Initiative, the framework acts as a tool for decision-makers to be certain we have trustworthy technology development, covering security and reliability; governance and oversight; and ethical and responsible use.\n\n**Privacy and Cybersecurity Oversight Committees**\n\nThe Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer and Divisional Vice President for Global Privacy oversee our Global Privacy Office. Two oversight committees support this office, with further assistance from dedicated global professionals and country-specific privacy champions. Each committee has its own operational committees that engage key stakeholders at product and business levels.\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Privacy Oversight Committee oversees Abbott\u2019s cybersecurity and privacy program. The committee brings together corporate officers from Legal, Ethics and Compliance, Finance, Human Resources, Quality, and Information Technology to advise and oversee the cybersecurity and privacy programs. A Product Security Oversight Committee, made up of cross-company leadership, meets regularly to develop Abbott\u2019s strategy and approach to product security, monitor progress, and support company-wide compliance.\n\nAbbott\u2019s senior cybersecurity and privacy leaders also provide regular progress updates to the Board of Directors and Board committees. Both the Audit Committee and Public Policy Committee have responsibilities related to cybersecurity and data privacy, and our well-balanced board has expertise in cybersecurity.\n\n**CYBERSECURITY MANAGEMENT**\n\nOur Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) leads the Enterprise and Product Cybersecurity organization, helping to ensure the security and availability of Abbott\u2019s systems, technologies, and products. The CISO reports into Abbott\u2019s Chief Information Officer (CIO). The CIO has overall responsibility and reports directly to our Chief Financial Officer.\n\n**Enterprise Cybersecurity**\n\nWe aim to create a strong cybersecurity foundation by reducing cybersecurity risks through:\n\n- Education and awareness\n- Building cybersecurity into our systems and applications\n- Implementing incident monitoring and response efforts\n- Protection of sensitive data\n- Manufacturing cybersecurity\n- Disaster recovery planning efforts\n\nCompany-wide training helps ensure employees and contractors receive targeted instruction on company policies and emerging cybersecurity risks. For example, we conduct phishing awareness campaigns to help users identify and respond to phishing attempts. We monitor results to identify retraining requirements and help ensure everyone at Abbott understands their shared responsibility to protect sensitive data and personal information. In 2022, we introduced and completed a new course on security controls for enterprise employees.\n\nAbbott Divisions also have dedicated cybersecurity leaders to help address cybersecurity risks within their business. They provide updates to division leadership and work with Corporate to look at how cybersecurity controls are applied across Abbott\u2019s businesses. Regional Security Leaders in key geographies support local and regional cybersecurity requirements.\n\n**Product Cybersecurity**\n\nOur Product Cybersecurity organization partners across Abbott to help ensure products and systems are secure by design and maintain security throughout the product life cycle. This includes secure development, testing, and ongoing security monitoring and maintenance.\n\nWe work to ensure that Abbott products or services that process personal data are certified by an industry-recognized certification. To further protect data, we are working to expand this requirement to internet-based applications, such as websites.\nENHANCING OUR SECURITY EFFORTS\n\nTo advance our commitment to data transparency, we have implemented our first Abbott-wide cybersecurity portal. The platform, which is currently open to a limited number of healthcare delivery organizations (HDOs), greatly enhances the speed and ease with which these customers can access relevant product documentation. Throughout 2023, we aim to add more HDOs to the portal globally.\n\nWe have also taken several steps to strengthen our internal understanding of cybersecurity, including:\n\n- **Launching cybersecurity and privacy communication videos** to help employees understand the importance of data privacy and security.\n- **Updating cybersecurity capability training** to offer personnel a variety of role-based learning paths \u2014 including mentorship and certification.\n- **Convening our Medical Device Cybersecurity Council.** This group of physicians, CIOs, CISOs, and other healthcare cybersecurity experts meet several times a year to discuss Abbott\u2019s cybersecurity program and focus areas.\n\nOur commitment to product security and privacy has not gone unnoticed. During 2022, Abbott won a tender to supply continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology to a healthcare provider in Sweden. Our FreeStyle Libre CGM system was selected thanks, in part, to the protocols we have in place to keep personal data secure.\n\nBETTER DECISIONS WITH CONNECTED CARE\n\nHarnessing data and technology, we\u2019re developing connected solutions that enable greater health choices and management.\n\n**Connecting People to Care**\n\nIn partnership with diabetes-care innovators CamDiab and Ypsomed, Abbott is developing an automated insulin delivery system to aid diabetes management and improve the lives of people living with it.\n\nThe new system uses Abbott\u2019s FreeStyle Libre 3 to continuously monitor glucose levels in real time. The sensor is connected to the CamDiab\u2019s CamAPS FX mobile app, which calculates optimal insulin dosage, communicating it to the Ypsomed mylife\u2122 automatic insulin YpsoPump\u00ae.\n\nCONTINUOUS, SECURE DATA CONNECTIONS TO IMPROVE CARE\n\nAbbott is a leader in developing products that offer virtual connections between people and their doctors, improving access to care, helping better control chronic conditions, and reducing healthcare costs. Protecting patient data is key to our success in this area.\n\nOur Cardiac Rhythm Management business provides an excellent example of this with a suite of connected devices that includes our Gallant implantable cardioverter defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator devices that help keep a patient\u2019s heart beating normally, and our Confirm Rx insertable cardiac monitor that allows continuous observation.\n\nThese devices communicate with our myMerlinPulse mobile app, which lets patients track the performance of each device and securely share information on heart activity with their doctor from anywhere in the world.\nBUILD THE DIVERSE, INNOVATIVE WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW\n\nOur ability to build a healthy, sustainable future depends on the innovative ideas, execution, and dedication of a diverse workforce. In return, Abbott provides an environment that helps all employees learn and grow in careers that matter, where they can bring their true selves to work each day.\n\nIn the summer of 2022, Bhuvi Kedia (left) and Chaya Sandhu (right) gained valuable experience working as high school STEM interns in our diabetes care business.\nOUR APPROACH TO BUILDING TOMORROW\u2019S WORKFORCE\n\nOur talent management approach focuses on attracting, retaining, engaging, and developing a diverse workforce ready for tomorrow\u2019s challenges while bringing our strategy to life today.\n\nATTRACTING THE BEST TALENT\n\nWe offer the opportunity to build a great career with financial security and well-being. When you join Abbott, you are part of a community of employees doing purposeful work in an environment where everyone can bring their true self to work every day.\n\nWe build and maintain long-term relationships with diverse candidates through the Abbott Talent Community. This helps build a talent pipeline that promotes diversity and longevity.\n\nRETAINING AND ENGAGING OUR EMPLOYEES\n\nOur goal is to build a strong pipeline of internal talent through intentional development. This includes offering growth opportunities such as mentoring, leadership training, and personalized career development conversations and tools.\n\nTalent Management Reviews (TMRs)\n\nOur senior leadership conducts TMRs by division and function to review succession plans for our most critical positions. As part of these discussions, senior leadership considers employees with leadership potential who are early in their careers and discusses how they can continue to develop that talent.\n\nOur Board of Directors conducts an annual TMR to review succession plans and development actions for our senior positions, as well as discuss the overall health of our talent pipeline.\n\nReal Talk. Real Impact.\n\nAt Abbott, we believe that when employees and managers talk frequently and honestly about performance and development, employees become more engaged and perform better. \u201cReal Talk. Real Impact.\u201d is Abbott\u2019s approach to effective and agile conversations between managers and employees.\n\nIn addition to our formal, annual goal setting and performance assessment process, we also encourage a continuous dialogue, asking managers and employees to have regular conversations throughout each quarter about how the organization is doing, how the employee is performing, and how they can make a bigger impact. The dialogue can be initiated by the employee or manager, and can follow different formats or scenarios.\n\nDuring those conversations, managers also seek to identify barriers and determine what they can do to better support the employee, and their career aspirations.\n\nOUR 2022 PROGRESS\n\n41% of global management positions filled by women\n\n45% of STEM roles filled by women\n\n35% of leadership roles in the U.S. held by people from underrepresented groups\n\n88% of leadership roles filled based on succession plan\n\n46% of targeted new jobs filled internally\n\n>346,000 development and job opportunities created for current and future employees\n\n>47,000 STEM opportunities created for young people (64% for people from underrepresented groups)\nWe also offer employees the opportunity to participate in 360\u00b0, 180\u00b0, and self assessments. These assessments provide multi-perspective feedback from managers, colleagues, peers, direct reports, and others. Results from the assessment present an expanded understanding of an employee\u2019s strengths and development needs.\n\n**Mentoring**\n\nOur mentoring program connects employees with experienced mentors to receive professional guidance, development perspectives, and career coaching. In 2022, we expanded the program by adding eight languages and invited more employees to participate globally. The mentoring program is now available to all employees.\n\n**CONTINUING TO LEARN AND GROW**\n\nCreating the workforce of the future requires inspiring the workforce of today and tomorrow. We continue to invest in resources that support the development and professional growth of all our employees and to help them build their best careers. And we look at ways we can help prepare the next population, particularly women and diverse students.\n\nOur employees can access growth and development opportunities at every stage of their career to build new skills and gain new perspectives (learn more on page 41). These programs have been designed to support the development and strengthen the skills of all our employees, and to help achieve our goal of increasing diversity in STEM and management roles. By continuing to foster a culture of learning and growth, we will be able to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow and bring our life-changing solutions to more people around the globe.\n\nIn 2022, we provided training around data-driven decision-making, a simulation for agility, and a learning content path for digital mindset training to prepare our employees to be the healthcare engineers, specialists, and providers of the future.\n\nWe also launched our first pilot cohort of our Software Engineering Training (SET) program in 2022. Targeting approximately 25 participants per year, the SET program is a nomination program for current employees interested in learning software engineering. We plan to launch our second cohort in September 2023. The SET program supports our internal technical pipeline by providing a challenging technical program that prepares participants to be successful in the field with essential fundamental knowledge of software engineering.\n\n**Global Development Weeks**\n\nAbbott\u2019s Global Development Weeks encourage employees to explore the range of resources available to help them build their best career and realize their full potential. We had two development weeks in 2022, with approximately 20% of Abbott employees around the world participating. Nearly 200 leaders served as instructors, facilitating and engaging employees through live webinars, exploring personal branding, and sharing their own development journeys through leadership panels. There were also external speakers, workshops, online content, and more.\n\n**LEADING WITH IMPACT**\n\nWe recognize the vital role frontline managers play in building a supportive, inclusive, and rewarding work environment. That\u2019s why, in 2022, we reinforced the behaviors learned in our two-time Brandon Hall Excellence Awards-winning Leading With Impact program through topical peer pods, an interactive coaching workbook, leader podcasts, and more.\n\nAs a result, we have seen scores on many components of manager effectiveness increase, showing the work is helping to develop the leadership skills needed to sustain engaged, high-performing teams.\n\nAfter a concerted effort of training people leaders in 2021 to be more proactive, understanding leaders, we continued to train new and newly promoted leaders in 2022. Approximately 3,600 managers completed the program in 2022 and approximately 96% of all of our leaders have participated in the program since it first rolled out in 2021.\nDEVELOPING OUR FUTURE LEADERS\n\nIn addition to the vast curriculum available to all employees, we offer various programs to support emerging leaders along their development journey.\n\n- **New Leader Program:** Designed to support new managers in making a successful transition to managerial roles while honing leadership potential. Instruction is delivered over 12\u201314 weeks, with eight virtual, instructor-led sessions and various self-paced modules and on-the-job activities.\n\n- **GM Acceleration Program:** Created to accelerate the readiness and quality of identified talent for general manager (GM) or commercial leadership roles. Across a year, three program phases include a business and finance workshop, an assessment center, and development opportunities to apply learned skills.\n\n- **Global Citizen Development Program:** Brings together early career employees to prepare them to be next-generation leaders. Cohorts of approximately 25 employees \u2014 from different divisions, functions, and geographies \u2014 complete blended learning sessions to develop leadership skills, build business acumen, and develop a strong network. The program spans six months and includes critical business challenges where participants apply their learnings.\n\n- **The Operations Leadership Program (OLP):** Provides focused development for key talent within our Operations functions, focusing on helping participants make cross-functional and cross-company decisions, understanding key business drivers, future challenges, and strategic direction, practicing how to anticipate issues and risks and implement options for mitigation, and strengthening collaboration and relationship-building skills. By design, each cohort is global, culturally diverse, and geographically dispersed. A key component of the program is helping participants lead and develop others. The progress of participants is tracked over a three-year period against a peer group. For the latest cohort of participants tracked over three years, the promotion rate is significantly higher than that of the peer group.\n\n- **The Emerging Leaders Program (ELP):** A global development program that identifies and develops cross-division talent for future leadership roles. The program spans five months and includes a virtual workshop to build broad leadership and communication skills, as well as coaching and motivating skills. The program also includes private coaching, periodic cohort meetings, and a final group webinar to reflect on learnings and refine goals for progress. The progress of participants is tracked over a three-year period against a peer group. Program participants are promoted at significantly higher rates than their peer group.\n\nBUILDING THE PIPELINE FOR TOMORROW\n\nBy 2030, Abbott plans to create 100,000 STEM opportunities globally, helping to create a pipeline of talent interested in STEM careers to meet the growing demands for healthcare innovation. We offer a STEM internship for high school students \u2014 particularly for underrepresented applicants \u2014 to kick-start their healthcare careers. In 2022, this was expanded into four additional countries \u2014 Saudi Arabia, Costa Rica, India, and Canada \u2014 bringing the total to 23 locations in eight countries to date.\n\nIn November 2022, we launched a three-year U.S. skilled-trades apprenticeship program. Apprentices have flexible working hours and study time at nearby community colleges. And they participate in the program while working their full-time job. Abbott\u2019s goal is to support apprentices throughout their education while preparing them for long-term careers with us.\n\nAbbott also has a long-established presence on campus at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) Research Park that continues to give us access to a competitive and diverse pool of talented students to consider for internship opportunities.\nOUR 2022 PERFORMANCE\n\nUnderstanding Employee Sentiment\nWe provide an environment where each employee can be themselves and feel proud about coming to work each day. To maintain a welcoming environment, we actively listen to employees to understand what they expect and need.\n\nOn our Your Voice Counts survey, we ask employees 12 questions that address their basic needs, their contributions, teamwork, and growth. Our businesses have the opportunity to ask up to six additional questions on topics that are most relevant to their people. We also include a question to measure employee satisfaction. In 2022, the Your Voice Counts survey was completed by 78% of all our employees.\n\nLearning and Progression Opportunities\nIn 2022, Abbott hired 21,820 new external employees. We also filled 44% of open positions with internal candidates. Our open positions include those filled by external hires, internal hires, and promotions. Providing our employees with the resources to grow personally and professionally is important to us. We offer our employees the development and advancement opportunities that allow them to achieve their full potential and have their best careers. Last year, we provided over 346,000 job and development opportunities and, after two years, are just past halfway to our 1 million goal. Additionally, we ran two Global Development Weeks in 2022, where more than 22,000 unique employees participated for over 64,000 hours.\n\n2022 RECOGNITION: DEVELOPING THE WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW\n\nInternships and Early Careers\n\nFirsthand (formerly Vault) Rankings:\n\u2022 #1 Best Health Sciences Internships\n\u2022 #1 Best Internships for Engineering\n\u2022 #1 Best Internships for Sales, Marketing, & Communications\n\nChooseMyCompany:\n#2 for early-career programs outside the U.S.\n\nFast Company\u2019s Best Workplaces for Innovators Awards:\nStandout company for early-career workers\n\nAbbott\u2019s 10 employee networks provide communities of support for colleagues across our company.

One way we do this is through our Executive Diversity Council \u2014 a group that drives cross-company DEI strategy development and implementation. The council meets throughout the year with our Chairman and CEO to establish priorities and discuss progress.\n\nCommunities of Support\n\nTen employee networks bring our employees together to expand visibility and create opportunities to engage with local communities, develop professionally, and seek or provide mentorship. Our employee networks take a leadership role in helping to bring attention to DEI-related issues. With nearly 17,000 members overall, each network is sponsored by an Abbott corporate officer and supported by our Diversity and Inclusion team.\n\n| OUR EMPLOYEE NETWORK GROUPS | Founded |\n|-----------------------------|---------|\n| Women Leaders of Abbott (WLA) | 2000    |\n| Black Business Network (BBN) | 2001    |\n| Flex Network (part-time/flexible employees) | 2001 |\n| Asian Leadership and Cultural Network (ALCN) | 2001 |\n| LA VOICE Network (Hispanic and Latino employees) | 2005 |\n| PRIDE (LGBTQ+ employees) | 2007    |\n| Women in STEM | 2016    |\n| Veterans Network | 2017    |\n| Early Career Network (ECN) | 2018    |\n| Abbott disABILITY Network | 2021    |\n\nDEVELOPING DIVERSE TALENT\n\nEach year, we host hundreds of interns through our college and high school STEM internship programs. Since the inception of the high school STEM internship in 2012, women have accounted for approximately 70% of former high school interns later hired as full-time engineers. In partnership with Advancing Minorities\u2019 Interest in Engineering (AMIE), Abbott launched an initiative to diversify and strengthen our workforce by building cybersecurity curriculum capability at Historically Black College and University (HBCU) engineering schools. Among other actions, we funded cybersecurity internships for HBCU students during summer 2022 (see page 18).\n\nFuture Female Engineers\n\nTo increase female representation in engineering, Abbott Ireland recently launched the Future Female Engineer program, partnering with Atlantic Technological University to pursue degrees in Mechatronic Systems. This program is designed to develop existing female employees, typically operators, who do not have a third-level technical qualification but are interested in pursuing a career in engineering.\n\nIn addition to having dedicated study time, participants will work reduced hours on-site as part of the local Abbott engineering team as they complete the three-year virtual degree program. Course fees are fully funded by Abbott, with participants receiving their normal annual salary, building year on year as their experience and knowledge grows.\n\nOUR 2022 PERFORMANCE\n\nFor more detailed insights into 2022 workforce diversity, please see our 2022 DEI Report.\n2022: DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION AWARDS\n\nForefront 50:\n\u2022 Top Corporations for Minority Businesses\n\nDiversityInc:\n\u2022 #3 Company for Diversity (listed for 19 consecutive years)\n\nDiversityInc\u2019s Top Companies Specialty Lists:\n\u2022 #1 Supplier Diversity\n\u2022 #3 Environmental, Social, and Governance\n\u2022 #4 Sponsorship\n\u2022 #4 Native American and Pacific Islander Executives\n\u2022 #9 Philanthropy\n\u2022 #9 People with Disabilities\n\u2022 #11 Mentoring\n\u2022 #11 Executive Diversity Councils\n\u2022 #22 Black Executives\n\nSeramount:\n\u2022 22-time 100 Best Company\n\u2022 3-time 100 Best Company for Women in India (by Avtar/Seramount)\n\u2022 15-time Top Company for Executive Women and Hall of Fame member\n\u2022 3-time Inclusion Index Company\n\u2022 4-time Best Company for Multicultural Women\n\nWomen of Color STEM:\n\u2022 15 honorees\n\nBlack Engineer of the Year Award (BEYA):\n\u2022 12 honorees\n\nETHNIC REPRESENTATION IN U.S. MANAGEMENT POSITIONS\n\n| Totals by race | White | Underrepresented groups |\n|----------------|-------|-------------------------|\n|                | 65%   | 35%                     |\n\nWORKPLACE GENDER DIVERSITY U.S.\n\n| 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|------|------|------|\n| Female share of workforce | 47% | 47% | 47% |\n| Total management positions filled by women | 42% | 43% | 43% |\n| Women in STEM-related positions | 42% | 43% | 44% |\n\nWORKPLACE GENDER DIVERSITY GLOBAL\n\n| 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|------|------|------|\n| Female share of workforce | 45% | 45% | 45% |\n| Total management positions filled by women | 39% | 40% | 41% |\n| Women in STEM-related positions | 44% | 45% | 45% |\n\nSPONSORING STEAM SUMMER CAMP\n\nAbbott sponsors Chicago Urban League\u2019s Project Ready STEAM Summer Camp.

The STEAM Summer Camp provides an interactive, educational program with activities and instruction that aids in STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math) career exploration.\n\nThe goals and objectives of the STEAM Summer Camp include the following:\n\n\u2022 Middle and high school participants will show an increased awareness of STEAM-related academic and career pathways by the end of the STEAM Summer Camp.\n\u2022 Middle and high school student participants will increase interest in STEM and motivation to pursue STEM-related post-secondary education and careers by end of the STEAM Summer Camp.\nDoing our best work starts with feeling our best. That is why Abbott offers innovative programs and solutions that reward our efforts, recognize our rich diversity, promote healthy lifestyles, help our employees balance work and family, and provide financial security.\n\n**OUR APPROACH**\n\nAbbott provides a robust combination of health, wellness, and life programs that provide security for employees. We also offer opportunities like flextime, part-time hours, compressed work weeks, reduced schedules, job sharing, and remote working.\n\nWe continually monitor changing needs and offerings, working to provide innovative programs and a competitive well-being support program.\n\n**OUR 2022 PERFORMANCE**\n\n**Supporting Every Employee**\n\nWe work to develop new programs to assist our employees and their evolving concerns, because we know their needs are as diverse as they are.\n\n**Spring Health**\n\nTo advance our well-being offering in 2022, we introduced Spring Health as our new mental healthcare provider for U.S. employees. Spring Health provides personalized, confidential mental health resources to our U.S. employees, their covered family members, and everyone in their household. Their approach includes one-to-one support throughout the journey to better mental health and also offers free life/work services, parenting coaching, legal and financial services, and more. Through Spring Health, our employees also have faster access to care through online appointment requests. Typically, employees will have a confirmed appointment scheduled within approximately 20 minutes after completing a mental health assessment. Follow-up therapy appointments are available within two days on average, and all therapists are in-network for most plans, thereby helping ensure employees\u2019 access to affordable care.\n\nWithin the first six months of introducing the new mental health and life/work service in July 2022, over 8,300 people at Abbott had created accounts with more continuing to open accounts.\n\n**Flexible Benefits**\n\nIn Turkey, we offer a flexible benefits program. Employees can select from a list of optional benefits beyond our core medical and insurance offers \u2014 for example, travel vouchers, shopping vouchers, and fuel cards.\n\n**Digital Primary Care**\n\nDuring 2022, we implemented a digital primary care clinic for employees in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, to support all Brazilian employees, intended to improve access to medical care and management of chronic conditions. Various services are offered, including periodic exams for primary care, COVID-19 testing and monitoring, and continuing healthcare. In 2022, more than 4,300 employee appointments were made.\n\nThe service includes a telehealth tool, which has expanded the clinic\u2019s digital reach to 100% of Brazilian employees and their dependents (approximately 6,400 people). It has proven to be an effective tool, with a resolution rate of 91%.\n\n**A GLOBALLY RECOGNIZED COMMITMENT TO OUR EMPLOYEES**\n\nWe prioritize well-being because we care about and value our employees. While not motivated by external recognition, we are proud to have our global efforts noted.\n\n**Top Employers Institute:**\n\n- Top Employer in 10 countries\n- Continental certification in Europe and Middle East\n\n**Science magazine Top 20 Employer**\nFINANCIAL AND RETIREMENT BENEFITS\n\nOur financial and retirement programs help our employees build a solid financial future for themselves and their families.\n\nOUR APPROACH\n\nWe work to ensure employees are compensated fairly and without discrimination \u2014 regardless of race, ethnicity, or gender.\n\nFair compensation is based on three concepts:\n\n- Base salaries and benefits that are market competitive\n- Annual and long-term incentives linked to performance, with a balance of short- and long-term financial and strategic objectives\n- Compensation that encourages behavior consistent with the ethical values in Abbott\u2019s Code of Business Conduct\n\nSupporting Financial Well-Being\n\nIn addition to providing equitable compensation, we help employees build an ownership stake in Abbott. Offerings (where applicable) include retirement savings programs, employee stock purchase plans, and restricted stock units (RSUs) awarded as long-term incentives.\n\nIn 2022, Abbott granted RSUs to about 14,000 employees across 73 countries and offered our employee stock purchase plan in 63 countries with 44% of eligible employees participating.\n\nOur financial security offerings include several innovative programs designed to address the issues we know employees face.\n\nFreedom 2 Work\n\nThe Freedom 2 Work program was developed in the U.S. to leverage the knowledge and experience of our seasoned employees approaching retirement. The initiative allows them to reduce their schedules, workloads, and/or responsibilities while continuing to build retirement income. Over 1,800 employees have enrolled since 2008.\n\nIn addition, we created a partial retirement program in the Netherlands that allows those approaching retirement age \u2014 which has been gradually increasing \u2014 to maintain pension accumulation while reducing workload. Sixteen percent of eligible employees currently participate.\n\nFreedom 2 Save\n\nFreedom 2 Save helps U.S. employees save for retirement while repaying student loans. Since its launch in 2018, more than 2,400 employees have enrolled in the program. Those putting at least 2% of eligible pay toward student loan repayments receive a 5% 401(k) contribution from Abbott \u2014 amounting to contributions of over $5.5 million since inception. We were the first company to help U.S. employees save for retirement while repaying student loans through our Freedom 2 Save program, which was recently codified by the federal government through the SECURE 2.0 Act.\n\nStudent Loan Support in the Netherlands\n\nIn the Netherlands, we developed a student loan program in response to changes in government university-level financing in 2015.\n\nFreeU\n\nIn 2021, we launched FreeU \u2014 a virtual program to help employees pursue a bachelor\u2019s degree on flexible schedules at no personal cost when combined with our tuition reimbursement program. In 2022, 175 people enrolled in this program.\nEMPLOYEE HEALTH AND SAFETY\n\nKeeping employees and contractors healthy and safe is non-negotiable for Abbott. We\u2019re committed to driving a culture of shared responsibility, embedding safety considerations throughout our business process.\n\nOUR APPROACH\n\nOur Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) Leadership Council is made up of business and global EHS leaders who develop and drive our EHS programs, including those related to employee health and safety.\n\nAbbott\u2019s EHS organization reports to the Senior Vice President, Quality Assurance, Regulatory and Engineering Services, who reports to our Chairman and CEO. The commercial EHS organization is divided across six regions, each with a dedicated manager. Safety representatives and teams at each Abbott site help ensure internal EHS programs are implemented successfully.\n\nAt the end of 2022, 23 Abbott sites were certified to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 45001:2018. We regularly update global standards for managing the health and safety of everyone working at Abbott locations.\n\nEach organization must comply with EHS management programs, including:\n\n- Health and safety\n- Strategic planning and prioritization\n- Risk assessment/self-assessment\n- Business integration\n- Training and awareness\n- Communication and information\n- Performance measures\n\nWe evaluate commercial operations, manufacturing, and R&D sites on a regular basis. Using an EHS scorecard, senior leadership monitors performance with results used to identify corrective actions.\n\nOccupational Health Services\n\nOur global Occupational Health Services (OHS) team develops and maintains occupational health policies, procedures, and guidelines, trains relevant employees, and consults on regulatory compliance. Together with the EHS team, the OHS team leads our response to public health emergencies with the potential to impact our employees and our business. The team also implements Abbott\u2019s global employee health and productivity strategy, supported by our OHS Standard, which requires each facility to have designated healthcare professionals with site-specific knowledge.\n\nToday, more than 130 occupational health professionals support employee health and well-being, and treat illnesses and injuries. They also conduct regular screenings and health education programs. Site and divisional leaders track implementation of occupational health and well-being initiatives using a Global Health Scorecard.\n\nWe also have a Reproductive Hazard Management Standard to help ensure the health and safety of employees and their potential future children.\n\nFostering a Culture of Health and Safety\n\nAlong with a dedicated EHS Policy, we utilize several technical and management standards, including:\n\n- Risk Assessment and Self-Assessment Management Standard to assess and mitigate health and safety risks\n- Training and Awareness Management Standard to inform employees of risks and job-specific hazards\n- Topic-specific technical standards, e.g., Fleet Safety, Control of Hazardous Energy, Confined Spaces, Ergonomics, Electrical Safety, Biological Safety, and Working at Heights\n- Emergency Preparedness Standard to establish requirements for emergency preparedness planning and ensuring health and safety on-site and in surrounding communities\n\nAll EHS management and technical standards are detailed online.\nProtecting Our Employees\nThrough our team of experienced security professionals and subject matter experts, the Employee Safety Group executes a variety of protective programs all focused on one common Duty of Care goal \u2014 keeping our employees accounted for, safe, and secure. The Global Communications Center monitors world events to proactively identify emerging threats and tactically get the right information to the right decision-makers right away. Situational Awareness For Everyone Everywhere (SAFE) briefings boost employee personal security awareness mindset and attitude. In 2022, it was provided to more than 12,000 employees. Regional security experts and our Travel Safety program help identify high-risk travel destinations and protect employees traveling for work. The Threat Management team partners with corporate stakeholders to keep Abbott\u2019s work environments safe and reduce the incidence and impact of troubling situations. The Executive Protection and Special Events Support teams partner with senior leadership stakeholders to create safe environments for employees and senior leaders participating in a variety of Abbott-sponsored events including senior leadership gatherings, Abbott World Marathons Majors, and division-level conferences.\n\nOUR 2022 PERFORMANCE\nWe consistently update our protocols to safeguard against occupational injuries and illness. Each division actively implements initiatives to drive improvements. As well as introducing new measures, we maintain and evolve our existing practices and provide targeted training in key areas, such as the safe-driving program to reduce vehicle accidents across Abbott.\n\nEnhancing Lockout/Tagout Control\nWe demand strict safety protocols are followed when servicing and maintaining equipment. It\u2019s why, in 2022, we focused on enhancing Abbott\u2019s Control of Hazardous Energy processes. These processes, known as lockout/tagout, are critical to prevent severe employee injuries. Refresher sessions were delivered to approximately 500 employees and contractors during our 2022 EHS Awareness Campaign, and during global sessions we brought in a speaker to emphasize the importance of strictly following lockout/tagout processes.\n\n| OHS PERFORMANCE | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|-----------------|------|------|------|------|\n| **Lost-Time Case Rate**<sup>18</sup> |      |      |      |      |\n| Employee and Contractor | 0.30 | 0.13 | 0.13 | 0.12 |\n| **Vehicle Accidents per Million Miles** |      |      |      |      |\n| Field-based Employees Only | 3.81 | 2.70 | 2.61 | 2.56 |\n| **Recordable Case Rate**<sup>18</sup> |      |      |      |      |\n| Employee and Contractor | 0.46 | 0.28 | 0.30 | 0.25 |\n\nRECOGNIZING EXCELLENCE IN EMPLOYEE SAFETY\nWe prioritize workplace safety in every single Abbott site. Our Plant of the Year award is given to locations where EHS practices help raise the bar. The recipients for 2022 were our Electrophysiology and Structural Heart plant in Costa Rica and our Diabetes Care plant in Donegal, Ireland (pictured below).\n\nWe also award EHS Excellence Awards every year, selecting standout individuals and teams from a pool of over 100 nominations. Categories include Health & Safety, Environmental Sustainability, Product Stewardship, Occupational Health, and Community Outreach.\nHUMAN RIGHTS\n\nWe are committed to actively protecting human rights.\n\nOur processes for managing human rights risks are embedded throughout the business, encompassing workforce policies, ethics and compliance programs, supply chain management, and more. We regularly evaluate risk exposure, including annual risk assessment of strategic suppliers in our supply chain.\n\nWe aim to proactively identify and mitigate potential human rights impacts across our operations and supply chain, including risks of:\n\n- Discrimination and unequal pay\n- Unsafe working conditions\n- Human trafficking\n- Child labor\n- Forced or bonded labor\n\nWe maintain policies, including our Code of Business Conduct and policy on workplace harassment, that reinforce our zero tolerance for any discrimination. They detail steps for reporting instances of workplace harassment or discrimination and clearly define escalation processes.\n\nU.S. employees are required to complete anti-harassment training every two years, and beginning in 2021, all managerial employees are required to complete unconscious bias training. Our global problem-solving policy encourages employees and management to maintain open lines of communication, calling attention to issues as they arise. The policy also details alternative steps employees can take to resolve issues or concerns.\n\nWe investigate all reported allegations of harassment or discrimination in a confidential manner and, where necessary, take corrective action. Consequences for employees include disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Read more about our processes for reporting, investigating, and addressing instances of harassment and discrimination on page 85.\n\nIDENTIFYING AND MANAGING HUMAN RIGHTS RISKS\n\nAll employees must adhere to relevant laws and Abbott\u2019s policies, procedures, principles, and standards. Our Code of Business Conduct prohibits illegal and inappropriate labor conditions, and cruel or inhumane treatment.\n\nIn our supply chain, we establish human rights expectations of strategic suppliers we enter a business relationship with through our Supplier Guidelines, and conduct assessment, monitoring, and auditing of strategic suppliers to identify and mitigate potential risks, including those related to human rights. For further information, see pages 71\u201374.\n\nWe also address human rights risks in our other business relationships, including through our Third-Party Compliance Process, which requires Abbott businesses, subsidiaries, and affiliates outside the U.S. to complete due diligence before engaging third-party companies. This involves screening companies, identifying high-risk partners, and monitoring and mitigating any potential risks, including human rights risks. For further information, see page 86.\n\nFind more about our discrimination and harassment approach on page 86; compensation and benefits on page 46; and health and safety on page 47.\nPROTECT A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT\n\nAs champions for health, we do more than develop life-changing products and technologies. We take targeted action to help protect our environment.\n\nIN THIS SECTION\n\n51 OUR APPROACH TO A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT\n53 ENERGY AND EMISSIONS\n56 PROTECTING WATER RESOURCES\n59 WASTE MANAGEMENT\n62 PACKAGING\n63 RESPONSIBLE SOURCING AND PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP\n\nTommy Kennedy, Manager, Engineering & EHS, Abbott Nutrition\nSupply Chain, Sligo, Ireland\nOUR APPROACH TO A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT\n\nWe are evolving our operations to better preserve a healthy environment, building a more resilient, responsible business.\n\nOUR APPROACH\n\nWe rely on natural resources to manufacture and supply products that help people around the world live healthy, full lives. We are committed to using them as responsibly as possible to preserve a healthy environment \u2014 now and for future generations. A comprehensive environmental, health, and safety (EHS) approach and defined governance drive our efforts.\n\nOur Management Approach\n\nAbbott\u2019s EHS organization reports to the Senior Vice President, Quality Assurance, Regulatory and Engineering Services, who reports to our Chairman and CEO. The Senior Vice President is also the executive sponsor for the development and implementation of our environmental strategy, including climate change and water. The Board of Directors and its committees have oversight over Abbott\u2019s environmental, social, and governance practices. The Board has regular discussions with management on sustainability matters, as well as workplace, management, and Board diversity.\n\nemerging governance practices and trends, global compliance matters, and sustainability reporting.\n\nThree leadership councils support implementation of EHS programs, covering concepts from product and facility design to operation to sales and service.\n\nGlobal Operations Council (GOC)\n\n- Oversees operations strategy across manufacturing, supply chain, engineering, and EHS.\n\nCommercial EHS Executive Council\n\n- Sets EHS priorities, goals, and objectives for commercial operations.\n\nEHS Leadership Council\n\n- Sets EHS strategy and helps ensure execution of programs.\n- Builds company awareness and sharing of EHS best practices.\n\nPolicies, Regulations, and Auditing\n\nWe maintain policies and standards that align with best practices, regulatory trends, and requirements and seek to ensure we operate in accordance with applicable requirements.\n\nOur comprehensive global audit program monitors compliance with applicable environmental regulations. It also identifies potential risks to our business and employees. We evaluate EHS risk factors for each site annually, using insights to determine audit frequency. Following audits, corrective action plans are developed, implemented, and monitored where needed. The audit program also informs standards and regulatory training requirements for relevant employees through the identification of potential risks to business.\n\nOur EHS policies and standards are available online.\n\n* Abbott Granada in Spain and Abbott Temecula in the U.S. are Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) Core Certified Sites. For more information visit a4ws.org/certification.\nEnvironmental and Ecosystem Protection\nRecognizing the vital role protecting biodiversity and ecosystems plays in environmental management, we maintain technical standards designed to prevent unpermitted environmental releases. Each Abbott facility must comply with these standards as well as relevant external regulations.\n\nWe assess environmental risk from our operations and our supply chain, and we are working across functions to establish a biodiversity program.\n\nEngaging Employees\nEHS employees are trained on relevant regulatory requirements and Abbott\u2019s standards. We further engage employees in environmental efforts through evaluations of EHS leaders against annual EHS performance goals, dedicated forums for discussing priority EHS issues, and our annual EHS Awards Program.\n\nUtilizing External Standards\nWe consider Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification when building new facilities, and have certified 17 projects under LEED standards, including 1 platinum, 4 gold, and 6 silver certifications.\n\n2022 ENVIRONMENTAL CERTIFICATIONS\n\n| Certification Type                        | Number |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Total sites certified to ISO 50001:2018 and/or ISO 14001:2015 | 65     |\n| Total ISO 14001:2015 Certifications      | 51     |\n| Manufacturing Sites Certified            | 40     |\n| Non-manufacturing Sites Certified        | 11     |\n| Total ISO 50001:2018 Certifications      | 30     |\n| Manufacturing Sites Certified            | 18     |\n| Non-manufacturing Sites Certified        | 12     |\n\nWe also consider external certification \u2014 such as International Organization for Standardization (ISO) \u2014 where they add business value. By the end of 2022, 52% of manufacturing sites had been certified under ISO 14001:2015 \u2014 Environmental Management Systems \u2014 and/or ISO 50001:2018 \u2014 Energy Management Systems \u2014 standards. These sites represent 68% of our manufacturing site square footage.\n\nMergers and Acquisitions\nOur EHS Policy requires that EHS liability and compliance evaluations are completed on property and business acquisitions and divestitures. Compliance with our EHS Policy is also incorporated into all new acquisitions.\n\nAbbott develops multi-year integration plans to align acquisitions with our EHS management practices, standards, and policy. Integration progress is monitored and verified by an internal EHS compliance audit.\n\n* All figures are annual and approximate.\nENERGY AND EMISSIONS\n\nReducing climate impact is key to a healthy planet. We\u2019re working to deliver results against near-term science-based targets to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nOUR APPROACH\n\nOur energy and air emissions recording and reduction programs are outlined in our Energy Policy, technical standards, and energy guidelines. These activities are supported by and driven through our global EHS Governance team and cross-divisional Energy Council, with a focus on:\n\n- Energy efficiency in manufacturing operations\n- Low-carbon energy investments\n- Transportation fleet efficiency\n- Supply chain carbon footprint\n\nOUR FOOTPRINT\n\nOur first action in addressing our carbon footprint is to measure and track annual emissions. These emissions cover Scope 1 (direct), 2 (indirect), and 3.20\n\n---\n\n*Sum of percentages listed is greater than 100% due to rounding.*\nEmissions Targets Based on Science\n\nWe are continuing to reduce our emissions as well as strengthen our commitments to reductions for our global operations. In 2022, the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) approved Abbott\u2019s near-term science-based greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets and classified our Scope 1 and 2 targets as aligning with a well-below 2\u00b0C trajectory.\n\nWe aim to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 30% by 2030 (vs. 2018), with a program that targets reductions through:\n\n- Operational energy efficiency and reduced energy demands\n- Purchase of renewable energy\n- Electrification of industrial processes, spaces, and fleets\n- Conversion to cleaner fuel options\n- Integration of sustainable engineering technologies and concepts into projects\n- Business and manufacturing site-specific carbon reduction goals\n\nScope 3 emissions are estimated annually using the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard, referring to the categories applicable to Abbott. We are working with key carbon-intensive suppliers to reduce our Scope 3 footprint. Abbott has committed that 82% of its suppliers by emissions covering purchased goods and services and upstream transportation and distribution will have science-based targets by 2026. Read more about supply chain efforts on page 75.\n\nOur Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and Scope 3 emissions related to business travel and operational waste production, undergo third-party limited assurance annually. Our latest assurance statement is available on the Environmental Policy page of our website.\n\nClimate Change Adaptation\n\nWe\u2019re also taking action to protect people\u2019s health in a world impacted by climate change, focusing in two areas: tracking and finding solutions for emerging health threats and preparing frontline systems and communities. Across our business and in collaboration with others, we\u2019re working to identify and address emerging health issues, strengthen underlying systems, and help build more resilient communities. To read about our work to address emerging health threats, see page 16. To read about our efforts to build resilience in communities affected by disasters, see page 23.\n\nAssessing Our Climate Risk\n\nOur EHS Governance team, along with key Abbott functions such as Legal, Regulatory, Supply Chain, Risk Management, Business Continuity, and Finance, monitors emerging climate-related trends and regulations. This allows us to analyze potential business impacts, understand risk exposure, and develop appropriate mitigation strategies.\n\nThe Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) outlines how companies should report on climate-related risks and mitigation strategies. Our TCFD index details our disclosures. We also share information in our latest CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project) Climate Change Disclosure Response (2022). The environmental metrics we track and report against are available on page 98.\n\nRegulated Air Emissions\n\nAny Abbott facilities using substances containing ozone-depleting or hazardous/toxic air pollutants, as classified by local environmental protection agencies, adhere to applicable regulations. They also abide by Abbott\u2019s technical standards to help ensure protection of human and environmental health. Our Supplier Guidelines establish that the same standards are expected of Abbott suppliers.\n\nA More Energy-Efficient Global Operation\n\nTo make progress on site-specific and Abbott emission reduction targets, we are retrofitting equipment and advancing in-house energy management. Several sites collect sub-metered energy data to identify and quantify manufacturing inefficiencies. These insights inform a list of priority energy demand reduction projects across Abbott. We also build for sustainability, with environmental considerations front of mind during design and construction stages.\n\nFor example, our new facility under construction in Kilkenny, Ireland, will incorporate key sustainable design features including implementing energy efficiency, green building concepts, and effective waste management throughout the construction and operational phases.\n\n* CDP 2022 responses reflect 2021 reporting year.\nOUR 2022 PERFORMANCE\n\nThroughout 2022, absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions production decreased by 0.4% compared to 2021. When adjusted for sales, Scope 1 and 2 emissions decreased by 1.7% over this same period.\n\nPowering Our Facilities\n\nOur ongoing Renewable Energy Procurement initiative drives efforts to increase use of renewables. In 2022, we purchased 180 million kWh of low-carbon and renewable energy, resulting in savings of about 76,500 metric tons of CO2e. These savings were complemented by the roughly 2.6 million kWh generated from solar installations at 10 of our sites. We anticipate this value will grow in the future with support from the:\n\n- Launch of our Technical Guidelines to Purchasing Renewable Energy, intended to guide sites to increase efforts in renewable energy procurement\n- Three additional sites that received Abbott funding in 2022 to install on-site solar panels\n\nIncreasingly Green Transport\n\nTo manage fuel consumption in our commercial fleet, we have established requirements for vehicle fuel efficiency. We are converting our U.K. fleet from traditional internal combustion and hybrid vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs).\n\nTo date, we have replaced about 34% of the U.K. fleet with EVs, with a plan to transition the remainder of the U.K. fleet in the coming years.\n\nWe continue to encourage employees to reduce their commuting impacts through providing on-site EV charging stations as well as promoting car-sharing and public transportation use. As part of our site environmental sustainability efforts, 14 additional EV stations were installed at Abbott Park corporate headquarters, six EV stations installed at our Molecular business in the U.S., and 12 EV stations at our Nutrition business in Spain.\n\nSustainably Upgrading Our Facilities\n\nOur cross-functional teams search for ways to retrofit facilities for sustainability. At our nutrition site in Zwolle, the Netherlands, we installed a heat recovery and pump system. The system harnesses heat energy produced by other systems \u2014 such as chillers, air compressors, and production units \u2014 to heat water in the site\u2019s new aseptic production line, reducing energy procurement requirements. The installation has also reduced GHG emissions, resulting in an annual decrease of about 1,700 metric tons of CO2e emissions.\n\nAt our Rapid Diagnostics site in China, a team analyzed operational site energy consumption and identified opportunities for energy conservation. In 2022, the site implemented several energy-saving projects, including replacing air handling unit motors with more energy-efficient motors, installing a heat recovery system to recover heat from the air conditioning system\u2019s dehumidifier, and repairing and refurbishing steam piping insulation. These projects helped reduce energy consumption at the site such that by the end of October 2022, electricity consumption on a per unit production basis was approximately 30% lower than the previous year, while steam consumption on the same basis was about 36% lower than the previous year.\n\nWe also seek opportunities to reduce our emission impact beyond energy reduction. At a medical devices facility in the U.S., we implemented a process change to switch to a lower global warming potential (GWP) material. This change resulted in less air emissions and an annual GHG saving of about 1,300 metric tons CO2e per year \u2014 which represents about a 40% reduction of total CO2e emissions at this site.\n\nUpgrading Our Energy and Environmental Impact Tool\n\nIn 2022, we implemented upgrades to our Energy and Environmental Impact Tool, an embedded element in our engineering Front-End Planning process. These upgrades incorporate principles from industry standards and allow project teams to identify and model energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable concepts for inclusion in the capital project design.\nPROTECTING WATER RESOURCES\n\nWater sustains life, health, and ecosystems. It also plays a critical role in our operations. That\u2019s why we\u2019re committed to responsible water use in the communities where we operate.\n\nOUR APPROACH\n\nOur annual mapping process helps us understand where we source and where we discharge water. This provides us with greater insight into our operational impacts on local basins. Most of our sites discharge water to municipal treatment plants before release to the environment. Those that treat water on-site and discharge it directly are required to meet relevant local regulations.\n\nWherever we use and discharge water, we work to minimize the impact we have on the quality and quantity of local sources. In some instances, we have established initiatives that address the most pressing local needs \u2014 whether that\u2019s quality, quantity, or other concerns for those who rely on this precious natural resource.\n\nTailoring Our Management Approach\n\nOur water management approach centers around four principles, as communicated through our Position Statement on Access to Clean Water:\n\n- **Reduce**: Continuously work to improve water-use efficiency in our operations.\n- **Prevent**: Manage water discharges that could adversely impact human health or the environment.\n- **Educate**: Emphasize to our employees and suppliers the importance of protecting groundwater and other water resources vulnerable to overuse or contamination, and the role they play in doing so.\n- **Engage**: Develop and apply key water management principles and best practices across our company.\n\nWe tailor this approach, and our efforts to mitigate potential risks, to local circumstances to help ensure business continuity.\n\n*Sum of percentages listed is less than 100% due to rounding.*\nManaging Water Risks\n\nOur water management technical standard details requirements for monitoring Abbott\u2019s impact on resources in communities where we operate, including:\n\n- Implementing management plans and targets for mitigating risks\n- Engaging key local stakeholders to fully understand water-related risks\n\nWe use a context-based approach to water management, annually assessing for resilience, using the World Resource Institute (WRI) Aqueduct\u2122 \u2014 a global water-risk mapping tool \u2014 to analyze local water stress and evaluate against our internal water use intensity. This analysis allows us to tailor our water management systems accordingly to reduce impacts at sites identified as exposed to water stress.\n\nRead more about how we manage water risks in our CDP Water Disclosure Response (2022)* (section W4.2b).\n\nEngaging Key Suppliers\n\nWe initiated engagements with key suppliers on initiatives to reduce water quality and quantity risk. Read more about our 2022 supply chain efforts on page 75.\n\nOur Context-Based Water Risk Management Approach\n\nWater mitigation requirements depend on water stress and water use.\n\nAll our sites must comply with internal and external requirements regardless of their context. We also apply stronger mitigation measures in water-stressed sites and high water use sites:\n\n**Level 1: High Water Use**\n- Evaluate local water risks\n- Identify opportunities to mitigate water-related risk\n- Set and track water targets\n- Engage local stakeholders\n\n**Level 2: Medium\u2013Low Water Use**\n- Evaluate local water risks\n- Identify opportunities to mitigate water-related risk\n- Set and track water targets\n\n*Baseline water stress using the WRI Aqueduct\u2122 tool.\n\nOur 2022 Performance\n\nWe took concerted efforts throughout 2022 to reduce our water use and impacts. Total water intake in 2022 decreased by 0.2% versus the previous year. When adjusted for sales, water intake decreased by 1.5% compared to 2021.\n\nSee page 109 for key water metrics.\n\nWater Stewardship Certification\n\nIn 2022, 24 manufacturing sites were identified as operating in areas of water stress. Of those, 42% used less than 15 million gallons (57 megaliters) of water. Considering basin water stress, basin water depletion level, and water usage, 11 manufacturing sites were deemed high water impact.\n\n*CDP responses reflect 2021 reporting year.\nWe have targeted these high-water-impact sites for Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) certification, an achievement that indicates site commitment to:\n\n- Good water governance\n- Sustainable water balance\n- Good water quality status\n- Important water-related areas\n- Safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH)\n\nAbbott Granada in Spain and Abbott Temecula in the U.S. are Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) Core Certified Sites. For more information visit a4ws.org/certification.\n\n**Water Stewardship Management Practices**\n\nIn 2022, the EHS Governance team finalized Abbott\u2019s internal water stewardship management practices, complete with accompanying guidance and standardized templates. This process included engagement of subject matter experts across Abbott and approval from relevant councils to finalize and publish.\n\nThirteen manufacturing sites were identified as being in water-stressed areas but not classified as high water impact. We have engaged these sites via our community of practice, and all non-high-water-impact manufacturing sites in water-stressed areas completed efforts to implement Phase 1 of the accredited water stewardship management practices. The first phase focuses on understanding water management within the internal boundaries of the facility.\n\n**Supporting Local Water Needs**\n\nSuccessful water management should also consider local water and biodiversity needs. We work with local partners to support these demands. For example, our Granada site donates empty 1,000kg bulk containers to a local forest regeneration nongovernmental organization (NGO) that supports the irrigation of trees and gives a second life to these vessels. Our Temecula, California, site has also partnered with our waste disposal company to provide compost to a local winery to improve soil conditions and enhance water retention.\n\n**Site Upgrades to Optimize Water Use**\n\nTo drive greater water-use efficiency, we are committed to finding ways to upgrade our existing sites and processes every year. In 2022, one of our medical device facilities in California converted the site\u2019s turf to drought-resistant plants utilizing drip irrigation. This project will save about 4.5 megaliters of water every year at this water-stressed site. At a diagnostics facility in Ireland, an opportunity to recover reject water from a reverse osmosis (RO) treatment step was implemented to redirect the reject water back into the pre-treatment process. The project is yielding a wastewater reduction of approximately 1,000 liters per hour, ultimately saving about 8.8 megaliters of water per year. We also implemented a project at our medical device site in Costa Rica to collect graywater from various sources, such as laundry, condensation from air conditioning, rain, and cooling towers blowdown, and to use this graywater instead of potable water as feed water for toilets. This initiative resulted in annual water savings of about 14.8 megaliters.\nWASTE MANAGEMENT\n\nProducts have potential impacts on human health and the environment at every stage of their life cycle. We are committed to reducing these impacts beyond the manufacturing phase.\n\nOUR APPROACH\n\nOur waste management strategy commits us to finding ethical, economical, and efficient ways to reduce the volume and hazardous characteristics of our waste and helps ensure proper disposal practices. It also goes further, with a commitment to maximize recovery of resources and improve operating efficiency while reducing environmental risks and impacts.\n\nWe work to reduce the impact of our products and services \u2014 including the waste they produce \u2014 throughout the life cycle:\n\n\u2022 **Procurement:** We engage strategic suppliers to help ensure operational inputs \u2014 e.g., raw materials, processed goods, and services \u2014 are procured ethically and sustainably.\n\n\u2022 **Design, production, and distribution:** We consider the environmental and social impacts of how we produce and deliver our products.\n\n\u2022 **Consumption:** We aim for our products to be consumed and disposed of in environmentally responsible ways.\n\nEfforts to manage and reduce our waste footprint are supported by safe material handling training for relevant manufacturing workers.\n\nRead about our waste diversion initiatives with key suppliers on page 78.\n\nOUR OPERATIONAL WASTE FOOTPRINT\n\nWASTE GENERATED IN 2022\n\n- 22% Landfilled\n- 1% Other, Diverted\n- 49% Recycled\n- 24% Incinerated with energy\n\n66,000 METRIC TONS\n\nBENEFICIAL USE IN 2022\n\n- 5% Wood\n- 6% Unused product waste\n- 2% Corrugate and cardboard\n- 5% Cafeteria\n- 6% Construction and demolition\n- 18% Production waste\n- 40% Nutrition byproduct\n- 18% Other\n\n107,000 METRIC TONS\n\nBeneficial use is using material as an effective substitute for a commercial product or commodity rather than sending off-site as waste.\nClosing the Loop on Operational Waste\n\nWe are targeting a circular economy approach to reduce impacts from waste by 2030, aiming to achieve and maintain a waste diversion rate of at least 90%. In 2022, we reached a 90% rate by diverting 62% of materials to beneficial use, and a further 28% away from incineration without energy recovery and landfill.\n\nThis approach reflects our commitment to finding responsible and economical ways to reduce the volume of waste we produce while ensuring effective disposal practices. We are innovating processes to maximize resource recovery considering a circular approach.\n\nWe have standards and guidelines addressing hazardous and nonhazardous waste, as well as beneficial use activities. These include a range of waste management strategies, such as:\n\n- Incorporating preventive maintenance and process design to eliminate waste generation\n- Processing waste reduction through diagnosing and fixing problems that would otherwise result in waste generation\n- Reducing waste through product design, material input, and purchasing decisions\n- Partnering across other value chains to promote beneficial use\n- Segregating waste material properly\n- Recycling and incinerating with energy recovery\n\nManaging Hazardous and Chemical Waste\n\nWe are prioritizing reducing the proportion of waste classified as hazardous (around 12% of our 2022 waste footprint). Our waste management standard has requirements for proper management of hazardous waste, and for decontaminating biohazardous waste prior to final disposal. It also details training requirements for any Abbott employee or contractor working with waste.\n\nOUR 2022 PERFORMANCE\n\nWaste production decreased by 5.6% in 2022. When adjusted for sales, waste production decreased 6.8% versus 2021.\n\nIn 2022, two manufacturing facilities and four non-manufacturing facilities received Zero Waste-to-Landfill certification. This expands our total Zero Waste-to-Landfill program, which includes 39 manufacturing and 12 non-manufacturing facilities certified since our program began in 2012.\n\nReducing Waste and Increasing Waste Diversion Through Site Initiatives\n\nAbbott continues to look for ways to reduce the generation of waste and increase waste diversion at the site level. At our nutrition site in Singapore, the site\u2019s Waste Diversion Committee identified several opportunities to reduce waste and/or increase diversion rate. One such opportunity was to find a beneficial use for a raw material waste that was previously being incinerated. This effort will result in a waste reduction of approximately 128 metric tons annually at the site as this waste material will now be composted and used as fertilizer. Another waste reduction opportunity identified by this same committee was to divert food waste from incineration to the site\u2019s new food digester. This will result in approximately 18 metric tons of material annually beneficially used as compost.\nIn alignment with our goal to maintain a waste diversion rate of 90%, we seek opportunities to move waste away from landfilling and incineration without energy recovery. Examples that were initiated this year include collecting safety shoes to recycle the rubber soles, collecting expired safety helmets to recycle the hard plastic shell, and expanding a recycling program to include all single-use personal protective equipment (PPE).\n\n**Minimizing Waste Impacts Through Innovation**\n\nAbbott sites in California, Oregon, and Minnesota have piloted a technology that equips front-load waste containers with machine-learning-equipped camera hardware. The technology flags instances of improperly sorted waste (e.g., trash in recycling) during each container load and offers automated communications with recommendations to optimize container sizing and pickup frequency. Teams have leveraged this technology to pursue data-driven actions while optimizing waste vendor spends. Abbott continues to work with waste vendors in various capacities to implement innovative solutions to increase diversion rates.\n\nOur manufacturing plant in Brazil identified a unique waste disposal alternative through a partnership established in 2022 with a local company. Approximately 10.9 metric tons per year of gel packaging used to thermally protect received manufacturing materials was previously incinerated for disposal. This quantity is now used as an ingredient in this company\u2019s process, prolonging the useful life of these materials in alignment with our circular economy approach.\n\n**Working With Our Suppliers**\n\nWe\u2019re engaging suppliers in our efforts to lower the impact of packaging as part of our circular economy approach. Throughout 2022, we initiated engagements with five key suppliers to reduce the environmental impacts of inbound materials, discussing mutually beneficial opportunities to prevent them becoming waste. To support these discussions, we developed standardized supplier-facing information for use by cross-business supplier relationship managers.\nPACKAGING\n\nWe are continually assessing design and manufacturing processes to enhance our packaging \u2014 balancing the need for protecting the product with protecting the planet.\n\nOUR APPROACH\n\nRecognizing the impact our packaging can have on the environment, we\u2019re designing for recyclability, efficiency, and increasingly positive impact. Our Sustainable Packaging Council has designed a database for reporting predicted progress against division projections for packaging projects. These next-decade figures guide Abbott functions as they collaborate to design and manufacture packaging with environmental sustainability as a priority.\n\nOur 2030 commitment is to address 50 million pounds of packaging through high-impact sustainable design programs that employ circularity principles. Sustainable Packaging Guiding Principles inform existing packaging upgrades and target new, more sustainable designs.\n\nIncluding Suppliers in Our Circular Economy Approach\n\nWe\u2019re engaging suppliers in our efforts to lower the impact of packaging as part of our circular economy approach. In Australia, as part of our Organic Pediasure rollout, our shipper supplier has eliminated the need for packaging rework, and reduced the amount of wasted corrugate material by redesigning the shippers for the product. Read more about our supplier partnerships for environmental impacts on page 75.\n\nOUR 2022 PERFORMANCE\n\nSustainable Packaging Project Roadmap\n\nIn July 2022, we established a detailed three-year roadmap for sustainable packaging. The guide includes investment required and a KPI tracking system for our 2030 packaging commitment. Projects focus on the optimization of existing packaging and institutionalizing sustainable packaging design for new projects.\n\nWe are actively monitoring progress and establishing divisional reporting with data collection. We continue to socialize the importance of sustainable packaging and communicate broadly with our internal Sustainable Packaging Council to identify projects that contribute to our goal.\n\nTransitioning to More Responsible Materials\n\nOur medicines business is addressing over 280,000 pounds* of packaging by transitioning non-recyclable borosilicate glass bottles to a widely recyclable polyethylene terephthalate (PET) material. In addition, 1.3 million pounds* of fiber-based packaging purchased and consumed in Colombia was certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC).\n\n* Savings based on annualized reductions.\nWe work with key supply chain partners to understand the wider effects of our products. These partnerships inform stewardship by providing insight into steps of the product life cycle.\n\n**OUR APPROACH**\n\nOur Product Stewardship, Supply Chain, R&D, Engineering, and EHS groups collaborate to analyze how and what we source. Relevant teams partner to identify and mitigate environmental impacts of our packaging and products.\n\n**Hazardous Chemicals and Conflict Minerals**\n\nHazardous chemicals are those that pose a risk to human and environmental health. We comply with relevant regulations for product use, recycling, and disposal. Product marketing and sales comply with current regulations for hazardous chemicals, not just those in place at the time of development.\n\nConflict minerals include tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold \u2014 also known as 3TG minerals. We maintain due diligence processes for 3TG sourcing and use. We file an annual Form SD and Conflict Minerals Report with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, accessible via our Conflict Minerals webpage. As a member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative, we use its Reporting Template to survey suppliers on conflict materials.\n\n**Product Stewardship**\n\nProduct stewardship covers design to end of life. To help ensure compliance with applicable regulations, our product stewardship focuses on minimizing use of hazardous chemicals and substances of concern and managing these materials in products, packaging, and manufacturing processes.\n\nAssessments are conducted for substances of concern or restricted materials for new and changed products. When substances are identified, risk assessments are prepared, following evaluation of:\n\n- Whether continued use can be justified\n- The value of use versus reformulation\n- Any potential compliance issues\n\nThe evaluation process creates an opportunity to research suitable alternatives, including potential product performance and cost impacts. Business management reviews recommendations for next steps, including justification for substance use, product support strategies, and business risk monitoring and mitigation plans.\n\nOur product stewardship program tracks and addresses hazardous chemical legislation and supports the implementation of conflict mineral due diligence. We offer product stewardship training to all relevant teams, including R&D, Supply Chain, Procurement, and EHS.\n\nOur Corporate Product Stewardship organization updates all company areas on potential business impacts of changes to regulatory requirements for hazardous chemicals. Our regulatory intelligence process follows business level actions to confirm we remain compliant and helps ensure potential impacts are identified in a timely manner.\nQUALITY MANAGEMENT\n\nWe make our products and services as if they were for our own families. That\u2019s why we continuously improve our systems and processes to help ensure we deliver only the highest quality products and services.\n\nIN THIS SECTION\n\n65 OUR COMMITMENT TO QUALITY\n66 QUALITY EMBEDDED THROUGHOUT OUR BUSINESS\n\nLaboratory Technician Mary McGardle analyzing a test sample, helping ensure the quality of products produced at our nutrition manufacturing facility in Cootehill, Ireland.\nEvery day, people around the world rely on Abbott to provide life-changing products and services. Delivering high-quality, safe, and effective products and technologies is fundamental to our business.\n\n**ESTABLISHING A CULTURE OF QUALITY**\n\nMaintaining quality requires a company-wide commitment. That\u2019s why we work to embed it across our company. We have robust quality processes in place for all of our products and services, and we are committed to continually assessing and improving those processes as information, technologies, and practices evolve. We also work with our suppliers to promote the same commitment to quality and safety through qualification programs, audits, and other tools.\n\nWe maintain over 20 quality focused working groups led by our global subject matter experts, who delve into emerging issues and learnings from events to improve practices and processes.\n\n**Issues Responsiveness**\n\nWe are dedicated to create the life-changing products and technologies of the future and are vigilant they are of the highest quality.\n\nIn 2022, Abbott initiated a voluntary recall of powder infant formulas manufactured in one facility. The recall responded to reports of Cronobacter sakazakii or Salmonella Newport in infants who had consumed powder infant formula from this facility. After thorough investigation by Abbott and others conducted over the course of the last year, there is no conclusive evidence linking Abbott\u2019s formulas to these infant illnesses.\n\nAs we worked through this situation, Abbott worked tirelessly to help get formula into caregivers\u2019 hands, boosting production in our global network where we could to increase infant formula supply to the U.S., and shipping tens of millions of pounds from our facilities in Europe. We prioritized infant formula production at our Columbus, Ohio, facility, switching from manufacturing adult nutrition products to Similac and Alimentum liquid ready-to-feed formulas.\n\nWe also worked with the USDA and state Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) agencies in states where we were the contracted manufacturer so program participants could continue to obtain formula, free of charge, whether Similac or formula from another manufacturer when Similac was not available. We ran other facilities at increased capacity to help replenish the supply in the market.\n\nAbbott worked with the Patient Advocate Foundation to establish a Pediatric Amino Acid Formula Emergency Assistance Fund for patients on amino acid-based formulas who required hospitalizations or emergency room visits as a result of the amino acid-based formula shortage. The fund helped them with medical and living expenses incurred.\n\n**OUR PLEDGE TO CUSTOMERS**\n\nAt Abbott, we all put the people we serve at the center of everything we do. We make our products and services as if they were for our own families. We live Abbott\u2019s purpose of creating a healthier world where everyone can have better, fuller lives. We know that every one of us plays a vital role in bringing our life-changing solutions around the globe to the people who need them.\n\nEmployees signing Abbott\u2019s Customer Pledge during an event focused on our culture of quality and customer centricity.\nQuality and safety are paramount for Abbott; we embed quality and safety at the highest levels of our entire business.\n\nA MULTIFACETED QUALITY SYSTEM\n\nAbbott\u2019s Quality Management System (QMS) model and metrics are continuously reviewed to track site, business, and company-level performance. We capture and apply key learnings and best practices, including those from external intelligence, and industry-specific issues are examined and escalated as appropriate. We analyze root causes for performance indicators and take appropriate corrective actions. In targeted use cases, machine learning enhances potential risk predictions. To enhance data analysis and decision-making, the Abbott Quality and Regulatory (AQR) advanced analytics team is increasingly harnessing machine learning and artificial intelligence to modernize processes.\n\nWe conduct compliance auditing at the site, division, and corporate levels. Each operating business maintains a QMS and performs audits in line with governing regulations. Surveillance results feed into continuous improvement initiatives.\n\nOur quality system is based on established regulations and industry standards that govern the quality framework for Abbott businesses. We have policies, processes, and procedures that encompass the total product life cycle, including the design of cybersecurity controls, to help ensure quality design at every stage.\n\nQuality Governance\n\nOur operations cross several jurisdictions, with 88 manufacturing sites and oversight from over 120 quality and regulatory agencies. Our quality framework drives regulatory compliance wherever we operate.\n\nThe Senior Vice President, Quality Assurance, Regulatory and Engineering Services oversees quality globally, reporting to our Chairman and CEO. Executive management review of the quality system takes place quarterly to reinforce alignment with Abbott\u2019s quality policy and objectives, as well as relevant regulations. Quality and Operation heads also review quality and compliance metrics, including improvement plans on a quarterly basis. Business-specific quality and regulatory leaders are responsible for business-specific quality systems, updating each president on progress. The Board\u2019s Public Policy Committee reviews quality metrics, industry progress, and emerging issues.\nEngaging Our Supply Chain\nA comprehensive, risk-based program helps ensure suppliers impacting our regulated products and/or QMS conform to quality requirements. Suppliers are required to have a documented QMS appropriate for the products and services they provide to Abbott.\n\nWe monitor suppliers against performance criteria. They are classified according to potential impact risk level; this informs evaluation frequency, from every two (high risk) to four (low risk) years. Learn how we categorize suppliers for sustainability risks on page 73.\n\nAudits and evaluations aim to confirm suppliers can deliver to our requirements, maintain adequate QMS elements, and conform to relevant regulations and standards. Abbott chooses suppliers with quality management systems and training processes that meet requirements. On-site audits and additional agreements for high-risk suppliers verify operational capabilities and QMS requirements. Complementing our QMS, Abbott\u2019s quality assurance (QA) groups require that suppliers maintain training and competency programs and records.\n\nAssuring Commercial Quality\nCommercial quality assurance groups help ensure supply chain processes maintain product quality and compliance.\n\nThe One Abbott QA initiative establishes common management procedures for:\n- Operational excellence\n- Customer satisfaction\n- Supply chain assurance\n- Organization and professional development\n\nIt also aligns systems for managing suppliers, documentation, warehouse controls, distribution controls, nonconformance, and corrective and preventive action (CAPA).\n\nAssuring Quality Through Training and Certification\nNew employees are trained on QMS elements, with an annual QMS refresher course delivered to existing and part-time personnel. In addition, business-level Good Manufacturing Training offerings and corporate-level quality courses support employees with product quality responsibilities. Each business also offers tailored division- and site-specific trainings.\n\nIn 2022, we introduced new trainings on material controls and cybersecurity for all Quality personnel and created a curriculum to enhance critical thinking and technical writing skills. We continuously monitor industry hot topics, recalls, and audit findings to understand where we can augment our training offerings.\n\nAlso in 2022, we increased funding for pursuit of American Society for Quality (ASQ) and Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society (RAPS) qualifications, resulting in 31 additional employees receiving various quality and regulatory certifications through the ASQ and RAPS. Abbott now has over 1,000 certified employees.\n\nIndependent Quality Certification and Standards\nManufacturing operations hold Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) certification, including International Organization for Standardization (ISO) ISO 13485 and ISO 9001 certification for quality management. One hundred percent of Abbott\u2019s finished device manufacturing sites have been certified under ISO 13485. Of our international nutrition manufacturing sites, 83% are ISO 9001 certified and 100% are ISO 22000 certified. Abbott\u2019s Quality Manual and QMS encompass the requirements of the ISO standards and are implemented at all manufacturing sites. Our nutrition manufacturing maintains Food and Safety standards certification as well.\n\nAcross Abbott, our sites conform to various standards, including:\n- ISO 9001:2015, ISO 13485:2016, ISO 14001:2015, ISO/IEC 17025:2017, and ISO 22000:2018\n- NSF (National Sanitation Foundation) International\n- GMP+ FSA (Good Manufacturing Practices Plus and Food Safety Assurance)\n- HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points)\n- AAMI (Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation)\n- ASTM International\n- ISPE (International Society for Pharmaceutical Engineering)\nOUR PERFORMANCE\n\nDelivering quality and safe products is an ongoing process, and one we strive to improve year over year.\n\nProduct Quality Indicators\n\nRegulatory agencies around the world regularly assess our quality performance across our locations.\n\nTOTAL FDA WARNING LETTERS ISSUED\n\n| Year | 2021 | 2022 |\n|------|------|------|\n|      | 0    | 1    |\n\n2022 FDA CLASS I AND CLASS II RECALLS\n\n| Business     | Class I | Class II |\n|--------------|---------|----------|\n| Med Device   | 1       | 10       |\n| Diagnostics  | 0       | 16       |\n| Pharmaceutical* | N/A   | N/A     |\n| Nutrition    | 1       | 4        |\n\n*Abbott does not distribute pharmaceutical products in the U.S.\n\nOn May 16, 2022, Abbott entered into a consent decree with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) related to its Sturgis, Michigan, infant formula plant.\n\nQUALITY INSPECTIONS AND AUDITS\n\n|                                | 2021 | 2022 |\n|--------------------------------|------|------|\n| Quality/regulatory inspections by global health authorities | 559  | 560  |\n| % resulting in zero observations | 80%  | 77%  |\n| FDA site inspections            | 12   | 22   |\n| % resulting in zero observations | 92%  | 68%  |\n| Average number of observations per inspection | 0.42 | 0.64 |\n| Internal independent corporate-level audits to help ensure compliance with Abbott quality standards | 145  | 158  |\n\nReducing Human Error\n\nAbbott focuses intently on reducing instances of human error in our operations. Beginning in 2020, five of our diagnostics sites designed a human reliability program to reduce human error instances. Targeting manufacturing sites and distribution centers, as well as labeling, R&D, and third-party manufacturing operations, the program focuses on three actions:\n\n- Standardizing human error investigations and initiatives\n- Standardizing and improving guidance for human error CAPA investigations\n- Prioritizing improvements to high-risk human error processes\n\nBetween 2020 and 2022, the program delivered a reduction in human error nonconformance rate (vs. 2018\u20132019). Additionally, recalls due to human error have decreased by 87% since 2019 in our core diagnostics business.\n\nQuality Plant of the Year\n\nWe believe in recognizing and showcasing best-in-class work and so, every year, we name a \u201cQuality Plant of the Year.\u201d We invite employees to submit nominations, detailing quality performance, to our panel of judges, which comprises senior leaders from a variety of functions. To determine the winning plants, semi-finalists are invited to present to a panel. Senior leadership from Quality Assurance, Regulatory, Engineering, and Abbott\u2019s Senior Vice President visit the winners to present the awards on-site.\nCREATE A RESILIENT, DIVERSE, AND RESPONSIBLE SUPPLY CHAIN\n\nAs a key element of our business, Abbott proactively manages our supply chain to amplify our positive impact on the world. To reduce shared sustainability impacts, we work to nurture a global supplier network that is strong, responsible, and resilient.\n\nDiversified Synergies (DSL) leaders talk near their Detroit, Michigan, facility. DSL is a custom-engineering, co-packing and co-manufacturing solutions firm. Abbott works with the company as part of its commitment to advance diverse supplier development.\nNurturing a responsible supply chain relies on a management approach that emphasizes sustainability and resilience. We continue to evolve how we manage supplier relationships to minimize our shared sustainability impacts.\n\nA MULTIFACETED SUPPLY CHAIN\n\nOur global supplier network enables us to deliver life-changing products to millions of people around the world.\n\nOUR GOVERNANCE APPROACH\n\nWith a global footprint, we have an opportunity to leverage our supply chain for positive social and environmental change. We maintain a multi-layered governance structure that provides oversight of supply chain-related activities, helping minimize risks and maximize opportunities to address shared impacts.\n\nOur management approach places particular importance on supply chain sustainability and resilience. Each Abbott business is responsible for its respective supply chain, with enterprise efforts coordinated through our Global Operations Council (GOC). The GOC collaborates across the enterprise to set the framework for our supply chain, encompassing procurement, manufacturing, and logistics to improve supply chain adaptability, resilience, and flexibility.\n\nA TARGETED STRATEGY\n\nOur supply chain and procurement strategy embeds sustainability considerations into supplier selection and management processes. It is overseen by Global Procurement \u2014 a group spanning geographies, organizations, and businesses. Our strategy is designed to ensure the products we make \u2014 and what others make for us \u2014 are sourced and produced ethically while attempting to mitigate negative sustainability impacts.\n\nOUR 2022 PROGRESS\n\n88% spend increase from the 2020 baseline with diverse and small businesses\n\n130% spend increase from the 2020 baseline with black and women-owned businesses\n\n3,900+ SUPPLIERS engaged on sustainability risks and opportunities\n\nFor our work with suppliers to lower their environmental impacts, please see the Environment section.\nDESIGNING FOR SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCE\n\nDecisions made early in product development impact later stages. To safeguard our ability to manufacture and supply products after launch, we\u2019ve enhanced collaboration between our R&D and Supply Chain teams to reduce dependence on individual suppliers or bespoke manufacturing processes. In addition, we are updating design processes to place a greater focus on product and material life cycle management.\n\nThrough our Design for Supply initiative, we\u2019re developing Design Principles, tools, and supplier engagement models that address our needs throughout the product development life cycle \u2014 from design to scaled production. This allows Abbott to be more resilient in dynamic market conditions.\n\nGUIDING RESPONSIBLE SUPPLIERS\n\nWe are committed to upholding the fundamental principles of environmental protection and human rights and labor to drive long-term business success for Abbott and our suppliers, and to improve lives around the world.\n\nOur Supplier Guidelines establish expectations for suppliers we work with, aligning with internationally recognized and industry-accepted guidelines, such as the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI) Principles for Responsible Supply Chain Management.\n\nOur Guidelines focus on the following priorities:\n\n- Management systems\n- Human rights and labor\n- Health and safety\n- Ethics\n- Environmental management and compliance\n- Supply chain management\n\nThrough the Guidelines, we detail our expectations that suppliers conduct business in compliance with relevant legal requirements and industry codes. When asked, suppliers are expected to demonstrate compliance at the request and to the satisfaction of Abbott through our Supplier Responsibility program. We expect suppliers to fully support the Guidelines, driving sustainability principles into their own supply chains, systems, and employee practices. Our Tier 1 suppliers are expected to cascade the values represented in our Supplier Guidelines into their own supply chains and drive responsible sourcing practices to Abbott\u2019s Tier 2 suppliers and beyond.\n\nAdditional policies and guidelines also support supply chain sustainability:\n\n- **Supplier Diversity Guidelines**: Commits Abbott to equal opportunities for small businesses and those owned or operated by members of underrepresented groups.\n- **Water Policy**: Sets supplier requirements on transparency for water management practices.\n- **Climate Responsible Energy Policy**: Encourages suppliers to reduce emissions and improve energy efficiency.\n- **Animal Welfare Policy**: Guides work with animal-related suppliers and contract laboratories, including expectations that animal use in any testing or process should occur only after alternatives have been fully explored and rejected.\n- **Position Statement on Conflict Minerals**: Details process for understanding conflict mineral sourcing and use, including identification of in-scope products and suppliers, supplier engagement, and requirements to disclose the presence and source of conflict minerals in their supply chains.\nSafeguarding Business Continuity\nOur Supply Chain Resilience program helps further safeguard our business and supply chain against unforeseen events; developing people, processes, and tools for engaging suppliers on identified topics. We have updated this program to help standardize how we monitor and measure events across the supply chain. Nineteen risk metrics and 13 resilience indicators guide how we assess topics at different supply, product, or business points.\n\nChoosing the Right Suppliers\nWhen selecting suppliers, we consider environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors alongside business capabilities and capacities, financial health, and alignment with Abbott\u2019s vision. Classification models assess risk and shared sustainability impacts of potential relationships.\n\nOur Approved Suppliers List categorizes suppliers as high (critical), medium, or low risk, with critical partners identified as:\n\u2022 Supplying materials, components, or services that influence the safety or performance of our products\n\u2022 Our only approved source of materials, components, or services\n\u2022 Integral to our business continuity\n\nSuppliers are also evaluated on supply chain transparency and complexity, alignment with certification schemes, proximity to our customers, and their commitment to product security. Our process to verify alignment with quality standards is detailed on page 67.\nRisk-Based Monitoring and Evaluation\nWe have global policies and procedures for evaluating suppliers for potential sustainability issues in their operations, including those related to human rights and labor, health and safety, environment, and management systems. These policies guide Abbott\u2019s supply chain sustainability due diligence activities, including, but not limited to, supplier selection and management, compliance to Abbott\u2019s Supplier Guidelines, and participation in sustainability due diligence and remediation activities.\n\nWe take a risk-based approach to supplier screening, assessment, and monitoring, considering supplier size, industry, sourcing location(s), ESG performance, and Abbott spend. We maintain a supplier assessment process to minimize reputational and business continuity risks. This is particularly relevant to critical suppliers, but we also assess noncritical suppliers flagged for potential sustainability risk.\n\nSustainability Risk Screening\nDuring 2022, we took several steps to enhance this process. This included adopting additional third-party supply chain sustainability risk-mapping technology to assess and provide a more detailed understanding of our direct suppliers\u2019 sustainability risks.\n\nThese tools assign sustainability risk intensity factors based on a supplier\u2019s industry and region through referencing a variety of public and nonprofit sustainability, geopolitical, security, and infrastructure indices and sources.\n\nProduct Traceability and Critical Materials\nSupply critical to Abbott is identified through our Supply Chain Resilience program via risk and resilience screening of suppliers and components that are traceable to Abbott\u2019s finished product.\n\nAbbott helps ensure product traceability by leveraging tracking technologies and enterprise resource planning solutions for select materials. This way, we can help ensure compliance with regulatory, quality, and control requirements.\n\nEngaging Suppliers in Sustainability Risk Assessment\nWe engage with our suppliers of potentially high sustainability risk to explore compliance with our Supplier Guidelines.\n\nDesktop assessments, conducted by a third party, are tailored to the nature of the supplier\u2019s operations, location, and size. Assessments cover the topics of labor and human rights, environment, and sustainable procurement. On-site audits are conducted by an external auditor using a Workplace Conditions Assessment or other globally recognized sustainability audit standards to assess social and labor conditions, and health and safety, environment, and business practices at the site.\nPrevention, Monitoring, and Mitigation\nWhere issues are identified, suppliers are expected to submit corrective and preventive action (CAPA) plans within 30\u201360 days of receiving audit results. Abbott\u2019s supplier relationship manager and subject matter experts monitor CAPA implementation and determine if a reaudit or other action \u2014 up to supplier disqualification \u2014 is required. In addition, we encourage suppliers and other third parties to use our Speak Up tool to report concerns (see page 85).\n\nWhere applicable, we maintain strategic category- and/or region-specific supplier assessment and audit programs where sustainability risks have been identified (see page 72). Insights collected support better supplier engagement and inform sustainability initiative development at the supplier, sourcing, and/or business levels.\n\nDepending on the supplier audit program, supplier industry, and assessment results, audit frequency can range from one to five years.\n\nOUR 2022 PERFORMANCE\nImprovements in our supplier sustainability assessment process helped drive progress toward our responsible supply chain goals. It enabled us to focus additional resources on supplier assurance and strengthen internal and external collaboration with key stakeholders.\n\nIn 2022, Abbott completed inherent sustainability risk screening of strategic suppliers utilizing a third-party supply chain sustainability risk screening technology to assign sustainability risk intensity factors based on a supplier\u2019s industry and region. Through this exercise we screened 88% of spend affiliated with raw materials, components, and services that are directly traceable to Abbott\u2019s final finished products. Results of this preliminary screening drive prioritization and supplier engagements in 2023. Given the geographic extent, breadth, and complexity of our supply chain, risks may change over time.\n\nIn 2022, we continued partnering with suppliers from key sourcing categories, engaging over 3,900 suppliers on sustainability risks and opportunities and influencing over 49% of our supply chain spend. These activities addressed 260 potential high-sustainability-risk suppliers through desktop assessments and 74 high-sustainability-risk suppliers through sustainability audits.\n\nThrough our 2022 audit programs, we engaged with seven suppliers to implement corrective actions to address employee health and safety, environment, and supply chain management issues.\n\nOUR 2022 SUPPLIER SUSTAINABILITY SURVEY RESULTS\n235 suppliers participated in Abbott\u2019s 2022 Sustainability Assessment. Percentages reported based on suppliers to whom the issue is applicable.\n\n- 31% of water-stressed suppliers assessed have quantitative objectives set on water\n- 82% of key suppliers assessed have actions on energy consumption and greenhouse gases (GHGs)\n- 54% suppliers with ISO 14001 certifications at at least one operational site\nSTRENGTHENING THE SUPPLY CHAIN\n\nWe partner with strategic suppliers to address shared sustainability impacts, prioritizing responsible sourcing, supplier diversity, and continuity of supply.\n\nPARTNERING ACROSS THE SUPPLY CHAIN WITH EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS\n\nWe connect with global sustainability leaders to drive continuous supply chain improvements through industry and membership organizations, such as the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI), the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC), Diverse Manufacturing Supply Chain Alliance (DMSCA), and many others.\n\nSTRENGTHENING THE SUPPLY CHAIN\n\nThrough these partnerships, we engage across our supply chain to address shared risks and opportunities, including but not limited to:\n\n- Education and mentoring to improve sustainability awareness and management performance\n- Connecting to explore business continuity solutions and opportunities to source, design, produce, and distribute products in ways that respect the environment, society, and human health\n- Solutions to reduce shared sustainability impacts across Abbott and with our suppliers\n\nSTRATEGIC SUPPLY CHAIN INITIATIVES\n\nOur supply chain initiatives prioritize topics such as the environment and human rights and labor, and drive collective action in two ways:\n\n- **Issue-specific initiatives**: Cover the whole supply chain and address targeted topics, such as supplier diversity and emissions, water, and inbound materials management.\n- **Sourcing category-, business-, and region-specific initiatives**: Cover multiple risks and opportunities in high-sustainability-risk areas.\n\nDetails of our 2022 strategic initiative performance are available on pages 76\u201378.\n\nOUR 2022 PERFORMANCE\n\nThroughout 2022, we continued partnering with suppliers from key sourcing categories to address shared sustainability impacts.\n\nBuilding a More Resilient Supply Chain\n\nAbbott operates against a changing geopolitical and environmental backdrop. We continually monitor issues that could impact our operations and those of our suppliers, including political instability, acute and chronic weather events, labor shortages, and inadequate capacity investments.\n\nTo accelerate recovery following disruptions, we must have an in-depth understanding of our extended supply network. We have expanded mapping efforts to include sub-tier supplier data \u2014 covering who they are, what they supply, and where from \u2014 bringing greater visibility to our supply chain. Our businesses are moving diligently in developing multi-year plans for mapping sub-tier suppliers for most portfolio products.\nCommitment to Diversity\nSupplier diversity is a vital component of our 2030 Sustainability Plan. Our Supplier Diversity Program creates opportunities for diverse, historically underrepresented suppliers. In 2022, we expanded the diverse classifications to include Disadvantaged Business Enterprises to better engage Small Disadvantaged Businesses who, through their work with Abbott, have grown out of the Small Business Administration\u2019s (SBA) criteria of a Small Disadvantaged Business. We also launched a certification campaign to validate the diversity status of critical minority-, women-, LGBTQ+, veteran-, and disability-owned suppliers. Through an ongoing Tier 2 program, we engaged with prime suppliers to increase spend with diverse subcontractors, thereby expanding Abbott\u2019s impact.\n\nGoals for diverse supplier spend are incorporated into all Abbott divisions and sourcing category performance within our procurement organization. An economic impact analysis conducted in 2023 on 2022 data indicated that, through our efforts, we have supported over 7,500 jobs and generated over $4.5 billion in economic impact in the diverse communities where we operate.\n\nANNUAL SPEND OF SMALL AND DIVERSE SUPPLIERS*\n\n| Year | Dollars spend (billions) |\n|------|--------------------------|\n| 2022 | $4.41                    |\n| 2021 | $3.22                    |\n| 2020 | $2.34                    |\n\nWe are committed to partnering with organizations globally to advance diverse supplier development. For example, in the U.S., we have established an initiative with the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) to promote robust diverse healthcare supply chains. More information can be found on page 20.\n\nIn 2022, Abbott sponsored a minority-owned business to attend the Advanced Management Education Program (AMEP) offered by the Kellogg Advanced Management Executive Program.\n\n$663M spent with minority-owned suppliers in 2022\n$936M spent with women-owned suppliers in 2022\n$187M spent with veteran-owned suppliers in 2022\n$2,358M spent with small businesses in 2022\n\nFor full diverse spend classifications 2020\u20132022, please see Appendix section page 96.\nSupply Chain Water Risks\nBy 2030, we aim to work with 50 key suppliers in high water-stressed areas to reduce shared business continuity and water quality and quantity risks. To be successful, we anticipate that these deep-dive engagements will be long term, lasting from one to five years depending on initiative taken. In 2021, we completed a supply chain assessment to identify and prioritize supplier engagements for the coming years. This process identified 52 suppliers operating in water-intensive or -impactful industries, and that source to Abbott from water-stressed locations in 2022. Of the identified suppliers, 29 suppliers operating in water-intense industries and sourcing to Abbott from water-stressed areas were assessed to determine water-management maturity and water-risk engagement. Building on this work, we piloted the first five supplier engagements to understand their water-risk mitigation efforts and identify opportunities to collaborate and reduce our shared risks.\n\nAgriculture and Deforestation\nOur Food and Safety Council (including representatives from Supply Chain, Regulatory, and R&D) meets quarterly to address agriculture supply chain concerns. This includes due diligence of our sourcing practices and those of our agricultural suppliers to better understand environmental, social, and deforestation risks, particularly for soy- and palm-derived products. In 2022, 0.3% of total spend was with these ingredients, and 0.1% was from deforestation-affiliated regions.\n\nAnimal Welfare in Dairy\nWe are committed to improving conditions for animals in our dairy supply chain by supporting the World Organisation for Animal Health\u2019s Five Freedoms of Animal Welfare. In 2022, 99% of the milk we procured (by spend) was certified to animal welfare standards.\n\nChemicals of Environmental Concern\nAcross our businesses, Abbott works with strategic suppliers to manage risks from chemicals of concern. For example, Abbott\u2019s branded generic medicines business assesses suppliers in at-risk regions that handle and/or manufacture chemicals of environmental concern and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).\n\nThis program evaluates applicable suppliers based on supply chain criticality and environmental, health, and safety risk. Depending on the level of risk assigned, suppliers are evaluated via a questionnaire and/or an on-site visit. On-site audits may be triggered if a supplier is determined high risk from a questionnaire review, if it\u2019s had a significant incident, received notice of violation or negative media reporting, or is identified by one of our internal stakeholders.\n\nIn 2022, 17 self-assessments were completed by suppliers and 37 on-site audits were completed by Abbott or third-party subject matter experts.\n\nFollowing on-site assessment, suppliers are assigned a risk status and follow-up actions are determined, including supplier CAPA execution, continuation of business activities, back-up supplier identification, and/or supplier disqualification.\n\nSupply Chain Emissions Management\nScope 3 emissions account for more than 90% of Abbott\u2019s carbon footprint. A cross-functional team \u2014 including corporate and divisional EHS, Procurement, and Supply Chain functions \u2014 identifies our most carbon-intensive suppliers and sourcing categories with the greatest emission reduction opportunities.\n\nAs part of our 2030 strategy, Abbott committed to engage our key carbon-intensive suppliers to implement sustainable programs to reduce our Scope 3 emissions. In 2022, the SBTi approved Abbott\u2019s Scope 3 target, in which we commit that 82% of our suppliers by emissions covering purchased goods and services and upstream transportation and distribution will have SBTi-approved targets by 2026.\n\nAs of 2022 year end, approximately 30% of our suppliers by emissions covering purchased goods and services and upstream transportation and distribution have SBTi approved science-based targets, with about an additional 14% committing through the SBTi to adopt science-based targets.\nRenewable Energy Procurement\nWe continue to explore renewable energy sourcing options, increasingly purchasing electricity from providers with above-average renewable generation in their energy mix. In 2022, we purchased 180 million kWh of low-carbon and renewable energy, resulting in savings of about 76,500 metric tons of CO2e. These savings were complemented by the 2.6 million kWh generated from solar installations at 10 of our sites.\n\nAdditionally, we have replaced about 34% of the U.K. fleet with electric vehicles, with a plan to transition the remainder of the U.K. fleet in the coming years. Read more about this transition on page 55.\n\nTransportation and Distribution\nWe aim to balance emissions savings with the need for timely product delivery.\n\nIn 2022, Abbott moved freight 45 million miles across North America using multiple modes of transport. This included over 200,000 miles and approximately 100 shipments through intermodal transport, and nearly 45 million miles and over 67,000 truckloads sent by road.\n\n| TRANSPORTATION MODES (% OF GLOBAL SPEND) | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|-----------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Air                                     | 22%  | 26%  | 44%  |\n| Road                                    | 31%  | 25%  | 27%  |\n| Parcel                                  | 22%  | 29%  | 19%  |\n| Multimodal and Rail                     | 12%  | 6%   | 3%   |\n| Ocean                                   | 13%  | 14%  | 7%   |\n| Total Global Spend in Scope             | 100% | 100% | 100% |\n\nPackaging\nOur Sustainable Packaging Guiding Principles tailor how we design and develop innovative, sustainable solutions for our existing and new packaging. Read more about our approach to balancing the need for product protection without negatively impacting the environment on page 62.\n\nWaste Diversion With Inbound Material Suppliers\nAbbott\u2019s EHS, Procurement, and Supply Chain teams are committed to working with key suppliers on waste diversion initiatives for both the waste we generate in our operations and the inbound materials that become waste. Read more about our work with suppliers and waste programs on page 61.\n\nReuse and Responsible Waste Management\nWe partner with key suppliers to reduce the environmental impacts of materials sent to Abbott that become waste in our operations and to responsibly dispose of waste, including diverting as much as possible from landfill and incineration without energy recovery. Our technical standard for vendor evaluation and approval mandates ethical, responsible waste management approaches and aims to minimize associated risks. For manufacturing sites producing over 1,200kg of hazardous waste annually, our Waste Vendor Assessment program requires waste vendor audits at least every five years.\n\nWe maintain an IT standard for evaluating and approving vendors for electronic disposition, ensuring responsible recycling and, where viable, resale of used IT assets. In 2022, we continued our partnership with two primary IT asset disposition vendors to recycle 283 U.S. metric tons and resell an additional 71 U.S. metric tons of electronic equipment.\nTo help create the future of healthcare, we must continually build on the trust Abbott has earned over our 135-year history. We aim to innovate accessible, affordable solutions that transform lives, and do so sustainably. Robust governance helps ensure we have the leadership, policies, and structures in place to succeed.\n\nA Compliance Director and Data Protection Officer based in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, Juliana Ruggiero helps Abbott colleagues anticipate and detect compliance risks to help ensure responsible decision-making.\nAbbott is committed to strong governance that is aligned with stakeholder interests.\n\n**OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS**\n\nAbbott\u2019s Board of Directors consists of our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Robert B. Ford, and 11 other independent directors including a Lead Independent Director.\n\nThroughout the year, the Board and its committees review Abbott\u2019s corporate governance structures, taking into account the results of the annual shareholders\u2019 meeting and other shareholder feedback; the results of annual Board, committee, and director assessments; regulatory developments; and evolving trends in the areas of corporate governance, compensation, and sustainability.\n\nFor more information about the Board and its committees, including details of Board members and committee functions, visit The Board of Directors and Its Committees section in our 2023 Proxy Statement.\n\n**BOARD DIVERSITY AND COMPOSITION**\n\nWhen identifying nominees to serve as members of the Board of Directors, the Nominations and Governance Committee seeks to balance the Board\u2019s diversity of relevant experience, areas of expertise, ethnicity, gender, and geography.\n\nOur 12 directors comprise a well-balanced and highly qualified Board, with diverse backgrounds, skills, and experiences.\n\n**Expertise Aligned With Abbott\u2019s Diversified Operating Model and Long-Term Strategy:**\n\n- Healthcare and medical device industry\n- Finance and accounting\n- Risk management, including data protection and cybersecurity\n- Global supply chain, operations, and infrastructure management\n- Regulatory and compliance\n- Consumer products\n- Leadership expertise in multinational corporations, diverse business models, government, and the military\nBOARD OVERSIGHT\n\nThe Board has risk oversight responsibility for Abbott, which it administers directly and with assistance from its committees. Throughout the year, the Board and its committees engage with management to discuss a wide range of enterprise risks.\n\nRISK ASSESSMENT\n\nOur enterprise risk management (ERM) process evaluates likelihood, impact, and velocity of risks that potentially impact business performance. At Abbott, we have four reportable business segments with 13 global businesses, each with unique markets, competitors, and risk. In order to maintain the flexibility required to appropriately manage the unique risks within each business, risk management is a core job responsibility for our Executive Leadership, who identifies, owns, and manages the risks embedded within their respective businesses. This drives a culture that aligns ownership with business strategy.\n\nOur ERM Network team \u2014 16 functional experts led by Abbott\u2019s Vice President, Internal Audit \u2014 integrates ERM throughout Abbott by working with management to establish a risk management framework that identifies, assesses, and manages key risk exposures. The ERM Network facilitates an annual risk survey that seeks feedback from our global leaders on enterprise risk exposure that exceeds existing mitigation plans. The results of the survey are presented to the Audit Committee.\n\nThe top enterprise risks are prioritized and used to inform strategic action plans. The Board exercises risk oversight by focusing on areas of high priority identified, including business strategy, human capital, cybersecurity and data protection, and Abbott\u2019s sustainability, environmental, and social responsibility practices.\n\nOur Office of Ethics and Compliance (OEC) has embedded risk assessment into Abbott\u2019s global compliance program. It oversees periodic compliance risk assessments and monitors the external risk environment. Factors assessed by the OEC include evolving industry best practices, government guidance, and enforcement actions taken against other companies. OEC risk assessments are completed at least annually for the countries in which we operate and for the business activities in which we engage.\n\nThese assessments include elements such as the affiliate business footprint, the external environment (including local regulations and enforcement as well as the Corruption Perception Index rating for the country), the controls associated with business activities, and prior internal monitoring, investigations, or audit findings. The results of these assessments help inform OEC activities, including training, monitoring, and other actions.\n\nWe also maintain an Anti-Corruption Compliance Enhancement (ACE) program that focuses on in-person reviews of business activities in selected countries in order to identify potential opportunities for continuing enhancements to our program, and include corruption risks in enterprise-wide risk assessments conducted by our corporate internal audit group.\nEMERGING RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nWe also analyze emerging situations that represent potential risks and opportunities for Abbott.\n\n| EMERGING RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES | ABBOTT\u2019S RESPONSE |\n|----------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Increased Cost of Living          | The cost of living for patients and consumers has been steadily rising, as has the potential for reduced access to healthcare. This presents a challenge. We have to deliver innovative and reliable technologies to improve health outcomes, but we have to do so in a way that makes them accessible to the greatest possible number of the people who need them. One way we are responding to this is by rapidly expanding the use of direct-to-consumer devices, so that healthcare can now be provided closer to home and is not bound to a physical healthcare institution. We are harnessing the power of technology to digitize, decentralize, and democratize healthcare, which ultimately places more control of individual health into individuals\u2019 hands. In addition to improving access, our 2030 Sustainability Plan focuses on designing our technologies and products for broader access and affordability at every step \u2014 from every phase of our R&D process, to the materials we use, to manufacturing, to the ways we reach the people who need them. |\n\n| Disruptive Technologies          | In recent years, Abbott has embraced the latest digital and technology advancements, creating medical devices that are smaller, faster, more precise, and more connected. We see a future where even more devices are connecting patients and their doctors beyond the four walls of the clinic, putting timely, accurate, and secure data in patients\u2019 hands to help them better engage with their providers and manage their care. And while our leadership in this area offers us many opportunities for growth, this trend also presents a challenge as we face competition from technology players who are currently making strides into the healthcare sector. We view the proliferation of advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence, as an accelerator to our innovation and as an opportunity to develop products that meet the needs of more people in more places than ever. In addition to bringing the power of connectivity to our wireless implants, wearable sensors, and diagnostic tests, we are also improving health outcomes through enhanced precision and efficiency. For several years, we\u2019ve been using artificial intelligence in predictive analytics and maintenance of our diagnostic instruments, and monitoring of our manufacturing equipment. And our Ultreon software merges imaging technology with artificial intelligence to improve visualization of percutaneous coronary intervention procedures. Advances in technology have also changed how we run our business. We have operationalized automation to support several business functions, including in Talent, Quality, and Supply Chain management. |\nETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\nActing ethically and with integrity is foundational to building trust \u2014 in Abbott, our solutions, and the care we aim to deliver for people and the planet.\n\nGOVERNING ETHICAL PROCESSES\n\nAbbott\u2019s Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer (CECO) is the corporate officer responsible for leading our global ethics and compliance program and managing our Office of Ethics and Compliance (OEC). The CECO provides regular briefings to our Chairman and CEO, executive leaders, the Board of Directors, and Public Policy Committee. The CECO chairs Abbott\u2019s Business Conduct Committee (BCC) \u2014 a team of executive-level leaders and Abbott\u2019s Chairman and CEO. The BCC meets regularly to discuss potential risk areas and mitigation measures, to review compliance program performance and metrics, including plans for improvements, and to evaluate legal and regulatory changes and best practices.\n\nIn addition, dedicated business- and affiliate-level committees monitor compliance, provide employee training and engagement, and meet to discuss emerging issues. OEC staff members support each business and corporate function to help ensure appropriate ethics and compliance program implementation. Outside the U.S., regional OEC teams oversee the compliance program for all countries in which Abbott conducts business, including implementation of regional- or country-specific compliance requirements where necessary.\n\nCODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT TRAINING\n\nUpholding the highest ethical standards is the responsibility of everyone at Abbott. Offered in 93 countries and available in 32 languages, our online Legal and Ethical Resource Network (LERN) training educates employees on our Code of Business Conduct. The LERN program also shares practical guidance on recognizing and responding to legal and ethical issues. The LERN curriculum includes annual certifications on the code and conflicts of interest in addition to other training and education courses, with a key focus on interactions with healthcare professionals.\n\nEmployees are assigned LERN courses based on their role and responsibilities. Course topics include overviews of our Code of Business Conduct and Global Business Standards, fraud and anti-corruption, marketing and promotion, data privacy and security, handling adverse events, and understanding trade sanctions among others. The 2022 LERN curriculum included four new/fully revised courses, incorporating interactive features, and knowledge checks interspersed through the content. In 2022, over 99.7% of active employees completed the annually assigned Code of Business Conduct training course and certification.\n\nInteracting With Healthcare Professionals\n\nWe commit to interacting and communicating responsibly \u2014 and in compliance with local regulations \u2014 with healthcare professionals, patients, and consumers about our products and services. Where required, we report payments and other transfers of value made to healthcare professionals to relevant organizations or oversight bodies. Interactions are regularly monitored and audited, as determined on a risk basis.\n\nEthics and Compliance Week\n\nEach year, Abbott holds an Ethics and Compliance Week to drive employee awareness on anti-bribery and anti-corruption, as well as other business conduct-related topics. In 2022, over 63,000 employees across the company interacted with a Compliance Week kickoff email from our CECO highlighting our commitment to compliance. In addition, over 51,000 employees were reached with compliance-related messages from their divisional leaders. Other interactive regional and local engagement activities, including training and knowledge checks, resulted in an estimated 17,000 engagements with employees. Ethics and Compliance Week activities also included opportunities to nominate local ethics and compliance champions.\n\nEthics training is offered in 93 countries and in 32 languages.\nUpholding ethical practices and ensuring we comply with relevant regulations is how Abbott demonstrates its commitment to responsible business practices.\n\nSEVEN STEPS TO COMPLIANCE\n\nOur global ethics and compliance program \u2014 which is regularly reviewed by an external party \u2014 reflects the fundamental elements of an effective corporate compliance program as detailed in the Office of Inspector General guidance and U.S. Federal Sentencing guidelines.\n\nCompliance leadership, training, and communication are detailed on page 83.\n\nOur risk assessment process is outlined on page 73.\n\nCODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT\n\nOur Code of Business Conduct, available in 29 languages, is foundational to ethical conduct at Abbott. Every employee is required to read and certify adherence to the code annually. It and other policies are designed to align with laws, regulations, and industry guidelines issued by medical technology trade associations, including AdvaMed, APACMed, MedTech Europe, and Mecomed.\n\nOur Code of Business Conduct contains a section dedicated to promoting and selling our products with honesty and integrity. We expect product materials and communications will be balanced and truthful, consistent with the approved label in the countries we operate, and consistent with scientific evidence. We require compliance with each country\u2019s laws and regulations that govern how, where, and when we are permitted to promote medical devices, diagnostics, nutritional products, and medicines. Our code also explains that we may not promote or pre-sell a product that has not yet been approved or cleared by the relevant regulatory body, and any requested information beyond the scope of approved product labeling must be directed to the appropriate medical or scientific function for response.\n\nThese principles are also carried through to our Ethics and Compliance Global Policy on Business Standards, along with the expectation that all promotional materials are properly reviewed and approved in accordance with applicable laws and company standards. To further support this compliance, we also maintain systems designed to ensure business-wide alignment between our Global Infant Formula Marketing Policy and laws in our countries of operation.\n\nIn 2022, we completed a revision of our Ethics and Compliance Global Policy on Business Standards, which is applicable worldwide, to reflect regulatory and industry changes. This updated policy will be rolled out in all countries in which we do business in phases throughout 2023.\nREPORTING CONCERNS\n\nOur code emphasizes employees\u2019 responsibility for reporting noncompliance concerns, including those related to workplace discrimination or harassment; we strive to ensure they feel safe doing so without fear of retaliation. This applies to whistleblowing, or anyone reporting violations in good faith, with anti-retaliation principles and language included in our Global Compliance Policy on Reporting Concerns, Global Compliance Standards, and human resources policies, including Employee Problem Solving, Workplace Harassment, and Violence in the Workplace. Abbott encourages employees and others to report instances of retaliation. We investigate reports, identify remedial actions as appropriate, and appropriately discipline employees as needed.\n\nWe have defined avenues and processes for asking questions and reporting suspected or actual violations of our code, policies, or procedures. In addition to reporting to managers, the OEC, or Legal, this includes our Speak Up tool, through which employees and external parties, including suppliers, can confidentially and \u2014 where permitted \u2014 anonymously raise concerns of potential misconduct. Speak Up can be accessed by telephone, email, or internet 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nOur Employee Problem Solving policy supports information exchange and concern resolution. It applies to all Abbott employees, except where local laws or collective bargaining agreements dictate otherwise.\n\nAuditing and Monitoring\n\nOur Sales & Marketing Compliance Audit function and OEC-led monitoring process assess compliance with our Ethics and Compliance Global Policy on Business Standards and local procedures. Compliance Audit has the primary function to plan, direct, and manage sales and marketing compliance audits of global operations such as select third parties supporting Abbott\u2019s businesses, including those promoting our products to customers on our behalf. Specifically, these compliance audits cover the following: U.S. Federal Health Care Programs (when applicable), Abbott\u2019s policies, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, privacy laws, and local industry codes on ethical business practices. The audit scope is designed to assess the effectiveness of the compliance program and includes transactional testing of compliance activities related to Abbott\u2019s interactions with customers and the responsible promotion and marketing of our products. Risk assessments are performed to determine the schedule and the scope of the audits.\n\nAudit reports are distributed to local and corporate management and include detailed findings and remediation points, which are subsequently tracked for implementation to help ensure business leaders are held accountable for making necessary improvements to processes in a timely manner.\n\nYearly results are presented to both the Audit Committee and Public Policy Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\nOEC personnel supporting each Abbott business unit and country perform an annual risk assessment to identify areas of potential compliance risk. Based on assessment outcomes, they then establish monitoring plans for the year, which includes selecting a risk-based sampling of interactions with healthcare providers (HCPs) (such as educational events, engagements with HCPs for services, and provision of sample or evaluation product) and reviewing supporting documentation to assess compliance with Abbott\u2019s policies. \u201cLive monitoring\u201d programs may also be utilized, allowing OEC personnel to directly observe HCP interactions. Monitoring data is analyzed and trended over time to identify potential signals or patterns requiring further evaluation. OEC identifies corrective and preventive actions designed to address the root causes of monitoring findings.\n\nIssues detected through auditing and monitoring are analyzed, investigated if necessary, and reported to management.\nInvestigations\nThe Ethics and Compliance Officer (or delegated vendor/personnel) adds every potential code violation report \u2014 including those related to discrimination and harassment \u2014 to a database. These reports are categorized by issue type and investigated by the appropriate function so OEC can determine if action is required. Periodic audits of this process help ensure investigations are conducted as quickly and thoroughly as possible.\n\nAll reports of potential code violations \u2014 including those related to discrimination and harassment \u2014 by employees and third parties who perform certain services on our behalf are thoroughly investigated. Any employee violating our Code of Business Conduct, policies, or procedures is subject to appropriate disciplinary action, which may include termination. Employees refusing to cooperate in investigations \u2014 or knowingly reporting false concerns, or ones intended to threaten, intimidate, or retaliate \u2014 may also be subject to disciplinary action. Disciplinary actions can range from coaching and retraining to verbal or written warnings, financial penalties, or termination. Managers are made aware of disciplinary actions associated with investigations and may take this into account when conducting performance assessments. In addition, Abbott\u2019s recoupment policy allows the company to seek recoupment of incentive compensation, and/or existing awards, or reduce future awards if it determines that a senior executive engaged in significant misconduct or failed in a supervisory capacity.\n\nWe regularly report on investigations to our Board of Directors and senior management and communicate results to the appropriate OEC staff and business leaders.\n\nTHIRD-PARTY COMPLIANCE\nAll third parties (for example, distributors, dealers, wholesalers, resellers, and marketing partners promoting and selling Abbott products) with whom Abbott works are expected to hold themselves to the same ethical and legal compliance standards as Abbott does; we detail our expectations in Third-Party Guidelines, available online in 18 languages. In addition, our Third-Party Compliance Process is designed to address corruption and bribery risks arising from third parties interacting with government officials or healthcare providers on our behalf outside the U.S. Our process requires Abbott businesses, subsidiaries, and affiliates outside the U.S. to complete due diligence before engaging third parties, including screening suppliers, identifying high-risk partners, and monitoring and mitigating potential risks. Potential partners must answer detailed questionnaires, while an external vendor engaged by Abbott performs due diligence background checks on risks, including:\n\n- Corruption\n- Fraud\n- Organized crime\n- Regulatory breaches\n- Human rights and labor abuses\n- Social accountability\n- Arms trafficking and war crimes\n- Violations of government-imposed sanctions\n- Terrorism\n- Money laundering\n- Anti-competitive behavior\n\nWe also provide third parties with training on these Third-Party Guidelines and on anti-corruption issues, using OEC training materials designed to guide country-specific training, particularly with suppliers that promote products to HCPs on our behalf. An e-learning platform provides and tracks online training for third parties undergoing due diligence. In October 2022, we launched a multilingual training video that must be viewed by third parties before they can successfully complete Abbott\u2019s due diligence screening process. The curriculum has been completed by all third parties that have undertaken the screening process since launch.\n\nA Third-Party Compliance Process addresses corruption and bribery risks arising from interactions with government officials or HCPs on our behalf outside the U.S. It requires Abbott businesses, subsidiaries, and affiliates outside the U.S. to complete due diligence before engaging third parties, including screening suppliers, identifying high-risk partners, and monitoring and mitigating potential risks.\n\nWhere risks are identified, appropriate remedial action is taken, including additional contract terms, auditing, monitoring, training, or disqualification/rejection. We routinely update the Third-Party Compliance Process to continually protect against bribery and corruption risks.\nCORRUPTION AND ANTI-BRIBERY\n\nWe interact with thousands of people around the globe every day. Safeguarding our business against activities that could be viewed as corruption or bribery are fundamental to our development of protocols and policies that are designed to evolve and continuously improve.\n\nPROTECTING OUR RIGHT TO OPERATE\n\nAs a publicly traded company, we are subject to external auditing of our books and records, with results periodically reported to the Board\u2019s Audit Committee. We commit to aligning with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act, and all other applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws. To protect our reputation and right to operate, we must ensure we never provide or accept anything of value to gain an improper advantage or inappropriately influence the use of our products. Our Global Anti-Corruption Policy, available in 29 languages, prohibits bribery and corruption in any form. Employees complete annual training on this and other related policies and procedures.\n\nPREVENTING ANTI-COMPETITIVE PRACTICES\n\nWe commit to complying with competition laws wherever we operate. These laws apply to several business areas, including competitor relationships, prices and terms of sale, and marketing and trade practices.\n\nEmployees are encouraged to contact our Legal team or OEC for guidance regarding competitor interactions and to report inappropriate conversations. Reports can also be made through our Ethics and Compliance helpline.\n\nRaising Employee Awareness\n\nOn International Anti-Corruption Day, our Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer (CECO) sent a company-wide email available in 22 languages to raise awareness of and highlight Abbott\u2019s commitment to combat and prevent bribery and corruption. The communication included links to important compliance resources such as our Global Anti-Corruption Policy, LERN training system, Abbott\u2019s Third-Party Due Diligence process, and our Speak Up portal to raise concerns.\n\nINTERNAL CONTROLS TO PREVENT BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION\n\nRisk assessments: Identify potential risk areas and mitigation measures designed to prevent improper behavior.\n\nPolicies, procedures, and training: Guidelines, training and education to raise awareness of anti-bribery and anti-corruption.\n\nSpeak Up reporting platform: For employees and external parties to raise potential misconduct concerns.\n\nInvestigations: For all reports of potential violations, together with appropriate remediation or disciplinary actions when needed.\n\nOEC approval: Approval by OEC may be required for activities or interactions that may potentially present bribery or corruption risk, such as the lawful distribution of brand reminders or items of medical utility such as textbooks or anatomical models intended for the use in HCPs\u2019 treatment of patients.\n\nIndependent Internal Audit team: Reports to the Audit Committee and verifies policy and procedure compliance.\nPROTECTING OUR PEOPLE, PRODUCTS, AND BRANDS\n\nEnsuring the authenticity of Abbott products is key to maintaining strong relationships. We want to assure people that they\u2019ll receive the level of quality they have come to expect from authentic Abbott products.\n\nPROTECTING PRODUCT AUTHENTICITY\n\nEfforts to mitigate counterfeiting and illegal diversion risks are overseen by our Global Security, Legal, Trademark, Regulatory, Public Affairs, and Business Unit teams.\n\nIn 2022, using advanced analytics, our Global Security team identified and removed over 500,000 illicit listings of Abbott products being sold online, helping ensure the safety of the products our customers are purchasing online.\n\nBusiness Unit and Business Support teams develop product identification playbooks (including authorized packaging, manufacturing locations, and typical shipping routes) to align with external efforts to increase fraudulent product identification as part of our preparedness and resilience efforts.\n\nSAFEGUARDING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\n\nThree processes help safeguard Abbott\u2019s intellectual property and trade secrets:\n\n\u2022 Employee education on trade secret protection and risk-reduction strategies\n\u2022 A comprehensive security vulnerability and mitigation program to proactively identify gaps and implement as needed\n\u2022 Abbott business- and industry-specific security risk mitigation and compliance programs\n\nSECURING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN\n\nWe are committed to eliminating criminal activities from our supply chain, including drug trafficking, terrorism, human trafficking, forced/child labor, cyber threats, and illegal contraband. We comply with all international customs laws, carefully selecting partners to prevent unethical practices and security threats.\n\nOur efforts exceed U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) enhanced Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (CTPAT) Minimum Security Criteria. We partner with CBP and an external vendor on a surveillance system that mitigates theft, counterfeiting, and illegal diversion risks. Additionally, we remain a Tier 3 CTPAT partner, enabling product movements in and out of the U.S. with expedited processing and fewer customs exams. In multiple countries outside of the U.S., Abbott has achieved recognition as Authorized Economic Operators (AEO) by complying with World Customs Organization (WCO) supply chain security standards.\n\nAbbott collaborates with our network of transportation carriers and logistics providers such as the Transported Asset Protection Association (TAPA) to meet industry security standards. These partnerships help ensure our products are delivered to our customers safely.\n\nENFORCEMENT PROGRAM TACTICS:\n\n\u2022 Covert market surveys\n\u2022 Removing counterfeit products and sites\n\u2022 Halting unauthorized product sales\n\u2022 Providing contract security language and enforcing policies with authorized resellers\n\u2022 Identifying and removing illicit actors via paid searches\n\u2022 Reporting fake social media accounts\n\u2022 Eliminating illegitimate and cybersquatted sites\n\u2022 Training of customs and other enforcement officials to recognize and interdict counterfeit and illegally diverted Abbott products\nPUBLIC POLICY ENGAGEMENT\n\nPublic policy can positively impact societal health. Abbott engages in ongoing dialogue with policymakers, trade associations, and thought leaders to encourage policies that support access to our innovations.\n\nIMPACTING POLICY SOLUTIONS\n\nTo help ensure our policy engagement complies with our own standards as well as relevant laws, we practice ethical behavior and transparency in activities as guided by our Code of Business Conduct. All public policy activities comply with applicable laws and regulations and adhere to Abbott policies.\n\nOur activities aim to shape policies that impact our company and benefit people who need our products. Abbott, relevant Abbott employees, and external lobbyists and firms register as lobbyists and file lobbying and contribution disclosures as required by applicable law.\n\nThe Board of Directors\u2019 Public Policy Committee oversees our Government Affairs function and any public policy issues that could impact our business, performance, or public image. This includes reviewing political participation, such as advocacy priorities, political contributions, lobbying activities, and trade association memberships.\n\nPOLITICAL ACTIVITY PARTICIPATION\n\nThe Abbott Employee Political Action Committee (AEPAC) contributes to U.S. federal state and local candidates and political organizations. We support those that we believe understand how government actions impact medical access, and those that will promote continued medical progress.\n\nAll U.S. political activities are approved by Abbott\u2019s Government Affairs function, covering advocacy at federal, state, and local levels, and managing relationships with trade associations and similar groups. Our State Government Affairs function provides further oversight of state-level advocacy, while the U.S. Congress and federal government fall under our Federal Government Affairs office.\n\nPer the U.S. Lobbying Disclosure Act, Abbott is committed to the ongoing disclosure of political contributions and lobbying expenditures, filing a quarterly report, including:\n\n- Total federal lobbying expenditures\n- Name of the specific legislation or subject that was the topic of communication\n- Any Abbott individuals who lobbied on our behalf\n- Which legislative body or executive branch was contacted\n\nIn 2022, Abbott reported approximately $4.2 million in U.S. federal lobbying.\n\nAdditionally, Abbott has ranked in the first tier on the CPA-Zicklin Index for our election-related spending transparency and accountability. Read more on the Corporate Political Participation page of our website.\n\nU.S. TRADE ORGANIZATIONS\n\nWe are a member of various U.S. trade organizations such as AdvaMed, Business Roundtable, Consumer Brands Association, Medical Device Manufacturers Association, and other tax-exempt organizations, National Association of Manufacturers, and U.S. Chamber of Commerce that engage in lobbying and other political activity to champion our needs, the needs of our industries, and of the needs of people who rely on Abbott solutions. Our participation in these trade associations, and other tax-exempt organizations, is assessed annually by the Government Affairs function.\nENDNOTES\n\n1 Total number of lives improved was adjusted for indirect overlap between businesses using a binomial probability model, and only adjusted for direct overlap within a business where data is currently available to support the adjustment.\n\n2 Common rounding convention utilized, see appendix for detailed data.\n\n3 Data on file, Abbott Diabetes Care.\n\n4 Among patient-applied sensors.\n\n5 FreeStyle Libre 3 User Manual.\n\n6 Notifications will only be received when alarms are turned on and the sensor is within 33 feet unobstructed of the reading device.

In most countries, this means we offer benefits to full-time employees and part-time employees working more than a certain number of hours. We typically provide benefit programs above and beyond government requirements.\n\n18 Annual incident rates are calculated per 100 employees, assuming the average employee works 40 hours per week and 50 weeks per year. This is equivalent to 200,000 hours worked.\n\n19 Scope 1 emissions result from owned and controlled sources. Scope 2 emissions are produced during generation of purchased electricity and energy.\n\n20 Abbott estimates Scope 3 emissions using the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. Transportation and Distribution includes Upstream and Downstream. Scope 3 estimations may be adjusted annually to account for data availability and methodology enhancements. Sourcing category spend allocations are subject to change year over year in alignment with business strategy. Abbott\u2019s estimated Scope 3 footprint excludes known sources in Downstream Transportation, Processing of Sold Products, Use of Sold Products, and Investment categories. Collectively, these emissions are estimated to represent less than 4% of our total Scope 3 footprint.\n\n21 The target boundary includes land-related emissions and removals from bioenergy feedstocks.\n\n22 Manufacturing sites that produce over 25,000 metric tons of CO\u2082e annually are required to set additional carbon reduction goals.\n\n23 We define water recycling as the act of processing used water and wastewater through an additional operating cycle(s) before treatment and discharge.\n\n24 Abbott defines beneficial-use activities as sending material that otherwise would have been waste off-site to be used as an effective substitute for a commercial product or commodity. Beneficial-use material is used as is or in substantially the same form as it was generated.\n\n25 Abbott\u2019s diversion rate is calculated as follows: (Total Waste + Beneficial Use - Landfilled and Incineration without Energy Recovery)/Total Waste + Beneficial Use. Waste with an Other, Diverted fate is diverted from landfill and incineration without energy recovery.\n\n26 A Form SD is an Exchange Act Form used to satisfy special disclosure requirements implemented under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.\n\n27 This list represents a sample of the standards our sites maintain and that are frequently used as indicators of product quality.\n\n28 The program focuses on Abbott manufacturing sites in Dallas, Texas; Lake County, Illinois; Longford, Ireland; Sligo, Ireland; and Wiesbaden, Germany.\n\n29 Supplier diversity key performance indicators (KPIs) are calculated using the U.S. government fiscal year (October 1 \u2013 September 30). Spend data is for U.S. and Puerto Rico for 2022 reporting. 2022 target for annual spend of small and diverse suppliers is $3.27 billion.\n\n30 We do not use palm oil in our products. However, we use sustainably sourced soy- and palm-derived ingredients (such as palm nuts and medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) oil), which can be affiliated with deforestation.\n\n31 Includes China, Europe, India, and Latin America.\n\n32 On-site audits may be repeated every three to five years.\n\n33 Applies to both full- and part-time employees.\n\n34 Laws that prohibit agreements and practices that eliminate or discourage competition.\n\n35 Including marketplaces, apps, websites, and social media. Abbott trademarks and products in-licensed by Abbott are shown in italics in the text of this report.\nSustainability reporting is deeply engrained at Abbott \u2014 stretching all the way back to our first reports in the early 1970s. Since then, we have continued to evolve our disclosure practices to share more, and increasingly transparent, progress information.\n\nWe align our reporting with various environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings and sustainability indices, including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), and the World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP).\n\nAdditional sustainability reports and performance updates, including country reports for key markets, can be found on the Sustainability Reporting page of our website.\n\nOur policies help Abbott meet standards in countries where we operate, with many publicly available on the Policies page of our website.\n\nSCOPE OF THIS REPORT\n\nAll financial information is stated in U.S. dollars.\n\nAll data reflect Abbott\u2019s activities, with a focus on 2022 results. The boundary of our reporting, unless otherwise noted, is all activities under Abbott\u2019s global, operational control, as consolidated in our financial reporting.\n\nAll Abbott trademarks appear in italics throughout this report.\n\nREPORTING FEEDBACK\n\nDevelopment of our sustainability strategy was informed by the expertise of several external sources. These experts also guide stakeholder engagements, the development of our Responsibility webpages, and the production of this report. We gratefully acknowledge the counsel we receive from Corporate Citizenship, Flag, and WBCSD, among others. Working with these groups better informs our reporting approach, keeps us abreast of external expectations, and helps us identify areas for strengthening stakeholder engagement.\n\nWe welcome feedback on our report. Please send us an email at responsibility@abbott.com to share yours.\n\nEXTERNAL ASSURANCE\n\nWe engaged Apex Companies, an independent assurance provider, to conduct limited assurance of selected 2022 environmental and safety data. Our website includes a PDF of the Apex Assurance Statement.\nTo build our 2030 Sustainability Plan, an in-depth, two-year planning process began with a detailed analysis of over 200 topics that were relevant to internal and external stakeholders, which we prioritized by impact to our long-term business strategy, enterprise risk management (ERM) process, and most important ESG topics.\n\n**A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH**\n\nSupported by external consultants Corporate Citizenship, we took a robust approach to identifying and ranking Abbott\u2019s ESG priority issues.\n\n1. **Conduct extensive research on potential issues:** Included peer and competitor benchmarking, emerging issue tracking, customer and ratings and rankings organization engagement, best practices identification, and detailed analysis of over 200 sustainability topics.\n\n2. **Stakeholder interviews:** Conducted interviews with over 100 internal and external stakeholders, including customers, suppliers, investors, healthcare providers, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), sustainability experts, and employees.\n\n3. **Issue ranking:** Using feedback from the interview process, our Executive Leadership team prioritized topics according to importance to stakeholders and importance to the future success of our business. Considerations included the relationship of each issue to our enterprise risk management (ERM) process. The information supported development of our ESG priorities matrix and ESG topics that will drive our strategy over the next 5\u201310 years.\n\n4. **Working groups:** Created working groups to address each priority issue. Our Finance and Corporate Audit teams were engaged to help ensure Abbott\u2019s targets are integrated into our business strategy and financial plan.\n\n5. **Sustainability Plan summit:** To define our 2030 Sustainability Plan goals, targets, and key performance indicators (KPIs), we held a day-long summit with more than 100 cross-company leaders. Leaders offered cross-business and cross-function representation to help ensure alignment across the global business. Outcomes of the summit have guided our progress, drive improvement, and help ensure Abbott\u2019s future competitiveness.\n\n**OUR ESG PRIORITIES MATRIX**\n\n| Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 |\n|--------|--------|--------|\n| Animal Welfare | Climate Change | Access and Affordability |\n| Human Rights | Packaging and Waste | Innovation |\n| Clinical Trial Transparency | Transparency and Reporting | Talent |\n| Executive Compensation | Cybersecurity and Data Privacy | Data |\n| Antimicrobial Resistance | Corporate Governance | Government and Regulation |\n| Water | Product Quality and Safety | |\n| | Supply Chain | |\n| | Ethics and Compliance | |\n| | Corporate Governance | |\n| | Government and Regulation | |\n| | Data | |\n| | Innovation | |\n| | Access and Affordability | |\n| | Animal Welfare | |\n\n**ESG PRIORITIES**\n\nGLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\n\nABOUT ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY DATA WORKFORCE ENVIRONMENT QUALITY MANAGEMENT SUPPLY CHAIN GOVERNANCE APPENDIX\nListening to stakeholders is vital to our success. That\u2019s why we maintain open channels of communication with various groups to understand pressing issues, evolving health challenges and needs, and the role Abbott can play as a global healthcare leader.\n\nWe engage stakeholders formally through the various associations and partnerships we hold memberships with. We also informally connect with stakeholders through various networks and organizations. Across our key geographies, local teams regularly review stakeholder engagement strategies, ensuring alignment with Abbott\u2019s wider methodology. Local engagement outcomes are reported in country-level citizenship reports or at local forums.\n\n**Customer Satisfaction**\n\nOur Net Promoter Score\u00ae (NPS) is an externally recognized metric for customer satisfaction. Internally, it is a key indicator of our ability to continuously meet customers\u2019 needs. As an example of our performance, the NPS for our diagnostics business increased from 32.2 in 2010 to 55.1 in 2022.\n\n**Suppliers**\n\n- Supplier Guidelines and other strategic policies\n- Supplier Sustainability Risk and Opportunity Mapping Assessment and Engagement Activities\n- External partnerships and industry organizations (e.g., DMSCA and PSCI)\n- One-on-one supplier engagements on reducing shared impacts\n- Speak Up hotline\n\nFor more details, see the Supply Chain section (page 69).\n\n**Employees**\n\n- Annual all-employee survey and other ad-hoc surveys\n- Annual All-Employee Meeting with our Chairman and CEO\n- All-employee Chairman and CEO communications\n- Business and functional town hall meetings\n- Employee networks\n- Abbott World intranet and myHR portal\n- Personalized information app\n- Weekly news digest\n- Weekly HR brief for managers\n- Yammer\u00ae groups\n- Employee Giving Campaign\n- Exercise Across Abbott\n- Employee volunteering website\n- Speak Up hotline\n- On-site digital displays, banners, and posters\n- Manufacturing site huddles/Let\u2019s Talk Sessions\n\nFor more details, see the Workforce section (page 38).\n\n**Governments**\n\n- Government affairs liaison\n- Trade associations/organizations\n- Abbott Employee Political Action Committee\n- Global Citizenship and Abbott Fund programs\n- Corporate Political Participation webpage\n\nFor more details, see the Governance section (page 79).\n## Key Financial Metrics\n\n### Sales Worldwide\n\n| Year | Dollars in Millions |\n|------|---------------------|\n| 2022 | $43,653             |\n| 2021 | $43,075             |\n| 2020 | $34,608             |\n| 2019 | $31,904             |\n| 2018 | $30,578             |\n\n### R&D Investment\n\n| Year | Dollars in Millions |\n|------|---------------------|\n| 2022 | $2,888              |\n| 2021 | $2,742              |\n| 2020 | $2,420              |\n| 2019 | $2,440              |\n| 2018 | $2,300              |\n\n### Dividends Paid\n\n| Year | Dollars in Millions |\n|------|---------------------|\n| 2022 | $3,309              |\n| 2021 | $3,202              |\n| 2020 | $2,560              |\n| 2019 | $2,270              |\n| 2018 | $1,974              |\n\n### Social Investing\n\n| Year | Dollars in Millions |\n|------|---------------------|\n| 2022 | $74.2               |\n| 2021 | $90.1               |\n| 2020 | $75.7               |\n| 2019 | $70.6               |\n| 2018 | $62.7               |\n\n### U.S. Employee Giving Campaign Results\n\n| Year | Dollars in Millions |\n|------|---------------------|\n| 2022 | $15.10              |\n| 2021 | $15.00              |\n| 2020 | $7.58               |\n| 2019 | $6.71               |\n| 2018 | $6.58               |\n\nTotals and percentage changes may differ from listed metrics due to rounding.

It is assumed that downstream transportation and distribution emissions are affiliated with retail space to store and sell products, which is marginal in the transportation and distribution category.\n\n\u2021Abbott\u2019s estimated Scope 3 footprint excludes known sources in Downstream Transportation, Processing of Sold Products, Use of Sold Products, and Investment categories. Collectively, these omissions are estimated to represent less than 4% of our total Scope 3 footprint.\n\n\u0394Abbott assumes that the majority of its products are not further processed after they leave Abbott\u2019s manufacturing facilities.\n\nTotals and percentage changes may differ from listed metrics due to rounding.

To ensure data accuracy, the most accurate number has been used. Refer to page 119 for endnotes.\nAll environmental data has been adjusted to account for acquisitions and divestitures, in accordance with the methodology prescribed in the World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP). We report data from acquisitions as soon as is practical.\n\n(a) Abbott Fund, Citizenship, business contributions and product donations.\n\n(b) 2021 marked the first year of our enhanced employee giving program. See page 23.\n\n(c) These percentages are as of December 31. Percentages represent a count of U.S. employees, excluding the Rapid Diagnostics business.\n\n(d) Legacy Alere is included in Health and Safety metrics beginning in 2019.\n\n(e) Annual incident rates are calculated per 100 employees, assuming the average employee works 40 hours per week and 50 weeks per year. This is equivalent to 200,000 hours worked.\n\n(f) This change represents 2022 progress toward our 2030 goal of 30% reduction from 2018.\n\n(g) This is the percentage change from 2021 to 2022.\n\n(h) This is the baseline year.\n\n(i) Progress toward 2030 carbon goal is reported using the GHGP Scope 2 market-based methodology.\n\n(j) Scope 2 emissions are calculated using the GHGP market-based methodology. Per the GHGP, where market-based information is not available, location-based results have been used as proxy.\n\n(k) Reported Purchased Fuels Scope 1 sources consist of fuel consumed by manufacturing, R&D, and warehouse facilities under Abbott\u2019s control; sales fleet; and Abbott-owned aviation.\n\n(l) Per the GHGP, Scope 1 Refrigerant CO\u2082e emissions include only those covered in the Kyoto Protocol.\n\n(m) Reported Scope 2 sources consist of energy directly purchased by Abbott, such as electricity, steam, and hot and chilled water, as well as emissions from leased locations. Unless specified otherwise, emissions are calculated according to the GHGP Scope 2 market-based method.\n\n(n) Abbott\u2019s non-energy consumption greenhouse gas emissions, such as refrigerant releases and process air emissions, are omitted. The total CO\u2082 equivalents from non-energy sources are noted in the Total Emissions (Scope 1 and 2) table.\n\n(o) Abbott estimates Scope 3 emissions using the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. Transportation and Distribution includes Upstream and Downstream. Scope 3 estimations may be adjusted annually to account for data availability and methodology enhancements. Sourcing category spend allocations are subject to change year over year in alignment with business strategy. Abbott\u2019s estimated Scope 3 footprint excludes known sources in Downstream Transportation, Processing of Sold Products, Use of Sold Products, and Investment categories. Collectively, these omissions are estimated to represent less than 4% of our total Scope 3 footprint.\n\n(p) This reflects emissions from fuel combusted by manufacturing, R&D, and warehouse facilities under Abbott\u2019s control.\n\n(q) Water-stressed locations have been determined using the WRI Aqueduct\u2122 global water risk mapping tool. Sites rated as having high- or extremely high-baseline water stress in the tool are classified as being water stressed.\n\n(r) Water withdrawal is equivalent to water intake.\n\n(s) Abbott\u2019s diversion rate is calculated as follows: (Total Waste + Beneficial Use - Landfilled and Incineration without Energy Recovery)/Total Waste + Beneficial Use. Commercial and other building activities, specific to beneficial use, are included in this rate starting in 2019. Waste with an unknown disposal fate is included with landfill fate. Waste with an Other, Diverted fate is diverted from landfill and incineration without energy recovery.\n\n(t) In 2018, data represents manufacturing, R&D, and warehouse facilities under Abbott\u2019s control. Commercial and other building beneficial use and waste fate data in alignment with current fates were not collected prior to 2019.\n\n(u) Waste-generation data does not include materials that are reused beneficially.\n\n(v) Abbott defines beneficial-use activities as sending material that otherwise would have been wasted off-site to be used as an effective substitute for a commercial product or commodity. Beneficial-use material is used as is or in substantially the same form as it was generated.\n\n(w) Per our environmental, health, and safety metrics reporting protocols, metrics data published in previous years were adjusted in this report to reflect minor corrections, method adjustments, etc. We report data from acquisitions as soon as is practical.

See page 75 for more information on how we work with our suppliers.\n| | We regularly assess discharge levels at each of Abbott\u2019s antibiotic and antifungal manufacturing sites. We quantify antimicrobial discharge levels in the wastewater by conducting a high-level theoretical assessment of the potential discharge risk (called \u201cmass balance\u201d), and whenever we see that results could be out of compliance, we follow up with chemical analysis of water samples for a more precise assessment. For sites where multiple active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are produced, we consider the lowest antimicrobial discharge limits available among all publicly available databases, including those set by the AMR Industry Alliance. If limits are not publicly available, our preclinical safety laboratory calculates them based on European Medicines Agency (EMA) guidelines.\n| | When setting antimicrobial discharge limits, we consider the lowest predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) and those with the biggest batch size. Abbott\u2019s PNECs are risk-based. For antimicrobials, Abbott has a default PNEC system based on an internal standard. In parallel, our preclinical safety laboratory evaluates PNECs availability on publicly available databases, including PNECs established by the AMR Industry Alliance. If multiple values are available, the most stringent value is selected. If PNECs do not exist but ecotoxicological information is available publicly, our preclinical safety laboratory calculates PNECs based on the European Medical Agency (EMA) guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use.\n| | In the 2021 Access to Medicines Foundation\u2019s AMR Benchmark report, Abbott received the second-highest score of all generic medicines manufacturers assessed and received the highest score in the manufacturing section.\n| 303-3 Water withdrawal | Protecting Water Resources, page 56\n| | CDP Water Response: page 4*\n| | Appendix, Key Environmental Metrics \u2014 Water, page 109\n\n* CDP responses reflect 2021 reporting year.\n### GRI STANDARD | GRI DISCLOSURE | LOCATION\n--- | --- | ---\n303-4 | Water discharge | Protecting Water Resources, page 56  \nCDP Water Response: page 4*  \nAppendix, Key Environmental Metrics \u2014 Water, page 102\n303-5 | Water consumption | Protecting Water Resources, page 56  \nCDP Water Response: page 4*\n\n### Emissions\n\n| GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 | 3-3 | Management of Material Topics  \nAppendix, ESG Priorities, page 93  \nEnergy and Emissions, page 53  \nOur Approach to a Healthy Environment, page 51  \nEnvironmental Management & Policy  \nProxy Statement: Our Commitment to Sustainability, page 8  \nIndependent Assurance Statement\n\n| GRI 305: Emissions 2016 | 305-1 | Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions  \nEnergy and Emissions, page 53  \nAppendix, Key Environmental Metrics \u2014 Energy and Emissions, page 98  \nCDP Climate Change Response: (C6.1)*\n305-2 | Energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions  \nEnergy and Emissions, page 53  \nAppendix, Key Environmental Metrics \u2014 Energy and Emissions, page 98  \nCDP Climate Change Response: (C6.2)*\n305-3 | Other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions  \nEnergy and Emissions, page 53  \nAppendix, Key Environmental Metrics \u2014 Energy and Emissions, page 98  \nCDP Climate Change Response: (C6.5)*\n305-4 | GHG emissions intensity  \nCDP Climate Change Response: (C6.10)*\n305-5 | Reduction of GHG emissions  \nEnergy and Emissions, page 53  \nAppendix, Key Environmental Metrics \u2014 Energy and Emissions, page 98  \nCDP Climate Change Response: (C7.9a)*\n305-6 | Emissions of ozone-depleting substances (ODS)  \nAppendix, Key Environmental Metrics \u2014 Energy and Emissions, page 98  \nCDP Climate Change Response: (C7.1a)*\n\nAny Abbott facilities using substances containing ozone-depleting or hazardous/toxic air pollutants, as classified by local environmental protection agencies, adhere to applicable regulations.

The following index provides content aligning with disclosures related to the Medical Equipment & Supplies Standard; Biotechnology & Pharmaceuticals Standard; and Processed Foods Standard. Unless otherwise noted, all data disclosed is as of December 31, 2022.\n\n### METRIC\n\n**HC-MS-240a.1:** Ratio of weighted average rate of net price increases (for all products) to the annual increase in the U.S. Consumer Price Index.\n\n| Year | Total Abbott Net Sales Price Change (year-on-year %) | Global Consumer Price Index (year-on-year %) |\n|------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| 2022 | -0.3%                                               | +7.9%                                       |\n| 2021 | -1.5                                               | +3.9                                        |\n| 2020 | -0.4                                               | +1.7                                        |\n| 2019 | +0.2                                               | +2.4                                        |\n\nAffordability and access are priorities for Abbott as we strive to help people live fully through our life-changing products and technologies. We aim to reach as many people as possible who need these healthcare solutions.\n\nAs part of our 2030 Sustainability Plan, we have an intentional focus on designing sustainable access and affordability into our new life-changing technologies so that we can make them widely available at affordable prices to people who need them. Pricing, however, is only one of the factors that determine affordability. Abbott also is advocating for systems and approaches that broaden access while minimizing additional costs for consumers and payers.\n\nIn 2022, Abbott\u2019s product pricing reflected the company\u2019s approach, with an annual global net sales price change of -0.3%, which compares to a Global Consumer Price Index (CPI) of +7.9% for 2022. This metric is modified from the metric provided by SASB by substituting a global CPI for the U.S. CPI.\n\nSales outside of the U.S. in 2022 comprised approximately 58% of Abbott\u2019s revenue. Abbott believes that disclosing product pricing relative to the Global CPI is an appropriate way for investors and other stakeholders to best understand pricing for products across our diversified, global businesses. The global CPI is the total headline CPI for each country weighted by Abbott\u2019s geographic revenue exposure. For more on Abbott pricing, see Abbott\u2019s 10-K filing for 2022.\n\n### 2022 DISCLOSURE\n\nAbbott Laboratories sells diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products, and established pharmaceuticals (for more details, see page 26 in our Innovate for Access and Affordability section in this report). Given the breadth of our product offerings, each Abbott division sells products using a variety of contracting methodologies. Divisions use a variety of price concessions in their sales contracting, including point-of-sale discounts, rebates, and wholesaler chargebacks. These price concessions can be for single or multi-product sales and may include products from multiple business units or divisions (such as all medical device business units or rapid and molecular diagnostics). Price concessions may be based upon factors such as volume, market share, and purchase commitments, or result from competitive bidding processes, and are generally documented in executed contracts, purchase orders, and term sheets. Point-of-sale discounts are reflected in invoices that show the discounted prices, and rebates are documented in written agreements, with rebate calculations provided at the time rebate payments are made.\n\nOur customers span the globe and include federal, state, and local governments, hospitals, group purchasing organizations, wholesalers, individual healthcare providers, and consumers. We maintain pricing flexibility to meet the needs of our diverse customers, large and small, and to help ensure that our essential healthcare products are available and affordable across the globe.\n\n### Product Safety\n\n**HC-MS-250a.1:** Number of recalls issued, total units recalled.\n\n| Business | FDA Class I and Class II |\n|----------|--------------------------|\n|          | Class I | Class II |\n| Med Device | 1 | 10 |\n| Diagnostics | 0 | 16 |\n| Pharmaceutical | N/A | N/A |\n| Nutrition | 1 | 4 |\n\nSee the FDA\u2019s MedWatch safety alerts for human medical products database:\n\n- Abbott Recalls the Readers used with the FreeStyle Libre, FreeStyle Libre 14 day, and FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring Systems for Risk of Extreme Heat and Fire\n- Abbott Issues Safety Notification for FreeStyle Libre Family of Readers in the U.S.\n- Abbott Trifecta Values: Potential Risk of Early Structural Valve Deterioration \u2014 Letter to Health Care Providers\n- Abbott MitraClip Device: Potential for Clip Lock Malfunctions \u2014 Letter to Health Care Providers\n- Abbott Medical Recalls Dronerpen OpStar Imaging Catheter for Potential Loose Catheter Marker Band That May Cause Patient Harm\n- Abbott Molecular, Inc.

If a healthcare professional asks about uses for Abbott products that are beyond the scope of approved labeling (sometimes referred to as \u201coff-label\u201d uses), the inquiry should be directed to the designated function for such inquiries in each Abbott division, which normally resides in Medical Affairs.\n\n**METRIC**\n\n**HC-MS-410a.1:** Discussion of process to assess and manage environmental and human health considerations associated with chemicals in products and meet demand for sustainable products.\n\nTo identify and mitigate the environmental impacts of our packaging and products throughout their life cycles, our relevant teams must work together. Our Product Stewardship, Supply Chain, R&D, Engineering, and EHS groups partner closely to analyze how and what we source. We continuously monitor the regulatory landscape and any change to hazardous chemical requirements. Our Corporate Product Stewardship organization holds regular forums for informing all areas of our company about the potential business impacts these changes could have. Our enhanced regulatory intelligence process helps ensure potential impacts are identified in a timely manner. It also follows actions taken at the business level to confirm we remain compliant.\n\nOur product stewardship program tracks and addresses hazardous chemical legislation and supports the implementation of conflict mineral due diligence. We offer product stewardship training to all relevant teams, including R&D, Supply Chain, Procurement, and EHS.\n\n**HC-MS-410a.2:** Total amount of products accepted for takeback and reused, recycled or donated, broken down by (1) devices and equipment and (2) supplies.\n\nStrengthening the Supply Chain, page 75\n\nWe look for opportunities to reduce waste going to landfills by collecting our diagnostic products for recycling, refurbishing, and energy recovery. In one of our various takeback programs, we collected and refurbished about 300 instruments and diverted about 240,000 pounds of product waste from landfill in 2022. Some of Abbott\u2019s takeback programs are driven by government regulations; however, others are proactive initiatives.\n\n**Supply Chain Management**\n\n**HC-MS-430a.1:** Percentage of (1) entity\u2019s facilities and (2) Tier 1 suppliers participating in third-party audit programs for manufacturing and product quality.\n\nApproximately 78% of applicable Tier 1 suppliers participate in third-party auditing programs. Suppliers are classified according to risk level of potential impacts; evaluation frequency is determined based on this, ranging between every two (high risk) and four (low risk) years.\n\n**HC-MS-430a.2:** Description of efforts to maintain traceability within the distribution chain.\n\nAbbott helps ensure product traceability by leveraging tracking technologies and enterprise resource planning solutions for select materials. Through these systems, we help ensure compliance with regulatory, quality, and control requirements.\nSUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (SASB) INDEX (CONTINUED)\n\n**METRIC**\n\n**2022 DISCLOSURE**\n\n**HC-MS-430a.3:** Description of the management of risks associated with the use of critical materials.\n\nAbbott operates against a changing geopolitical and environmental backdrop. We continually monitor issues that could impact our operations and those of our suppliers, including political instability, acute and chronic weather events, labor shortages, and inadequate capacity investments. Our Supply Chain Resilience program helps further safeguard our business and supply chain against unforeseen events; developing people, processes, and tools for engaging suppliers on identified topics.\n\n- Supply critical to Abbott is identified through our Supply Chain Resilience program via risk and resilience assessments of suppliers and components that are traceable to Abbott\u2019s finished product.\n- To accelerate recovery following disruptions, we must have an in-depth understanding of our extended supply network. We have expanded mapping efforts to include sub-tier supplier data \u2014 covering who they are, what they supply, and where from \u2014 bringing greater visibility to our supply chain.\n\nFurther, decisions made early in product development impact later stages. To safeguard our ability to manufacture and supply products after launch, we\u2019ve enhanced collaboration between our R&D and Supply Chain teams to reduce dependence on individual suppliers or bespoke manufacturing processes. In addition, we are updating design processes to place a greater focus on product and material life cycle management.\n\n**Business Ethics**\n\n**HC-MS-510a.1:** Total amount of monetary losses as a result of legal proceedings associated with bribery or corruption.\n\nWhen public disclosure criteria are met, the total amount of monetary losses as a result of legal proceedings associated with bribery or corruption is included in our 2022 Annual Report.\n\n**HC-MS-510a.2:** Description of code of ethics governing interactions with healthcare professionals.\n\nWe respect the expertise of healthcare professionals, who provide guidance about healthcare treatment options and healthy living. Healthcare professionals, such as physicians, pharmacists, nurses, researchers, or laboratory staff, must use their independent judgment to decide the best course of care for their patients based on their training and expertise. We are committed to working with healthcare professionals to provide them with timely and accurate information to assist them in making decisions and providing advice to their patients. We can achieve our mission of supporting health only through a truly collaborative approach.\n\nWe want to build a culture of integrity and compliance, engaging every employee in upholding ethical behaviors. Our global online Legal and Ethical Resource Network (LERN) training program is run in 93 countries and 32 languages. It informs employees of all aspects of our Code of Business Conduct, with practical guidance on recognizing and responding to legal and ethical issues, with a key focus on interactions with healthcare professionals.\n\n**Activity Metric**\n\n**HC-MS-000a.1:** Number of units sold by product category.\n\nNot disclosed.\n\n**METRIC**\n\n**2022 DISCLOSURE**\n\n**Biotechnology & Pharmaceuticals Standard**\n\n**HC-BP-210a.1:** Discussion, by world region, of management process for ensuring quality and patient safety during clinical trials.\n\nAbbott follows all applicable regulations in the countries where we conduct clinical studies or register products. We also follow nationally and internationally accepted standards, such as the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use Good Clinical Practices (ICH GCP), the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Organization for Standardization\u2019s ISO 14155, ISO 20916, and other standards. We train employees and clinical sites on the proper conduct of clinical studies and employ both external and internal oversight of studies.\n\nWhen planning our clinical studies, Abbott identifies and reduces controllable risks to patients. Either our Institutional Review Board (IRB) or our Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) reviews any proposed research prior to commencement to assure patient protections. The informed consent procedures and consent form documents for any clinical study must conform to all relevant legal statutes and governmental regulations. During the course of a study, patients can report any concerns to the IRB. We monitor our studies on an ongoing basis to help ensure compliance with Abbott standards and identify any unforeseen risks to patient safety.\n\nThis includes audits of contract research organizations (CROs) that conduct or manage studies on behalf of Abbott. If Abbott becomes aware of study misconduct, we report it to the appropriate authorities. No GCP inspections by regulatory agencies of the company or clinical trial investigators led to fines, penalties, warning letters, or product seizures in 2022.\n\n**Clinical Trial Registrations**\n\nAbbott registers all applicable and/or covered clinical trials, regardless of outcome, in a publicly accessible clinical trials registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. For branded generic pharmaceuticals, this means we register interventional clinical studies in patients as designated by national laws and regulations. For medical devices and diagnostics, this means we register interventional clinical studies of health outcomes and pediatric post-marketing surveillance studies, as designated by national laws and regulations.\n\n**Clinical Trial Results Disclosures**\n\nAbbott is committed to transparency and sharing important information about the clinical trials we sponsor. We recognize that there are important public health benefits to making clinical trial information available to healthcare providers, patients, and the public. Our registrations and results disclosures adhere to all applicable national laws and regulations in countries where we operate.\n\nAbbott discloses the results of all applicable or covered clinical trials as described above, regardless of outcome, in a publicly accessible clinical trials results database, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. We also report the results of any exploratory pharmaceutical clinical studies if the findings have significant medical importance, such as with important safety findings.\n\n**Clinical Trial Data Sharing**\n\nThe regulatory environment around sharing clinical trial data for research purposes is evolving. We continually engage with stakeholders\u2019 different approaches for sharing clinical trial data with scientific and medical researchers to advance medical science, while protecting confidential information.\nSUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (SASB) INDEX (CONTINUED)\n\n**METRIC**\n\n**HC-BP-210a.1:** Discussion, by world region, of management process for ensuring quality and patient safety during clinical trials.

Likewise, a core part of Abbott\u2019s business strategy includes reducing our water footprint in our operations and engaging our value chain in strategic sourcing categories.\n\nPackaging Lifecycle Management\n\nFB-PF-410a.1: (1) Total weight of packaging, (2) percentage made from recycled and/or renewable materials and (3) percentage that is recyclable, reusable and/or compostable.\n\nAbbott is committed to packaging optimization through sustainable design. In order to better understand opportunities for more sustainable packaging, teams in our Nutrition business unit conducted an analysis of their packaging portfolio to establish a baseline. In 2022, it is estimated that our Abbott Nutrition business utilized about 123,000 metric tons of material to place approximately 3.4 billion packages on market, made 21% of packaging from recycled content and/or renewed materials, and estimated that 80% of its packaging is recyclable, reusable, and/or compostable.\n\nMETRIC 2022 DISCLOSURE\n\nFB-PF-410a.2: Discussion of strategies to reduce the environmental impact of packaging throughout its life cycle.\n\nRecognizing the impact our packaging can have on the environment, we\u2019re designing for recyclability, efficiency, and increasingly positive impact. Our Sustainable Packaging Council has designed a database for reporting predicted progress against division projections for packaging projects. These next-decade figures guide Abbott functions as they collaborate to design and manufacture packaging with environmental sustainability as a priority. Our 2030 commitment is to address 50 million pounds of packaging through high-impact sustainable design programs that employ circularity principles. Sustainable Packaging Guiding Principles inform existing packaging upgrades and target new, more sustainable designs.\n\nOur Guiding Principles\n\n| Optimize Material Efficiency | Employ Circularity Principles |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Eliminate unnecessary components | Reduce packaging materials |\n| Replace problematic materials | Design for disassembly |\n| Design for recyclability | Design for reuse |\n| Utilize renewable materials | Integrate recycled content |\n\nBalance All Aspects of Packaging Systems Holistically\n\n| Optimize cube efficiency | Provide consumer direction | Improve carbon footprint |\n\n1 Global CPI is calculated using the total headline CPI for each country weighted by Abbott\u2019s geographic revenue exposure. CPI values are gathered by Abbott Economics from S&P Global, which sources data from each country\u2019s respective statistical agency or reporting institution. Revenue data for weighting are consistent with the net sales price change as reported in Abbott\u2019s annual 10-K Filing.\n\n2 Abbott does not distribute pharmaceutical products in the U.S.\nMANAGING RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nWe are committed to identifying and reducing climate-related risks that may have the potential to impact our operations, supply chain, and distribution network. We maintain an identification process for opportunities to address emerging climate change-related healthcare needs and increase operating efficiencies by reducing climate-related impacts. We have determined that climate-related risks and opportunities exist for Abbott at site and regional levels but are limited at a global scale.\n\nRISKS\n\nWe analyze physical and transitional risks resulting from emerging regulations, and assess and manage them through our risk management processes, which identify opportunities to build resilience in both our operations and our business model. We regularly update risk management, standards, and programs to align with global best practices and regulatory requirements, and aim to anticipate emerging risks and upcoming regulatory changes.\n\nThe EHS Governance team monitors emerging climate-related trends and regulations to analyze potential impacts and risk exposure, and develop appropriate management strategies. We use scenario-sensitivity risk modeling to understand the implications of climate-related risks. Abbott\u2019s Business Continuity and Crisis Management organizations implement measures to help ensure business continuity and attempt to minimize the impacts of physical climate-related risks. These physical risks fall into two categories: acute and chronic.\n\nAcute physical risks associated with climate change include unforeseen extreme weather events for which we cannot develop preventive strategies. We have developed strategies for mitigating and responding to them across our supply chain. Our Business Continuity and Crisis Management organization works with our EHS, Engineering, and Supply Chain groups to strengthen business resiliency against weather events and other forms of extreme disruption. During the COVID-19 pandemic and strict travel restrictions, our processes enabled us to quickly produce millions of COVID-19 tests while continuing to provide our other essential products to people globally.\n\nOur Engineering and EHS policies and management standards consider chronic physical risks, such as water scarcity, and require sites to conduct regular risk and opportunity evaluations and implement mitigation strategies.\n\nAbbott is a global organization with 88 manufacturing facilities in more than 25 countries, a diverse geographical supply chain and distribution network, and site-level business continuity planning. These factors lessen the potential for a material business impact from climate-related physical risks, such as effects of severity of weather.\n\nClimate-related risks include transition risks that relate to emerging expectations and regulations around GHG emission management. These include carbon limits and taxes, enhanced reporting obligations, costs to transition to lower-emissions technologies, and increased costs of goods and services. We have identified the need to manage and reduce environmental impacts as a potential enterprise risk. In response to this, our business strategy includes reducing operational energy and carbon footprint, and engaging our value chain in strategic sourcing categories.\nOPPORTUNITIES\n\nAs part of our product research and development (R&D) and climate risk management processes, we consider climate change-related opportunities. These fall into two main categories:\n\n\u2022 Increased operating efficiencies through achieving carbon reduction targets\n\u2022 The opportunity to advance our mission to help people live their best lives by meeting changing healthcare and nutrition needs\n\nAlthough opportunities exist and are incorporated into our 2030 Sustainability Plan, they are unlikely to have a substantive impact on our business.\n\nOur 2030 Sustainability Plan commits us to respond to increased humanitarian needs due to severe weather events, new disease threats, and changes in the spread of disease. We will do so in line with our priority of innovating for access and affordability, which characterized our company\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We will continue to respond to humanitarian needs in line with our caring value and primarily through our philanthropic organization and product donations.\n### DISCLOSURE 2022 RESPONSE\n\n#### Governance\n\n**a) Describe the Board\u2019s oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities.**\n\nAbbott is committed to strong corporate governance that aligns with stakeholder interests.
