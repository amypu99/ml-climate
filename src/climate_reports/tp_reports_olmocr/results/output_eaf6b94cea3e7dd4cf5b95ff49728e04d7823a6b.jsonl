Over the past half century, there have been two constants: change, and an unwavering commitment to our customers, partners, employees and communities. This year, more than ever, I reflect on how dramatically the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted communities around the globe and how our customers care for them. It is our honor at Cardinal Health to support our customers in these efforts and grow and evolve, combining our deep heritage in business with a bias toward action as we shape the future.\n\nOur environmental, social and governance (ESG) priorities are more critical than ever to our shared future. As a global company, we know that the long-term health of our employees, customers, partners and communities depends on a healthier, more sustainable and equitable world. In many ways, the pandemic has exposed how much our world still needs to change in order to protect and serve the most vulnerable among us and create a more inclusive future. This motivates us as we continually push ourselves to find ways to care for our people and our planet, and we remain grateful to our Board of Directors for their ongoing oversight and support of our enterprise ESG priorities and initiatives year over year. These efforts are highlighted throughout this report.\n\nA message from our CEO\n\nStrengthening our focus on diversity, equity and inclusion\n\nWe believe representation matters and are committed to using our voices to speak out against racism and inequities of any kind \u2014 making diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) foundational to everything that we do.\n\nDE&I is about ensuring that our people \u2014 every employee and potential employee, and every customer, partner and supplier \u2014 feel welcome, included and valued. While that\u2019s the right thing to do, research proves it\u2019s also smart business. A recent survey of more than 1,000 global companies, for example, demonstrates the relationship between diverse leadership teams and positive financial results.1\n\nIn FY21, we established specific goals for significantly increasing the representation of our African American and Black employees and other ethnic minority populations in the U.S., as well as the representation of women in our employee populations around the world by 2030. We also recently announced a comprehensive talent strategy to increase access to leadership development programs for diverse employees at the management level and above, including professional development, career counseling and mentoring. This commitment is aimed at increasing the company\u2019s global leadership representation of women, as well as African American and Black, Asian, Latinx, Indigenous and all other ethnically diverse groups in the U.S. Finally, we\u2019re expanding DE&I metrics in our FY22 annual incentive plan and performance share units under our long-term incentive plan, further reinforcing globally our cultural commitment with our employees and leaders.\n\nDE&I leads to better performance, makes us more innovative and agile, and enables us to solve problems more quickly and creatively. To help ensure continuous innovation, DE&I must be a leading factor in everything we do.\n\nI\u2019m proud of the progress we\u2019ve made, but we still have work to do. Achieving a culture that is truly diverse, equitable and inclusive is a journey to which my executive team and I are committed.\n\nSetting environmental goals\n\nWe continue to identify opportunities to help combat climate change and build a sustainable economy. I\u2019m proud to share here for the first time that Cardinal Health has committed to reducing Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50% by FY30 (measured from our FY19 data), as we continue to do our part and reduce our potential environmental impact.\n\nWe\u2019ve also broadened our Total Waste Management (TWM) initiative, which simplifies and standardizes waste management across our businesses and contributes to our environmental sustainability. In FY21, we extended TWM throughout our pharmaceutical distribution, specialty and global logistics businesses and continue to expand it across the enterprise.\nLeading through the pandemic to support our customers and partners\n\nAs in many industries, the COVID-19 pandemic drove fast-paced, significant changes within healthcare and in our business.\n\nOur people are our most important asset. Over and over again, they showed remarkable commitment to our customers, responding to dramatic and unforeseen changes with both agility and determination. I continue to be inspired by them every day.\n\nAt the start of the pandemic, we pivoted almost overnight to a work-from-home model for those who could work remotely. We very quickly developed safety protocols for our essential workers \u2014 those who continued working in our manufacturing facilities, distribution centers and critical customer operations to help provide our customers with products and services critical to healthcare. (You can read more about our initial response to the pandemic in our FY20 Corporate Citizenship Report.)\n\nOur employees were able to quickly learn new ways of doing business to continue serving customers and communities around the world. As a result, we kept all of our facilities open and operating throughout FY21. We have kept patient safety and product quality at the forefront of every decision we make.\n\nEarly on, we began reevaluating our entire supply chain to respond to the unprecedented increase and surges in global demand for gowns, masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE). We also began a partnership with FourKites, a leader in supply chain visibility, to continue optimizing our supply chain based on actionable data and predictive intelligence.\n\nWe changed inventory practices, increasing inventory of certain products so that we can more quickly meet spikes in demand, and collaborated with U.S. and foreign trade authorities to expedite shipments and shorten lead times. As a result of a $58 million contract with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), we stored and distributed 80,000 pallets of PPE to support the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), the country\u2019s national repository of critical medical supplies that are used to supplement state and local supplies in public health emergencies.\n\nAnd we focused on developing and investing in innovative technology solutions and actionable data tools as never before, enabling meaningful, cost-effective and outcomes-driven connections in healthcare. One example is MyScheduling, a digital solution specific to COVID-19 that enables U.S.-based independent pharmacists to schedule vaccinations (and allows patients to schedule their own appointments), creates waiting lists for patients not yet eligible for the vaccine, gathers screening and demographic information and generates reports on daily appointments.\n\nWe remain focused on innovating solutions that enhance how we serve our customers and their communities \u2014 throughout the pandemic and beyond.\n\nCelebrating 50 years with an increased commitment to our communities\n\nWe celebrated our 50th anniversary in January 2021 with a virtual bell ringing at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the kickoff to a year of service for Cardinal Health employees around the world. Our employees are passionate about giving back to our communities; during our anniversary year, we have a collective goal of giving 50,000 hours in volunteer service.\n\nThrough our Cardinal Health Foundation, we work to improve the health of our communities, particularly for disadvantaged populations. The Foundation focuses its investments on impacting social determinants of health, particularly hunger (by increasing access to healthy foods through its Food Rx for Health program and other initiatives) and homelessness. It also seeks to increase both access to and quality of physical and behavioral healthcare services.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nWith our deep healthcare expertise, we are delivering solutions that enable our customers and partners to provide the best possible care for their patients and communities. At Cardinal Health, we know that change will be a constant, as will our unwavering commitment to our customers, partners, employees and communities.\n\nI hope you\u2019ll read on, in the pages that follow and on our website, to learn more about our progress in becoming healthcare\u2019s most trusted partner.\n\nBe well.\n\nMike Kaufmann, CEO\nWe distribute pharmaceuticals, manufacture and distribute medical and laboratory products, and provide performance and data solutions for healthcare facilities.\n\nWe are a crucial link between the clinical and operational sides of healthcare, delivering end-to-end solutions and data-driven insights that advance healthcare and improve lives every day.\n\nWith more than 50 years of experience, we seize the opportunity to address healthcare\u2019s most complicated challenges \u2014 now, and in the future.\n\nEssential to care\u2122\n\nWe serve nearly 90% of U.S. hospitals\n\nWe operate in more than 35 countries\n\nWe have more than 4,500 sourcing and manufacturing partners across the healthcare supply chain\n\nThrough our distribution and services, we serve more than 60,000 U.S. pharmacies\n\nWe ship to more than 140,000 locations globally\n\nSpecialty Solutions\nWe serve more than 10,000 specialty physician offices and clinics\n\nOutcomes\u2122\nOur digital ecosystem to support medication adherence currently reaches more than 23 million patients and more than 60 payers\n\nNuclear & Precision Health Solutions\nWe have a U.S. network of more than 130 nuclear pharmacies and more than 30 PET sites and manufacturing facilities\n\nat-Home Solutions\nWe serve more than 3.4 million patients with more than 46,000 home healthcare products\n\nMedical Services\nOur OptiFreight\u00ae Logistics business makes 20 million shipments annually to 22,000 shipping locations, and our WaveMark\u2122 business optimizes the supply chain for more than 2,400 individual critical care areas from more than 250 U.S. hospitals\n\nApproximately 44,000 employees worldwide\n\n$162.5 billion in revenue in fiscal year 2021\n\n$162.5 billion in revenue in fiscal year 2021\n\nCardinal Health FY21 Corporate Citizenship Report | Diversity, equity and inclusion | Our customers and partners | Our communities | Operating sustainably | Governance\n\ncardinalhealth.com\n@CardinalHealth\nlinkedin.com/company/cardinal-health\nfacebook.com/cardinalhealthinc\n\n8\n\n9\nDiversity, equity and inclusion\n\nCreating awareness, access and opportunities for all\nRepresentation matters\n\nAt Cardinal Health, we have been deeply committed to fostering diversity and inclusion for years. As we continue to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic and confront racism and social injustice, we continue our work to create a culture where everyone can thrive. We recently added \u201cequity\u201d to our global strategy. Adding equity, and advancing the work of diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I), is more essential than ever.\n\nAs you\u2019ll read in the pages that follow, DE&I is foundational to who we are. It differentiates us as an employer and makes us more attractive to top talent around the world, which makes our company stronger. A focus on DE&I allows us to better meet the needs of our customers and partners \u2014 and the patients they care for \u2014 and fulfills our mission as an organization to make a positive difference in the lives of our employees and communities.\n\nCreating a workplace that is truly diverse, equitable and inclusive takes focused, thoughtful hard work and doesn\u2019t happen overnight. However, we have a strong foundation. We\u2019ve been refining our recruiting, development, succession and retention practices to ensure equitable access and opportunity, and we continue to listen, learn and act.\n\nRepresentation matters. Employees with a diversity of talent, experiences and ideas drive more innovation \u2014 innovation that propels our evolution from a distributor to a tech-enabled healthcare solutions provider. That is why we are pleased to highlight on these pages our representation goals for 2030 \u2014 for women around the globe and, in the U.S., for African American and Black, Asian, Latinx, Indigenous and all other ethnically diverse individuals.\n\nTwo distinct internal organizations are helping to guide our progress. Our DE&I Steering Council, composed of senior leaders from across the company, is charged with identifying and discussing barriers to DE&I, challenging the status quo and empowering change. Our African American and Black Racial Equity Cabinet also is made up of leaders, all of whom serve as truth tellers to our senior executives by identifying and naming issues of inequity both inside and outside the company.\n\nAs we continue this journey, we regularly assess our progress through a robust employee listening strategy, which includes engagement surveys, focus groups and onboarding assessments. We maintain open and transparent dialogue with external stakeholders, partners and investors, and proactively share information about our progress.\n\nWe are proud of the work we\u2019ve done, but we know there is much more to do. We are committed to listening, learning and acting to help drive change.\n\nUnderstanding diversity, equity and inclusion\n\nDiversity is any difference between individuals and groups.\n\nEquity focuses on the specific access gap to enable success for all individuals.\n\nInclusion is a culture that values the unique perspectives and contributions of all employees.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that equity is not interchangeable with equality \u2014 both are important. Equality means ensuring that everyone has the same amount of resources; equity means distributing resources based on the needs of the recipients. Equity brings focus to access gaps, which helps enable success for individuals.\n\nWe focus on equality when we say equal pay for equal work, and we ensured years ago that LGBTQ+ employees have the same rights and protections as other groups \u2014 even before federal and state laws were expanded to provide protections for these employees.\n\nBut all individuals may not have the same access and opportunity. At left, we explore how individuals may experience the same situation in three distinct scenarios as we illustrate how gaps in access to education, healthcare, housing, financial resources and career opportunities can impact outcomes. Equity can help close the gaps in access.\nGoal setting: Representation matters\n\nRepresentation matters because when the decision makers at the table are truly diverse, the choices we pursue and the decisions and policies we make are better, bolder and more creative. And yet, there are gaps in access and opportunity, particularly for women and ethnically diverse populations, across the U.S. That is why we have established goals for increasing representation of traditionally underrepresented people at the manager level and above.\n\nSpecifically, by 2030, our goals are that workforce representation changes in the following ways:\n\n- **Globally, increased representation of women** at the manager level and above from 40% to **48%**\n- **In the U.S., increased representation of African American and Black employees** at the manager level and above from 5% to **11%**\n- **In the U.S., increased representation of Asian, Latinx, Indigenous and all other ethnically diverse groups** at the manager level and above from 17% to **23%**\n\nWe plan to share our progress toward achieving these representation goals each year in our annual Corporate Citizenship Report.\n\nAccountability at every level\n\nWe have invested in the work of culture change, leadership capability, policy infrastructure and content development to support an inclusive workplace. Our leaders are working to create environments that allow for psychological safety and growth mindsets among all employees.\n\nWe have a listening strategy to help ensure we hear from a broad cross-section of employees through employee surveys, focus groups and informal listening sessions.\n\nIn establishing our 2030 Representation Goals, the Human Resources & Compensation Committee of the Cardinal Health Board of Directors also approved expanding DE&I metrics in the company\u2019s FY22 annual incentive plan, and performance share units under our long-term incentive plan at the SVP level and above, with a portion of payouts aligned to progress toward our 2030 Representation Goals over each program\u2019s relevant performance periods. These incentives extend well beyond the executive team, reinforcing the cultural commitment within the company\u2019s leadership team.\n\nVisit newsroom.cardinalhealth.com for more details about our expanding differentiated development programs that provide professional growth opportunities and increase access for underrepresented talent.\nSpeaking out against racism and social injustice\n\nTwo public health crises \u2014 the COVID-19 pandemic and systemic racism in the U.S. \u2014 merged over the last 18 months to expose and exacerbate inequities across the country; we were impelled to speak out.\n\nThis spring, CEO Mike Kaufmann spoke out publicly as violence against Asians and Asian Americans increased across the U.S.:\n\nThere is a straight line that runs between degradation and violence. While details of the recent shootings in Atlanta are still unfolding, it is the latest example of the disturbing increase in violence towards Asians. Seeing someone as less than human, due to their race, class, gender or any of the layers of identity that define each of us, is the first step towards exploitation and brutality. As a company, we stand against hate. We stand for perspectives, actions and policies that support the human dignity of all people.\n\nWe know that racism is our past, and it is our present. Discriminatory policies created centuries ago continue to produce unequal outcomes. Many benefit from the effects of systemic racism and the advantages it gives to white people. If we remain silent and do nothing, racism will be our future. We have the responsibility to do things differently, to ensure a just and equitable future for all.\n\nWe know that changes won\u2019t be easy or happen quickly. We are committed to the hard work and long journey required to end systemic racism and inequities. And we continue to speak out. Visit newsroom.cardinalhealth.com to read these recent examples:\n\n- George Floyd\u2019s death should never have happened. Inhumanity against one is inhumanity against all. This has to stop. All of us have a responsibility to encourage unity and demand justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and too many others whose lives have been cut short by racism throughout our country\u2019s history. We must come together so that everyone enjoys the same privilege of living, working and raising their families in a community that is safe for all.\n\n- There is still much work to do by Mike Kaufmann, CEO\n\n- Reckoning, reflection and repair this Juneteenth by Victor Crawford, CEO of our Pharmaceutical Segment\n\n- National Minority Health Month: Addressing vaccine hesitancy by Victor Crawford, CEO of our Pharmaceutical Segment\n\n- The power of advocacy by Steve Mason, CEO of our Medical Segment\n\n- This Women\u2019s History Month, A call for equality by Ola Snow, Chief Human Resources Officer\n\n- In support of the Equality Act by Steve Mason, CEO of our Medical Segment\nLeadership development\n\nIncreasing representation through increased access\n\nWe are focused on attracting, developing and retaining diverse talent from entry-level to senior leadership positions. To build a diverse pipeline of tomorrow\u2019s leaders, we are expanding our existing differentiated development programs and creating new offerings to bring an equity lens to our development practices and help more effectively advance underrepresented talent.\n\nDifferentiated development programs provide professional growth opportunities as well as increased access and awareness for traditionally underrepresented populations and their leadership. We launched our first such program for women several years ago, and have continued to expand differentiated development offerings for men and women of color.\n\nWe are intentional about diversity, equity and inclusion for all our differentiated development offerings, both in the mix of employees selected to participate and in curricula.\n\nCardinal Health is deeply committed to creating a balanced, inclusive and equitable culture, an approach that has fostered great employee engagement and innovation. For me personally, it has provided opportunities to engage leaders and take on leadership roles within our organization while receiving unwavering support from our leadership teams as we pursue the company\u2019s core values.\n\n\u2014 Jeremy Bolden\nSenior Consultant, Sales, Medical Segment, Texas\n\nDriving innovation through DE&I\n\nDE&I makes us better, more innovative and agile, and allows us to solve problems faster and more creatively.\n\nMany studies link DE&I to organizational performance. According to McKinsey & Company,1 organizations with gender diversity and ethnic diversity are 25% and 36% more likely to outperform less diverse organizations, respectively. Companies with more gender diversity \u2014 and policies about gender diversity \u2014 are likely to have lower levels of employee turnover, according to research published in Organizational Studies.2 And a study from the Boston Consulting Group3 shows that diversity in gender, country of origin, career path and industry background are all linked to innovation.\n\nThe takeaway is simple: When talented people with diverse experiences and perspectives work together, they innovate more. A keen focus on diversity, equity and inclusion is essential to our evolution from a distributor into a tech-enabled healthcare solutions provider. We are building core strengths of innovation and data-driven insights, and we need DE&I to be a leading factor in everything we do.\n\nOrganizational Studies.4 And a study from the Boston Consulting Group5 shows that diversity in gender, country of origin, career path and industry background are all linked to innovation.

We are building core strengths of innovation and data-driven insights, and we need DE&I to be a leading factor in everything we do.\nOur employees participate in a variety of other differentiated development programs, including:\n\n- **KPMG Women\u2019s Leadership Summit** for executive women\n- **Signature Leaders Select and Premier programs** for high-potential female executives\n- **MDX**, a mid-level leader development experience for those on executive succession plans (women and men of various races are among the participants)\n- **EDX**, an executive development experience for those on senior executive succession plans (participants are women and men of various races)\n- **Aspiring Leaders program**, designed for underrepresented supply chain leaders not yet at the manager level. The program, currently in a pilot phase, focuses on helping participants grow their leadership skills. We have developed the program in partnership with Franklin Covey to address what McKinsey & Company calls the \u201cbroken rung\u201d in the talent pipeline.\n- **Cardinal Health will also focus on developing diverse junior talent through its existing summer internship program and EMERGE, a three-year rotational development program for young professionals launching their careers.**\n\nInclusion is how we unleash the power of diversity. I have taken the responsibility to foster belonging and empowerment at work by hosting open, honest and sometimes tough conversations within my team. I have learned the importance of listening first, and being mindful and authentic to all perspectives. This approach has truly translated into my growth as an individual and a leader at Cardinal Health.\n\n\u2014 Romeyn Webb\nDirector, Distribution Operational Excellence, California\nAt Cardinal Health, employees from underrepresented populations share their experiences with their colleagues and with our leaders through a variety of internal organizations, including:\n\n**Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council**\nThis diverse group of business leaders is committed to putting DE&I at the center of everything we do.\n\n**African American and Black Racial Equity Cabinet**\nAs truth tellers, this Cabinet aspires to bring our scale, influence and resources to openly identify and address issues of Black and African American inequity due to unconscious bias, both inside and outside of our organization.\n\n**New Perspectives**\nThis grassroots group is committed to learning together and sharing different points of view about a wide range of social issues like inequality, systemic racism, unconscious bias, access gaps and social identity. New Perspectives hosts group discussions every other week, with as many as 400 employees participating.\n\n**Fostering inclusion**\nOur seven employee resource groups (ERGs) and our Multi-Cultural Community (MCC) help create community for underrepresented populations, their allies and advocates \u2014 all of whom are committed to helping recruit, develop, engage and retain talented individuals who are part of the same constituencies.\n\n**Spotlight**\n**Multi-Cultural Community**\nLike all of our employee resource groups (ERGs), our Multi-Cultural Community (MCC) is ingrained in the culture of Cardinal Health and welcomes employees around the globe to get involved. The MCC\u2019s mission is to bring more people across the globe into our DE&I efforts.\n\nThe global Multi-Cultural Community was created with the vision of a world made up of communities that welcome everyone to come as they are. Every Cardinal Health employee is a member of the MCC. The mission of this group is to unite all the existing MCCs around the globe to share many different perspectives \u2014 and grow from them.\n\n\u2014 Suzanne Foster\nPresident, Cardinal Health at-Home Solutions and Executive Sponsor of the Multi-Cultural Community\n\nThe results of our 2021 Voice of the Employee (VOE) Survey showed that our strong record of employee engagement continues to improve: Sustainable engagement \u2014 meaning how engaged, energized and empowered employees feel in their work \u2014 is at 87% across the enterprise.\nPrioritizing pay equity\n\nWe define pay equity as equal pay for women, men and all ethnicities who are performing substantially similar work. Some of the things we consider include job-related skills, tenure, experience and education level, performance rating and geography.\n\nFor every dollar male employees are paid, female employees at Cardinal Health are paid $0.99.\n\nFor every dollar non-minority employees are paid, minority employees at Cardinal Health are paid $1.00.\n\nThe business case for building diverse teams is undeniable, but building them requires intentionality. Cardinal Health is committed to creating a diverse, equitable and inclusive culture, which continues to unleash a greater impact on innovation, business results and employee engagement.

Our executive team includes our CEO\u2019s direct reports and our business presidents.\nMaintaining a diverse supplier base promotes an inclusive approach to procurement and provides direct support to the communities where these diverse businesses reside. At Cardinal Health, we define diverse suppliers as small businesses (some of which are minority- or women-owned), as well as those that are at least 51% owned, operated and controlled by an individual or team that is part of an underrepresented group, including ethnic minorities, women, veterans, LGBTQ+ individuals and those with disabilities.\n\nOur supplier diversity program helps diverse suppliers learn how to navigate larger organizations, how to package their ideas and how to harness their nimble, innovative thinking so that they\u2019re better able to compete. Our program also helps generate economic opportunities for marginalized communities.\n\nCardinal Health operates in more than 35 countries; I see colleagues around the globe working to embrace diversity in everything they do each day. For example, even though I\u2019m based in Asia, my U.S. and European colleagues always consider time zone differences when setting up meetings. This sort of inclusiveness is one of the key reasons I recently agreed to and accepted a new international business role. I knew it wouldn\u2019t be a problem to collaborate with teams in other countries. That\u2019s what makes this company so special. I know I am appreciated for who I am here. This is a place where I truly can be myself at work.\n\n\u2014 Raymond Francis\nInternational Communications Business Partner, Singapore\nMind Matters: Focusing on mental health\n\nIn 2019 we launched Mind Matters, a global mental health initiative to provide mental health resources to employees and their families, foster an open and supportive mental health culture and eliminate stigma around mental health issues throughout the company. Since the launch of Mind Matters, and throughout the pandemic, we have learned so much about the mental health needs of our employees.\n\nWe know the past 18 months have been difficult for our employees, whether they\u2019ve continued to work on the front lines, ensuring that our customers get the products they need to care for patients, or they work from home, where work-life balance is especially challenging to achieve. Since the onset of the pandemic, many employees have reported working longer hours. Many are still juggling their work with additional responsibilities of childcare, home schooling and/or eldercare, and many feel isolated and long for social interaction.\n\nMental health issues can affect employees in many different ways, from reducing their ability to complete tasks and their cognitive performance to causing communication problems with peers and managers.\n\nWe also know that mental health issues can affect women and ethnically diverse people differently. For example, according to the World Health Organization, women are twice as likely to struggle with depression as men. People from diverse backgrounds can face unconscious bias and other stressors that affect their mental health; they may also lack access to mental healthcare services.\n\nStigma is also a significant barrier to mental healthcare among certain racial and ethnic communities. Throughout the pandemic, we\u2019ve focused on expanding support for all employees, including customized resources for diverse audiences.\n\nEarly in the pandemic, we increased the number of one-on-one counseling sessions that employees and their household members could access through our global Employee Assistance Program (EAP). Nearly 11% took advantage of these counseling sessions, an increase of 2.5% over the previous year; those accessing more than one counseling session more than doubled in 2021 over the previous year.\n\nWe also provided free access to an app called Headspace to our employees worldwide. This app is designed to guide individual meditation and relaxation. Headspace offered virtual educational sessions for employees to help them understand the benefit of meditation and drive engagement. As a result, requests from employees for Headspace licenses increased by 150%.\n\nWe encourage employees to focus on the job to be done, rather than on the time of day it\u2019s completed, to create some balance and mitigate burnout. Working parents, for example, may need time during the traditional workday to help students with virtual learning. We instituted Midweek Moment, a weekly window without internal meetings that employees can use to create some balance and support anyone who might be experiencing an issue (e.g., a panic attack, traumatic event or withdrawal from substance misuse), and helps connect them to care. Almost 500 employees have completed the MHFA certification. They continue training after certification and lead small group conversations designed to help reduce stigma.\n\nHere\u2019s what we\u2019re doing to help:\n\nReducing stigma\n\nStigma is often the reason people avoid or delay seeking mental health treatment, even though treatment can alleviate many symptoms. Stigma directly affects individuals with mental illness, but it also hurts the friends and family members who help support them.\n\nThrough our Mind Matters initiative, we have hosted multiple virtual programs that provide employees with access to mental health professionals. We\u2019ve also offered programming through our employee resource groups (ERGs), designed with specific educational messages for diverse audiences.\n\nCreating balance\n\nWe\u2019re training our leaders in mental health awareness and response so they have the skills to address mental health issues in the workplace. To date, almost 900 Cardinal Health managers have completed our Mental Health Responsiveness Training. In FY21, we began offering a program to employees in the U.S. called Mental Health First Aid (MHFA). The MHFA certification helps people identify and support anyone who might be experiencing an issue (e.g., a panic attack, traumatic event or withdrawal from substance misuse), and helps connect them to care. Almost 500 employees have completed the MHFA certification. They continue training after certification and lead small group conversations designed to help reduce stigma.\n\nRead more about how we prioritize mental health \u00bb\nCreating value for our customers and partners\n\nTransforming through growth, innovation and technology\nWe celebrated our 50th year in business in January 2021, less than 10 months after the World Health Organization (WHO) formally declared the COVID-19 pandemic. As a company, we were able to pivot quickly at the start of the pandemic and learn new ways of doing business to continue serving customers and communities around the world.\n\nOver the past 50 years, the only constants have been change and a deep commitment to our customers and partners. Today, as we continue to evolve from a distributor to a technology-enabled healthcare solutions provider, we\u2019re bringing life-changing healthcare innovations to market and optimizing care delivery by harnessing the power of technology, data and insights to improve the patient experience.\n\nWe have deep expertise \u2014 and we know how to respond to disruptions with innovation. We are advancing healthcare and removing barriers to deliver solutions that will allow our customers and partners to provide the best possible care for the patients who depend on them.\n\nThe pandemic pushed us further in our evolution, as you\u2019ll read on these pages. We are enabling technology solutions at a faster pace than ever before. And as we look ahead, focused on becoming healthcare\u2019s most trusted partner, we\u2019ll continue to prioritize improved outcomes for our customers. We\u2019re agile, determined and continually innovating.\n\nReevaluating the supply chain\n\nIn the early days of the pandemic, the demand for gowns, masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) that helps protect healthcare providers and their patients was two to 12 times that of what was available. Once products arrived in the U.S., we delivered them to customers swiftly and efficiently; the challenge was securing reliable and quality products through a disrupted global supply chain facing a rapid, unprecedented increase in demand.\n\nTo meet the demand, we reevaluated our entire supply chain. We changed sourcing practices to limit geographic concentration of products coming from a single country. We expanded self-manufacturing capabilities to increase production capacity of isolation gowns, surgical and procedural masks and face shields \u2014 all in North America. These efforts are expanding surgical and procedural mask capacity by 150 million masks annually and increasing safety needle capacity by 15 million units. Throughout the pandemic and beyond, patient safety and product quality are at the forefront of every decision we make as we maintain trusted sources of supply.\n\nDelivering life-saving blood donations amid severe shortages\n\nBlood Centers of America (BCA) recognized Cardinal Health\u2122 OptiFreight\u00ae Logistics with one of its new Critical Infusion Awards for helping deliver record amounts of critical blood supplies and convalescent plasma to hospitals.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, OptiFreight\u00ae Logistics helped BCA centralize shipping efforts, provide same-day delivery, optimize visibility to shipments using real-time analytics, get deliveries quickly to point of care and, ultimately, save on shipping costs.\n\nVisit newsroom.cardinalhealth.com to learn more.\n\nWe began a partnership with FourKites, the leader in supply chain visibility, to give our healthcare customers real-time information about where their products are in the supply chain. The technology behind this visibility is allowing us to revolutionize the network and to ensure that all parts of the supply chain are working seamlessly. We continue to innovate as the supply chain and technology evolve.\n\nWe launched Cardinal Health\u2122 TotalVue\u2122 Analytics, a logistics management tool for healthcare supply chain leaders that provides health systems with shipping trends so they can identify opportunities to reduce freight costs, including inbound shipments from suppliers or outbound shipments from sites of care. These actionable data help supply chain leaders improve the predictability and efficiency of their supply chains.\n\nRead more about our initial pandemic response in our FY20 Corporate Citizenship Report \u00bb\n\nRead more about our partnership with FourKites \u00bb\n\nRead more about TotalVue\u2122 Analytics \u00bb\nAs a distributor of pharmaceutical products and a global manufacturer and distributor of medical products and supplies, we remain focused on getting critical medicines and supplies into the hands of our customers so they can effectively care for their patients. We\u2019ve increased inventory of certain products to more quickly meet spikes in demand.\n\nIn April 2021, we were awarded a $58 million contract to store and distribute 80,000 pallets of PPE to support the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), the repository of critical medical supplies used to supplement state and local supplies in public health emergencies. We\u2019re also investing $50 million in medical inventory management throughout the U.S., adding nearly 1.5 million square feet to our regional replenishment centers. These centers store products that our nearby distribution centers can quickly access to restock their own inventory, then ship to our customers.\n\nUpgrading inventory practices\n\nAs a distributor of pharmaceutical products and a global manufacturer and distributor of medical products and supplies, we remain focused on getting critical medicines and supplies into the hands of our customers so they can effectively care for their patients.

Here are four notable examples:\n\n1. **MyScheduling**, a digital solution specific to COVID-19 that allows U.S.-based independent pharmacists to schedule vaccines (and lets patients schedule their own appointments), creates waiting lists for patients not yet eligible for the vaccines, gathers patient information and generates reports on daily appointments. MyScheduling has scheduled 283,000 COVID-19 vaccination appointments (with only a 2% no-show rate); more than 3,500 pharmacies have connected via the MyScheduling tool to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Datawarehouse for COVID-19 vaccine reporting. The MyScheduling tool is available through our Outcomes\u2122 Connect platform, which supports 23 million patients at more than 60,000 pharmacy locations nationwide.\n\n2. **Cardinal Health\u2122 Navista\u2122 Tech Solutions (TS)** launched to help oncology practices improve patient care, lower costs and drive success in value-based care. Through this comprehensive suite of technology solutions, Navista\u2122 TS helps oncology practices understand the biggest cost and value drivers, identify treatments that offer the highest-quality care at the lowest cost and select the right care plan at the onset of each patient\u2019s treatment. It also helps to automate manual processes and reduce administrative burdens.\n\n3. We collaborated with eMed, a digital health company democratizing healthcare through digital point-of-care solutions, to distribute at-home COVID-19 rapid tests to thousands of pharmacies nationwide. eMed offers a unique digital health platform to virtually guide individuals through the testing process. The tests require no additional equipment; they are authenticated and deliver results within minutes. The collaboration enables pharmacies to offer convenient at-home tests to their patients and help protect against the further spread of COVID-19 in their communities.\n\n4. Through work with HIMSS Analytics\u2122, our WaveMark\u2122 Supply Management & Workflow Solutions became a Certified Organization of the Clinically Integrated Supply Outcomes Model (CISOM), to help health systems optimize and benchmark progress as they innovate their clinical and operational supply chains. WaveMark\u2122 supports an optimized supply chain strategy with service and technology offerings, helping to ensure accurate visibility to \u201cat risk\u201d product inventory and to help prevent \u201cnever events,\u201d including expired or recalled product used on a patient.\n\nContinually evolving our business\n\nTo discover more about how we\u2019re transforming our business through growth, innovation and technology to best serve our customers and their patients now and into the future, please visit newsroom.cardinalhealth.com\n\nLearn more about how we\u2019re making healthcare more accessible, including through virtual care \u00bb\nStrengthening our communities\n\nCardinal Health focuses on creating positive, lasting change\nThe Cardinal Health Foundation\n\nThe Cardinal Health Foundation works to help build healthier, more equitable communities where all people have the opportunity to live healthy lives and share their perspectives and experiences \u2014 communities where diversity, equity and inclusion thrive.\n\nEach year, we invest $5.5 million to improve health outcomes. On these pages, you\u2019ll see some of the highlights of this work in FY21.\n\nOur priorities\n\nImproving physical health\nExpanding mental health services\nIncreasing access to healthy foods\nIncreasing access to stable housing\nImproving educational outcomes\n\nSupporting employee engagement\n\nGiving back to important causes\nIn addition to their time and talent, employees donate more than $2 million each year to nonprofit organizations \u2014 funds that are matched by the Foundation.\n\nFighting prescription drug misuse\nMany of our employees teach others about medication safety through the resources of Generation Rx (learn more on page 41).\n\nCOVID-19 response\n\nAddressing unprecedented need\n\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic took hold last year, we acted with urgency, funding our nonprofit partners that work to address some of the most pressing needs of at-risk children and families in our hometown of Columbus, Ohio, and around the world. Below is a list of the organizations we support:\n\nCentral Ohio relief:\n\n\u2022 United Way of Central Ohio, to support its COVID-19 emergency response\n\u2022 Mid-Ohio Food Collective, to help feed hungry children and their families in Central Ohio throughout school closures\n\nGlobal relief:\n\n\u2022 United Way Worldwide, to support basic needs of children and families and children\u2019s education across six countries\n\u2022 I Know I Can, to support high school graduation for seniors in Columbus City Schools\n\u2022 Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission, to support a broadband access pilot program across Central Ohio\n\u2022 Red Cross Society of China, for emergency relief\n\nWhen vaccines became available in Ohio in early 2021, the Foundation partnered with Ohio State University (OSU) Athletics to address vaccine hesitancy in disadvantaged communities by sponsoring a statewide public service announcement (complemented by other promotional materials) featuring former OSU linebacker Joshua Perry.\nAdvancing mental well-being\n\nAbout one in five adults in the U.S. have mental health issues, and one in 10 have a drug use disorder at some time in their lives, according to the National Institutes of Health. Though many of these issues can be managed with treatment and support, many people struggle to get help. Here are some of the ways the Foundation is working to combat mental health and substance use issues.\n\nThe Cardinal Health Foundation Zero Suicide Collaborative\n\nSuicide is a growing public health concern. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2019, suicide was the second leading cause of death for people ages 10-34, the fourth leading cause among people ages 35-44, and the fifth leading cause among people ages 45-54.\n\nSuicide deaths for individuals under the care of health and behavioral health systems are preventable. That\u2019s why the Cardinal Health Foundation is partnering with the Zero Suicide Institute, whose framework is based on the realization that those at risk of suicide often fall through the cracks in a fast-paced and sometimes fragmented healthcare system. A systematic approach to quality improvement in these systems is both available and necessary to save lives.\n\nWith the Zero Suicide Institute, we have created a national Zero Suicide Collaborative of 17 adult and children\u2019s hospitals. Each of the participating hospitals received a two-year grant and are receiving in-depth training and expert consultation from the Zero Suicide Institute throughout the term of the grant.\n\nThe collaborative includes a partnership with the State of Ohio and the Ohio Children\u2019s Hospital Association (OCHA), focused on six children\u2019s hospitals that are implementing systemwide and community-based suicide prevention efforts. And through an initiative of Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, the Ohio Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services is making an investment in youth suicide prevention. We are proud that the Cardinal Health Foundation is amplifying this work to create a comprehensive suicide prevention model from hospitals to home.\n\nEach of the Zero Suicide Collaborative grantees is committed to patient safety and the safety and support of clinical staff, as well as supporting a community focus on suicide prevention. Through the collaborative, grantees will track and share learnings and best practices with each other, with the Zero Suicide Institute and with Cardinal Health to inform and improve future suicide prevention work.\n\nOptimal Prescribing for Pain Management (OPPM) Collaborative\n\nIn 2019, the Foundation awarded nearly $1 million in grants through the OPPM Collaborative to combat the opioid epidemic across five states. The initiative engaged state pharmacy associations and schools of pharmacy in partnerships that enabled pharmacists to work closely with other healthcare providers and patients to improve pain management and pain medication prescribing.\n\nThe five grantees completed their grant-funded work in FY21:\n\n- Maryland Pharmacists Association Foundation\n- Missouri Pharmacists Foundation\n- North Carolina Pharmaceutical Association Endowment Fund\n- Ohio Northern University Raabe College of Pharmacy\n- Wisconsin Pharmacy Foundation\n\nThe grantees worked to bridge the communication gap between prescribers, pharmacists and patients in their states, and spread tools and resources to promote optimal prescribing for pain management patients. Throughout the term of the grant, they participated in a learning collaborative led by the Alliance for Integrated Medication Management (AIWM) designed to drive progress and to facilitate discussions, identify barriers and brainstorm solutions.\n\nIn addition to AIWM, the Foundation also partnered with the National Alliance of State Pharmacy Associations (NASPA) and the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) to coordinate the program.\n\nThe Foundation supports several solutions designed to prevent prescription drug misuse and fight the opioid epidemic. A key program is Generation Rx, which was founded at The Ohio State University College of Pharmacy and has been powered through a partnership with the Foundation since 2009. Generation Rx is an evidence-informed prevention education and awareness program designed to educate people of all ages about safe medication practices.\n\nRead more at cardinalhealth.com/GenerationRx\nFighting food insecurity with food pharmacies\n\nTo begin addressing SDoH, the Foundation is investing in grant-funded work to combat food insecurity, which is the lack of consistent access to enough nutritious food to support an active, healthy life. Food insecurity is a complex social issue that greatly impacts population health. By supporting organizations that help to increase access to healthy foods, we can improve health outcomes as well as the overall health of the communities in which we work and live.\n\nOur food pharmacy work was established with a pilot cohort of five grantees across the country in 2020, all working together to address food insecurity. Food pharmacies \u2014 partnerships between food banks and healthcare organizations \u2014 help to support and sustain healthier eating habits of low-income patients. Through clinic-based food pharmacies, patients can fill prescriptions for free, nutritious foods written by their healthcare providers. They also receive support to foster and sustain healthy eating habits with cooking instructions, recipe sharing and nutrition coaching.\n\nIn FY21, the Foundation expanded its food pharmacy initiative with national partner Feeding America* and announced its Food Rx for Health program, awarding new grants to four food banks partnering with healthcare organizations to improve health outcomes for adults with diabetes. The following partnerships began their grant-funded work in July 2021:\n\n- Mid-South Food Bank in Memphis, Tennessee partnering with Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare, Methodist University Hospital\n- Mountaineer Food Bank of Gassaway, West Virginia partnering with the Wheeling Health Right Medical Center in Wheeling, West Virginia\n- Feeding Tampa Bay in Riverview, Florida partnering with Tampa Family Health Center, a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC)\n- Northern Illinois Food Bank in Geneva, Illinois partnering with Northwestern Medicine Lake Forest Hospital\n\n* The Cardinal Health Foundation is a supporting partner of Feeding America.\n\nAdvancing social justice and racial equity\n\nThe Cardinal Health Foundation and the company have prioritized donations to organizations working to help eliminate inequities in healthcare, education, jobs, housing, criminal justice and more.\n\nThe Foundation provides 100% matching gifts for employee donations to these nonprofit organizations:\n\n- Black Youth Leadership Project\n- Center for Constitutional Rights, Inc.\n- Consortium for Graduate Study in Management\n- Equal Justice Initiative\n- NAACP Foundation\n- NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.\n- National Council of Negro Women, Inc.\n- National Fair Housing Alliance\n- National Urban League\n- Workers Center for Racial Justice\n- Urban League of Greater Columbus\n- United Negro College Fund of Central Ohio\n- United Way of Central Ohio\n- Workers Center for Racial Justice\n\nCardinal Health provides financial support to a variety of organizations working to advance equity.

Around the world, they raise millions of dollars for and share time and professional skills with thousands of nonprofit organizations.\n\nA year of service\n\nOur employees are passionate about giving back to the communities where we live and work. During our 2021 year of service, we are inspired by the collective goal of giving 50,000 hours in volunteer service.\n\nOn these pages, we share highlights of that commitment.\n\nIn January 2021, we celebrated our 50th anniversary with a virtual bell ringing at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the kickoff of a year of service for Cardinal Health employees around the world.\n\nThroughout our year of service, employees have hosted school supply drives, stuffed and donated backpacks, cleaned up community green spaces, donated to food pantries and more.\nPelotonia\n\nOur Foundation, company and employees have raised more than $3 million for cancer research since 2009. Hundreds of employees, friends and families participate each year by cycling, volunteering or setting their own challenges to fundraise against.\n\n\u2014 Victor Crawford\nCEO of our Pharmaceutical Segment\n\nAs a healthcare leader, cancer survivor and advocate for advancing health equity, Crawford serves on the Pelotonia Board of Directors.\n\nI am proud to support Pelotonia\u2019s mission of engaging, inspiring and challenging a community committed to changing the world by accelerating innovative cancer research.\n\n\u2014 Victor Crawford\n\nLearn more about Pelotonia\u2019s impact on cancer research at pelotonia.org\n\nAmerican Heart Association (AHA) Heart Walk\n\nSince 2009, we\u2019ve raised more than $2 million for heart research; hundreds of employees participate in walks across the country.\n\n\u2014 Ola Snow\nChief Human Resources Officer\n\nA long-time champion of the AHA, Snow recently joined the AHA\u2019s Go Red for Women National Leadership Council, an influential group of women who encourage other women to take charge of their heart health.\n\nLearn more about the American Heart Association at heart.org\n\nThrough our collaboration with the American Heart Association, Cardinal Health is focusing on health equity, education, wellness, mental health and overall well-being for our employees and the community.\n\n$3M+\nraised\n\n$2M+\nraised\n\nLearn more about Pelotonia\u2019s impact on cancer research at pelotonia.org\n\nLearn more about the American Heart Association at heart.org\n\nAbove: Victor Crawford (right), with Pelotonia CEO Doug Ulman at a virtual Pelotonia kickoff event in May.\nOperating sustainably\n\nCreating a cleaner future\nBuilding a more sustainable future\n\nAs a global company, we know that the long-term health of our communities, colleagues, customers and partners depends on a commitment to environmental sustainability. We all have a role to play in addressing climate change to ensure a healthier planet for generations to come; it\u2019s essential that we do our part.\n\nAcross our footprint, we look for ways to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, reduce landfill burden, conserve water and design products, services and solutions that help lessen our environmental impact. We continue to measure and manage our impact, constantly pursuing opportunities for improvement \u2014 and we are achieving real results in an effort to benefit our planet and the communities in which we operate.\n\nFollowing the completion of a climate scenario analysis in FY21, we are issuing for the first time a report using the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) as a guide.\n\nGoal setting: Enterprise GHG emissions\n\nWe\u2019re committed to reducing our impact on the environment and have set initial targets for reducing our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50% by FY30, against an FY19 baseline.\n\nOur Scope 1 and 2 targets align with what the latest climate science deems necessary to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement: limiting global warming to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C. Further, we are assessing our Scope 3 emissions and working toward validation of a comprehensive Scope 1, 2 and 3 science-based target by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi).\n\nLearn more about our GHG data and goals \u00bb\n\nUnderstanding Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions\n\n- **Scope 1 emissions**: Direct GHG emissions from fuel burned in our own facilities or vehicles that we directly own or operate.\n- **Scope 2 emissions**: Indirect GHG emissions that come from the consumption of the electricity, heating and cooling we buy.\n- **Scope 3 emissions**: Other indirect GHG emissions, including those from our supply chain and transport-related activities not owned by Cardinal Health. These may include but are not limited to GHG emissions from companies that deliver us raw materials, external manufacturing facilities and last-mile partners who drive products to healthcare providers. Scope 3 emissions are more difficult to measure but, along with Scope 1 and 2, they represent an important impact on the environment.\n\nGuiding principles\n\n- Pollution prevention\n- Energy optimization\n- Design for environment\n- Employee and public outreach\nRenewable energy\n\nIn FY21, we were among Central Ohio\u2019s three founding customers of renewable energy through Smart Columbus Energy, an initiative of Smart Columbus designed to support the decarbonization of large businesses in the region. The program pools customers\u2019 energy demands and allows procurement energy from Ohio-based wind and solar projects. Smart Columbus estimates the initiative will supply the founding customers with about 25 megawatts of renewable energy each year \u2014 the equivalent of annually powering more than 4,000 U.S. homes.\n\nBeginning early in calendar year 2022, we will use renewable energy to fully power our global headquarters and our National Logistics Center in Central Ohio.\n\nSustainable sourcing and human rights\n\nWe are committed to ensuring that our supply chain reflects our core values and our prioritization of both product quality and social responsibility. To do this, we have built ESG priorities into our procurement and manufacturing standards and procedures. This includes thorough evaluation of our suppliers and sites to protect against the use of forced labor and unsafe work environments, and improve waste and emission control programs.\n\nFind our most recent vendor code of conduct, Global Human Rights and Labor Standards policy and Modern Slavery Statement on our website.\n\nRecycling\n\nFundamental to our sustainability initiatives, our recycling programs address water, wood, cardboard, plastics, paper, metal, electronics, ink cartridges and other materials.\n\nFor details on our FY21 outcomes, visit cardinalhealth.com/recycling-data\n\nTotal Waste Management\n\nWe promote responsible waste management across the company through an innovative program initiated in FY20 called Total Waste Management. An enterprise-focused solution emphasizing elimination, reduction and/or reuse of waste and waste by-products, Total Waste Management simplifies and standardizes waste management throughout our operations and increases compliance solutions.\n\nIn FY21, our Total Waste Management program:\n\n- Increased use of waste-to-energy, generating 412,000 kWh (enough to power 39 homes for a year)\n- Increased landfill avoidance by nearly 870 tons (the average weight of about four locomotives)\n\nOnce fully implemented across the enterprise, Total Waste Management is expected to:\n\n- Achieve a waste management cost-savings year over year of at least 3%\n\nInternational Organization for Standardization (ISO) certification\n\nIn FY21, we achieved internationally recognized ISO 14001:2015 (environmental management system) and ISO 45001:2018 (operational health and safety management system) integrated certifications in four manufacturing sites: Rayong, Thailand; Costa Rica; Juarez, Mexico; and Tullamore, Ireland.\n\nBy FY23, we expect to achieve a multisite ISO 14001 and 45001 certification for a total of 21 manufacturing sites, including the four sites certified in FY21.\n\nAs a global citizen, we\u2019re working to reduce our environmental impact in the communities where we work and live. We\u2019re reducing energy use, GHG emissions and waste, and prioritizing recycling efforts.\n\n\u2014 Mike Bellantis\nDirector, ESG and Sustainability\nGovernance and ethics\n\nDoing business the right way to create value for all our stakeholders\nComprehensive Board- and management-level ESG oversight\n\nBoard of Directors\nOversight of ESG-related risks and opportunities\n\nAudit Committee\nMonitors the company\u2019s financial risks, cybersecurity, internal audit function and enterprise risk management process\n\nHuman Resources and Compensation Committee\nHuman capital management, including diversity, equity and inclusion, talent recruitment and development, and workplace safety and culture\n\nNominating and Governance Committee\nEnvironmental sustainability, corporate citizenship activities, political contributions and lobbying, and corporate governance\n\nAd Hoc Committee\nOversight of company\u2019s response to the opioid epidemic and related litigation, regulatory and reputational risks\n\nRisk Oversight Committee\nMonitors compliance risks associated with ethical, quality and legal/regulatory requirements (other than opioid matters)\n\nESG Steering Committee\nThis committee, chaired by the EVP, Chief Corporate Affairs Officer and composed of management team members, oversees our ESG strategies.\n\nThe ESG Steering committee leads efforts to integrate corporate citizenship throughout our business by:\n\n- Coordinating and prioritizing recommendations and requests about ESG issues\n- Making recommendations to management on ESG projects and investments, with a focus on business benefit, cost-effectiveness and sustainability\n- Assessing recommendations and requests for ESG information or initiatives from stakeholders and interest groups\n- Developing consistent internal and external communications about ESG matters\n\nRead more about governance and ethics at Cardinal Health, our Board of Directors and Standards of Business Conduct \u00bb\nAbout our Corporate Citizenship Report\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, data in this report are reflective of the fiscal year 2021 (July 1, 2020-June 30, 2021).
