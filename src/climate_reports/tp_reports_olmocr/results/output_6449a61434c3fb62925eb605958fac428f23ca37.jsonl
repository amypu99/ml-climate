This report shares our track record and ongoing efforts to make the world better for individuals, families, and communities through our stories, experiences, operations, and philanthropy.\n\nWe encourage a world in balance by lowering the environmental impact of our operations and investing in wildlife care and conservation.\n\nThis past year we launched the Disney Wish, designed to be among the most energy-efficient cruise ships on the water. We also continued to reduce the environmental impact of our productions and received 58 Green Seals and 38 Gold Seals from the Environmental Media Association. In December 2022, we updated our emission reduction goals to include our broader value chain and we plan to submit our goals to the Science Based Targets initiative for validation. And our Disney Conservation Fund contributed nearly $6.7 million in grants to more than 60 nonprofit organizations across 32 countries.\n\nWe inspire a world of belonging by embracing stories and storytellers who reflect the life experiences of people from across the globe. In fiscal 2022, we released award-winning and critically acclaimed films and shows that respect and celebrate different communities, such as Encanto, Abbott Elementary, Prey, Turning Red, Reservation Dogs, and Ms. Marvel, among others.\n\nWe also continue to make progress toward a workforce reflective of the audiences and guests we serve. This past year we continued to invest in programs like Disney\u2019s Veterans Institute, Disney on the Yard, Women\u2019s Talent Network, and Black Talent Network, to help attract and develop a more diverse workforce at all levels. We also celebrated the 10th anniversary of our Heroes Work Here program, our employees and cast members worldwide have collectively contributed nearly 13 million hours of service to their communities since the program was started nearly 40 years ago.\n\nWe continue to invest in our people. The underlying character of our Company comes from the hard work, energy, and dignity of our people. Investing in the health, safety, and overall well-being of our employees; providing opportunities for development and career mobility; and maintaining a supportive, respectful workplace require concrete solutions. In 2022, we expanded our education investment and career development program, Disney Aspire, and launched a new virtual leadership program for senior leaders called Disney IGNITE. We also reported adjusted pay ratios, which were at least 99% across gender, race, and ethnicity in the U.S.\n\nWe are focused on operating responsibly and on conducting our business in accordance with high standards of ethics. In 2022, we updated our Human Rights Policy, enhanced our Supply Chain Code of Conduct, and celebrated the 10th anniversary of our Supply Chain Investment Program, which provides grant funding to support tools and programs that improve working conditions and enhance accountability in global supply chains.\n\nAs you read this report, we hope you share our excitement about the progress we made this past year and the many opportunities ahead to deliver meaningful impact from our efforts. We are excited to celebrate our 100th anniversary; create even more magical experiences; and further serve our employees, guests, consumers, and communities in 2023 and beyond.\nOur Approach\n\nIn This Section\n\nOur Businesses 05\nSetting Our CSR Priorities & Strategy 06\nFiscal 2022 Highlights 07\nCSR Oversight & Accountability 10\nStakeholder Engagement & Participation 11\nCharitable Giving Approach 12\nOUR BUSINESSES\n\nThe mission of The Walt Disney Company is to entertain, inform, and inspire people around the globe through the power of unparalleled storytelling, reflecting the iconic brands, creative minds, and innovative technologies that make ours the world's premier entertainment company.\nSETTING OUR CSR PRIORITIES & STRATEGY\n\nSince the Company\u2019s founding nearly 100 years ago, operating responsibly has been an integral part of our DNA.\n\nOur corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts address the expectations of our people, consumers, communities, and investors, and help us to attract, retain, and develop talented and diverse creators, cast members, and employees, all of whom contribute to our business success. We take a strategic approach to setting our CSR priorities, addressing issues that are important to our businesses and to the communities where we operate. We regularly monitor issues and evolve our efforts to ensure we remain focused on the economic, environmental, and societal matters that impact those we serve.\n\nDisney strives to inspire a world of belonging by embracing broad representation and respect for every individual in our workplace, storytelling, and communities; a world in balance by taking action to create a cleaner, safer, and healthier world; and a world of hope by supporting our communities, especially children. We are also investing in our people and operating responsibly. Working together, side by side, our first responsibility is to have a meaningful, measurable, and positive impact on the people we serve. This report details our key actions across these focus areas and describes how we\u2019ve continued to implement our CSR strategy across our offerings, operations, and charitable giving initiatives.

She works in close collaboration with our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Human Resources Officer, Chief Diversity Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, General Counsel, Investor Relations, Global Public Policy, Government Relations, our segment business leaders, and their respective teams. Together they develop strategies, policies, programs, and other initiatives to address our priorities across our offerings, operations, and philanthropic giving.\n\nAdditionally, the Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board has oversight of CSR programs and reporting. Our EVP of CSR provides updates on CSR topics to the Committee throughout the year and presents to the full Board at least annually. The Board has also delegated oversight of specific topics to certain committees. The Governance and Nominating Committee oversees human rights policies and lobbying and political strategy. The Audit Committee oversees cybersecurity and data security risks and mitigation strategies. And the Compensation Committee oversees workforce equity matters. This includes compensation of the Company\u2019s executive officers; for example, diversity has been included as a factor in the executive bonus plan for many years, and in fiscal 2022, diversity and inclusion again had the highest weighting among nonfinancial objectives.\n\nFramework Alignment\n\nYou will see relevant icons in various sections throughout this report to demonstrate where our efforts align with specific United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\u2014a collection of global goals intended to create a cleaner, safer, and healthier future for all.

We work with a variety of stakeholders representing diverse perspectives\u2014including consumers, employees, industry and business communities, nonprofit and social impact organizations, and shareholders\u2014as we believe this can enhance our ability to identify opportunities and, in some cases, solutions to some of our most pressing challenges. We also engage on policy issues both directly and through industry associations on issues relevant to our businesses. Ongoing and responsive engagement with key stakeholders continues to inform our CSR strategy, goals, and initiatives.\n\n| Community Group                  | Examples of Engagement                                                                 | Objective of Engagement                                                                 |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| CONSUMERS                        | \u2022 Consumer surveys<br>\u2022 Focus groups<br>\u2022 Fan events<br>\u2022 Social media interactions<br>\u2022 Customer service emails and calls<br>\u2022 Cause marketing campaigns | Our customer engagement approach helps us better understand what our consumers expect from us. For example, it helps inform how we can utilize our unique content and experiences to inspire millions globally to show up as a force for good in our world. |\n| EMPLOYEES                        | \u2022 Employee surveys and focus groups<br>\u2022 Town halls<br>\u2022 Conversations focused on topics that matter to our employees, like inclusion and respect in the workplace<br>\u2022 Employee volunteering and giving<br>\u2022 Business unit\u2013specific initiatives (e.g., Disney Studios virtual executive coffees) | Through a variety of outlets, we participate in a two-way responsive dialogue where we learn what our employees value, their levels of satisfaction as well as their concerns, and their knowledge of and engagement with key issues at Disney. For example, in 2022 we surveyed employees across the enterprise. Learnings help to inform our ongoing work to develop programs that support and further the employee experience. |\n| INDUSTRY & BUSINESS COMMUNITIES  | \u2022 Industry conferences<br>\u2022 Industry and multi-stakeholder coalitions<br>\u2022 Supplier meetings and collaborations | Through engagement with industry leaders and suppliers, we join efforts to create large-scale, industry-wide change, as well as to learn about trends and insights related to our specific businesses.

For example, in calendar year 2022, our Investor Relations team contacted more than 95% of our largest 50 shareholders, and our Investor Relations team and Board held two formal rounds of shareholder engagement. This was in addition to regular ongoing engagement throughout the year with investors of all sizes from around the world. The feedback gathered during these conversations helps inform the Board\u2019s thinking, including on CSR practices and disclosures. |\nCHARITABLE GIVING APPROACH\n\nThrough financial contributions, collaboration with nonprofit organizations, and in-kind donations, Disney brings positive, meaningful, and measurable impact to our communities around the world. Guided by our Charitable Giving Guidelines, we focus on investments that align to our CSR focus areas; leverage our unique resources, skills, talents, and expertise; and address pressing community needs.\n\nIn the past decade, we have also matched more than $104 million in employee and cast member personal donations of money and time through Disney\u2019s Matching Gifts and VoluntEARS Grants programs. Charitable giving highlights are included throughout this report.\n\nCharitable Giving Strategy\n\nOur charitable giving is focused on three strategic pillars:\n\nWorld of Belonging\nDIVERSITY, EQUITY & INCLUSION\nGrants that advance authentic representation and increase access and opportunity in media and entertainment\n\nWorld in Balance\nENVIRONMENT & CONSERVATION\nGrants that protect species and habitats and inspire kids and families to take action for wildlife and the planet\n\nWorld of Hope\nCOMMUNITY\nGrants that bring comfort, optimism, and joy to our communities and inspire hope, especially for children\n\nWe are committed to directing >50% of our annual charitable giving to programs benefiting underrepresented communities. In fiscal 2022, ~60% of our ~$233 million in total cash and in-kind charitable contributions supported this commitment.3\n\n3 Charitable giving that we report includes grants specifically directed toward historically underrepresented and protected communities, including the Asian American, Pacific Islander, Black, Hispanic, Native American/Indigenous, and LGBTQIA+ communities, as well as People with Disabilities, veterans, and women. We also include grants to organizations where a percentage of their services reaches underrepresented and protected communities. If the organization spends a majority of their efforts on these communities, we count the entire grant, and if the organization does not spend a majority, we count a proration of the grant. For grants to these two types of organizations, we rely on their self-reported percentages regarding communities served. On a sample basis, we validate the percentages that we report.\nWorld of Belonging\n\nWe inspire a world of belonging through stories and storytellers who reflect the rich diversity of our world.\n\nIn This Section\n\nOverview 14\nPeople 15\nCulture 18\nContent 19\nCommunity 23\nTransparency & Accountability 28\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nDisney is committed to celebrating an inclusive and respectful world. We create authentic and unforgettable stories, characters, experiences, and products that capture the imagination of our global audiences.\n\nOur workplace practices help us to make progress toward attracting, retaining, and developing a workforce that reflects the diverse life experiences of our audiences and guests. Disney also collaborates with community organizations to create opportunity around the world through charitable giving and strategic endeavors. These efforts are described in the following sections that reflect our diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) focus areas:\n\nPEOPLE \u2794 | CULTURE \u2794 | CONTENT \u2794 | COMMUNITY \u2794 | TRANSPARENCY & ACCOUNTABILITY \u2794\n\nOur Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion team is working across the Company to inspire positive change.

We offer optional training to support leaders in identifying, attracting, and engaging a multifaceted talent pool. We also work to engage, develop, and retain a leadership team and workforce that reflect our audiences. For example, we promote accessible workplaces and we strive to recruit, train, and integrate employees with disabilities in alignment with industry best practices.\n\nTo attract and retain representative talent at the executive level, we invest in talent development programs like the Black Talent Network, which launched in 2020. This initiative expands exposure for Black talent across the Company and helps to increase representation in senior-level roles. Participants engage with senior leaders and create career plans to expand their opportunities within the Company, and 86% of Black Talent Network participants said they know the next steps to achieve their career possibilities.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we launched two new cohorts of the Women\u2019s Talent Network to enhance careers for Asian American & Pacific Islander (AAPI) as well as Latina employees. One hundred participants joined the pilot across both programs.\n\nOur individual businesses also facilitate talent development programs. For example, Disney General Entertainment continues its Executive Incubator Program, which works to create a pipeline of the next generation of creative executives by providing participants from underrepresented backgrounds with experience in various aspects of the content business. A few additional examples of how we are building a robust talent pipeline are included on the next page.\nAttracting & Developing Talent That Reflects Our Audiences (continued)\n\nCREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR HBCU ALUMNI\nNow in its second year, Disney on the Yard continues to build a community for alumni from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and provide meaningful opportunities for HBCU students who dream of one day working in the entertainment field. The program builds on Disney\u2019s support of HBCUs through scholarships and engagement with students, faculty, and alumni. Focused on building a robust, long-term pipeline of Black talent, in fiscal 2022 Disney on the Yard launched an inaugural summer program in which students from HBCUs received unique on-the-job experience with Disney.\n\nATTRACTING DIVERSE TECH TALENT\nDisney is working to attract wide-ranging talent to our technology teams. We are a proud supporter of The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, the world\u2019s largest gathering of women and nonbinary people in technology. In fiscal 2022, we supported the conference, both in-person and virtually, as a top-tier Emerald sponsor with more than 300 Disney representatives attending. Since 2020, Disney has also participated in AfroTech, an annual gathering of technologists focused on celebrating Black and African American community, culture, and innovation. These conferences, and many others, enable Disney to engage with prospective talent and share innovations and content from across the Company.\n\nBREAKING BARRIERS TO ENTRY\nIn fiscal 2022, Disney\u2019s Lucasfilm launched the Get in the Door initiative, which offers a robust website and documentary video series showcasing various Disney career opportunities and how to build a rewarding career in the industry. The initiative encourages talent from underrepresented backgrounds to explore careers in entertainment production. It reaches a broad cross-section of audiences, allowing them to see themselves in these roles through a wide network of social platforms, presentations, and recruitment avenues.\n\nDEVELOPING DIVERSE TALENT IN ANIMATION\nThe Walt Disney Studios supports the professional development initiatives of Latinx in Animation (LXIA), a signature program of the Latino Film Institute, by hosting talks to inspire artists in their own work and facilitating networking and hiring opportunities for LXIA members. LXIA is dedicated to uniting a talented pool of diverse innovators across the animation, visual effects, and gaming industries. Through our collaboration, talented groups of Latino creators are empowered to craft exceptional stories across multiple platforms and help bring valuable perspectives to our talent pipeline.\nChampioning Veterans\n\nWe are honored to champion the veteran community of the United States of America.\n\nHiring Veterans at Disney\n\nIn 2022, Disney celebrated the 10th anniversary of Heroes Work Here, an innovative hiring program that has resulted in more than 12,500 veterans being hired across the Company through the end of 2022, and we look forward to continuing to grow this program.\n\nLaunched in 2012, the program is committed to hiring, training, and supporting U.S. military veterans and military spouses while elevating awareness of their significant contributions as civilian employees. The program, which also included a supporting comic book from Marvel Entertainment, quickly surpassed its initial benchmark of providing at least 1,000 career opportunities for veterans by 2015\u2014a goal that was met in less than a year. And it continues to support individuals who have worn the uniform who are transitioning to the civilian workforce at Disney and beyond.\n\nPromoting Veterans\u2019 Professional Development\n\nIn 2013, Disney launched the Veterans Institute, a series of no-cost events designed to help companies enhance their recruiting, training, and development of veteran talent. The institute provides a forum for sharing best practices in hiring veterans and military spouses, and promoting skills and opportunities for a successful transition from the military to the civilian workforce.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, the seventh Veterans Institute Summit, presented by Disney Institute and Wounded Warrior Project, convened 600+ organizations and challenged organizations and individuals to determine \u201cwhat\u2019s next\u201d in hiring, training, and support programs for veterans and military spouses.\n\nLearn more about our support for veterans:\n\n- Gratitude & Respect for U.S. Armed Services\n- Heroes Supply Here\n\nSupport for the U.S. Armed Forces is a long-standing Disney tradition, and our Heroes Work Here program continues that proud legacy. Employees with military service are an essential part of our Disney family and contribute immeasurably to our work of telling incredible stories and making magic. We could not be more honored to champion U.S. military service members in all lines of work here at Disney.\n\nCappy Surette\nSenior Manager, External Communications, Disney Parks, Experiences and Products; retired U.S. Navy Captain; a founder of the Disney SALUTE Veteran BERG\n\nU.S. Army Reservist and Walt Disney World Resort cast member Greg Jackson is one of thousands of employees across Disney who have proudly served in uniform.\nOur Intention\n\nTo put the responsibility for an inclusive culture in the hands of our leaders and employees through comprehensive educational opportunities and engagement efforts.\n\nAcross Disney, we cultivate, value, and encourage curiosity, collaboration, and creativity from everyone and strive to build supportive environments that inspire optimism and drive innovation. We work to create a culture that is respectful and welcoming to all, including through our Business Employee Resource Groups (BERGs) and employee affinity groups, celebrations of heritage months, and leadership accountability and engagement. With the addition of a new human resources management system, employees in select countries and regions now have the option to indicate their pronouns. And employees also have access to optional DEI learning programs that help foster a culture that welcomes all, celebrate our unique perspectives, and promote respect for one another regardless of identity or background.\n\nEmployee-Led Groups\n\nDisney supports affinity groups and more than 100 BERGs, our voluntary, employee-led groups formed around shared identity, interests, and pursuits. These groups are a key component of nurturing a sense of employee belonging, visibility, and cultural understanding. Employees can network with peers, participate in outreach and mentoring programs, acquire new skills, build leadership capabilities, and develop their careers.\n\nHeritage Celebrations\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we expanded our celebration of affinity months and cultural moments. We elevated the voices and stories of employees, talent, producers, fans, and families around the world; engaged employee VolunTEARS; amplified awareness on social media; and supported community organizations with social impact grants. For example:\n\n- Freeform\u2019s Put You On campaign during Black History Month featured Black Freeform employees, talent, fans, and influencers.\n- FX collaborated with the National Indigenous Women\u2019s Resource Center to support an awareness week for missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.\n- On International Women\u2019s Day, we held an executive speaker series on global gender equality challenges.\n- During Asian American & Pacific Islander Heritage Month, Disney engaged experts and talent to explore mental health stigmas and challenges in the AAPI community and shared tools and resources for self-care and allyship.\n\nPride Year-Round\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we formed a dedicated team focused on year-round LGBTQIA+ inclusion in our workplace, content, and community giving and engagement. Disney also pledged $5 million to organizations serving the LGBTQIA+ community through support for inclusive and respectful workplaces and authentic representation of LGBTQIA+ in media and entertainment. In addition, Disney became a Human Rights Campaign National Corporate Partner at the Platinum tier.\n\nDuring LGBTQIA+ Pride Month, Disney employees participated in Pride parades in 17 cities while our Owned Television Stations and Hulu live-streamed Pride parades. Hulu was the exclusive streaming platform for GLAAD Media Awards and supported GLAAD PSAs featuring the story of an LGBTQIA+ teen and his family. Disney+ released Say It with Pride on its YouTube and Facebook channels. Additionally, the Disney Pride Collection was created by LGBTQIA+ employees and allies at The Walt Disney Company, and all profits from sales from the collection in June 2022 were donated to organizations around the world that support LGBTQIA+ communities.\nAcross our platforms, we champion storytelling that reflects the world around us and helps us develop meaningful relationships with our consumers.\n\nWe strive to present genuine, authentic, and respectful storytelling. To do so, we engage individuals, families, and communities across the globe, and we embrace different perspectives in our filmmaking, both in front of and behind the camera.\n\nAcross the film and television industry, studios and organizations like the British Film Institute and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences have adopted policies, practices, and standards to grow representation and respect for all communities. In line with evolving industry practices, we have and are continuing to develop representation guidelines across Disney General Entertainment (DGE) content and Studio live-action productions.\n\nRecent Examples of Our Inclusive Storytelling (pictured to the right)\n\nWalt Disney Animation Studios\u2019 Encanto (Academy Award winner), Pixar\u2019s Turning Red, ESPN+\u2019s exclusive coverage of the annual Department of Defense Warrior Games, ABC and 20th Television\u2019s Emmy Award\u2013winning Abbott Elementary, 20th Century Studios\u2019 Prey, Marvel Studios\u2019 Eternals and Ms. Marvel, Star Wars\u2019 Andor, Hulu Originals\u2019 This Fool, Onyx Collective\u2019s The Hair Tales, FX\u2019s Peabody Award\u2013winning Reservation Dogs, and Nat Geo\u2019s Life Below Zero: First Alaskans.\n\nPhoto Credits: Abbott Elementary: ABC/Matt Sayles.

The network is accessible to directors, producers, and casting directors who can search the profiles and invite artists to collaborate on their projects.\n\nCREATIVE TALENT PIPELINE PROGRAM\nDisney\u2019s Creative Talent Development & Inclusion (CTDI) team connects writers, producers, directors, and other creative talent from a variety of backgrounds to opportunities across DGE. In fiscal 2022, 100% of CTDI Writers and Directors program participants were staffed on DGE-scripted series. CTDI continues to provide direct mentorship and support to talent through events, networking opportunities, and coursework, including the DGE Writing Program, Directing Program, and Production Assistant Program.\n\nDEVELOPING EMERGING FILMMAKERS\nDisney Launchpad: Shorts Incubator serves as an entry point for emerging filmmakers, including writers and directors, from underrepresented backgrounds and with varied perspectives, with the goal of making an original short for Disney. In fiscal 2022, Launchpad expanded from six directors to 12 writers and directors after receiving nearly 2,000 applications. Season Two filmmakers come from a variety of backgrounds, including Black, Native American, Native Hawaiian, and LGBTQIA+. The program, which also expanded to include creative executives across the Company as mentors, is on track to release six short films in 2023.\n\nAUTHENTIC & ACCURATE PORTRAYALS\nDisney collaborates with many leading community organizations to guide content creators in developing authentic stories and accurate cultural portrayals. These organizations include CAPE, GLAAD, IllumiNative, NALIP, National Hispanic Media Coalition, Pillars, RespectAbility, and the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media. In addition, in fiscal 2022 Disney collaborated with Gold House to launch an industry-wide media guide that provides resources to support creators in developing authentic and affirming representation of Asian & Pacific Islander communities.\n\nDiversity has to be on the page before it can ever show up on the screen. With the pairing of writers and directors for our new season, we can\u2019t wait to share a new group of thought-provoking and creatively inspiring shorts that reflect the world we live in.\n\nPhillip Yaw Domfeh\nSenior Manager and Producer, Disney Launchpad, Season Two\nAccessible Experiences\n\nMaking Theme Parks More Accessible\n\nDisney wants every guest to be able to enjoy our experiences, and we work to adhere to accessibility best practices and standards. Our parks offer many accessible options, starting with online information and printed guidebooks to help guests fully experience the magic of the parks. Each park shares accessibility information on their site-specific website.\n\nAs examples of our efforts, at Walt Disney World Resort, accessibility services include wheelchair/Electric Conveyance Vehicle access, captioning, assistive listening, sign language interpretation, audio description, and more. At Disneyland Paris, we adapt our offerings to accommodate a range of disabilities. We empower guests to access all attractions based on their autonomy. We have integrated audio description services across the resort, provide a console with 3D printed maps for visually impaired guests, introduced sign language interpretation at select shows, offer assistive listening devices, adapted changing areas, adapted hotel and shuttle services, and more. We continue to ensure that accessibility priorities are taken into account for our guests and cast members.\n\nAnd at Hong Kong Disneyland, we teamed up with the Hong Kong Federation of Handicapped Youth to pilot a new accessibility training program for cast members. After completing the intensive training, cast members are appointed \u201cbarrier-free\u201d ambassadors.\n\nInclusive Offerings & Experiences\n\nShanghai Disney Resort celebrated International Day of Persons with Disabilities (IDPD) with an inspirational surprise, its first wheelchair flash-mob dance, where wheelchair dancers delighted guests with their moves. Additionally, since 2021, Hong Kong Disneyland Resort has showcased a wheelchair dance performance with Hong Kong Wheelchair Dance Sport Association to create an inclusive cavalcade for IDPD.\n\nAlso, just in time to mark the 25th anniversary of the \u201cIt\u2019s a small world\u201d Holiday experience, the beloved Disneyland Resort attraction welcomed two new dolls in wheelchairs to better reflect the diversity of children across the globe. From design to installation, Imagineers worked closely with Resort Enhancement, Animation, Wardrobe, and the ENABLED BERG that advocates for People with Disabilities.\n\nLearn more about accessible experiences:\n\nDisney Parks, Experiences and Products\n\nWheelchair dancers gave a spirited performance in Shanghai Disney Resort\u2019s first wheelchair flash-mob dance in December 2021.\nAccessible Content\n\nAccessibility on Our Streaming Platforms & Networks\n\nWe offer a range of tools and accessibility features across our streaming services, and we are working on improving offerings. Features vary by platform and may include tools such as audio descriptions, closed captioning, keyboard navigation, and interoperability with popular screen readers. We are committed to ongoing efforts to increase the accessibility of our content for all consumers.\n\nIn addition, ABC was recently honored by the American Council of the Blind with an award for Outstanding Achievement Audio Description Contribution for Live Events for their audio descriptions of live specials like the Oscars\u00ae.\n\nSee examples of our digital accessibility offerings:\n\nDisney+ Help Center\nHulu Help Center\n\nMaking Moviegoing More Accessible\n\nDisney is exploring ways to make moviegoing more accessible. In fiscal 2022, we worked with KultureCity, a leading nonprofit focused on sensory accessibility and acceptance, to launch sensory-inclusive movie screenings that cater to audiences with sensory needs such as autism. Exceptional Minds, a nonprofit academy and post-production studio for people on the autism spectrum, consulted on our strategy and attendee experience.\n\nTogether, we designed a moviegoing experience featuring trained staff, expedited check-in, reduced seating capacity, dimmed lighting, lowered sound, and sensory bags with items like noise-canceling headphones. In June 2022, we piloted the experience at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles, which has committed to hosting at least one screening respectful of audiences with sensory needs for each new major release moving forward.\n\nMarvel Studios\u2019 First Deaf Super Hero\n\nMarvel Studios\u2019 Eternals presented an important opportunity to include the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community in Disney\u2019s ongoing work to make content more accessible. Eternals\u2019 diverse team of heroes features the first Deaf character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, played by Deaf actress Lauren Ridloff. We worked with exhibitors to provide on-screen captions, held an open-caption premiere with American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters, and hosted screenings for organizations supporting the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community. Exhibitors, including AMC Theatres and Regal Cinemas, announced their commitment to on-screen captioning for Eternals and new movie releases across multiple regions.\n\nDisney Songs in Sign Language\n\nWe often adapt songs into ASL music videos so the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community can experience popular tracks from their favorite films and franchises. This year, the Disney Music Group collaborated with Deaf West Theatre on an ASL version of We Don\u2019t Talk About Bruno from Disney Animation\u2019s Encanto for International Day of Sign Languages. We Don\u2019t Talk About Bruno and Surface Pressure were also released in British Sign Language (BSL).\nCOMMUNITY\n\nOur Intentions\n\nTo direct more than 50% of our annual charitable giving to programs serving underrepresented communities and to spend at least $1 billion annually with diverse suppliers by 2024.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, more than $140 million (~60%) of our charitable giving was directed to programs that support Asian American and Pacific Islander, Black and African American, Hispanic and Latino, Native American and Indigenous, and multicultural communities, as well as women, veterans, People with Disabilities, and LGBTQIA+ individuals. Through impactful collaborations and strategic community investments, we are helping to advance authentic representation in media and entertainment (e.g., the Pillars Muslim Artist Database); drive economic opportunity, access, and equity in the business communities in which we operate (e.g., Out & Equal, RespectAbility); create inclusive and respectful entertainment experiences (e.g., sensory-accessible movie screenings with Exceptional Minds); and empower future generations of storytellers and innovators (e.g., Ghetto Film School, Hispanic Scholarship Fund, Asian Pacific Islander American Scholars, American Indian College Fund). In fiscal 2022, we launched the Disney Future Storytellers initiative, described in the spotlight on the next page.\n\n$140M+\nCharitable giving directed to programs supporting underrepresented communities\n\nAccess additional information on our philanthropy:\nCharitable Giving Approach\nCharitable Giving\n\nDisney employees paint a mural that honors LGBTQIA+ history and culture in East Los Angeles with Rainbow Labs.\n\n4 See footnote 3 on p. 12.\n5 See footnote 7 on p. 26.\nEmpowering the Next Generation Through Disney Future Storytellers\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we launched Disney Future Storytellers, Disney\u2019s commitment to empowering the next generation of storytellers and innovators. From charitable grants and programs that provide inspiration and hands-on experience in arts and science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education for school-age children, to scholarships, mentoring, and creative and technical skill-building for teens and young adults, Disney is increasing access to careers in the media, entertainment, technology, and hospitality industries for youth, especially for individuals from historically underrepresented or underserved communities.\n\nIt all starts with inspiring today\u2019s youth to dream about their future by sparking an interest in storytelling and technology. From there, we invest in programs that help them build the skills they need to turn their dreams into reality. Finally, we help young adults become who they imagine they can be by removing barriers and expanding access to professional training and networks with early career opportunities and financial support.\n\nWe want all youth to have access to rewarding opportunities in our industries. It is important to our future success to have a workforce that is representative and respectful of all communities so that we can create successful content and products reflecting our wide-ranging audiences.\n\n**Dream**\n\nSparking interest in storytelling and technology, inspiring the next generation to dream about their possibilities\n\n**Build**\n\nSupporting essential training and development programs to help youth build their talents and skills\n\n**DISNEY MUSICALS IN SCHOOLS**\n\nDisney Musicals in Schools, which builds sustainable arts programs in under-resourced public schools, was rebooted in 22 markets following the pandemic. Through the program, elementary school students and teachers join professional artists to produce their very own Disney KIDS musical on stage. Research conducted by Search Institute discovered that the program nurtures developmental relationships, with children finding a platform for connection, collaboration, and creative expression.\n\n**NEW INITIATIVES IN JAPAN AND KOREA**\n\nIn Japan, Disney collaborated with Junior Achievement and sponsored our first-ever program for middle school students in provincial areas. Students created characters and stories, and local Disney producers served as mentors to guide the students.\n\nIn Korea, in alignment with the Disney+ launch in November 2021, we expanded programs that invest in young creators. Programs support underprivileged children as well as teens that attend special-purpose schools, such as animation high schools.\n\n**PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES IN CODING**\n\nIn fiscal 2022, Disney began working with ChickTech, an organization committed to bringing gender equity to technology. We are supporting ChickTech\u2019s high school program, which includes a free, yearlong series of technology workshops, mentoring, and internship connections for eighth to 12th grade students. Our support includes grant funding for the program; mentorship, networking, and event opportunities; and the development of a technical workshop with Disney technologists.\nEmpowering the Next Generation Through Disney Future Storytellers (continued)\n\nBecome\n\nExpanding access to our industries and empowering young adults to become who they imagine they can be\n\nNURTURING RISING BLACK TALENT\n\nIn fiscal 2022, Disney joined the Propel Center, a first-of-its-kind education hub for HBCUs, as the organization\u2019s arts, media, entertainment, and hospitality lead sponsor. We also created the Disney Storytellers Fund at Howard University and Florida A&M University to generate opportunities for historically underrepresented students in media and entertainment. Additionally, we continued our long-standing work with United Negro College Fund (UNCF) and announced the 2022 Disney UNCF Corporate Scholars. Scholars receive a $5,000 annual scholarship, a paid summer internship at Disney, mentorship opportunities, and assistance with securing possible full-time roles with Disney upon graduation.\n\nDEVELOPING FUTURE TALENT IN EUROPE\n\nIn the UK, we strengthened local collaborations with education, community, and industry nonprofits. Organizations included MAMA Youth Project, The London Screen Academy, Stage One, Artistry Youth Dance, and The Thea Barnes Legacy Fund, among others. In fiscal 2022, Marvel entered the second year of a three-year collaboration with The Prince\u2019s Trust, which offers training and mentorship for young people in the field of product design, and released the \u201cWomen of Marvel: Stronger Together\u201d collection, featuring clothing, bags, and more.\n\nADVANCING A NEURODIVERSE TALENT PIPELINE\n\nWe made a $1 million contribution to Exceptional Minds in fiscal 2022 to help source, skill, scale, support, and sustain neurodiverse talent over the next three years. Our funds will be used for scholarships, academy faculty, career support services, and facilities and technology. Many of the program\u2019s graduates are offered full-time employment at Disney, Marvel, and other studios.\n\nPROVIDING A BEHIND-THE-SCENES VIEW\n\nDisney mentors are working with students in the Anaheim Union High School District through Anaheim\u2019s Innovative Mentoring Experience. As part of an ongoing workforce development initiative, Disneyland Resort has been a key supporter of the program since 2019, providing funding and mentorship, including a behind-the-scenes look at how business is conducted with a bit of Disney magic.\nSupplier Diversity\n\nWe believe that including diverse suppliers in our sourcing process provides a meaningful opportunity to seek innovative, high-quality, and cost-effective business solutions, while also supporting communities. Last year, we set a goal to spend at least $1 billion annually with diverse suppliers by 2024. Reaching this goal would place Disney among the top U.S. companies that are spending with diverse suppliers and would impact the communities where we do business by creating jobs and opportunities. In fiscal 2022, we spent more than $800 million with diverse suppliers, an increase of almost 80% compared to fiscal 2021.\n\nThroughout fiscal 2022, the Supplier Diversity team worked closely with internal analytics groups to develop a dashboard that guides business unit leaders in their supplier diversity benchmarks. Internal leaders can access the dashboard to review their teams\u2019 progress toward our diverse spending goal. This and other initiatives influenced the significant increase in diverse spending in fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2022, we also expanded our diversity classifications to include U.S. military spouse\u2013owned businesses.\n\nCOLLABORATING FOR CHANGE\n\nWe collaborate with supplier diversity\u2013focused organizations at the national, regional, and local levels, as well as business development organizations, advocacy groups, and trade show organizers. In fiscal 2022, our Supplier Diversity and Disney Parks, Experiences and Products (DPEP) teams sponsored the Russell Innovation Center for Entrepreneurs (RICE) Supply Chain Accelerator pilot that helped Black entrepreneurs do business with industry leaders, large corporations, and government agencies. The pilot included 35 growth-stage companies\u201466% of which were women-owned\u2014and began with a comprehensive gap assessment to understand needs and drive a detailed action plan.\n\nSUPPORTING INDUSTRY DIVERSITY\n\nOur Supplier Diversity team also began working with the Supplier Diversity Action Committee, an internal coalition of television marketing executives who advocate for agencies run by People of Color, women, LGBTQIA+ individuals, veterans, People with Disabilities, and others in the agency selection process. DGE led a committee that identified and created a database of more than 1,000 vendors to open doors to diverse businesses in the production and post-production categories.\n\nDiverse entrepreneurs participated in sessions on storytelling, customer service, and supplier diversity at Walt Disney World Resort as part of the Company\u2019s support for the Russell Innovation Center for Entrepreneurs Supply Chain Accelerator.\n\n7 Supplier diversity data include Tier 1 spend with firms that have obtained certification from a third-party agency as being at least 51% owned, controlled, and operated by a minority, woman, disabled person, veteran, service-disabled veteran, veteran spouse, or lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender person. We validate diverse status through certification compliance using WBENC, NMSDC, Department of Veterans Affairs, NGLCC, and Disability:IN.\nSupplier Diversity (continued)\n\nCHAMPIONING U.S. VETERAN\u2013 AND VETERAN SPOUSE\u2013OWNED BUSINESSES\n\nWe continue to expand our commitment to the individuals who have worn the uniform and have served the United States of America. Our efforts for U.S. veterans and their families extend beyond our Heroes Work Here program with our Heroes Supply Here endeavor. Through this program, we support businesses that are owned by veterans, including service-disabled veterans, as well as U.S. military spouses. We\u2019re committed to helping these communities earn the financial security they want, need, and deserve. By focusing our supplier efforts on work with veteran entrepreneurs and business owners, Disney has increased Company-wide spending with U.S. veteran\u2013 and veteran spouse\u2013owned businesses to approximately $6.4 million in 2022.\n\nLearn more about our support for veterans:\n- Championing Veterans\n- Gratitude & Respect for U.S. Armed Services\n\nPROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN\n\nIn 2022, Disney participated in panel discussions and business workshops in New Orleans that were hosted by minority business development groups, including Women\u2019s Business Enterprise Council (WBEC) South and the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Minority Business Development Agency. Disney also sponsored and provided executive support for WBEC\u2019s National Black Business Pitch, an event dedicated to discovering, promoting, and investing in Black business talent.\n\nAccess additional information on supplier diversity:\nSupplier Diversity Webpage\n\nU.S. Air Force Thunderbirds air demonstration team flies over Cinderella Castle at Magic Kingdom Park at Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, October 27, 2022, as a prelude to the beginning of National Veterans and Military Families Month in November.\nTransparency and accountability are an important part of our efforts. In fiscal 2022, we increased disclosure of meaningful metrics by releasing a new Pay Ratio Disclosure dashboard, and we continued to share data on representation of women and People of Color in our workforce and in front of and behind the camera. Our 2022 Workforce Diversity Dashboard, 2022 Content Representation Dashboard, 2021 EEO-1 report, and our adjusted Pay Ratio Disclosure are available online, and we intend to continue publishing these reports annually.\n\nAccess additional DEI data:\nReimagine Tomorrow\nWorld in Balance\n\nWe come together to help change the course of our planet\u2019s story, creating a cleaner, safer, and healthier world for people and wildlife.\n\nIn This Section\n\nOverview 30\n2030 Environmental Goals 30\nEmissions 31\nWater 34\nWaste 35\nMaterials 38\nSustainable Design 39\nWildlife Care & Conservation 42\nEnvironment & Conservation\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nDisney is committed to taking meaningful and measurable action to support a healthier planet for future generations as we operate and grow our businesses. We are focused on putting possibility into practice and inspiring optimism for a brighter, cleaner, and healthier future\u2014a unified commitment we call Disney Planet Possible.\n\nOur commitment to environmental sustainability goes back to our founding nearly 100 years ago. As Walt Disney himself said, \u201cConservation isn\u2019t just the business of a few people, it\u2019s a matter that concerns all of us.\u201d Our environmental commitments, summarized in this report and detailed in our 2030 Environmental Goals White Paper, represent some of the ways we are focused on helping to build on that legacy for communities around the globe, generation after generation.\n\n2030 ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS\n\nIn December 2020 and December 2022, we established a set of environmental goals that aim to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; help protect local watersheds; minimize waste; create products and packaging with environmentally preferable materials; and design and construct our buildings and attractions sustainably.\n\nSee more information about our environmental goals and how we plan to achieve them: 2030 Environmental Goals White Paper.\n\nEnvironmental Action Through Collaboration\n\nWe are a member of several initiatives and organizations, which we engage with regularly to support actions consistent with the Paris Climate Agreement and other environmental, climate, and conservation ambitions. These groups include:\n\n- Association of Zoos and Aquariums\n- Business Alliance to Scale Climate Solutions\n- BSR\n- Business Roundtable\n- Ceres Company Network\n- Clean Energy Buyers Association\n- Climate Solutions working group\n- Conservation Measures Partnership\n- Cruise Lines International Association\n- DIMPACT\n- International Union for Conservation of Nature\n- Sustainable Apparel Coalition\n- Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance\n- Sustainable Production Alliance\n- Textile Exchange\n- The Chamber of Commerce Climate Task Force\n- The World Resources Institute\u2019s Corporate Consultative Group and Aqueduct Alliance\n- U.S. Green Building Council\u00ae\n- World Association of Zoos and Aquariums\nIn alignment with our net zero emissions goal set in 2020, as well as the Paris Climate Agreement, we announced in December 2022 that we are setting a science-based target for all our emissions\u2014Scopes 1 and 2 in our direct operations, as well as Scope 3 in our broader value chain. We plan to submit this target to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for assessment.\n\nOur strategy for achieving net zero for Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 is based on the following fact-based reduction hierarchy:\n\n1. Designing our built environment to reduce or avoid emissions\n2. Reducing emissions through fuel and energy efficiency\n3. Replacing high-carbon energy sources with lower-carbon alternatives\n4. Investing in certified natural climate solutions\n\nLike most companies setting aspirational Scope 3 targets, these are challenging goals, and success depends on several external factors, including actions by our suppliers to reduce their emissions, global economy-wide transitions to cleaner fuels, availability of economically feasible solutions at scale, and consumer behavioral changes. Industry collaboration is key to addressing some of these challenges. See previous page for some of the organizations we engage with regularly.\n\nWe follow the global frameworks established by the GHG Protocol to measure Scope 1, 2 & 3 GHGs:\n\n- GHG Protocol\n\nSee more information about our environmental efforts:\n\n- 2030 Environmental Goals White Paper\n- 2022 CDP Climate Change Survey Response\n\nAccess emissions data:\n\n- Data & Reporting Frameworks\n\n---\n\n8 We define \u201cnet emissions\u201d and \u201cnet zero emissions\u201d for our 2030 goals as follows: \u201cNet emissions\u201d = Scope 1 emissions + Scope 2 emissions (market-based) \u2013 carbon credits. Scope 2 emissions (market-based) include emission reductions attributed to utility green power purchases, power purchase agreements, and unbundled energy attribute certificates (EACs). Our approach to carbon credits can be found in our Natural Climate Solutions White Paper. We will have achieved our 2030 \u201cnet zero emissions\u201d goal when \u201cnet emissions\u201d as defined above equals 0.\nProgressing Toward Net Zero GHG Emissions for Direct Operations\n\nWe are working to reduce our emissions by identifying ways to improve efficiency, reduce energy use, and use alternative low-carbon fuels.\n\n**REDUCING EMISSIONS FROM PRODUCTIONS**\n\nOur film and television productions are working to reduce emissions by replacing the diesel generators traditionally used to power sets and instead tying into the grid while on location or using battery electric, hybrid (diesel plus battery), and green hydrogen fuel cell generators. For example, in 2022, battery electric generators, which were recharged by solar panels, provided power for several weeks while filming on a beach, and grid ties replaced diesel generators on backlots in London, Vancouver, and Los Angeles.\n\n**ENERGY-EFFICIENT UPGRADES AT THEME PARKS**\n\nWe continue to make energy-efficient upgrades at our theme parks and resorts. For example, Shanghai Disney Resort installed a new water pump in the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction and added timing controls to outdoor fountains. Together, we expect to see approximately 830,000 kilowatt-hours in electricity savings annually. And Hong Kong Disneyland completed the installation of smart air conditioner occupancy sensors in guest rooms. This energy-saving feature is now in use in all three hotels.\n\n**USING LOWER-CARBON FUELS**\n\nThe Disney Wish set sail in fiscal 2022 and was designed to be among the most energy-efficient cruise ships on the water. The Disney Wish was primarily powered by liquified natural gas in fiscal 2022, which, when compared to traditional diesel or marine fuel, significantly reduces several emissions and pollutants.\n\n**NATURAL CLIMATE SOLUTIONS**\n\nWe also invest in high-quality, verified, and rigorously vetted natural climate solutions that generate meaningful carbon reductions as well as positive social and economic impacts. These projects help us address emissions from our direct operations that we cannot avoid. For example, our investment with Proyecto Mirador provides fuel-efficient, wood-burning cookstoves to families in rural Honduras and Guatemala.\n\n---\n\n9 See footnote 8 on p. 31.\nAccelerating Disney\u2019s Renewable Energy Portfolio\n\nDisney is committed to purchasing or producing 100% zero carbon electricity for all direct operations globally by 2030. We continue to research, invest in, and develop renewable electricity projects across our global portfolio. As of fiscal 2022, we have commissioned or announced more than 200 megawatts of solar capacity. Examples include:\n\n- In collaboration with the utility serving Walt Disney World Resort, two 75-megawatt solar facilities are expected to come online and are projected to bring the Resort\u2019s renewable energy consumption up to nearly 40% of its annual total power use.\n\n- Disneyland Paris is continuing the construction of approximately 50 acres of solar canopies, which will provide shade and shelter to more than 11,000 parking spaces and are estimated to generate approximately 36 gigawatt hours of electricity once fully operational.\n\n- Hong Kong Disneyland has embarked on the next phase of one of the largest solar panel sites in Hong Kong, installed at 21 different attractions and buildings.\n\n- Select operations subscribe to high-credibility green power programs that advance the decarbonization of Disney and our local communities. For example, Pixar is subscribed to 100% renewable electricity through East Bay Community Energy.\n\nMickey-shaped solar facility (located near EPCOT), which provides power to Walt Disney World Resort, was built in collaboration with Reedy Creek Improvement District and Duke Energy.\nDisney recognizes that water is essential for ecosystems and vital for communities and our operations around the world. Water is a shared resource, and we know that the Company\u2019s operations have an impact on local watershed conditions as well as on the health of our oceans. In keeping with the latest data and standards, our strategy reflects that water is a highly local issue, with individualized considerations in each geography.\n\n**Water Conservation**\n\nIn 2022, we continued to implement site-specific water conservation strategies at our theme parks and resorts. For example, we are using artificial turf and are implementing a sophisticated irrigation control system at Disneyland Resort as part of drought-fighting efforts. And Disneyland Paris is in the process of retrofitting the showerheads in two hotels with new LED-lit technology heads that allow guests to adjust their use to help conserve water. The turbine-powered LED lights change color based on the amount of water used, moving from blue to green, yellow, and eventually red when water use exceeds a certain volume. In a pilot, the new showerheads reduced water use by an average of 22% per room.\n\n**Watershed Investments**\n\nWe are identifying critical regional water issues and are continuing to collaborate with local stakeholders, such as industry and nonprofit organizations, to safeguard the overall health of watersheds as a multi-use sustainable resource. For example, we support WWF-Hong Kong\u2019s project to foster innovative approaches, such as the use of water buffalo, to conserve wetlands in the Shui Hau watershed and increase water security for local people and wildlife. We also support The Nature Conservancy\u2019s work in central Florida, including efforts to address growing freshwater demands, enhance water quality, improve water supply, and reduce flood risks through green stormwater infrastructure.\n\n**Sustainable Seafood**\n\nResponsible selection and sourcing of seafood is important to our business, to the livelihoods of the fishing industry worldwide, and to the health of the planet for future generations. In fiscal 2022, our U.S. parks, resorts, and cruise line sourced nearly 100% sustainable seafood. Fisheries are periodically evaluated for sustainability, and ratings for specific species do sometimes fluctuate. This affects our ability to source consistently to our ambitious 100% target. Nonetheless, our commitment to our 100% sustainably sourced seafood goal remains, and we continue to collaborate with the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership in their work across the supply chain to improve fishing and aquaculture and advance sustainable seafood production.\n\n---\n\n10 Disney\u2019s definition of sustainable seafood can be found in our 2030 Environmental Goals White Paper. The breakdown of sustainable seafood in fiscal 2022 was: 6% Best Choice, 73% Eco-certified, 11% Good Alternative, <1% Avoid, 9% Fishery Improvement Projects (FIP), and <1% Unrated.\nWASTE\n\nLearn more in our Data & Reporting Frameworks\n\n2030 Waste Goals\n\nAchieve zero waste to landfill for wholly owned and operated parks, resorts, and cruise line\n\nReduce single-use plastics in parks and resorts\n\nEliminate single-use plastics on cruise ships by 2025\n\nSee more information on our waste reduction strategies, including plastics reduction:\n\n2030 Environmental Goals White Paper\n\nThe growing amount of waste produced today poses a threat to our environment and ecosystems, and to communities around the world. Disney is committed to working to achieve zero waste to landfill for our wholly owned and operated parks, resorts, and cruise line by 2030.\n\nOur long-term waste management plan includes permanently reducing waste on our properties, including food waste; reusing products and materials; being deliberate about material sourcing; maximizing recycling; reducing single-use and other plastics; and focusing on education efforts with our guests and employees.\n\nMINIMIZING WASTE\n\n58%\n\nOf total Company operational waste diverted from landfill and incineration in fiscal 2022\n\nZero waste to landfill is defined as 90% operational waste diversion, including thermal waste-to-energy for Walt Disney World, Disneyland Resort, Disneyland Paris, and Disney Cruise Line.\nCostumes from Recycled Materials\n\nOur parks, hotels, and cruise businesses are integrating recycled content fiber into their cast and crew member costumes. For example, costumes and set pieces in *The Little Mermaid* theatrical production aboard the *Disney Wish* ship are made from recycled plastic, with more than 50% of the fabric used in the production made from recycled materials. The fabrics were also uniquely dyed using a waterless printing method, saving water compared to traditional dyeing processes. Back on land, the cast members at the newly opened *Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind* attraction at EPCOT are donning uniforms designed and created from sustainable features\u201470% of each uniform\u2019s base fabric is made from recycled content.\n\nReducing Waste on Productions\n\nMarvel Studios\u2019 *Moon Knight* series created a pop-up \u201cwaste garden\u201d where recyclables and other waste were collected and sorted by a local company that provides training and jobs to people transitioning out of homelessness. At the studio where *Moon Knight* was filmed, we plan to set up waste gardens for future films. In addition, *Prom Pact*, a Disney+ Original movie, introduced refillable water stations, saving the equivalent of more than 40,000 single-use plastic bottles of water during production. As we evolve our COVID-19 health and safety practices in line with local, regional, and federal guidelines, eliminating single-use plastic water bottles through refillable water stations will once again be a focus for our studios.\nReducing Food Waste\n\nOur approach to reducing food waste begins with menu planning to predict how many meals we will serve in a given day in order to prevent food waste before it begins. When there is unused food, we donate it to support local communities whenever feasible. We also utilize composting and biodigestion, and convert food waste into animal feed where possible. For instance, we have composting pilots at several restaurants, and Vero Beach Resort and Castaway Cay have installed biodigesters to manage inedible food waste.\n\nReducing Single-Use Plastics\n\nWe are committed to reducing single-use plastics in our parks and resorts, and eliminating single-use plastics on our cruise ships. For example, in fiscal 2022, Hong Kong Disneyland replaced plastic, disposable food service ware items, including to-go containers and cutlery, with wood alternatives and reusable melamine. Disney Cruise Line has been working to eliminate single-use plastic categories and intends to be free of single-use plastics by 2025. Examples include introducing alternatives to plastic merchandise bags and guest laundry bags, disposable cutlery, cold beverage lids, and even plastic drink garnish sticks. In addition, to encourage the use of reusable water bottles, refill stations have been installed on all ships and Castaway Cay.\n\nFrom Glass to Groundcover\n\nAs we explore options for the responsible disposal of glass from Walt Disney World Resort, we are piloting the use of a machine that pulverizes glass into gravel and sand-like pieces. This material can be used across the property in areas such as roadbeds, golf course bunkers, filtration systems, sandbags, and drainage.\nTo reduce environmental impacts across our consumer products portfolio, we identified a set of materials that are consistently used in high volumes and/or are known to have significant environmental impacts associated with their production and/or use. Such materials include paper, wood, and palm oil from forest products, as well as textiles and plastics. Our materials goals focus on reducing the environmental impacts of these materials while also helping our manufacturing network to become cleaner and safer as a whole.\n\nOur cross-functional consumer products task force works to advance our materials goals and produce comprehensive training resources to help our global teams and external collaborators understand how to help achieve our 2030 goals. To measure progress on our goals, we are building new tracking systems that will allow us to report on select quantitative measures. In the interim, we will continue to provide qualitative updates on our progress.\n\n**Unique Upcycled Accessories**\n\nDisneyland Paris offered guests limited-edition tote bags, duffel bags, briefcases, and pouches for purchase, which were made from a recycled tarp that previously covered Sleeping Beauty Castle during renovation work. Disney worked with a French-based SMB (small- to medium-sized business) that specializes in the upcycling of materials to create these unique goods.\nDesigning, building, and operating to avoid or reduce emissions, water, and waste have been core parts of Disney\u2019s sustainable design strategy.\n\nFor new projects, we are integrating sustainability throughout the design process, promoting a culture of continuous improvement, and exploring innovative solutions. In collaboration with our various design teams across Disney, and leveraging the creative expertise of our Disney Imagineers, we follow a rigorous set of internal Sustainable Design Standards aligned with our 2030 goals. This work is critical to helping us achieve our emissions goals since our built environment, ranging from theme parks to offices, accounts for the majority of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Our approach to sustainable design also helps contribute to cleaner air, more efficient use of water, and less waste for the communities in which we operate.\n\nOne example from our Disney Parks, Experiences and Products segment (DPEP) is Lighthouse Point in The Bahamas\u2014the newest addition to Disney Cruise Line\u2019s island destinations\u2014expected to welcome visitors in 2024. Only 16% of the site will be developed and much of it for low-density uses like the placement of beach chairs and umbrellas. The areas that will be developed will incorporate numerous design features to reduce environmental impacts, such as elevated walkways and structures to reduce disturbing the land. We are also designing to support zero waste to landfill as we explore innovative waste sorting and disposal technologies. We expect 90% of the energy demand to be met from renewable sources when it opens and for the site to be fully powered by renewable energy by 2030. In addition, we are developing a multi-faceted program to educate employees, vendors, and guests about the role they play in protecting the site.\nThrough National Geographic, Disneynature, and our other content platforms, Disney enjoys a rich and growing library of programming that connects audiences with the wonders of our natural world and inspires action to create a cleaner, safer, and healthier planet. In 2022, our broad portfolio of nature-focused stories included Disneynature\u2019s *Polar Bear* and National Geographic\u2019s *Explorer: The Last Tepui*, *Secrets of the Whales*, and *The Biggest Little Farm: The Return*.\n\nThe Environmental Media Association (EMA) Awards honor films and shows that increase public awareness of climate change, sustainability, and other environmental topics in their storylines. In 2022, we won two EMA Awards and received 58 Green Seals and 38 Gold Seals from EMA recognizing our efforts to reduce the environmental impact of production.\n\n### Giving Back Through National Geographic\n\nNational Geographic has been actively caring about our planet for well over a century. Today, National Geographic Partners\u2014a joint venture between The Walt Disney Company and nonprofit National Geographic Society\u2014continues this legacy. We return 27% of the net proceeds from our National Geographic lines of business to fund conservation, education, and sustainability projects.\n\nNational Geographic Partners aims to unite, inspire, and support the global travel community, with the brightest and best minds in scientific, travel, and cultural exploration, sharing groundbreaking, highly visual storytelling.\n\n### Protecting Wildlife\n\nWe have a strong track record of protecting wildlife. For example, with the release of Disneynature\u2019s *Polar Bear* in 2022, the Disney Conservation Fund (DCF) is supporting polar bear conservation with nonprofit organization Polar Bears International. Disney\u2019s grant will support research of promising aerial radar detection to identify hidden polar bear dens and help protect mothers and cubs; help to reduce possible human\u2013bear conflicts to keep both bears and people safe in the Arctic; and aid the preservation of polar bears\u2019 habitats.\nCovering Climate News\nABC News has a dedicated climate unit. In fiscal 2022, the unit highlighted people and organizations making an impact in *Hidden Climate Heroes* and took an in-depth look at the causes and risks of climate change in a monthlong series, *Climate Crisis: Saving Tomorrow*. The unit also teamed up with *Teen Vogue* to explore teenagers\u2019 growing concerns about climate change and the effects on their mental health.\n\nEarth Month Celebrations\nEarth Month kicked off with a conversation between DPEP Chairman Josh D\u2019Amaro and the legendary ethnologist and conservationist Dr. Jane Goodall. DCF made a gift to support the work of Dr. Goodall\u2019s Roots & Shoots, a program that supports young people working to effect positive change for the planet, starting in their local communities.\n\nNational Geographic India launched the year-round One for Change effort on Earth Day to spotlight change makers across India working to restore and preserve the environment. And National Geographic Latin America released a new edition of its *Lo Que Haces Cuenta* (\u201cWhat You Do Counts\u201d) campaign during Climate Change Day.\nThe Disney Conservation Fund was created more than 25 years ago to build on Walt Disney\u2019s legacy of saving wildlife, inspiring action, and helping to protect the planet. DCF philanthropic grants have helped bring wildlife like California condors, green sea turtles, and Atala butterflies back from the brink of extinction; plant millions of trees in critical forests; remove tons of debris from the ocean; advance conservation education for youth; and more.\n\nDisney Conservation Fund has invested more than $120 million, along with the expertise of dedicated teams, in community-led biodiversity conservation efforts since 1995 to help protect more than 1,000 species of wildlife and safeguard more than 315 million acres of habitat\u2014an area equal to more than 10,000 Walt Disney World Resorts.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, the DCF made nearly $6.7 million in grants, supporting more than 60 nonprofit organizations working across 32 countries. The DCF also honored 20 Disney Conservation Heroes\u2014an award recognizing Indigenous and local people dedicated to promoting a world where people, plants, and animals all have a thriving place to call home.\n\nLearn more about our Disney Conservation efforts online:\nCoral Reef Restoration\nWe continue to collaborate with a diverse group of coral reef management and conservation leaders to bring hope to the largest coral reef in the continental United States, the Florida Reef Tract. Disney Conservation Team Wildlife has provided leadership and expertise to support the Orlando-based Florida Coral Rescue Center. This state-of-the-art facility was established for gene banking and care of Florida corals rescued from reefs not yet affected by Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease, which has put 22 coral species at risk of extinction. The center is the largest facility of its kind in the United States and is part of a national network coordinated by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums to support breeding programs and efforts to return coral back to the ocean. In April 2022, the first reported spawning of rough cactus coral in human care took place at the Center.\n\nLocal Wildlife Conservation\nDisney Conservation Team Wildlife includes cast members working to inspire conservation actions and collaborating globally to share expertise and drive programs to positively impact wildlife and habitats. At Walt Disney World Resort, Team Wildlife monitors species diversity in our 8,000+ acre Wildlife Management Conservation Area to support statewide efforts to help preserve and connect key habitats. Nearby at the headwaters of the Everglades, we have also supported protection and restoration efforts at The Nature Conservancy\u2019s Disney Wilderness Preserve. The preserve spans 11,500 acres of restored wetland and upland habitats and is home to many native plants and animals, including threatened and endangered species like gopher tortoises and red-cockaded woodpeckers.\n\nRescuing & Rehabilitating Elephants\nOur Disney team based in India began supporting Wildlife SOS\u2019s efforts in 2021 and continued support throughout 2022 to rescue and rehabilitate elephants illegally taken from the wild. To date, more than 40 elephants have been given care and medical treatment at Wildlife SOS\u2019s Elephant Hospital and Elephant Conservation and Care Centre, established in 2010 and the first center of its kind in northern India.\n\nSea Turtle Conservation\nAs part of the $5 million we have invested since 1995 to help sea turtle conservation efforts globally, in 2022, the DCF supported a new mentorship and career training program hosted by the Sea Turtle Conservancy to spark passion for sea turtle conservation among central Florida youth from diverse and underserved communities. Students attended the 2022 Tour de Turtles event at Disney\u2019s Vero Beach Resort, an annual event that helps researchers, conservationists, and government agencies gather satellite transmitter data from migrating sea turtles to make more informed decisions about conservation methods and policies. In fiscal 2022, our sea turtle efforts reached an important milestone: Disney Conservation Team Wildlife celebrated 1.5 million sea turtles hatched from nests monitored by our team at Disney\u2019s Vero Beach Resort since 2003.\n\n14 This effort is led by the Association of Zoos & Aquariums with involvement from Disney Conservation, the Fish & Wildlife Foundation of Florida, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, NOAA Fisheries, and SeaWorld.\nExcellence in Animal Care\n\nDisney\u2019s Animals, Science and Environment team leads the Company\u2019s efforts to care for animals and the environment, connect people to nature, and conserve our natural resources.\n\nWHITE RHINOS BORN AT WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT\n\nAt Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom Theme Park, we celebrated the birth of the 13th white rhino born at Walt Disney World Resort\u2014an important milestone made possible by the dedication and care of Disney scientists, veterinarians, and keepers. Each birth has been part of the Species Survival Plan for white rhinos, overseen by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums to help promote responsible breeding of endangered species in managed care. These rhinos help us learn more about this near-threatened species, share learnings with other institutions, and offer guests an opportunity to connect with incredible animals in person.\n\nCELEBRATING GINO\u2019S 41ST BIRTHDAY\n\nIn December 2021, Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom celebrated the 41st birthday of Gino, the oldest western-lowland gorilla at Walt Disney World Resort. Gino is a favorite of many guests and something of an icon in the zoological community. Due to the trusted relationship he has developed with Disney\u2019s animal care team and his laid-back attitude, Gino has helped his keepers develop important techniques to care for gorillas in managed settings that have been modeled by other zoological institutions. He is one of the first gorillas in the world to allow his caretakers to perform cardiac ultrasounds without anesthesia, an important step in the advancement of care for his species, and more broadly for animal care and gorilla conservation globally.\nWorld of Hope\n\nWe are committed to bringing joy, comfort, and peace of mind to our communities and inspiring hope, especially for children.\n\nIn This Section\n\nOverview 46\nChildren\u2019s Hospitals 47\nWish Granting 51\nVolunteering 53\nStories of Hope in Communities Around the World 56\nCommunity\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nHaving a positive impact on the world as we grow our businesses has been a part of our Company since its founding. We place particular focus on areas where we are uniquely positioned to make a meaningful, measurable impact. Through our support of children\u2019s hospitals and wish granting, as well as the contributions of thousands of passionate employee volunteers around the world, we deliver joy when it\u2019s needed most.\n\n\u201c...At Walt Disney Imagineering, we make the impossible possible. We combine innovation and storytelling to bring Disney stories, characters, and worlds to life. Helping to reimagine the patient experience in children\u2019s hospitals to include Disney magic has delivered joy when it\u2019s needed most to so many kids and families all over the world\u2014one of the most rewarding experiences of my career.\u201d\n\nJosh Shaver-Moskowitz\nProducer, Walt Disney Imagineering\nCHILDREN\u2019S HOSPITALS\n\nSince Walt Disney himself first brought animators to visit hospitalized children, Disney stories have uplifted young people facing serious illness. In 2018, Disney announced a global commitment of $100 million to help reimagine the patient experience and deliver joy when it\u2019s needed most. Since setting our commitment, and despite pandemic-related delays, by the end of fiscal 2022, we had directed more than $75 million to our hospital initiative.\n\nWe bring the positive power of Disney stories and characters to children in more than 700 children\u2019s hospitals and pediatric places of care around the world. In fiscal 2022, we expanded our hospital installations globally, while continuing to provide new Disney-themed Starlight Hospital Wear and products, Disney Movie Moments, and Disney+ access.\n\nReimagining the Patient Experience\n\nDisney\u2019s efforts in fiscal 2022 included transforming hospital spaces with imaginative installations like interactive murals, digital displays, and play spaces to ease the fear and anxiety of a hospital stay and bring comfort to patients and their families.\n\n\u2022 Our children\u2019s hospital concepts and experiences expanded to hospitals in several U.S. states, Singapore, Japan, India, and eight countries across the Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA) region.\n\n\u2022 Kanagawa Children\u2019s Medical Center became the first hospital in Japan to offer interactive Disney murals that bring beloved characters and stories from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm to life.\n\n\u2022 We added wall art in two new hospitals in India. The installations at Holy Spirit Hospital in Mumbai and Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital in Varanasi delight and bring comfort to more than 200 children each day.\n\nDisney concepts were installed in Dr. von Haunerschen Kinderspital in Germany (top left), Ankara Bilkent City Hospital in Turkey (top right), KK Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital in Singapore (bottom left), and Kanagawa Children\u2019s Medical Center in Japan (bottom right) in fiscal 2022.\nCreating Moments of Comfort\n\nIn 2022, we expanded complimentary access to Disney+ for the teams in children's hospitals around the world who support patients. These Child Life Specialists have reported that Disney+ is a valuable tool that offers a sense of normalcy and eases stress during a child's hospital stay.\n\nAdditionally, to provide a sense of community and comfort during a time in which children may not be able to visit movie theatres, we more than doubled the number of participating hospitals in our Disney Movie Moments program, with more than 225 hospitals or places of care receiving special access to new movie titles from The Walt Disney Studios. New and existing hospitals kicked off their programs with a special screening of Disney and Pixar\u2019s animated film Lightyear.\n\nA Magical Day for Children\n\nIn May 2022, Disneyland Paris invited hundreds of children facing serious illness and their families to enjoy the park\u2019s 30th Anniversary festivities. The special event was planned in collaboration with Pi\u00e8ces Jaunes, part of the French Fondation des H\u00f4pitaux, whose mission is to improve the conditions of hospitalized children and adolescents. Guests were joined by French First Lady Brigitte Macron, who is President of the Fondation des H\u00f4pitaux, and Didier Deschamps, French national soccer team manager and godfather of Pi\u00e8ces Jaunes.\n\n15 Survey by Starlight Children\u2019s Foundation\u00ae in January 2023 of hospitals or pediatric places of care that are in Starlight\u2019s network.\nDelivering Joy Through the Power of Disney Characters and Stories\n\nDisney\u2019s collaboration with Starlight Children\u2019s Foundation\u2014a nonprofit dedicated to delivering happiness to seriously ill children and their families\u2014continues to bring moments of joy and comfort during hospital stays and challenging moments. More than 500 hospitals in the United States and Canada received Disney-themed Starlight Hospital Wear, toys, books, and games in fiscal 2022, and we continue to focus our donations on the medically underserved and vulnerable populations that need it most. Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, and ESPN Starlight Hospital Wear collections provided patients with their choice of fun and comfortable clothing to wear during their hospital stay.\n\nMay the 4th Be With You\n\nOur May the 4th celebration helped distribute lightsabers, adaptive costumes designed for children in wheelchairs, and more to hospitals around the U.S.\n\nBringing Movie Magic to Hospital Gowns\n\nPixar-themed Starlight Hospital Wear, inspired by iconic characters including those from Disney and Pixar\u2019s The Incredibles, Buzz Lightyear and Jessie from Toy Story, and Russell from Up, were offered to all hospitals within Starlight\u2019s network for the first time. Additionally, QR codes printed on the gowns provide an immersive experience for patients.\n\nDelivering Smiles\n\nMarvel-themed toys, books, and games were delivered to children\u2019s hospitals nationwide in August 2022. Patients at Texas Children\u2019s Hospital were delighted by a special Spidey and his Amazing Friends event with the voice talent of Hulk himself visiting.\nImproving the Patient Experience:\n\nDisney Institute has trained more than 23,000 hospital workers since 2018. In fiscal 2022, experts from Disney Institute again held training sessions for KK Women and Children\u2019s Hospital (KKH) in Singapore. The course focused on training hospital staff to create compassionate connections and meaningful moments with patients through three service principles: Serve with Heart, Reach Higher, and Own It. More than 5,000 KKH employees and leaders from multiple departments were in attendance.\n\nLearn more about Disney Institute:\n\nDisney Institute\n\nA young patient looks at Magic Art, a delightful digital screen that sparks to life with favorite characters delivering inspirational messages.\nWISH GRANTING\n\nDisney supports children beyond their hospital stays by helping grant life-changing Disney wishes for children when they need it most. Together with Make-A-Wish\u00ae, Disney has helped grant more than 145,000 magical wishes since 1980. Annually, we grant thousands of wishes in collaboration with wish-granting organizations around the globe. We are committed to helping kids feel like kids rather than patients by sharing unforgettable moments with their families. After a hiatus due to pandemic restrictions, in-person wish granting has made a gradual return.\n\nJoy for Children Who Need It Most\n\nThe Walt Disney Company UK & Ireland, Make-A-Wish UK, and The Kentown Wizard Foundation collaborated for a second year to provide magical Disney wish experiences for children with critical illnesses. In 2022, they granted more than 225 wishes and included children from Make-A-Wish Ireland. Disney VoluntEARS gave their time and skills, contributing more than 1,100 volunteering hours to these wish efforts. In addition to Disney experiences, the event also featured accessible activities such as a carousel for kids of all abilities to share everyday family moments together.\n\nGranting Wishes Around the World\n\nWish granting has resumed at all of our theme parks around the world, as well as at Aulani Resort and Walt Disney Imagineering. In 2022, wish families were given a special sneak peek of the Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser at Walt Disney World Resort before it opened to the public. And in China, in celebration of the fifth anniversary of Make-A-Wish Shanghai, Disney committed funds to support the construction of a wish room at Shanghai Children\u2019s Medical Center. A wish room, run by Make-A-Wish staff and volunteers, supports medically eligible children through the wish-granting process.\nSports Stars Delivering Joy\n\nESPN\u2019s My Wish series has returned to SportsCenter. The award-winning series has collaborated with Make-A-Wish since 2006 to fulfill 75 sports-themed wishes for children with critical illnesses. In fiscal 2022, wishes featured Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs, Klay Thompson of the Golden State Warriors, Austin Riley of the Atlanta Braves, and the NFL\u2019s New York Giants.\n\nMovie Premiere Wishes\n\nIn July 2022, two Make-A-Wish kids and their families sat front row as stars walked the blue carpet into the premiere of ZOMBIES 3, a Disney+ Original movie from Disney Branded Television. The children also got to meet with stars after the movie.\n\nA Very Special Bon Voyage\n\nDisney Cruise Line\u2019s newest ship, the Disney Wish, debuted with the help of wish kids. During the ceremony, three Make-A-Wish ambassadors\u2014Colby, 10; Megan, 16; and Jenna, 13\u2014symbolically bestowed good fortune on the vessel and its passengers.

Through collaboration and regular dialogue, we also work with a variety of external stakeholders, industry associations, and intergovernmental organizations to identify and manage human rights risks.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we updated our Human Rights Policy to reflect the evolving nature of our products and services, changes in our business, and the world in which we operate. Updates include, among others, new sections on content, communities, and privacy; additional information on grievance mechanisms and remedies; and expanded content on online safety to include children\u2019s privacy, safety and development, parental controls, and responsible marketing guidelines.\n\nOur refreshed content on our human rights webpage highlights various policies, practices, and programs that implement our Human Rights Policy, and identifies our salient human rights issues in the following areas: our people, our content, our products and supply chain, our communities, children, and privacy.\n\nThe Governance and Nominating Committee of our Board of Directors oversees the Company\u2019s human rights policies. Our General Counsel has oversight for compliance with our policy and works across the Company to monitor emerging issues, share progress, and identify areas for improvement.\nSUPPLY CHAIN\n\nDisney-branded products are produced in approximately 44,000 facilities in more than 100 countries. This manufacturing network and global footprint creates a highly complex network of suppliers, many of them several degrees removed from our direct operations. In addition, we purchase a vast array of products, materials, and services from thousands of suppliers to support our operations, such as theme parks and resorts; cruise and vacation experiences; film, television, streaming, and theatrical productions; and offices and distribution centers.\n\nResponsible sourcing is an important focus of Disney\u2019s overall corporate social responsibility efforts. We are focused on respecting human rights, reducing the environmental footprint of our supply chain, monitoring the safety and integrity of products, promoting supplier diversity, and working in collaboration with others to meet our objectives.\n\nInternational Labor Standards\n\nWe strive to foster safe, inclusive, and respectful workplaces wherever Disney-branded products are produced. Disney has set labor standards for the tens of thousands of facilities that make Disney-branded products, whether we procure products to sell directly to the consumer or license our intellectual property to independent businesses that use their own supply chains.\n\nThese standards come to life through our International Labor Standards (ILS) program, which licensees and vendors producing Disney-branded products are contractually obligated to comply with. The program is informed by our Standards of Business Conduct, Human Rights Policy, and Supply Chain Code of Conduct, along with a range of other responsible business expectations. Now in its third decade, the ILS program tracks the names and locations of authorized factories making Disney-branded products; sets standards for when, where, and how social compliance audits confirm compliance with our standards; and provides guidance to vendors and licensees on improving the labor conditions of their facilities, if needed. Suppliers are provided onboarding training and can participate in ongoing training sessions offered by our team.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY, TRANSPARENCY & COMPLIANCE ON INTERNATIONAL LABOR STANDARDS\n\nTo promote Company-wide integration, our Chief Financial Officer has responsibility for the ILS program. The Audit Committee of the Company\u2019s Board oversees and periodically reviews the program and receives updates, generally on an annual basis, about its performance.\n\nWe use ILS audits as a tool to identify and address labor-related issues. Audits are conducted by either third-party auditors or Disney staff. Submitted social compliance audits are reviewed for compliance with ILS program requirements. Corrective action plans are subsequently sent to licensees and vendors, who are expected to review them with their facilities and implement steps to promptly remedy any identified compliance violations.\n\nSupplemental guides are made available to our licensees and vendors to help them work with their facilities on program compliance. Along with an updated Forced Labor Guide, we also published a new Health and Safety Guide in fiscal 2022. To further promote program compliance, we regularly refine our Permitted Sourcing Countries list and periodically update our published list of facilities that produce Disney-branded products that are sold, distributed, or used in our own retail and wholesale businesses, as well as those used in our internal operations.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we enhanced and expanded our Supply Chain Code of Conduct (previously named the Code of Conduct for Manufacturers). The updated Code applies to both branded and nonbranded products, as well as their upstream components and materials, and formally recognizes the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the International Labor Organization\u2019s (ILO) Declaration on the Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. It also includes, for the first time, our expectations that suppliers will work to mitigate their environmental impacts as aligned with our 2030 environmental goals.\n\nWe are active participants in community efforts to improve labor conditions in global supply chains, including the Joint Forced Labor Working Group, Business at OECD Investment and Responsible Business Conduct Committee, the ILO Global Business Network on Forced Labor, ILO Better Work, and others.\n\nLearn more about our ILS program:\nAdvancing labor standards requires sustained investment to incubate and pilot scalable tools and programs. 2022 marked the 10th year of Disney\u2019s Supply Chain Investment Program (SCIP), which provides grant funding to nonprofit organizations, social enterprises, and United Nations agencies to create solutions that address root-cause issues of poor working conditions and help enhance supply chain visibility. Over the past decade, SCIP has addressed issues including forced labor, worker voice, supply chain traceability, child labor, and ethical recruitment.\n\nSince 2012, Disney has contributed more than $24 million through SCIP to 40 unique programs in more than 20 countries, directly benefiting 250,000 workers and supporting tools that have reached and benefited 14 million additional workers.\n\nIN 2022, SCIP PROVIDED FUNDING TO THE FOLLOWING ORGANIZATIONS\n\n- International Organization for Migration (IOM): Our funding supported IOM\u2019s International Recruitment Integrity System (IRIS) Global Policy Network, a platform for dialogue and exchange between policymakers, regulators, and key stakeholders to facilitate ethical and responsible recruitment of migrant workers.\n- FishWise: Disney\u2019s funding supported the creation of a market-based framework for monitoring labor and human rights in the seafood sector in alignment with existing human rights due diligence practices and models.\n\nRead more about SCIP projects we have funded: [SCIP Projects](#)\nGUEST SAFETY\n\nIn our parks and resorts around the world, safety is the first of the \u201cFive Keys\u201d of Disney\u2019s standards for theme park excellence. We demonstrate our commitment to safety in numerous ways at our properties\u2014from the Imagineers who apply advanced safety technologies to our attractions, to our security cast members who patrol our properties 24 hours a day. Our safety professionals reflect a broad range of disciplines, including medicine, engineering, quality, maintenance, attraction operations, ergonomics, industrial hygiene, occupational safety, and food safety.\n\nParks Safety\n\nTo support guest safety at our parks, we use innovative and \u201csmart safety\u201d systems for our attractions. Every night, maintenance teams perform priority maintenance functions, and our computerized maintenance management system tracks the completion of each procedure. The system includes Disney-patented technology that prevents a ride from accepting guests unless required critical maintenance has been completed and the ride has been deemed ready to open for operations. We regularly provide our cast and crew members safety training and information through formal instruction, on-the-job training, and a structured communications process.\n\nAccording to the annual International Association of Amusement Parks and Recreation Ride Safety Report, administered by the National Safety Council, the industry injury rate per million in attendance has decreased by 47% over the past 18 years, from 7.0 to 3.7 injuries. Over the past 10 years, our U.S. Disney Parks have reported rates averaging 41% below the industry average.18\n\nWild About Safety Program\n\n2023 marks the 20th anniversary of the Disney Wild About Safety program, which engages families in safety and health through storytelling. The program features Timon and Pumbaa from The Lion King animated movie as official \u201cspokes-characters\u201d on a mission to spread important safety and health messages to guests through a series of illustrations in tip cards, activity books, videos, and other materials throughout our domestic and international theme parks and resorts. We\u2019ve extended the program by providing materials on a streaming platform for our employees, cast members, and educators to use in schools and in the community. The lesson-based, multilingual, global educational program aims to improve children\u2019s awareness and understanding of safety, health, and environmental issues, and ultimately to impact their behavior.\n\n18 National Safety Council\nThe safety of products bearing Disney brands, characters, and other intellectual property is of the utmost importance to us. Disney-branded consumer products, spanning numerous categories from toys and apparel to books and fine art, are produced by thousands of independent licensees and vendors around the world. Our product safety program accounts for this breadth, as well as the rapid changes in scientific knowledge, evolving regulations, and consumer and community concerns.\n\nOur Product Integrity function oversees Disney\u2019s safety policies, procedures, and operating requirements for physical products containing Disney intellectual property across the enterprise. Disney requires that licensees and vendors contractually commit to follow sensible, reasonable, and proper procedures for verifying that Disney-branded products comply with applicable safety regulatory requirements and any additional requirements that may be specified by Disney.\n\nWe also have policies to manage the use of chemicals in products. These require vendors and licensees to conduct analytical tests by certified third-party testing laboratories or equivalent procedures, including testing for chemical levels to verify that, at a minimum, the products meet applicable regulatory requirements. Under the Disney Product Integrity Program, all test reports submitted are reviewed to verify that the testing was appropriate and that the proper procedures were performed. In 2022, we introduced a new requirement prohibiting the use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances\u2014known as PFAS\u2014in consumer products developed, sourced, and distributed by a Disney entity.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we updated our Supply Chain Code of Conduct to include \u201cQuality and Safety.\u201d Although we had already communicated quality and safety expectations to suppliers, the updated Code formalized our expectations across our supply chains.\n\nRead more about how we manage the use of chemicals:\n\nManagement of Chemicals in Consumer Products Policy\nPRIVACY & CYBERSECURITY\n\nDisney has implemented a robust and comprehensive global privacy program based on the principles of privacy by design, accountability, transparency, and giving consumers meaningful controls over their personal data. We regularly assess and update our program to meet the requirements of emerging privacy laws and regulations across the world, as well as to keep up with rapid advancements in technology and new business initiatives. In 2022, this included updates to reflect laws going into effect in 2023 in California, Virginia, Colorado, Utah, and Connecticut.\n\nDay-to-day management of our data privacy policies is overseen by our Senior Vice President of Global Public Policy, who reports directly to our General Counsel. We have incorporated privacy topics into the Company\u2019s annual Standards of Business Conduct and information security training, and we conduct ongoing specialized training for relevant groups that handle consumer and employee data.\n\nOur Senior Vice President, CISO Cybersecurity & Technology, oversees day-to-day management of data security. This role reports to our Executive Vice President of Enterprise Technology and Chief Information Officer, who reports directly to our Chief Financial Officer. The Audit Committee oversees cybersecurity and data security risks, and the Chief Information Officer updates the Board of Directors or Audit Committee, at least annually, on the Company\u2019s cybersecurity and data security risks and mitigation strategies.\n\nThe Company\u2019s information security program incorporates the core functions of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework, which provide a strategic view of an organization\u2019s management of cybersecurity risk. These functions cover areas such as asset management, governance, risk management, identity and access management, awareness and training, data and information protection, response and recovery, and communication protocols.\n\nWe have an established information security risk management framework that outlines the following steps:\n\n- **Prepare**: Prepare the organization to manage its information security risks by identifying key roles, documenting responsibilities, establishing information security risk principles, and helping ensure users are educated.\n- **Categorize**: Categorize information systems based on risk factors such as type of information stored or processed, exploitability, and business impact.\n- **Select and Implement**: Protect information systems commensurate with risk by selecting, documenting, and implementing necessary controls.\n- **Assess**: Determine whether controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome. This is accomplished through log collection and reporting, control evaluations, risk assessments, and remediation activities.\n- **Authorize**: Provide accountability by requiring control owners to determine whether the security risk, based on the operation of controls, is acceptable.\n- **Monitor**: Maintain awareness about the security of systems through ongoing monitoring.\n\nRead more about our approach to privacy:\n\nRead more about our approach to cybersecurity:\nDIGITAL WELLNESS & RESPONSIBLE CONTENT\n\nWe believe that the digital world should be a space for kids and families to engage, learn, explore, and express themselves. Disney strives to produce positive, respectful, high-quality content and experiences designed for individuals, children of all ages, and their families.\n\nWe deliver content through multiple channels, including our own digital offerings. Our internal policies and practices promote safety within our digital experiences. We also provide parents with controls and recommendations so that they can have the information they need to choose the content and experiences right for their families. For example, Disney+ and Hulu provide parents and caregivers with controls to manage their family\u2019s engagement with our content. This includes readily accessible content ratings as well as the ability to create profiles that can be tailored to provide a curated set of content appropriate for the profile user. In addition, subscribers can establish a PIN to control profile access.\n\nIn addition to designing our digital platforms with safety in mind, we invest in supporting children\u2019s digital well-being through our digital grant portfolio. We provide funding to NGOs and other organizations working on digital issues to educate children, parents, and teachers around the globe about digital citizenship. Grantees provide expertise in areas including digital literacy and resilience, privacy, responsible internet use, critical thinking, and educator training.\n\nIn 2022, we expanded our comprehensive digital wellness education programs with new programs in Belgium, Bulgaria, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa. Altogether, we supported 19 organizations around the world while increasing our focus on underserved communities, such as children in rural areas, Indigenous people, refugees, and children with disabilities. Our initiatives supported peer-to-peer training, youth advisory councils, and media literacy initiatives (including reporting portals and chat lines to assist children in crisis, and more).\n\nAs an example, the Paradigm Initiative works to connect underserved African youth with digital opportunities to improve livelihoods. Disney supports its LIFE (Life skills, Information & communications technology, Financial literacy, and Entrepreneurship) Legacy Program, which equips participants with digital literacy and entrepreneurship skills and connects them to internships or entrepreneurial ventures.\n\nWe also participate in industry coalitions to promote user awareness of online safety. For example, we are a longtime sponsor of fragFINN, collaborate with Childnet on Safer Internet Day in the UK, act as signatories to the Alliance to Better Protect Minors Online, and participate in the Members Group of the Family Online Safety Institute. In 2022, we joined the International Telecommunication Union\u2019s Partner2Connect Digital Coalition initiative, a multi-stakeholder platform that mobilizes resources, partnerships, and commitments to foster meaningful connectivity and digital transformation globally, in the hardest-to-connect communities.\n\nSee more on our approach to digital wellness:\n\nPrivacy Center\n\nLearn more about the content safety functionalities on some of our platforms:\n\nDisney+ Help Center\n\nHulu Help Center\nDisney maintains standards and practices with respect to the advertising we will accept on our media properties, which reflects our commitment to help promote truthful, accurate, and appropriate advertising.\n\nWe also prioritize the rights and the cognitive and emotional maturity of children when accepting and developing advertising and marketing materials. Our guidelines and policies governing our products, experiences, and communications are designed to promote the digital and physical safety of children, give parents the ability to decide on the appropriate experiences for their families, and encourage children to make good choices.\n\nWe are also intentional about how we promote healthy food and beverages to kids through our Nutrition Guideline Policy. These guidelines apply to our Studio promotions, food and beverage licensing, third-party advertising on our kids\u2019 networks, and kids\u2019 meals in Disney Parks. Ongoing reviews of these global guidelines help us reflect up-to-date dietary guidance and consider the evolving social and scientific understanding of children\u2019s physical and digital lives. In fiscal 2022, we continued to have approximately 100% of food and beverage advertising on our owned and controlled media platforms oriented to kids and families meet our Nutrition Guideline Policy. In addition, we again achieved our global target to have 85% of our licensed food and beverages intended for children and families meet our nutrition criteria for healthier choices and carry the Disney Check to signify this.\n\nThrough the Disney Check program, which marked its 10th anniversary in 2022, we help kids and families identify healthier food and beverage options on licensed products wherever Disney products are sold and at our U.S. theme parks and Disneyland Paris.\n\nWe work to make healthy living fun and simple. In 2022, Marvel teamed up with Dole Food Company on the Healthy Heroes, Assemble! campaign to create Avengers: Super Fuel! short-form content to encourage kids to try fruits and vegetables.\n\nRead more about our approach to responsible marketing online:\nABC News is committed to the independence of our editorial decision-making from commercial, political, and other interests of the Company's management or owners, as well as from the interests of external stakeholders, and to providing citizens with accurate and useful information across our platforms.

Saturday closest to September 30.\n\nEnvironmental Sustainability\n20 Some previously published environmental data have been restated to reflect corrections, updates to methodology, and/or changes in emission factors. Fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 data have been revised to include Twenty-First Century Fox operations.\n21 The boundary for Disney\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reporting includes owned and operated assets (such as Theme Parks & Resorts, Disney Cruise Line, and commercial spaces), leased assets (such as office locations), as well as Productions (including feature films, television, theatricals, and sporting events). Direct CO2 emissions from biogenic fuels are not included in the Scope 1 totals. They are as follows: FY19: 29,146 MT CO2e; FY20: 16,799 MT CO2e; FY21: 22,662 MT CO2e; FY22: 4,890 MT CO2e.\n22 GHG emissions are measured and calculated according to the principles in the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol\u2019s \u201cA Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, 2004 Revised Edition\u201d (GHG Protocol).\n23 Market-based emissions are used where available in calculating carbon credit retirements, total emissions, and net emissions. We define \u201cnet emissions\u201d as follows: Scope 1 emissions + Scope 2 emissions (market-based) \u2013 carbon credits. Scope 2 emissions (market-based) include emission reductions attributed to utility green power purchases, power purchase agreements, and unbundled energy attribute certificates (EACs). Our approach to carbon credits can be found in our Natural Climate Solutions White Paper. We will have achieved our 2030 \u201cnet zero emissions\u201d goal when \u201cnet emissions,\u201d as defined above, equals 0.\n24 Carbon credits are from projects developed according to recognized standards (e.g., Climate Action Reserve, Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard). All credits are verified by accredited third-party reviewers.\n25 Scope 3 emissions calculations follow guidance provided by the GHG Protocol. In many instances, these emissions calculations are based on estimated and extrapolated data and rely on third-party emission factor databases and industry averages. We expect to make continuous improvements to Scope 3 estimates over time, including updates to assessments of business activities and activity boundaries, and improvements in input data and emission factors. At the time of publishing this report, fiscal 2019 is our most recent Scope 3 inventory, with fiscal 2022 Scope 3 footprint calculation in progress (to be reported out at a later date).\n26 Spend-based methodology estimates emissions for goods and services by collecting data on the economic value of goods and services purchased and multiplying by relevant secondary emission factors; and using secondary data to calculate upstream emissions wherever supplier-specific data are not available.\n27 Hybrid methodology uses a combination of supplier-specific activity data (where available) and secondary data to fill the gaps. This method involves: collecting allocated Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions data directly from suppliers; calculating upstream emissions of goods and services from suppliers\u2019 activity data on the amount of materials, fuel, and electricity used, as well as distance transported and waste generated from the production of goods and services, and applying appropriate emission factors; and using secondary data to calculate upstream emissions wherever supplier-specific data are not available.\n28 Average data methodology estimates emissions for goods and services by collecting data on the mass (e.g., kilograms or pounds) or other relevant units of goods or services purchased, and multiplying by the relevant secondary (e.g., industry average) emission factors (e.g., average emissions per unit of good or service).\n29 Fuel-based methodology involves determining the amount of fuel consumed (i.e., Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions of transport providers) and applying the appropriate emission factor for that fuel.\n30 Average product methodology involves estimating emissions for goods by collecting data on the mass or other relevant units of goods purchased and multiplying by relevant secondary (e.g., industry average) emission factors (e.g., average emissions per unit of good).\n31 Distance-based methodology involves determining the mass, distance, and mode of each shipment, then applying the appropriate mass-distance emission factor for the vehicle used.\n32 Waste-type specific methodology involves using emission factors for specific waste types and waste treatment methods.\n33 Site-specific methodology involves site-specific fuel, electricity, and fugitive emissions data, and applying the appropriate emission factors.\n34 Franchise-specific methodology involves collecting site-specific activity data or Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions data from franchises.\n35 Asset-specific methodology involves collecting asset-specific (e.g., site-specific) fuel and energy use data and process and fugitive emissions data, or Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions data from individual leased assets.\n36 Emissions within this category were evaluated and determined not to be relevant. Activities identified as downstream transportation and distribution do not result in significant Scope 3 emissions for the Company.\n37 Emissions within this category were evaluated and determined not to be relevant. The Company does not have any activities that it characterizes as intermediate goods.\n38 Total energy includes electricity, natural gas, chilled water, hot water, steam, compressed air, renewable energy, and fuels. FY19\u2013FY21 data excludes energy from Productions.\n39 Percentage grid electricity is purchased electricity consumption divided by total energy consumption.\n40 Percentage renewables is renewable energy consumption divided by total energy consumption. Renewable energy consumption includes renewable fuels and renewable electricity that we produce or purchase and match with Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) or Guarantees of Origin (GOs). The renewable portion of the electricity grid mix for which we do not possess RECs or GOs is not included in this calculation.\nFISCAL 2022 DATA TABLE\n\nFootnotes\n\n41 Percentage zero carbon electricity is zero carbon electricity consumption divided by total electricity consumption. We define zero carbon electricity as any type of electricity generation that does not generate GHGs as solar, wind, geothermal, nuclear, and large-scale hydropower.\n\n42 Waste diverted includes waste prevention, donations, recycling, compost, anaerobic digestion, and thermal waste-to-energy. Total waste includes waste diverted, waste sent to landfill, and incineration without energy recovery. Incineration without energy recovery is not counted in total waste sent to landfill nor total waste diverted\u2014thus the two do not sum to total waste generated.\n\n43 For total Company data, facilities include Theme Parks & Resorts, Disney Cruise Line, ESPN, enterprise-owned commercial and office spaces, and Pixar. Excluded are all leased properties, Disney Stores and Distribution Centers, TV stations, and all construction materials.\n\n44 Diversion rate includes data from annual facility asset planning construction projects and construction for new assets that became operational in the reporting year, in the U.S. and Europe only.\n\n45 The boundary for Disney\u2019s water volume reporting includes owned and operated assets (Theme Parks & Resorts, Disney Cruise Line, owned commercial and office spaces, Studios, and ESPN). Water consumption from Disney Stores and leased assets are excluded. Water data for Shanghai Disney Resort were not included in data prior to fiscal 2021.\n\n46 A third-party validator provided limited assurance of our fiscal 2019, fiscal 2020, and fiscal 2021 GHG emissions. Limited assurance of fiscal 2022 emissions will be reported out upon completion.\n\nSocial Impact\n\n47 Charitable cash contributions include Company-directed charitable cash donations, including contributions made by the Disney Conservation Fund, as well as employee-directed Matching Gifts grants and DisneyVolunteers Grants.\n\n48 In-kind support refers to noncash contributions comprising tangible items or non-tangible support. Donations may include, but are not limited to, estimated values for merchandise, theme park tickets, food, public service announcements (PSAs), character/talent appearances, and other noncash charitable support. Due to differences in distribution, programming, availability, pricing, marketplace demand, and other variables, PSAs are valued differently across our media platforms. For example, in some cases, PSAs are valued based on an average sponsor value across a daypart rotation. Therefore, we do not use a single method to value PSAs.\n\n49 Includes grants directed toward historically underrepresented and protected communities, including Asian American & Pacific Islander, Black & African American, Hispanic & Latino, Native American & Indigenous, and LGBTQIA+ communities, as well as People with Disabilities, veterans, and women. We also include grants to organizations where a percentage of their services reaches underrepresented and protected communities. If the organization spends a majority of its efforts on these communities, we count the entire grant. If the organization does not spend a majority, we count a proration of the grant. We rely on each organization\u2019s self-reported percentages regarding communities served. On a sample basis, we validate the percentages that we report.\n\n50 Disney VoluntEARS data includes hours logged by employees of The Walt Disney Company and its subsidiaries and is rounded.\n\n51 Supplier diversity includes Tier 1 spend with firms that have obtained certification from a third-party agency as being at least 5% owned, controlled, and operated by a minority, woman, disabled person, veteran, service-disabled veteran, veteran spouse, or lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender person. We validate diverse status through certification compliance using WBENC, NMSDC, Department of Veterans Affairs, NGLCC, and Disability:IN.\n\n52 Employee statistics generally reflect our employment base at the end of each fiscal year.\n\n53 Headcount includes employees at The Walt Disney Company (TWDC), Hulu, Pixar, DisneyLand Paris, and Twenty-First Century Fox (TFCF). Excludes freelancers, contractors, and domestic TWDC employees not paid in the last 60 days.\n\n54 Consistent with our 10-K, Global Employee numbers are rounded to the nearest thousand.\n\n55 Learning-related data are approximate and rounded. Data reflects courses offered through our top learning platforms: D Learn, Harvard Spark, Harvard ManageMentor, and Harvard Leading Edge. D Learn represents all employees, excluding Pixar and contract workers for all years and Hulu employees prior to fiscal 2021. Data includes courses and non-required courses including online courses, orientations, in-person classes, and on demand content. Participants can attend more than one course and may view online content more than once, depending on their individual needs.\n\n56 Data represents the number of unique courses offered in CSR Reports in prior years, this metric measured the number of scheduled classes of a unique course. Methodology was updated to better reflect unique courses offered vs. courses consumed.\n\n57 Almost all hourly full-time and part-time nontipped employees in our U.S. Disney Parks, Experiences and Products business earn a base rate of at least $15/hour, excluding Walt Disney World Resort. (This program is not comparable to other employment opportunities, as it includes other benefits such as housing and transportation, and is not select regions.) All employees earn minimum wage or higher. Median earnings for hourly employees is based on total earnings for total hours paid and includes the impact of overtime, shift premiums, and gratuities. Excludes the value of benefits for eligible employees.\n\n58 Headcount includes full-time and part-time employees at TWDC, Hulu, Pixar, DisneyLand Paris, and TFCF. Excludes freelancers, contractors, casual seasonal, interns, and domestic TWDC employees not paid in the last 60 days. Domestic counts exclude Disney Cruise Line Shipboard Percentages for women based on global full- and part-time headcount. Percentages for People of Color include U.S.-based full- and part-time employees only. People of Color includes employees who are Asian American, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, Native American or Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, or Two or More Races.\n\n59 \u201cExecutive\u201d includes employees at the Director level and above. \u201cManager\u201d includes employees at Manager levels. \u201cBelow Manager\u201d includes employees that do not meet Executive or Manager criteria. In fiscal 2021 and prior, TFCF Directors were included in Manager.\n\n60 Scripted & Film Representation percentages include ABC Entertainment, ABC News, ABC Studios, and Disney Branded Television, Freeform, FX, Hulu Originals, National Geographic, Disney Channel, Disney Junior, Disney Telepictures, and feature films from Disney Disney Animation, Pixar, Lucasfilm, 20th, Searchlight, and Marvel. Data are limited to content developed by TWDC and excludes Disney+ undersea, global content developed in region, and Star. Data are not available for fiscal 2019.\n\n61 News and Sports Representation percentages include executive, project hire, and full- and part-time employees. Data excludes contingent workers, student programs, daily employees, and seasonal employees. Employees that did not disclose gender information or disclosed they are Non-Binary/Other Gender are included in the Men metric. Employees that did not disclose ethnicity information are included in the White metric. Data are not available for fiscal 2019.\n\n62 Content representation data for Scripted & Film for fiscal 2021 were restated due to a change in calculation methodology. Updated methodology totals talent by show instead of business unit, providing a more accurate measurement of representation.\n\nSupply Chain\n\n63 The supply chain for Disney-branded products experiences routine fluctuations in active facilities. In any given year, a significant number of new facilities may become authorized to produce Disney-branded products, which complicates any year-to-year comparison. In fiscal 2022, the facility count shown includes approximately 2,100 beyond Tier 1 that are subject to the purview of the Disney International Labor Standards (ILS) program.\n\n64 Facility footprint data includes all facilities authorized to manufacture Disney-branded products at any point during the fiscal year. With respect to TFCF intellectual property, as contracts are newly executed, renewed, or amended with respect to the manufacturing of products, the facilities producing such goods fall under the purview of the Disney ILS Program and are included in the facility footprint data. Facility data are rounded to the nearest hundred.\n\n65 For country facility data, total facilities are approximate and rounded.\n\n66 Disney uses the World Bank\u2019s Gender Indicators as the primary resource for identifying and comparing areas of risk and determining where to focus our monitoring resources and requirements. Please refer to our Permitted Sourcing Countries Policy.\n\n67 The Disney ILS Program works toward ongoing and sustainable improvement in working conditions at facilities producing Disney-branded products. All Code of Conduct violations identified in active facilities as the result of audits or assessments must be corrected or remediated within the time periods and in the manner established by the Disney ILS Program as a condition of continued use of the facility for the production of Disney-branded products.\n\nHealthy Living\n\n68 Healthy Living licensing results do not include TFCF businesses prior to fiscal 2022.\nThe Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) developed a voluntary framework for companies to provide climate-related information to stakeholders. In line with TCFD\u2019s recommendations, each year we publicly disclose our climate-related information primarily through our CDP Climate Change survey response. In the following index, we provide a mapping of TCFD\u2019s disclosure recommendations to our CDP responses to make clear where to find comparable information regarding how we approach and manage climate risks and opportunities.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company is committed to taking meaningful and measurable action to support a cleaner, safer, and healthier planet for future generations as we operate and grow our businesses. In addition to our annual response to CDP\u2019s Climate Change survey, in late 2020 and late 2022 we launched ambitious goals to continue making progress in addressing our environmental impacts, and in 2021 the Board delegated oversight of environmental, social, and governance programs and reporting to the Governance and Nominating Committee, including with respect to environmental and sustainability policies and initiatives. For a full description of our goals, read our 2030 Environmental Goals White Paper.\n\n| TOPIC                  | DESCRIPTION OF TCFD DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT | COMPLETE TCFD DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT | RELEVANT 2022 CDP CLIMATE CHANGE SURVEY RESPONSES |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| GOVERNANCE             | Degree of Board oversight                  | (a) Describe the Board\u2019s oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities. | C1.1b                                            |\n|                        | Management\u2019s role                           | (b) Describe management\u2019s role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities. | C1.2, C1.2a                                      |\n| STRATEGY               | Climate-related risks and opportunities     | (a) Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the organization has identified over the short, medium, and long term. | C2.1a, C2.3, C2.3a, C2.4, C2.4a                   |\n|                        | Impacts of risks and opportunities          | (b) Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization\u2019s businesses, strategy, and financial planning. | C2.3a, C2.4a, C3.1, C3.2b, C3.3, C3.4            |\n|                        | Resilience of the organization\u2019s strategy   | (c) Describe the resilience of the organization\u2019s strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2\u00b0C-or-lower scenario. | C3.2, C3.2a, C3.2b                               |\n| RISK MANAGEMENT        | Climate risk identification process         | (a) Describe the organization\u2019s processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks. | C2.1, C2.2, C2.2a                                |\n|                        | Climate risk management process             | (b) Describe the organization\u2019s processes for managing climate-related risks. | C2.1, C2.2                                      |\n|                        | Integration with other risk management processes | (c) Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organization\u2019s overall risk management. | C2.1, C2.2                                      |\n| METRICS & TARGETS      | Identify risk assessment metrics            | (a) Disclose the metrics used by the organization to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process. | C4.2, C4.2a, C4.2b                              |\n|                        | Identify GHG emissions                      | (b) Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and, if appropriate, Scope 3 GHG emissions, and the related risks. | C6.1, C6.3                                      |\n|                        | Identify targets and risk metrics           | (c) Describe the targets used by the organization to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets. | C4.1, C4.1a, C4.2, C4.2a, C4.2b                  |\nThe Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standards, now part of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation, is a set of standards to guide the disclosure of sustainability information by companies to their investors. The following index maps our disclosures to certain SASB indicators. Given our broad array of businesses that span multiple industries around the globe, we have focused this year\u2019s reporting on the recommended indicators for the \u201cMedia & Entertainment\u201d and \u201cInternet Media & Services\u201d industries. Where relevant, we also highlight select information relevant to the \u201cLeisure Facilities,\u201d \u201cHotels & Lodging,\u201d \u201cRestaurants,\u201d \u201cCruise Lines,\u201d \u201cApparel, Accessories, and Footwear,\u201d and \u201cToys & Sporting Goods\u201d industries.

We expect employees to approach their work with rigor, to question thoroughly and skeptically, and to analyze deeply. |\n|                              |                                                                                      | We continue to build on the exceptional legacy of ABC News, upholding high standards in journalism, while also leading in innovation. Our editorial integrity and commitment to accuracy provide the foundation for the outstanding work that we do. |\n| JOURNALISTIC INTEGRITY & SPONSORSHIP IDENTIFICATION (continued on next page) | Description of approach for ensuring journalistic integrity of news programming related to: (1) truthfulness, accuracy, objectivity, fairness, and accountability | (1) Truthfulness, accuracy, objectivity, fairness, and accountability: It is the mission of ABC News to inform the public on matters of interest and importance to them. The credibility we have with our audience is essential to this mission and we, therefore, attach great importance to the maintenance of our fairness and integrity\u2014both real and perceived\u2014as we gather and report the news. Company policies on Business Ethics, Fairness, and Insider Trading apply to all employees in every division, and those policies are particularly important to ABC News employees. We share responsibility for maintaining our reputation for fairness and accuracy. Action that damages that reputation, or even gives the appearance of compromising it, harms both ABC News and the individuals involved. All employees of ABC News are, therefore, required to abide by the letter and spirit of our policies and to be alert to subtle efforts that could have the effect of compromising the integrity of ABC News. | SV-ME-270a.3 |\n### JOURNALISTIC INTEGRITY & SPONSORSHIP IDENTIFICATION (continued)\n\n| Topic | Accounting Metric(s) | Location/Response | SASB Code |\n|-------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------|\n| (2) Independence of content and/or transparency of potential bias, and (3) protection of privacy and limitation of harm | (2) Independence of content and/or transparency of potential bias: ABC News employees are hired to report and record news events, not to participate in them. News employees should remain professionally detached in all situations and not take action that would be seen as favoring one side or the other. We take particular care to act in a neutral and professional manner where the passions of others are engaged or aroused. We must all share an uncompromising commitment to accuracy and fairness in reporting the news. We are committed to seeking out knowledgeable and credible sources of information, as well as reaching out for and carefully evaluating comments from those accused of wrongdoing and others with relevant information and perspectives on the matters that we are covering. When ABC News covers stories about The Walt Disney Company or other affiliated or subsidiary companies, we make clear disclosures about the relationship. (3) Protection of privacy and limitation of harm: News staffers receive extensive guidance and training on privacy concerns and other legal issues through legal and standards training sessions. And as a regular part of our newsgathering process, there are targeted reporting meetings to discuss journalistic and legal issues. Similarly, the mission of ESPN is to provide credible, timely, contextual, and trustworthy information. This mission is supported by detailed editorial guidelines intended to protect ESPN\u2019s journalistic credibility across platforms and with the oversight of the ESPN Editorial Board. ESPN reviews its performance against these standards on an ongoing basis and regularly reviews and provides training on guidelines for personnel. Ultimately, every member of the ESPN editorial teams is responsible for upholding the reputation and integrity of ESPN reporting. | SV-ME-270a.3 |\n\n### NUTRITIONAL CONTENT\n\n| Topic | Accounting Metric(s) | Location/Response | SASB Code |\n|-------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------|\n| Number of advertising impressions made on children, percentage promoting products that meet national dietary guidelines for children | \u2022 Approximately 100% of food and beverage advertising on our media platforms oriented to kids and families meets Disney Nutrition Guideline standards. \u2022 Disney Nutrition Guideline standards are informed by national dietary guidelines and focus on limiting calories, fats, sugars, and salt while promoting consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and low-fat dairy. | FB-RN-260a.3 |\n\n### DATA PRIVACY\n\n| Topic | Accounting Metric(s) | Location/Response | SASB Code |\n|-------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------|\n| Description of policies and practices relating to behavioral advertising and user privacy | \u2022 We are committed to giving consumers transparency into our data collection and use practices and having robust controls over how we use that data.

The following table provides select examples of how our corporate social responsibility programs support most of the SDGs.\n\n### UN SDG 1\n**No Poverty**\n- We have worked with UNICEF for many years, and when the humanitarian crisis began in Ukraine, we leveraged our media platforms to support UNICEF in helping families displaced by the conflict. ABC News coverage and on-air mentions across our networks drove thousands of viewers to UNICEF\u2019s website, raising more than $3 million in a few weeks.\n- In fiscal 2022, in addition to supporting 30 Feeding America member food banks to help increase access to fresh produce for communities that need it most, Disney also supported Feeding America\u2019s efforts in response to Hurricane Ian.

The center provides employees, cast members, and their partners with comprehensive, connected, and compassionate care to help navigate their family-building journeys.\n- We are intentional about how we promote healthy foods and beverages to kids through our Nutrition Guideline Policy. These guidelines apply to our Studio promotions, food and beverage licensing, third-party advertising on our kids\u2019 networks, and kids\u2019 meals in Disney Parks. Ongoing reviews of these global guidelines help us reflect up-to-date dietary guidance and consider the evolving social and scientific understanding of children\u2019s physical and digital lives. In fiscal 2022, we continued to have approximately 100% of food and beverage advertising on our owned and controlled media platforms oriented to kids and families meet our Nutrition Guideline Policy.\n\n### UN SDG 4\n**Quality Education**\n- We made a $1 million contribution to Exceptional Minds in fiscal 2022 to help source, skill, scale, support, and sustain neurodiverse talent over the next three years.
