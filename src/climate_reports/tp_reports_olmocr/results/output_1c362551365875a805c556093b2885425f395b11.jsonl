Throughout 2020, the world recognized the realities of our interdependent economic systems, and we were forced to face the weaknesses in our social structures. The lessons from 2020 underscore a simple truth: These racial and social inequalities are the biggest obstacle to our collective well-being. Every organization must be focused on all our stakeholders. But 2020 also proved that innovative ways of thinking about how we work, learn and interact create new opportunities for business resilience, effectiveness and sustainability.\n\nMicron made significant advancements in 2020, deepening our customer relationships and building on our rich history of innovation to further transform into a company that enables a better future for all. We developed new process technologies for our storage and memory products. For the first time in our history, we now lead the industry on both DRAM and NAND technology. That technology leadership provides the foundation for our next-generation solutions across a host of markets and is the core enabler of our vision to transform how the world uses information to enrich life for all. And importantly, we amended our vision statement to add that \u201cfor all\u201d emphasis as a visible reminder of our commitments to a more equitable future for everyone.\n\nOur Sustainability Strategy\n\nAs we highlighted in our last report, Micron has adopted specific long-term environmental sustainability goals in four areas: emissions, energy, water and waste. We also developed aggressive aspirational goals that guide our long-term thinking. We committed to invest approximately $1 billion over the next five to seven years to support these goals. And because meaningful sustainability encompasses all stakeholders and all opportunities, we also made strong commitments in our sourcing practices, our people programs, our products and our community involvement. We committed this year to drive six diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI) commitments; focusing on equal pay and inclusive benefits, increasing representation and spend with diverse suppliers, engaging with minority-owned financial institutions, strengthening our inclusive culture, increasing diversity, and advocating for equality. Each pillar has specific goals and executive ownership for accountability. We continue to foster a company culture that values a diversity of ideas among our teams. We also pursue programs that engage our team to maximize the positive impact we have on communities where we operate.\n\n2020 Progress\n\nCommunity Support\n\nWe responded quickly to the COVID-19 pandemic, donating hundreds of thousands of masks to health care workers and distributing nearly $34 million to global organizations focused on education and supporting basic needs. We also reached more than 600,000 students and educators through global STEM programs. We dramatically increased giving overall, with nearly 60% of our team, 88% of senior leaders and 100% of our board participating in 2020, generating $4.8M in donations (most of it matched 2:1 by Micron to deepen the impact) and 150,000 volunteer hours.\n\nDEI Goals\n\nIn addition to our focus on the six pillars mentioned above, we made real progress fostering a more inclusive culture and world. We increased our female board representation by 50% when Lynn Dugle joined last year, and we implemented inclusive hiring practices to increase representation of underrepresented groups. To support social justice, Micron directed a $1 million donation from the Micron Foundation to the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. We allocated $250 million for cash management through minority-owned firms, boosting the economies of underrepresented communities. Micron spent over $104 million with diverse-owned businesses and committed to doubling that spend over the next two years. We increased participation in our employee resource groups by 84%, which enhance team member belonging, foster inclusivity and strengthen connections within our communities globally.\n\nEmissions, Energy, Water and Waste\n\n- Emissions \u2013 We reduced greenhouse gas emissions per unit of production by 36% since calendar year 2018 (CY18). Our goal is a 75% reduction of GHG per unit of production from CY18 levels in CY30.\n- Energy \u2013 We initiated negotiations supporting new renewable energy development and procurement to meet our goal of using 100% renewable energy in the U.S. in CY25.\n- Water \u2013 We maintained our water conservation rate at 50%. Our target is 75% water conservation through reuse, recycling and restoration in CY30.\n- Waste \u2013 We expanded reuse, recycling and recovery to 84%. We are working toward 95% reuse, recycling and recovery, and zero hazardous waste to the landfill in CY30.\n\nWe continually strive to tangibly improve the lives of our team members, the communities in which we operate and the planet. With strong investment, innovative ideas and the passionate dedication of our team, I am confident Micron can exceed our goals and lead our industry in innovative practices and ideas that create the best outcomes for the future of our planet and our communities.\n\nThank you for reading our report.

We are committed to enriching life for all through technology innovation while staying true to our core philosophy of conducting business with uncompromising integrity. We are mindful that our business, operations and sourcing practices affect our team members, our communities and our planet, as well as our customers\u2019 sustainability. We continuously seek to challenge and strengthen our sustainability strategy\u2014which focuses on the environmental, social and governance impacts that we have, as well as the effects these issues have on the company\u2014through our leadership products, responsible operations and sourcing, and engaged team members.\n\nOur sustainability strategy is supported by effective governance management and stakeholder engagement. Execution of our strategy centers around initiatives that drive stakeholder value through goals and transparency.\nSustainability Governance\n\nMicron considers sustainability issues to be an integral part of our business practices and corporate strategy. The company\u2019s board of directors encourages a proactive approach to sustainable environmental practices, supporting our team members and the communities in which they live, respecting human rights, driving transparency and accountability in our supply chain and developing innovative products that promote a sustainable future for all.\n\nEnvironmental and social sustainability issues in Micron\u2019s supply chains, operations and products are managed by a cross-functional sustainability council composed of senior leaders throughout the company. The sustainability council is guided by a dedicated sustainability team that works closely with Micron functions to identify priority and emerging long- and short-term impacts of Micron\u2019s operations, supply chains and products, as well as the company\u2019s activities and annual public reporting on these topics. The governance and sustainability committee reviews and discusses ESG issues quarterly at each regularly scheduled committee meeting.\n\nIn 2020, we updated and expanded sustainability performance metrics used to determine the variable compensation of executives and team members throughout the company. Annual targets for our environmental programs and for our diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, which are aligned with our new goals in these areas, are now part of performance reviews.\nOpportunity & Risk\n\nIntegrating sustainability into our business is strategically important, helping Micron to both capitalize on opportunities and better manage risks. Among other things, sustainability is a differentiator when recruiting high-potential employees in a competitive talent market and provides a platform for increasing current team members\u2019 engagement, satisfaction and productivity. Natural resource conservation and waste reduction make us a more disciplined and efficient operation, which can directly enhance our bottom line. Plus, conducting our business with integrity and in a socially responsible manner in the communities where we live and work is consistent with our corporate and sustainability goals.\n\nWhile working to realize these opportunities, we also focus on identifying, assessing, quantifying and managing sustainability risks. Climate change, extreme weather events, global pandemics, natural disasters and carbon pricing pose risks to our supply chains, operations and markets. We work to better understand and address these risks through collaboration among our sustainability, environmental health and safety, and responsible sourcing programs, along with our various risk management organizations.\n\nCurrent efforts include improving operational energy and water efficiency; working toward our new long-term goals and targets for energy, emissions, water and waste; and monitoring regulatory, customer, investor and other stakeholder expectations. Additional comprehensive Micron disclosures about sustainability-related opportunities and risks are available through our annual CDP climate and water questionnaires as well as other sources noted in the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) index.\n\nMicron\u2019s goal is to integrate risk management practices companywide to improve decision-making in governance, strategy, objective-setting and daily operations. We do this by providing tools and knowledge, facilitating open global communication and monitoring continuously. Micron has a network of risk management functions operating across the company, including environmental, health and safety (EHS), information technology (IT), business continuity, global quality management, and enterprise risk management (ERM).\n\nOur ERM organization accumulates key risk information from the executive risk committee, which consists of select company executives, along with risk assessments performed by other risk management organizations. These results are regularly presented to the executive risk committee, the audit committee of the board of directors, and Micron\u2019s full board of directors for consideration.\nMateriality Assessment\n\nInforming our sustainability strategy, the work of our sustainability council and the topics covered in this sustainability report are insights from a materiality assessment. Micron conducts a full materiality assessment on a three-year cycle and evaluates priorities annually to ensure that the issues of greatest impact and importance to our stakeholders and our business are reflected in company sustainability initiatives, goals and reporting. Our most recent assessment was conducted in 2018, with a comprehensive update underway for 2021.\n\nAssessments begin with an extensive list of ESG issues that cover all aspects of our business. These issues then undergo an extensive data collection and review process that includes internal and external stakeholder and expert interviews, internal company documents, industry information and third-party assessments. This information is used to calculate results and map issues to visualize their relative importance to our stakeholders, our sustainability impact and our business success. We use this map to identify those areas where we have the greatest potential to drive meaningful change and enhance transparency.\n\nMicron\u2019s most recent materiality assessment identified the following priorities:\n\n**Communities**\n1. Philanthropy\n2. Community Relations\n\n**Customers and Products**\n3. Social Influence of Technology\n4. Product Use & Integrity\n5. Data Protection & Privacy\n\n**Environmental Operations**\n6. Waste\n7. Water\n8. Energy\n9. Operations & Facility Management\n10. Climate Change & GHGs\n\n**People and Community**\n11. Human Rights\n12. Workplace Health & Safety\n13. Diversity, Equality & Inclusion\n14. Employee Development & Engagement\n\n**Supply Chain**\n15. Responsible Sourcing\n\n**Governance and Management**\n16. Government Relations\n17. Corporate Governance\n18. Transparency, Accountability & Reporting\n19. Ethical Conduct\n\n**Most Material Issues**\n- Employee Development & Engagement\n- Responsible Sourcing\n- Climate Change & Greenhouse Gases\n- Data Protection & Privacy\n\n**Additional Significant Issues**\n- Workplace Health & Safety\n- Product Use & Integrity\n- Ethical Conduct\n- Operations & Facility Management\n- Diversity, Equality & Inclusion\n- Energy\n- Water\nToday\u2019s laws and standards of business conduct are complex, and Integrity Matters: The Micron Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is a practical resource that sets out the core policies, rules and principles that Micron applies to our business regarding risk, legal and ethical issues. Above all else, the code emphasizes that integrity comes before business results. It also explains Micron team members\u2019 personal responsibility to speak up if they see something that does not seem right.\n\nThe Micron code of conduct, which is available to the public, supports team members, organizations, contractors and suppliers in conducting business with integrity \u2014 with one another, investors, communities and the marketplace. The code was updated in 2020 to add supplemental guidance on conflicts of interest \u2014 particularly with respect to relationships in the workplace and service on for-profit company boards \u2014 and on Micron\u2019s commitment to DEI.\n\nTeam members receive online training and certify annually that they have read, understand and will comply with Micron\u2019s code of conduct. We also provide frequent, targeted live group and one-on-one trainings on ethics and compliance at Micron \u2014 with one another, investors, communities and the marketplace. The code of conduct and all other global policies, including translations in seven languages, are available to team members worldwide on our policy management site. Links to the code are also located on the Micron intranet homepage and internal compliance and ethics (C&E) site.\n\nMicron\u2019s senior vice president of legal affairs and general counsel serves as our chief compliance officer and is responsible for ongoing oversight of compliance with our code of conduct. Besides the code, we have adopted global public and internal policies addressing responsible minerals; environment, health and safety; human rights; slavery and human trafficking; supplier responsibility; anti-bribery and anti-corruption; and others. According to our global policy framework, global policies are reviewed and vetted by a policy council composed of director- and vice president-level executives, initially approved by a policy committee composed of senior and executive vice presidents, and finally approved by our CEO.\n\nIn addition, Micron is a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), a group of leading companies focused on promoting responsible working conditions, ethical business practices and environmental stewardship throughout our global supply chain. Our adherence to both the Micron and RBA codes of conduct demonstrates our commitment to integrity and responsible practices.\n\nWe educate and encourage all team members, vendors and third parties to speak up to their managers, Micron\u2019s legal department or our compliance hotline if they suspect violations of our code, policies or commitment to act with integrity. This hotline is operated by a third party, available 24/7 and accessible through all commonly used languages at Micron, and it supports anonymous reporting (when and where permitted by applicable law). To facilitate team member reporting, the C&E intranet site contains links to forms about conflicts of interest or government gift approval. We also maintain a dedicated C&E email address for team members and external parties to request information, ask questions or report concerns.\n\nUnwavering integrity is a foundational principle that underlies our corporate values and how we conduct business at Micron. Our code provides guidelines on how to act with integrity, make ethical choices and do the right thing. We foster a \u2018speak up\u2019 culture, where everyone feels comfortable asking questions and reporting concerns.\u201d\n\nJoel Poppen\nSenior Vice President of Legal Affairs, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary\nMicron\u2019s vision and commitment to integrity guide our actions related to taxation. Meeting our tax obligations, directly and through our affiliated entities, in every country where we operate is one of the ways we address our responsibilities to society.\n\n**Tax Governance & Risk Management**\n\nMicron supports tax policies, at the U.S. and international levels, that recognize our industry and its place in the global marketplace and that promote growth in a predictable and transparent manner. We are committed to complying fully with all relevant tax laws and regulations, filing all required tax returns and disclosing all relevant facts and circumstances. We employ an appropriately qualified and experienced tax team that is an integral part of the broader finance function reporting to our chief financial officer. Our tax team proactively manages, reviews and reports on the various direct and indirect local country taxes and monitors tax risks. These include implications from new tax legislation and policies, as well as from changes in our business. Given the nature of our business, risks inevitably arise from tax laws that are complex and uncertain at times. Where the application of tax law to a transaction or commercial situation is unclear, we routinely seek professional advice to ensure the integrity of our tax filing and compliance duties worldwide. In addition, our board\u2019s audit committee receives periodic updates on significant changes in tax legislation that may affect our business, as well as details of any global tax audits or disputes.\n\n**Group Dealings With Tax Authorities**\n\nMicron is committed to fostering positive, transparent and respectful relations with the tax authorities in the jurisdictions where we operate. We work collaboratively and positively with tax authorities to address inquiries, and we resolve any differences through timely and transparent discussions or, if necessary, through established channels for dispute resolution.\nStakeholder Engagement\n\nBecause stakeholders, both inside and outside the company, drive our business success, we take measures to understand our local influence and the effect of our operations, supply chains and products on people, the environment and society. To do this, we partner with a range of organizations to properly inform the decisions we make. Throughout our global operations, we engage with key stakeholders based on their material relationship to our operational success and on our potential to affect them through our operations. This outreach occurs at the local, subsidiary and corporate levels.\n\nCustomers\nOur customers are increasingly focused on the ESG performance of their suppliers, including Micron. Many customers use sustainability as one of their criteria for evaluating Micron\u2019s overall performance as part of the management of their own supply chain and reputation risks. In their assessments, they look at transparency, risk management, environmental and social performance, responsible sourcing and related topics. Customers include this information in their supplier performance evaluations and purchasing decisions, alongside quality, delivery, technology and service. That\u2019s why our sales team executives, account managers and sustainability leaders work closely with our customers \u2014 to share information about our sustainability efforts and performance, drive action and build trust.\n\nInvestors\nMicron regularly discusses our corporate ESG performance with the investment community, and in turn, our ESG disclosures evolve based on investor feedback. We have engaged with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) to support these efforts, joining the SASB Standards Advisory Group and issuing a sustainability reporting index aligned with the SASB semiconductor industry standard.\n\nGovernments & Policymakers\nEngagement in the political process is vital to Micron\u2019s success. Public policy decisions can directly affect Micron\u2019s strategies, investments, operations, team members and communities. Micron promotes policies that enhance our ability to innovate and advocates at all levels of government to ensure that our policies most important to Micron\u2019s business interests and values. We also participate in the political process through lobbying, public engagement, policy contributions and membership in various industry and trade associations. Micron complies with all applicable laws and regulations that oversee interactions with government officials and adheres to our own high standards of ethical conduct.\n\nTeam Members, Communities & Suppliers\nTeam members, the communities where we live and work, and our suppliers are vital to our operations. These stakeholder groups are covered in detail in the People, Communities, and Responsible Sourcing sections.\n\nMicron\u2019s engagements and partnerships are accelerating and evolving along with our sustainability programs. Collaboration is one of our values, and we need to expand our work with others as we address some of the world\u2019s most significant challenges.\u201d\n\nMarshall Chase\nDirector of Sustainability at Micron\n| Who We Engage | How We Engage | What the Engagement Creates |\n|--------------|--------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Team Members** | - Ongoing supervisor interactions  \n- Meetings hosted by senior leaders  \n- Employee engagement surveys  \n- Compliance hotline for reporting concerns | - Intranet with global and local content  \n- Employee resource groups  \n- Global town halls | A culture in which all team members contribute to our success |\n| **Customers** | - Regular meetings between customers and sales team executives, account managers and sustainability leaders  \n- Customer requirement documents  \n- Membership in industry organizations | - Customer scorecards and performance evaluations related to Responsible Business Alliance code compliance, transparency, risk management, environmental and social performance, responsible sourcing and other topics | Understanding of how we are performing from our customers\u2019 perspectives, industry consensus on social and environmental issues, and customer trust |\n| **Shareholders** | - Investor relations webpage  \n- Annual shareholder meeting  \n- Quarterly financial calls  \n- Periodic investor presentations  \n- Investor conferences and meetings | - Annual report and sustainability report  \n- Issuance of a SASB index and participation in the SASB Standards Advisory Group  \n- Regulatory filings  \n- Press releases  \n- Emails | Transparency and fulfillment of the needs of our shareholders and the investor and analyst communities as they increasingly focus on corporate ESG performance |\n| **Suppliers** | - Compliance hotline for reporting concerns  \n- Supplier performance reviews  \n- Labor practice audits and code of conduct compliance  \n- Supplier portal containing expectations and requirements in conduct and responsible sourcing | - Responsible Business Alliance membership and committees  \n- Training  \n- Risk profiling and event monitoring of mapped suppliers  \n- Supplier summits | Open dialogue about our expectations with respect to social and environmental criteria |\n| **Communities** | - Grants, programs and volunteers focused on promoting human potential through STEM education, basic human needs and equitable opportunity  \n- Local, regional and national STEM education conversations | - STEM outreach through virtual programming and in-person programs when possible  \n- Team member volunteerism and matching gifts globally | Stronger communities, relationships, equitable opportunities and shared value between Micron and organizations around the world, with primary emphasis on the communities where our team members live and work |\n| **Policymakers** | - Direct and indirect lobbying  \n- Political contributions  \n- Involvement in industry and trade associations:  \n  - American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing  \n  - American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai  \n  - American Chamber of Commerce in Singapore  \n  - American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei  \n  - Associated Taxpayers of Idaho  \n  - Boise Metro Chamber of Commerce  \n  - The Business Council  \n  - The Business Roundtable  \n  - European Automotive Technology Council  \n  - European Research Platform  \n  - Idaho Association of Commerce & Industry | - Italy Industry Trade Association  \n- Northern Virginia Technology Council  \n- SEMI  \n- Singapore Semiconductor Industry Association  \n- Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA)  \n- Silicon Valley Leadership Group  \n- Taiwan Association of Trade Secrets Protection  \n- Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Association  \n- U.S. Chamber of Commerce  \n- U.S.-China Business Council  \n- U.S.-India Strategic Partnership  \n- U.S. Information Technology Office  \n- U.S.-Taiwan Business Council  \n- Utah Taxpayers Association | Engagement with policymaking that governs and affects our strategies, investments, operations, team members and communities |\nProducts & Innovation\nMicron\u2019s memory and storage solutions are at the core of countless digital devices. We\u2019re constantly innovating to make those solutions faster and more efficient.\n\nMicron\u2019s vision is to transform how the world uses information to enrich life for all. We are proud to provide solutions that drive performance and access to information technology and to help our customers achieve their goals for benefiting society and the environment.\n\nAll modern computing hardware depends on shared underlying technology \u2014 semiconductor memory and storage \u2014 to access and store data. Advancements in memory and storage solutions set the pace for technology development and, therefore, breakthroughs that improve our way of life. A new generation of technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), precision medicine, the internet of things (IoT), autonomous vehicles and cloud computing, could further expand what\u2019s possible for society and our planet. As innovations like these enter the mainstream and demands for memory and storage increase, the need to analyze, access and act on data grows.\n\nBy enabling rapid advancements in memory and storage, Micron is helping unlock the innovations that will make a better future possible. Micron delivers a rich portfolio of high-performance DRAM, NAND, NOR, high-bandwidth memory and multichip package solutions, and we work closely with customers to create specialized memory and storage architectures. As a leader in the semiconductor industry for more than 40 years, we have taken part in every stage of these vital technologies\u2019 evolution.\n\nMemory and storage affect the sustainability of a variety of end products, from computer energy use to vehicle safety and even the efficiency of our own manufacturing facilities. This influence is why we strive to consistently improve performance, investing in research to deliver higher capacity, greater security, faster data transfer rates, lower power consumption, increased energy and material efficiency, and improved reliability. Through supplier engagement, technology development and legal compliance, we evaluate new materials to ensure the safety of our team members and our products.\nInnovative Product Applications\n\nThrough Micron\u2019s deep learning accelerator (DLA) program, we are partnering with customers on AI applications that will create the technological capabilities of the future.\n\nA significant part of the DLA effort involves eliminating wasteful and unnecessary data movement between processor and memory. This streamlining ensures that advanced computations are not only faster but also more energy-efficient. Our collaborations with others are enabling autonomous vehicles to operate more intelligently, sparking discovery in science and medicine and helping communities address basic human needs. Here are a few ways that the DLA is working with partners to accelerate sustainability and social good.\n\nEngaging With Customers for Vehicle Safety\n\nAutonomous vehicles (AVs) will revolutionize road safety, dramatically reducing the thousands of crashes caused by human error each year. They will also be the ultimate \u201cintelligent edge\u201d devices, collecting enormous amounts of data that must be converted into decisions in real time. Micron\u2019s technology is key to making AVs viable stand-alone devices, where all processing is done within the vehicle. Together with Continental AG, we are using neural network models to predict pedestrian behavior. The neural network also monitors a vehicle\u2019s driver and other occupants to track alertness and attention so that AVs can operate more safely.\n\nAccelerating Precision Oncology\n\nPrecision oncology, an emerging approach in cancer care, involves tailoring treatments for individual patients and tumor types. The process requires measuring, visualizing and integrating various levels of clinical information, from symptom expression all the way down to tumor-level DNA. This generates many terabytes of data that are highly complex and time-consuming to process.\n\nOur DLA, in conjunction with the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), is a mix of AI hardware, software and advanced memory that allows researchers to process entire high-resolution tumor images in a time frame that is clinically relevant. The team\u2019s three priorities are optimizing neural network performance, speeding up data analysis and using Micron\u2019s advanced memory solutions to improve image analysis and processing. In 2020, the team focused on applying insights extracted from tumor images. Next, the team will look at additional imaging modalities and automated analytics.\n\nAdvancing Basic Human Needs\n\nSince 2019, Micron has teamed up with Water.org in a unique partnership that combines our philanthropic efforts with our technological expertise. Water.org partners with microfinance institutions to provide small loans to help people put water and sanitation solutions like taps and toilets in their homes. Once people no longer have to spend long hours fetching water, they can seek employment outside the home, pursue education and keep their families safe and healthy. Repaid loans are then lent to the next family in need.\n\nTo help incentivize microfinance institutions to increase water and sanitation lending, Micron developed a neural network architecture to identify the characteristics of a successful portfolio. This solution is expected to be tested and deployed in 2021, allowing Water.org to combine human intuition with intelligent software for better decision-making. In addition to the technology solution, the partnership has reached 10,000 people with life-changing access to safe water and sanitation.\n\nAddressing AI Challenges Head-On\n\nAI solutions like those developed by Micron\u2019s DLAs can do good. But in the wrong hands, they can also be used in illegal, unethical or discriminatory ways. Micron is committed to participating in continuing conversations about ethics in AI. Micron has taken part in both governmental and private roundtables including the AI for Good Global Summit, the United Nations\u2019 platform for this topic.\nProduct Efficiency\n\nMicron\u2019s industry-leading products mitigate the growing energy demands of IT while enabling technologies that increase the efficiency of infrastructure and industrial processes.\n\nMore than half a century ago, Gordon Moore predicted that the number of transistors possible on a silicon chip would double every year. While Moore\u2019s law has been modified, questioned and declared dead multiple times over the years, Micron continues to drive rapid improvements in the power requirements, performance and area of each successive generation of chips.\n\nThese advancements help Micron meet the power requirements of AI, the IoT, our cloud computing customers and the world at large. Efficiency is both an important performance requirement \u2014 to improve battery life and reduce heat output, for example \u2014 and a means of addressing the environmental impacts of IT use. Data centers alone use about 1% of global electricity, much of which comes from fossil fuel sources contributing to climate change. With IT use projected to grow significantly in the coming years, product efficiency will play an important role in Micron\u2019s efforts to address the influence of technology on the environment.\n\nFor example, we are working to make each generation of our memory solutions for data center servers do more with less energy per bit. Transitioning from DDR4 to DDR5 products, which will take place over the next few years, is expected to reduce DRAM power consumption by approximately 14%, lowering costs for data center customers. Similarly, as the need for greater computing and data-processing capabilities on handheld devices grows, these devices cannot trade energy efficiency for performance. In early 2021, Micron introduced 1\u03b1 (1alpha) node LPDRAM products, which are up to 15% more power-efficient than previous generations, allowing 5G mobile users to perform more tasks on their smartphones without sacrificing battery life.\n\nWe collaborate with customers to deliver memory and storage solutions that meet increased expectations for energy efficiency. Micron\u2019s system power calculators are online tools that allow customers to estimate memory power use when they make system architecture and design decisions.\n\nMicron\u2019s products also enable automation and efficiency across sectors, from industrial applications to transportation. Micron\u2019s industrial memory solutions, including embedded AI accelerators and local storage, make it possible for industrial IoT (IIoT) edge infrastructure to collect, process and share data that increases energy efficiency and reduces waste.\n\nWe have seen these results in our own operations, where we collect petabytes of data to drive real-time performance monitoring, significantly improving labor productivity and production efficiency.\n\nIn addition, AVs need our DRAM products to provide data quickly for real-time processing, allowing these vehicles to be safer and more efficient. At the same time, our products support the networks facilitating the smooth flow of the entire vehicle transportation system. Our solid-state drives provide the storage for map data, image data, sensor readings, program code, and data being generated at a rate of 5 gigabytes each second.\n\nWe collaborate with customers to deliver memory and storage solutions that meet increased expectations for energy efficiency.

With an advanced neural network, our AI team is able to prevent manufacturing challenges that might cause productivity, materials and energy losses.\u201d\n\nEugenio Culurciello\nFellow and Machine Intelligence Technology Group Leader, Compute and Networking Business Unit\u2019s Advanced Computing Solutions\nData Protection & User Privacy\n\nWe work closely with our customers to understand their needs related to cybersecurity, data protection and product safety, while also looking at industry trends and potential vulnerabilities.\n\nSpecific areas of growing risk and vulnerability are the internet of things and industrial internet of things. What began as a means of machine-to-machine communication has evolved into a complex system of millions of connected devices worldwide, each of which represents a possible attack point within a network.\n\nAs a result of IoT growth, Micron\u2019s innovation today focuses not only on storage solutions for vast amounts of new data but also on security for these IoT devices. The threat of enterprise cyberattacks is far-reaching, given the potential vulnerability and proliferation of embedded systems\u2014which are found in everything from automated equipment in factories to automobiles and to smart home devices.\n\nAs everyday smart devices become targeted network entry points for cybercriminals, Micron\u2019s Authenta\u2122 technology provides an extra layer of defense without adding new components to an IoT platform. In addition, Authenta memory components include cryptographic verification, addressing growing concerns about counterfeiting or tampering with electronics components. Almost all IoT devices contain flash memory chips, and Authenta works by protecting the software and data that run from those chips. Imagine a typical house: If attackers can unlock the front door, they gain access to everything inside. Authenta acts like additional keys that lock not only the front door but every room within, providing an extra level of protection.\n\nThis unique security solution increases Micron\u2019s value as a memory provider for IoT and connected devices across the automotive, industrial and consumer markets. Micron\u2019s companion Authenta Key Management Service is a security-as-a-service platform that enables cloud activation and identity verification of installed Authenta flash devices and their platform software content at the edge. This capability offers platform-level hardening and additional device protection for our customer solutions.\n\nTechnologies like Authenta build on Micron\u2019s market and industry leadership. We are an active member of the Trusted Computing Group, an industry standards body that develops and maintains the open standards and specifications for self-encrypting drives (SEDs) and other trusted devices. A decade ago, we launched one of the industry\u2019s first solid-state SEDs intended for mobile computing and have since developed drives that meet the rigorous Federal Information Processing Standards. With safeguards like these, we help ensure that the theft of a person\u2019s device does not necessarily mean theft of that person\u2019s data.\n\nAutomotive Safety\n\nThe assurance provided by memory and storage products can\u2019t stop with IT and operational technology security. Some technology applications require remarkably stable, reliable hardware to protect users. This need is particularly true in the automotive sector, where driver and pedestrian safety is critical and where memory and storage solutions are vital to enabling safe and efficient connected, autonomous and electric vehicles. Micron has become the industry leader in automotive memory and storage by helping leading brands and tier 1 suppliers in their functional safety efforts. In addition to our work with Continental AG on the DLA applications noted above, Micron has made other investments:\n\n- Creating dedicated and experienced teams, such as a functional safety office staffed with industry safety veterans and safety experts, including system architects and applications engineers for collaboration support.\n- Adopting processes and methodologies across Micron on the journey to comply with the ISO 26262 standard for the functional safety of road vehicles. These activities include supplier-performed hardware evaluation reports and the industry\u2019s first independent assessment that Micron\u2019s automotive LPDDR5 is suitable for safety systems up to ASIL-D, the highest level applied to safety assurance.\n- Conducting extensive functional safety analysis and providing collateral to simplify customer analysis.\nProduct & Trade Compliance\n\nWe focus on addressing risks that products may pose to customers, the environment or society.\n\nControlling Restricted Substances\nMicron uses a range of potentially hazardous chemicals and materials to transform wafers into individual die and ensure product performance during use. These materials are carefully regulated in many parts of the world.\n\nIn addition to ensuring the safety of our people and processes, our environmental, health and safety (EHS), product compliance and global procurement functions work together to ensure that Micron products and processes meet legal and customer product-compliance requirements. These include the European Union directive on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances (RoHS), the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and other lists of banned or restricted substances.\n\nWe also closely track substances that might be restricted in the future. In the past decade, there has been a regulatory shift from managing select hazardous chemicals to managing classes of chemicals and their associated hazards. As a result, Micron has teams of chemical engineers in the U.S. and Asia dedicated to studying the structural hazards. As a responsible citizen in the global marketplace, Micron is committed to adhering to all laws and regulations that relate to export controls and trade compliance. Micron requires its team members and representatives to conduct business with the highest possible vigilance. We also mandate compliance with export controls, import controls and customs, economic sanctions and embargoes, and anti-boycott laws and regulations.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, Micron\u2019s trade compliance program includes the following:\n\n- Policies and protocols to ensure team members and management are informed and trained on the latest applicable trade compliance regulations\n- Risk assessments and oversight to consistently evaluate and strengthen our compliance posture\n- Internal systems and processes to effectively manage international operations, personnel and third-party relationships\n- Protocols for adequate compliance recordkeeping and reporting\n- Internal reporting channels and corrective action plans for suspected violations\n\nAdhering to trade compliance laws and regulations is vital for protecting the safety and security of the countries in which Micron operates and for keeping our products, technology and software out of the hands of people and organizations that seek to do harm.\n\nAs a global company, Micron\u2019s commitment to trade compliance initiatives ensures seamless support for our major objectives, achievement of our key business strategies and delivery of excellence for our customers. In 2020, our compliance team responded quickly to fully comply with evolving export control laws resulting from rapid and dynamic changes in U.S.-China trade policy.\nEnvironment\nInnovation, collaboration and tenacity are necessary as we drive improvements in our energy, emissions, water and waste performance throughout our operations.\n\nTransformative technology innovations \u2014 breakthroughs in autonomous driving, big data processing, artificial intelligence and more \u2014 are possible only through significant improvements in memory and storage solutions. Increasing the capacity and performance of these components can unlock new possibilities for people and the planet.\n\nBut these product improvements also require new manufacturing equipment, materials and processing technologies, which can intensify our operational footprint. We are continually working to align our production with objectives for both product and environmental performance while also managing sometimes significant trade-offs.\n\nThis balance begins in the early stages of planning and process development, when we strive to identify opportunities to reduce the effect of our operations on the environment and in the communities where we\u2019re located. This analysis requires a blend of global strategy and local adaptation, which we do through these activities:\n\n- Assessing opportunities to align processes with our strategic objectives in early-stage technology development\n- Engaging our robust network of site-based environmental, health and safety (EHS) professionals throughout our global operations\n- Exploring and implementing opportunities to build manufacturing, infrastructure and office space that conserves resources and ensures worker safety\n- Implementing and maintaining certified ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 45001:2018 EHS management systems at all manufacturing locations\n- Enhancing critical practices in our manufacturing to align with industry trends, often exceeding local legal requirements\n- Assessing and reviewing our performance through corporate and third-party audits\n- Adopting strategic corporate environmental sustainability and safety targets, which are implemented throughout our global manufacturing network\n\nWe continue to strengthen our upfront integration of EHS considerations into our process design, facility design and construction. This integration includes evaluating environmental sustainability improvements, such as energy, water and waste efficiency; Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED) criteria; and other opportunities to improve our performance over time.\n\nOur products improve the world by giving billions of people the power to access and store information. We believe these products should be made sustainably. That\u2019s why we set aggressive goals for emissions reduction, renewable energy, water use and waste reduction to achieve over the next 10 years.\u201d\n\nBuddy Nicoson\nSenior Vice President of Global Front-End Operations\nOur Manufacturing Process\n\nAs one of the world\u2019s largest semiconductor companies, Micron understands that our manufacturing operations affect the environment, so we take a proactive approach to environmental stewardship.\n\nWe build memory chips (or die) at our front-end facilities, known as fabs, in Singapore, Taiwan, Japan and the United States. Using state-of-the-art processes, we add and subtract specialized materials to silicon wafers to create our memory and storage solutions. This process takes place at the nanoscale in a cleanroom environment. Each wafer goes through numerous manufacturing steps, where chemicals and materials are precisely applied to develop the functionality of each chip. Airborne particles, temperature and humidity are tightly controlled to ensure quality as the wafer passes hundreds of times through up to 10 process areas, each with a unique set of tools.\n\nFrom the moment a new wafer enters the fab until all steps are finished, the process can take months. Once complete, a wafer is divided into its constituent die, which are then assembled at our assembly and test facilities into numerous customized formats that enable many technologies. These processes require energy to run specialized equipment and maintain the cleanroom environment, use water to ensure the cleanliness and quality of the wafer, and involve potentially hazardous chemicals.\n\nOur application of Moore\u2019s law has driven higher bit density with each successive product generation while requiring fewer resources and producing fewer emissions per unit of production. No other industry is as efficient as semiconductor manufacturing in this regard. For instance, energy consumed per bit produced is improved by as much as 25% per year, and the cumulative effect over the decades has been enormous. That said, innovation opportunities abound to enhance environmental sustainability in semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nTo take advantage of these opportunities to innovate, we are investing approximately US$1 billion over the next five to seven years to adopt and co-develop leading-edge technologies that further drive down our consumption of resources and generation of byproducts. We are committed to identifying and enabling these opportunities in partnership with governments, academia, utility providers and members of the broad manufacturing value chain. Micron is working with our process and equipment solution providers to drive energy, material use and reaction efficiency and to develop additional abatement techniques for unreacted gases and chemicals. We are also working with equipment manufacturers to promote advanced technologies that can reduce total water use and enable us to reuse and recycle more water. In addition, we are finding ways to repurpose our waste to contribute to a circular economy.\n\nWe will continue to dedicate significant resources in each of these areas, demonstrating our commitment to enhancing energy efficiency, reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and improving waste and water recycling infrastructure at our global facilities.\n\nOur task is to innovate boldly, not only to improve our products but also to accelerate sustainability.\nGoals & Aspirations\n\nThe semiconductor industry faces great challenges to reducing its operational footprint. But these are challenges that Micron engineers and innovators are uniquely positioned to solve.\n\nUnderstanding how our operations affect the environment and wanting to be responsible stewards, we aspire to align our emissions with the target established by the Paris Agreement to limit planetary warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius and with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 13 on Climate Action.\n\nTo be accountable for our performance, Micron has set ambitious sustainability goals for the short and long terms. These aspirations will dramatically improve the environmental impact of our global operations while staying true to our vision of enriching the world for all through technology innovation. As a first step, we have set time-bound emissions, energy, water and waste targets for calendar years (CY) 2025 and 2030. And, as we mentioned above, Micron plans to spend approximately $1 billion over the next five to seven years on our environmental programs to support these goals.\n\nA variety of innovative approaches will help us meet these goals. For example, we are using artificial intelligence, machine learning and the internet of things (IoT) to increase efficiency in our fabs. We are designing for sustainability, following LEED criteria in the construction of new facilities. Over the next five years, operational sustainability will be integrated into every technology development process, and goals and solutions will be developed to drive us to benchmark performance.\n\nA global, cross-functional team was convened to develop our sustainability aspirations and has allowed us to share insights across geographies so that we can make progress in several areas at once. In addition, we have formed specialized teams focused on heat transfer fluids, fluorinated gases, energy efficiency and renewables, water and waste, and other areas to support our goals.\n\n| Pillar | Goal | Aspiration | Actions | CY20 Performance |\n|--------|------|------------|---------|-----------------|\n| Emissions | 75% reduction in GHG emissions per unit of production in CY30 from CY18 baseline | 40% reduction in absolute GHGs from CY18 | Reducing direct emissions through efficient abatement of process GHGs and a transition to low global-warming-potential heat transfer fluid | 36% reduction in GHG emissions per unit of production vs. CY18 |\n| Energy | 100% renewable energy in the United States in CY25 | 100% renewable energy globally where available | Finalizing contracts for new U.S. renewable energy development and engaging with governments to increase the availability of renewable energy to support our global manufacturing | Initiated negotiations for new renewable energy development and procurement in the U.S. |\n| Water | 75% water conservation through reuse, recycling and restoration in CY30 | 100% water conservation through reuse, recycling and restoration | Targeting conservation through enhancing our water reuse and recycle infrastructure, as well as engaging in water restoration projects | 50% water conservation through reuse, recycling and restoration |\n| Waste | 95% reuse, recycling and recovery, and zero hazardous waste to landfill in CY30* | Zero waste to landfill through reduction, reuse, recycling and recovery | Focusing on reuse, recycling and recovery through enhanced waste recovery systems, improved waste stream segregation, and engagement of alternate waste disposal vendors | 84% reuse, recycle and recovery (including energy recovery) |\n\nNote: Micron\u2019s environmental performance is measured by calendar year. Environmental goals are targeted for the end of the referenced calendar year.\n\n*Subject to vendor availability\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions & Energy\n\nWhile Micron\u2019s low-power devices support sustainability and climate change initiatives in customer operations and products, our manufacturing process remains an energy- and emissions-intensive one.\n\nMicron is tackling the challenge of energy and emissions reduction head-on, with aspirations established early in 2020 to reduce our absolute GHG emissions by 40% and achieve 100% renewable energy where available worldwide. We are updating these aspirations with two new time-bound corporate targets:\n\n- Reduce GHG emissions 75% per unit of production in 2030 (compared to a 2018 baseline)\n- Achieve 100% renewable energy in the U.S. by the end of 2025\n\nWe also maintain our multiyear goal to achieve at least 10% energy savings (measured in kilowatt-hours saved compared to 2016 baseline energy use) by 2022. To achieve these goals, we are focusing first on areas where our potential is greatest, including our energy use and process gas emissions.\n\nOur approach to GHG management begins with collecting, analyzing and reporting data specific to these emissions. We report on GHG emissions through CDP, the primary international organization standardizing environmental data reporting on GHG emissions and other environmental criteria for companies, cities, states and regions. In 2020, we received a score of B on CDP\u2019s climate list and a B on its water security list, both improvements from prior years\u2019 scores.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is also working to reduce emissions of fluorinated GHGs (F-GHGs), a potent source of emissions that result from manufacturing processes. Despite years of research into alternatives for F-GHGs, few suitable substitutes exist for broad use. Micron is continuously evaluating possibilities that are more efficient or have lower potential for global warming. When no other options are available, we also reduce F-GHGs through point-of-use abatement at the tool level, where more than 90% of gases are destroyed.\n\nIn terms of energy savings, we have saved a cumulative 7% compared to our 2016 baseline through projects implemented in 2020. We are also taking the first steps toward our renewable energy goal. In 2020, we began negotiations to develop and procure new renewable energy in the United States. In addition, we are installing solar panels at facilities in Malaysia and Singapore and will explore further opportunities for on-site solar as local regulations allow.\n\nMicron is a member of the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance (REBA), a membership association for large-scale energy buyers, developers, service providers and nongovernmental organizations. In early 2021, we joined our REBA partners in releasing a policy statement calling on the U.S. government to enact national policy solutions that will accelerate the transition to a zero-carbon power system by decarbonizing the grid and increasing federal funding for clean energy technology research, development and demonstration.\n\nAchieving our GHG and energy goals requires incorporating sustainability into our buildings from the ground up. We consider sustainable building attributes \u2014 such as LEED criteria, the world\u2019s top rating system for green buildings \u2014 as part of new building design. Many of our newest buildings have achieved LEED Gold status, and we design and build all new construction to meet or exceed that standard. To improve the energy and emissions associated with existing buildings, we are creating roadmaps to reductions over the coming years. Because both new fab construction projects and upgrades take years to design and implement, our plans take a long-term view.\n\nIn the near term, we are implementing AI tools, smart control systems and predictive maintenance to improve production efficiency and automation. We have integrated 470,000 facility sensors into IoT platforms and control centers. And we use a real-time performance monitoring platform with video analytics, high-speed cameras, graphic units and deep learning to conduct automated root-cause and corrective-action analyses. This platform, which enables us to quickly resolve equipment downtime and process deviations, has led to an 18% improvement in labor productivity, 50% reduction in product downgrade, 22% improvement in time to new product ramp and significant savings in energy consumption.\n\nMicron deploys best environmental management practices and efficiency improvements that significantly reduce GHG emissions per unit of production. Production increases result in GHG emissions growth.\n\nNote: Micron\u2019s environmental performance is measured by calendar year. Environmental goals are targeted for the end of the referenced calendar year.\nWater\n\nWater is an essential resource in the manufacture of semiconductors.\n\nEach wafer used to make our products goes through a series of cleaning steps, which depend on ultrapure water to ensure manufacturing process quality. As semiconductor technologies have become more complex, demand for water has grown. Therefore, reducing the amount of water we use and properly treating the water we do use are among Micron\u2019s top environmental priorities.\n\nMicron proactively manages water consumption by identifying opportunities to increase water efficiency and reduce raw water demand, supporting the U.N. Sustainable Development Goal 6, which focuses on clean water and sanitation. Our manufacturing sites generate ultrapure water from a combination of recycled water from our operations and local, untreated water resources. Wastewater from our operations that is not recycled or otherwise reused on-site is treated to comply with local standards and then discharged.\n\nWe are working toward an aspirational goal of reusing, recycling or restoring 100% of the water used in our operations, with an interim goal of 75% by the end of 2030. Actions such as enhancing reuse and recycling infrastructure and managing water efficiency, especially at existing facilities, will drive us toward this goal. Increasingly, we are incorporating water saving measures during the design stage of new buildings and industrial processes.\n\nSustainable management of our water footprint begins with understanding where we obtain water. Globally, the primary source for water at manufacturing locations is the municipal supply, underscoring the importance of partnering with local water authorities. We consider these relationships within their local context, seeking to understand the implications of different geographies, climates, watersheds and infrastructure. We then use the information we have gathered to determine the best approach to water management at each site.\n\nA water risk assessment using the World Resources Institute\u2019s Aqueduct tool has helped us better understand local water conditions. Recent updates to Aqueduct note that only 1% of Micron\u2019s total water withdrawals come from areas of high water stress \u2014 specifically our facility in Xi\u2019an, China. Still, many of our locations face potential water stress, and we recognize the importance of being a good partner in managing local water resources. Our fabs in Taiwan, for example, have been designed to enable the highest water recycling rates in the Micron network. A wastewater reclamation system installed at our wafer fab in Taoyuan in 2019 reduces our annual municipal water consumption by over 450,000 cubic meters. As the location weathers a historic drought, we are working closely with local authorities and carefully managing our water use.\n\nWhile our approach to water stewardship reflects a local, adaptive approach, our commitment to ensuring that industrial wastewater discharges meet all environmental legal requirements is global. Each Micron site has invested in significant water treatment infrastructure so that any wastewater leaving the site meets or exceeds applicable water quality standards. Wastewater treatment methods may vary by site but include membrane filtration, ion-resin adsorption, precipitation, bio-oxidation and neutralization. We routinely sample wastewater discharges for compliance with environmental standards. In CY20, we discharged 42.4 million cubic meters of treated wastewater, with 85% of that discharge sent to publicly operated treatment works. The sites also have staff responsible for the ongoing operation and routine maintenance of wastewater systems to safeguard proper performance over time.\n\nNote: Micron\u2019s environmental performance is measured by calendar year. Environmental goals are targeted for the end of the referenced calendar year.\nSolving Shared Water Challenges Close to Home\n\nOne way Micron will achieve its water conservation goal is by getting involved in local water restoration projects in the communities where we operate. Boise State University\u2019s Intermountain Bird Observatory and Diane Moore Nature Center is just across the Boise River from the pumphouse for Micron\u2019s headquarters and primary technology development fab, providing a direct line of sight from one of Micron\u2019s water sources to our clean water goal.\n\nBy \u201cadopting\u201d this stretch of the river, Micron will support the restoration of a side channel that runs parallel to the river and improve the quality of 10.9 million cubic meters of water a year. If the main stem of a river is the highway, a side channel is the service road where the traffic flows at a slower pace. In the case of the Boise River, it is also where fish and wildlife can access food, shelter and rest. The side channel provides cleaner, cold water to target the higher dissolved oxygen needs of trout spawn and juveniles.\n\nMicron is providing funding for the design and construction of the project, which will reopen the side channel that has been filled in over the years. This effort will offer an annual restoration benefit equal to 21% of Micron\u2019s 2020 global water withdrawals. Our support will also allow Boise State University, a longtime partner, to incorporate walking paths, signage and wildlife viewing areas along the river. These amenities will engage visitors and bolster community STEM education programs.\nHazardous Substances & Waste\n\nThe manufacturing processes that transform a wafer into hundreds of individual die use chemicals and materials such as acids, bases and solvents for depositing, patterning, selectively removing and cleaning. These processes also create a variety of waste materials.\n\nMicron maintains an active program to continually reduce hazardous chemicals in the manufacturing process and evaluate what we can do to mitigate any environmental impacts stemming from our use of those chemicals.\n\nWe also seek to reduce waste going into landfills and identify new recycling opportunities for any waste we produce \u2014 ultimately to meet our 2030 target of 95% waste reuse, recycling and recovery on the way to our aspirational goal to send zero waste to landfill.\n\nThis commitment starts with a rigorous chemical review process that ensures only approved chemicals reach our facilities. This review prevents banned or restricted chemicals from reaching our operations and facilitates the proper handling, recycling and disposal of chemicals throughout their lifecycle. It also allows us to track and understand our chemical-use profile so that we can implement chemical reduction and elimination initiatives.\n\nOver the past year, we have increased our focus on chemical reduction through process improvements, encouraging teams to design waste out of their processes. Chemicals management also has critical intersections with workforce safety and with our products.\n\nBeyond chemical screening, we perform due diligence on all new waste vendors to make sure their practices meet applicable legal requirements and safeguard the surrounding environment. If a waste facility passes this evaluation, Micron updates the assessment periodically to support the consistent and effective management of waste materials over time.\n\nGiven our dynamic industry, we keep abreast of any new risks or opportunities related to hazardous substances. We are committed to reducing chemical consumption and waste production by identifying new segregation methods, collaborating with waste vendors on solutions, optimizing recipes to reduce chemical waste, and working with business partners on reuse and recycling technology. For example, facilities in many countries now divert treatment plant byproducts for use as alternative raw materials in other industries. We are also exploring technologies for treating and reusing it in other Micron applications.\n\nNote: Micron\u2019s environmental performance is measured by calendar year. Environmental goals are targeted for the end of the referenced calendar year.\nTeam Member Engagement\n\nMicron\u2019s team members care deeply about their environment, especially as it relates to the health and well-being of their communities. Whenever possible, they put their commitment into action.\n\nIn 2020, Micron invited all team members to rally around our new environmental goals by crowdsourcing a slogan that will support engagement and awareness for our environmental programs. Using an online collaborative innovation tool, the initiative garnered immense support: More than 730 submissions were posted and more than 8,700 team members across all Micron geographies participated. Based on this input and executive review, the slogan Our Memory. Our Planet. was born from a concept submitted by a Micron team in Arzano, Italy. Our Memory highlights our core business offering. Our Planet connects our business to sustainable environmental practices.\n\nWe\u2019re also involving team members in other sustainability work inside and outside Micron. We organized a virtual Earth Day celebration in spring 2020 and launched our first global environmental roundtable connecting grassroots environmental teams across 21 manufacturing and nonmanufacturing Micron locations. Roundtable members represent committees of local volunteers who raise awareness and engage peers on sustainability issues.\n\nDespite the challenges of COVID-19, volunteers came together where it was safe to do so to care for their local environments. Teams in Singapore, Taiwan and Japan organized cleanups of nearby waterways. In Singapore alone, nearly 850 team members gathered for 36 public space cleanup sessions, volunteering 4,185 hours and recovering 5,732 pounds of waste from the coastline.\n\nTaiwanese team member Solo Wu recruited colleagues to help him monitor and protect the Nankan River from pollution. Once a month, volunteers patrol and clean up trash along a roughly 6-mile stretch of the river. \u201cBiodiversity in Nankan River has been growing over the years,\u201d said Wu, an environmental engineer for Micron\u2019s EHS department in Tainan. \u201cWe have observed multiple distinctive and benchmark species. It indicates that patrol efforts are effective and water quality is improving.\u201d\n\nAt several sites, team members organized donation and recycling drives to keep materials out of landfills, repurposing food scraps, electronics, furniture and more. In Lehi, Utah, food waste collected from an on-site cafeteria has been used by a recycling partner to produce natural gas fuel, diverting 5.7 tons from the landfill in the first six months of operation. The Boise, Idaho, team also established a new program to reduce food waste by integrating compostable cafeteria scraps into an on-site composting system. The program recorded an average of 583 pounds a month of waste diverted from the local landfill.\n\nWe are fortunate to be located near a company that operates an anaerobic digester that converts food waste to biofuel. Our \u2018Scrape the Plate\u2019 campaign allows all team members and contractors to participate in Micron\u2019s sustainability efforts. This is an example of how small and simple things can lead to great results.\u201d\n\nMike Smith\nPrincipal Environmental Engineer\nResponsible Sourcing\nWe are one link in an intricate technology supply chain that spans the globe.\n\nBy accelerating continuous improvement and promoting transparency and collaboration, we can drive progress in human rights and environmental stewardship across our industry.\n\nMicron manages a complex supply chain that includes a variety of materials, equipment and services required to support our operations, from office supplies to highly specialized design components. Given Micron\u2019s 8,230 suppliers in 40 countries in 2020 and the changing sourcing environment, managing our supply base is a critical and complex undertaking. Supplier geography continues to diversify, which increases resilience but also complicates the process of ensuring that all suppliers adhere to our global standards.\n\nThese challenges require a dedicated and tenacious team to guide our supplier evaluation and approval process and ensure that new and existing suppliers meet our expectations, including those related to social and environmental criteria. Micron works closely and continuously with suppliers to assess risk, drive corrective actions and encourage improvement. We communicate expectations to our tier 1 suppliers \u2014 those we source from directly \u2014 through our supplier requirements standard, previously known as our supplier quality requirements document. Through this and other communications, we strive to have responsible practices replicated throughout our supply chain.\nSupply Chain Risk Assessment\n\nWe monitor our global supply network against supply events 24/7, review possible supply risk scenarios against unplanned interruptions and work with our supply base to improve and lower their overall risk profiles.\n\nMicron\u2019s supply chain risk and resilience program has global processes, partners with best-in-class, third-party risk service providers, and has a team of highly skilled professionals in place applying continuous improvement to ensure a resilient, compliant and sustainable supply chain. Profiling and managing the relative operational risks of each of our strategic suppliers allow us to continuously manufacture and deliver products to our customers while upholding industry and Micron standards relating to sustainability.\n\nMicron performs a supplier risk assessment that aligns with one of our guiding documents, Integrity Matters: The Micron Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and with the RBA code of conduct. We evaluate the results of the assessment to generate a risk score. We then require any supplier with a high risk score or deficiency in a program or process to develop plans to address the issues. In addition, we expect suppliers to comply with or report to the following:\n\n- Annual RBA self-assessment questionnaire for a company\u2019s headquarters and all facilities, or Micron\u2019s sourcing compliance assessment\n- RBA audit or equivalent for any facility identified as high risk\n- U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act\n- U.K. Bribery Act\n- California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010\n- U.K. Modern Slavery Act of 2015\n- Updated conflict minerals reporting template in case any new smelters are added or existing smelters change status\n- E.U. Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals, updated and provided every six months or as any product change requires\n- E.U. Restriction of Hazardous Substances, updated and provided every 12 months or as any product change requires\n- CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project)\n- Sustainability/corporate social responsibility or equivalent report\n\nMicron requests that suppliers provide transparency through supply visibility mapping and supplier assessments, including the following information:\n\n- Data points such as manufacturing locations, emergency contacts, manufacturing recovery time and locations of critical sub-tier suppliers\n- Business continuity processes and programs at manufacturing locations\n- Event impact notification responses associated with Micron\u2019s supply chain\n- Programs and policies related to ethics, environment, forced labor and safety\n\nAs part of these assessments, Micron uses a software system to make it easier to manage supplier inputs and data. This practice improves the coverage, resources and processes used to uphold high expectations for our suppliers. In fiscal year 2020 (FY20), Micron assessed over 1,400 new suppliers, up from 900 in FY19. As a check on this and other processes, we maintain a compliance hotline for anonymous reporting of violations in our supply chain. We also offer a training program focused on responsibilities and expectations for our suppliers, including Micron\u2019s code of conduct, RBA requirements and product compliance standards. More than 1,500 supplier representatives, including new suppliers and incumbent strategic partners, participated in this virtual training in 2020, and more than 3,500 have participated since FY18. We also introduced a more tailored training for indirect service and product suppliers that covers only training topics relevant to their areas.\n\nWhile compliance is an important aspect of a responsible supply chain, Micron is evolving to reach beyond compliance and toward greater engagement with suppliers. This approach is particularly significant as we grow our business, respond to evolving trade pressures around the world and seek suppliers in new locations. In some areas, newer businesses may not be familiar with industry standards for suppliers such as the RBA code of conduct. We are proactive in communicating our expectations and mitigating risk up front, rather than having to correct issues later.\n\nAs a result, in 2020, we introduced a new supplier onboarding process incorporating increased due diligence. We use a third-party partner to do background screenings and verify all supplier data. If we uncover violations of our sourcing standards, we give suppliers 30 days to address any gaps \u2014 with Micron\u2019s guidance \u2014 before they can be approved. Otherwise, they are removed from our approved supplier list.\n\nThroughout the COVID-19 crisis, close engagement with suppliers has been essential. We shared the Micron COVID-19 Playbook that we developed to guide our internal response to the pandemic, helping suppliers implement best practices and ensure safe workplaces. We also sped up payments to small vendors so that they could better manage financial challenges stemming from the pandemic.\nManaging Risk in Our Supply Chain\n\nMicron\u2019s responsible sourcing and resilience group oversees supply chain risk management, which includes environmental, human rights and geopolitical risks. This team continues to mature its mission of enabling a resilient, compliant and sustainable global supply chain, including screenings, assessments, investigations, risk profiling, development and auditing of new and incumbent suppliers.\n\nNew Suppliers\n\nWe initially assess suppliers using information from business continuity processes, geographic location, type of commodity or service, Micron\u2019s history with the supplier and third-party reviews. We conduct additional screening for new suppliers.\n\nScreen & Assess\n\nWe map suppliers at the manufacturing level, focusing on business continuity planning processes, ethics, location, forced labor, environment and safety. We assign a score that indicates the risk of manufacturing or business disruption, as well as a score that indicates risk associated with responsibility and compliance. Each score may be high, medium or low.\n\nImprove & Develop\n\nWe may develop a mitigation plan and request improvement actions of any suppliers found to be out of compliance, or the suppliers may be removed from our supply base. Micron may establish corrective action plans, conduct in-person training or develop scorecard reviews or other plans to improve suppliers\u2019 risk profiles.\n\nAudit\n\nSuppliers identified as high risk may be audited in person to ensure they comply with Micron\u2019s code of conduct. The COVID-19 pandemic limited the number of audits we could conduct in 2020.\nHuman & Labor Rights\n\nMicron and our stakeholders support the advancement of human rights along our value chain.\n\nThe Micron Code of Business Conduct and Ethics aligns with the RBA code of conduct and explicitly highlights our commitment to respecting and protecting human rights wherever we operate. Micron actively works to uphold the highest level of labor ethics in our own operations, and we also expect our suppliers, contractors and other partners to adhere to our code, human rights policy and relevant laws, with a particular emphasis on child labor and forced labor.\n\nOur commitment to these concerns is made public through our slavery and human trafficking statement, which was updated and approved by Micron\u2019s board of directors for FY20. As part of our ongoing due diligence in this area, we regularly conduct supplier risk assessments to understand how well suppliers address the issues, with specific focus on operations in areas more at risk for human rights violations. Beyond these important issues, Micron also monitors the following human rights concerns as they relate to our supply chain:\n\n- Working hours\n- Fair wages and benefits\n- Worker health and safety\n- Nondiscrimination and anti-harassment\n- Freedom of association\n\nThis oversight of human rights begins with anyone who works on a Micron site in any capacity, from security to construction work. It extends to the employees of our suppliers and to any people hired temporarily by suppliers, who in some parts of the world are foreign migrant workers. Many of Micron\u2019s suppliers are located in Asia, which has areas that are at higher risk for human rights violations against foreign migrant workers and require additional diligence. For example, workers may have their passports withheld or be charged recruiting or administrative fees before being hired. These fees can amount to more than several months\u2019 pay and may require workers to take out loans, effectively forcing them to pay to have a job. In addition, most of these workers send the majority of their earnings back to their home countries to support their families, making the payment of loans and fees especially burdensome.\n\nRBA code requirements limiting forced labor differ from the laws regarding fees, levies and working hours in many countries where we do business. While the variations add complexity, we enforce the more stringent standard if local laws and the RBA code are different. Micron is actively involved, along with other members of the RBA, in eliminating forced labor in our supply chain through training, dialogue with government officials and interviews with foreign migrant workers about their conditions. To avoid forced labor practices, Micron also works with recruitment agents in the countries of hire to make sure they follow proper procedures.\n\nTop Supplier Audit Findings 2020\n\n- Working hours\n- Foreign migrant worker fees\n- Discrimination\n- Freedom of association\n- Emergency exits\n\nRBA Code of Conduct\n\nWe are an active member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA). The RBA is composed of leading electronics, retail, automotive and toy companies that have joined together to promote responsible working conditions, ethical business practices and environmental stewardship globally throughout their respective industry supply chains. The RBA plays a critical role in upholding a single set of expectations regarding social and environmental responsibility and a single process for demonstrating conformance. Members adhere to a common RBA code of conduct, which addresses supply chain performance expectations for labor, health and safety, environmental practices, ethics and management systems. Through RBA training materials, monitoring tools and third-party audits, we support the efforts of our key suppliers to maintain responsible operations. We also hold suppliers accountable when they fall short of expectations. To comply with the RBA code in our own operations, we have adopted a vigorous management approach that includes training our team members on code requirements and using third-party auditors to verify our actions. Our global RBA oversight team includes representatives from legal, human resources, environmental, health and safety, and supplier management functions. They monitor key RBA metrics across all of our manufacturing locations and review periodic reports on Micron\u2019s overall RBA performance.\nResponsible Minerals\n\nMicron has long been a leader in programs to address and report on conflict minerals. Like many technology companies, Micron relies on the use of tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold (3TG) in the manufacture of our products.\n\nThese materials, known as conflict minerals, are abundant in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and surrounding countries, a region that has endured sustained conflict and human rights violations. We recognize that these and other raw materials are subject to controversy based on social and environmental concerns regarding how they are obtained. With this in mind, our program assesses and reviews other rare earth elements, metals and materials used in our processes to understand global risks related to human rights, potential restrictions, availability, pricing and implications to manufacturing processes and products while focusing expanded due diligence on worldwide 3TG minerals.\n\nCollaboration among government, industry and communities is key to achieving conformance in our supply chain. Reflecting this philosophy, Micron is a founding member of the RMI, a consortium that works across the minerals industry to develop a common approach for addressing conflict mineral supply chains and protocols that may expand to include other minerals. The RMI includes a third-party auditing process, due diligence tools and a public database documenting where each smelter or refiner stands in its conflict-free journey. Micron is a member of the RMI\u2019s smelter engagement working group and has supported expansion of the RMI\u2019s cobalt reporting program, which we expect to be implemented in 2022. Because Micron does not produce batteries, we do not use significant amounts of cobalt. Even so, we have investigated potential cobalt use within our supply chain.\n\nTo help Micron achieve our responsible mineral policy objectives, we require suppliers to comply with our responsible mineral programs by doing the following:\n\n- Providing a complete, updated conflict minerals reporting template (CMRT) that discloses the source of conflict minerals that may be present in products sold to Micron, including the smelters from which the conflict minerals originated\n- Updating CMRTs within two weeks of any smelter or refiner changes within the entire supply chain\n- Adopting a conflict mineral policy dedicated to achieving a conflict-free supply chain\n- Participating in and facilitating audits of facilities, conflict mineral policies, conflict mineral procedures and associated records\n- Directing their own suppliers to adopt conflict mineral policies\n\nMicron implements policies and procedures to help ensure that our existing suppliers rely on smelters and refiners that are conflict-free, and we only engage with new suppliers that make similar commitments. We require suppliers to remove nonconformant smelters within 13 weeks when they fall out of approved status, but they often resolve issues sooner.\n\nThroughout 2020, all the smelters and refineries in Micron\u2019s supply chain conformed with responsible minerals sourcing standards. We are committed to transparency and publish an annual conflict minerals report on our due diligence and progress toward a conflict-free supply chain.\nSupplier Environmental Impact\n\nAs an industry leader, Micron has significant opportunity to partner across our industry to influence the environmental profile of suppliers.\n\nA limited number of equipment manufacturers supply the technologies used in Micron\u2019s plants and those of our peers. Micron steers the industry toward innovations that reduce water and energy use. And we also help our suppliers to understand our sustainability efforts and to identify and address sustainability-related risks, including those pertaining to climate change and other environmental impacts. In much the same way as we assess suppliers for risk, we survey high-risk and critical suppliers\u2019 programs to improve energy efficiency; reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs); and control, treat and minimize solid waste, wastewater and air emissions. The RBA audit process used with our suppliers assesses these impacts.\n\nWe also require that key suppliers report to CDP, either by sending Micron their CDP submissions or reporting a subset of CDP information. We plan to expand our environmental engagement through a formal partnership with the CDP supply chain program in 2021. Beyond encouraging suppliers to disclose their direct carbon footprints, we are working with them to find ways to reduce environmental impacts at Micron sites. In 2020, we piloted a program with a targeted group of capital equipment suppliers to identify how they could support Micron\u2019s internal environmental goals related to energy, emissions, water and waste. We now have a tracking system for projects supporting these goals and are establishing timelines and milestones to keep us moving forward.\n\nMicron Is Also Part of Many Other Companies\u2019 Supply Chains\n\nWe have deep experience interacting with supply chain partners as both a supplier and a customer, and we are subject to many of the same auditing protocols that our own suppliers are. All Micron sites have qualified for RBA platinum recognition with perfect audit scores. In addition, Micron Memory in Taiwan received the Factory of Choice award from the RBA in 2020.\nSupplier Diversity\n\nWe believe the best innovation comes from diverse experiences, perspectives and backgrounds, and this belief extends to our supply chain and procurement programs.\n\nMicron\u2019s supplier diversity program is helping us build mutually beneficial partnerships with businesses that are majority-owned by women, underrepresented communities, people with disabilities, members of the LGBT community, and veterans. In 2020, we set an ambitious commitment to double Micron\u2019s annual spend with these businesses by FY23. Progress toward this goal will be measured against an FY20 baseline in spending with such businesses globally and made possible by our continued engagement with industry groups, nongovernmental organizations and corporate peers.\n\nIn 2020, we implemented new tools and processes that will allow us to find diverse suppliers more easily and increase their opportunities to participate in Micron\u2019s procurement events. We also revised expectations for suppliers, including supporting Micron\u2019s supplier diversity initiative and committing to use inclusive sourcing practices of their own. In addition, we incorporated tier 2 supplier diversity and reporting requirements into our supplier scorecards and evaluated a targeted group of our strategic partners on their reporting of tier 2 diverse spend.\n\nWe\u2019re working with industry organizations to establish best practices in supplier diversity and enhance the inclusion and competitiveness of diverse suppliers in the semiconductor industry. Micron recently joined the National Minority Supplier Development Council, which aims to advance business opportunities for certified minority-owned businesses based in the United States. Outside the U.S., Micron is working with WEConnect International to identify and increase opportunities for women-owned businesses throughout Asia. Micron is also a member of the SEMI Manufacturing Ownership Diversity working group, which seeks to increase ownership diversity in the semiconductor supply chain. These partnerships reflect our long-term commitment to advocating for supplier diversity around the world.\n\nIn FY20, Micron spent over $104 million with diverse-owned businesses. To ensure continued progress, we are committing to doubling our spend with diverse businesses by FY23.\u201d\n\nStefan Guth\nCorporate Vice President and Chief Procurement Officer\n6 People\nA thriving workplace requires focused effort. People are the backbone of our business and critical to our vision of transforming how the world uses information to enrich life for all.\n\nMicron depends on a hardworking, tenacious and highly educated workforce to design, develop and manufacture high-quality, cutting-edge memory and storage solutions. Our employees (called team members for the importance of their collaboration) are located in 17 countries. So creating a unified culture across functions and geographies is essential to realizing Micron\u2019s vision and mission.\n\nThe challenges of 2020 reaffirmed a fundamental truth: Nothing is more important than our people. While Micron has always had a strong human resources team, we recognized the need to shift to a comprehensive people strategy that reflects just how vital Micron\u2019s people are to the business and how highly we regard our team members. We have also elevated the position of chief people officer (CPO) to Micron\u2019s executive leadership team.\n\nOur new people and culture organization has introduced a mission to be a top company to work for by investing in our people, strengthening our communities and investing for the future. We will achieve this mission with efforts in three areas:\n\n- Focusing on our people and our influence on the community. Innovation requires diverse perspectives at the table. That\u2019s why we\u2019re committed to building a diverse pipeline of people who not only contribute to their local communities, but also drive progress for the world at large.\n- Enabling the workforce of the future. We\u2019re creating the next generation of trailblazers by actively investing in the professional development of our talent. By cultivating an inclusive culture, we\u2019re able to continue growing our talent at all levels.\n- Transforming the work experience. We embrace change. Using technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, data analytics and other tools, we\u2019re able to evolve and create the best experience working at Micron.\n\nOver the short and long terms, our people and culture organization will focus on priorities in each of these areas, bringing us closer to our vision.\n\nIn partnership with our global leaders, our incredible people team is continually looking for new ways to strengthen our culture that fosters inclusion for all.\u201d\n\nApril Arnzen\nSenior Vice President and Chief People Officer\nTalent Acquisition, Engagement & Retention\n\nFinding and retaining the best and brightest people in an extremely competitive industry environment is a strategic imperative for our business.\n\nWork in our three strategic focus areas begins even before prospective employees become part of the Micron team. Our talent acquisition group works to build a diverse, global workforce by enhancing our employment brand and strengthening recruitment efforts at universities and with diverse candidates. We have partnerships with more than 300 colleges and universities worldwide. In collaboration with these institutions, we offer curricula and mentorship programs that reinforce awareness of and engagement with Micron among students and graduates. To connect with candidates from diverse backgrounds, Micron is strengthening our efforts at historically Black colleges and universities and Hispanic-serving institutions, and we\u2019re also working with organizations such as the Society of Women Engineers.\n\nMicron is increasing hiring \u2014 and therefore representation \u2014 of diverse candidates through a new set of practices. These include hiring practices where we build a diverse slate of qualified candidates and ensure that interview panels themselves are diverse. In addition, we use artificial intelligence to draft job descriptions to reduce or eliminate the potential for bias, and we remove identifiable information from r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, minimizing any distractions from personal characteristics to instead focus on individual merit. Micron\u2019s legal department has adopted the Mansfield Rule, which means it will consider at least 50% historically underrepresented lawyers for 70% or more of its high-visibility opportunities, internal promotions, significant leadership roles, and outside counsel representation for a two-year period.\n\nKnowing that bias can unconsciously influence hiring decisions, volunteers from our employee resource groups have been trained to participate on interview panels as inclusion advocates to deter bias. The advocate listens carefully and challenges unfair assumptions to ensure hiring decisions are made fairly.\n\nMeasuring Team Member Engagement\n\nPeople who are engaged at work tend to thrive professionally, and our performance is better as a result. Micron participates in the Great Place to Work survey, which solicits feedback from our global team members on their experiences at the company. This information allows us to identify strengths and areas of opportunity, as well as to benchmark our performance against other companies.\n\nWe are proud of our results, which improved in a number of key areas compared to 2019. For example, 94% of employees agreed that Micron is a physically safe place to work, which was especially meaningful in light of the pandemic. Micron was certified as a Great Place to Work in seven countries and made the Best Workplace list in four countries in 2020.\n\nImproving Team Member Retention\n\nCreating an environment where team members can thrive enhances our ability to retain the best talent. Micron historically has low turnover, even at locations with fierce competition for top talent. We have seen a 6% rate of voluntary turnover in fiscal year 2020 (FY20), down 1% from FY19. This trend was observed across all three geographical regions where Micron operates, with the biggest improvement in Asia.\n\nThat said, Micron is focused on improving the retention rate for our female team members. Many companies including Micron experienced a decline in turnover due to COVID-19. This coupled with our efforts to retain diverse talent through targeted programs resulted in a 0.6% decrease in the gender retention gap from 2019.\nOffering Employee Benefits\n\nWe encourage our team members to seek balance between their work and home lives. Micron follows Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) standards on working hours, which state that employees in all functions should work no more than 60 hours a week (typical in some international manufacturing environments), except in emergency or unusual situations, with at least one day off every seven days. We also offer flexible work arrangements and compressed work weeks for manufacturing team members so they can manage work and life.\n\nOur total compensation strategy includes base salary, annual bonuses and equity awards. Taken as a whole, Micron\u2019s compensation programs are designed to support our team members\u2019 financial and personal well-being by providing a valuable return for their contributions to the company. We also offer a discounted stock purchase program, allowing team members to purchase Micron stock at a 15% discount in most of the markets where we operate. They can enroll in the program twice a year and contribute up to 10% of their salary. When the program was reinstated at Micron in August 2018, about 53% of our workforce opted to participate. In 2020, that participation increased to 65%.\n\nMicron also offers a comprehensive benefits package:\n- Medical coverage, insurance, paid time off and holidays\n- Family and bereavement leave\n- Military differential pay to offset the difference in pay for eligible team members who are performing voluntary or involuntary service in the U.S. uniformed services\n- Professional development opportunities and financial assistance for team members seeking to advance their education in a traditional university setting\n- An extensive employee assistance and wellness program designed to support healthy lifestyles\n\nIn 2020, we expanded these benefits in the U.S. to offer an adoption benefit, fertility benefits and coverage for team members\u2019 domestic partners. We also enhanced gender confirmation services covered under the medical plans and added benefits for backup child care and elder care. We modified our U.S. holiday calendars to incorporate floating holidays that team members can use as they wish, provided an additional paid wellness day and facilitated a charity event in which team members could cash out or donate vacation days to help others affected by COVID-19.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we expanded medical benefits and leave-of-absence programs. No-cost telehealth benefits were added to all U.S. medical plans to give team members access to medical and mental health services at home while doctors\u2019 offices were closed and hospitals were at capacity. Similar telemedicine services were implemented in Singapore so that team members there could avoid waiting at clinics, and medical insurance policies in Malaysia were enhanced to provide better coverage. In India, Micron enhanced the insurance policy exclusively for COVID-19 treatment on top of standard insurance benefits and sponsored COVID-19 testing for all Micron team members there.\n\nMicron also addressed financial challenges related to the pandemic, including providing a global COVID-19 assistance payment and pledging no layoffs for 90 days in the early stages of the pandemic. To help U.S. team members adjust, Micron adopted several 401(k) and flexible spending account COVID-19 provisions. We also instituted an assistance fund to deliver additional financial help to team members facing extreme hardships. It is funded primarily by Micron team members and gives one-time grants of US$500 to eligible team members who apply. We have now broadened the scope of the fund to help team members experiencing hardships and emergencies not related to COVID-19 with grants up to US$5,000.\n\nSafety protocols to prevent community spread of COVID-19 required a swift work-from-home transition for many of our team members. In response, we offered several resources:\nDiversity, Equality & Inclusion\n\nAs a multinational company, Micron knows that real innovation comes from our team members\u2019 distinct experiences, perspectives and backgrounds.\n\nIn 2020, Micron updated our corporate vision statement, adding two small but important words to the end: Transforming how the world uses information to enrich life for all. This powerful and intentional change builds on Micron\u2019s brand promise and highlights our ongoing commitment to diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI). \u201cFor all\u201d embodies not just who we are but also what we do.\n\nDEI is essential throughout our business. Our customers expect us to collaborate with them to solve real human problems. Our investors expect our board to represent a diverse set of experiences and views. Our communities expect us to advocate for equitable laws and accessible education that benefits everyone. Our people expect to work in an inclusive culture where all voices are heard and the best ideas win.\n\nWe know that diversity can be both visible and invisible, so we foster a culture of inclusion and equality in which all team members can grow and thrive. While we have made great progress, our achievements to date don\u2019t represent our sense of urgency. We are making powerful commitments for 2021, launching targeted programs to support our underrepresented team members in their advancement at all levels of the company. Because we believe transparency promotes accountability, each year we affirm our commitment by publishing our DEI report. This year\u2019s report, titled \u201cFor All: 2020 Annual Report,\u201d highlights our DEI strategy, recognizes our successes and calls attention to areas that need improvement.\n\nWhile most of Micron\u2019s team members are located outside the United States, our DEI efforts to date have been more U.S.-focused than representative of our global workforce. In FY20, we addressed this situation by expanding our DEI team in Asia and naming a senior leader based in Singapore who will oversee our DEI business partners and collaborate with global leaders. We are also putting in place regional DEI strategies for each of our locations.\n\nIn addition, we have set goals for inclusive hiring and work practices, with specific focus areas for all regions. For example, our teams in Japan and Malaysia are working to hire women and people with disabilities, while Japan is emphasizing hiring foreign nationals. In India, Micron\u2019s talent acquisition team has ramped up recruitment of new female college graduates for engineering roles.\n\nTo hold ourselves even more accountable for progress, we have announced six global DEI commitments for FY21, each with an executive sponsor:\n\n1. Increase representation of underrepresented groups\n   Scott DeBoer, Executive Vice President of Technology and Products\n\n2. Drive equitable pay and inclusive benefits\n   Sumit Sadana, Executive Vice President and Chief Business Officer\n\n3. Strengthen our culture of inclusion\n   April Arnzen, Senior Vice President and Chief People Officer\n\n4. Advocate for racial and LGBTQ+ equality\n   Joel Poppen, Senior Vice President of Legal Affairs, General Counsel, and Corporate Secretary\n\n5. Engage with minority-owned financial institutions for cash management\n   David Zinsner, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\n6. Increase representation and spend with diverse suppliers\n   Stefan Guth, Chief Vice President and Corporate Procurement Officer\nIncreasing Representation of Underrepresented Groups\n\nOur talent acquisition, university relations, DEI, workforce development and other teams work closely to guide inclusive hiring efforts and ensure development and advancement opportunities for all. We continue to make progress on women\u2019s representation in leadership positions. In FY20, our board of directors was 37.5% female, growing to 50% female representation in February 2021. Female representation in our senior leadership team grew from 13.5% in FY19 to 14.2% in FY20.\n\nMicron is developing a strong pipeline of female technical talent through a global women\u2019s mentoring program that connects early-career engineering talent with our senior leadership. In FY20, 33% of the participants in our FY19 advance sponsorship cohort were promoted, including two who became vice presidents in technical areas. We continue to more broadly promote women in the technology industry through our partnerships with organizations such as the Global Semiconductor Alliance.\n\nAnother area of DEI progress addresses our team members with disabilities, a self-reported group that grew by nearly 4% in FY20. Our Malaysia sites successfully launched a program to recruit and train 20 new technicians with hearing impairments. The Malaysia team partnered with an external agency and marshalled internal resources to create an inclusive environment for these new team members through staff training in sign language and light-based notification systems.\n\nMicron has also raised awareness of visible and invisible disabilities globally through our new Capable employee resource group and campaigns such as World Mental Health Day. Because disability data is self-reported, we believe that increasing cultural acceptance helps our global team members feel more comfortable being open about their disability status.\n\nRepresentation Throughout Our Workforce\n\n|                | FY19 | FY20 |\n|----------------|------|------|\n| Female         | 37.5%| 50%  |\n| Male           | 62.5%| 50%  |\n\nFemale Representation in Board of Directors\n\n|                | FY19 | FY20 |\n|----------------|------|------|\n| Female         | 25.0%| 37.5%|\n| Male           | 75.0%| 62.5%|\n\nIncreased to 50% in 2021\n\nFemale Representation in Senior Leadership\n\n|                | FY19 | FY20 |\n|----------------|------|------|\n| Female         | 13.5%| 14.2%|\n| Male           | 86.5%| 85.8%|\n\nInclusion Survey\n\n- 40,000 Team Members\n- 64% Participation\n- 2.2% LGBTQ+\n- 7.2% Living With Disabilities\n- 5.9% U.S. Veterans\n\nMicron Donations\n\n- $1M+ Donated to the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund\n- $165K Donated from the Micron Foundation to organizations focused on programs with people with disabilities across Japan, Singapore and Malaysia to cultivate inclusion and enhance quality of life\nDriving Equitable Pay and Inclusive Benefits\n\nWe have a regular review of pay globally, including base pay and stock awards, to drive compensation equity. Micron works with a third party and uses dynamic technology to analyze and adjust when needed.\n\nHistorically, our pay equity analyses have focused on gender. We have expanded our scope to assess all underrepresented groups: women and people with disabilities globally, and veterans, Black Americans and Hispanic Americans in the U.S. As a result of our analyses, in FY20, we increased Micron\u2019s minimum wage to $15 an hour for all U.S. team members.\n\nMuch like the inclusion advocates who participate in candidate interviews, team member advocates also participate in talent review meetings to ensure that decisions regarding promotions, performance, rotation assignments, access to training and other advancement opportunities are determined fairly.\n\nStrengthening Our Culture of Inclusion\n\nEmployee resource groups (ERGs) are an important part of our talent pipeline and our work to build a more inclusive culture. ERGs are employee-led and volunteer-driven groups centered around people with shared identities or experiences and their allies. Micron has nine ERGs with 74 chapters at our sites around the world. We saw an 84% growth in overall ERG membership in 2020 and the creation of 25 new chapters, including 10 in the U.S. and 15 in Asia.\n\nMicron is empowering ERG members even more by aligning their work more closely to our business objectives. For example, the Micron Women\u2019s Leadership Network (MWLN) ERG and Micron patent team began the Women\u2019s Innovation Network in 2019 to mentor women inventors. As a result, the number of female inventors at Micron increased from 77 in 2019 to 136 in 2020.\n\nERGs engage both members and nonmembers in creative ways. For example, the PRIDE+ Allies, Black Employee Network (BEN) and Micron Hispanic Professionals ERGs held inclusion ally training to help all Micron team members understand the importance of allyship. Nearly 1,000 team members participated in this training. For FY21, all ERGs have developed their own training, with a goal of all 40,000 Micron team members participating in at least one session, an activity that is tied to the company\u2019s short-term incentive goals. Taking this a step further, we created a new inclusion ally award, given quarterly to recognize exceptional allyship among team members. Awards have been given for standing up against microaggressions and creating hiring initiatives aimed at women and people with disabilities.\n\nOther efforts by ERGs to promote inclusion include Micron\u2019s first commemoration of Juneteenth, led by our BEN ERG in the United States. The group organized a day of education with a virtual fireside chat, panel discussions and opportunities for small-group meetings among teams about the prejudices faced by Black Americans. In June, members of PRIDE+ Allies raised the Pride flag at three Micron sites. And our Capable ERG has partnered with our senior leadership team, facilities and IT staff to explore technology resources for team members with varying abilities. Such resources include smart badges and translations of video calls. In addition to these specific efforts, the DEI team has also focused on creating strong dialogue with community leaders and police officers.\n\nAdvocating for Racial & LGBTQ+ Equality\n\nWe have the power to promote social justice beyond the walls of our company. Micron\u2019s new social justice council is determining how best to promote racial equality and LGBTQ+ rights in the communities where our team members live, work and play. For example, we are actively engaging with community and law enforcement leaders at our largest U.S. sites to identify systemic issues and take action to move our communities forward. We are training local municipalities and police departments where Micron has a presence in DEI behaviors, and we will partner with other organizations to advance the use of data and technology to influence the criminal justice system and create greater transparency in law enforcement.\n\nIn addition, the Micron Foundation is promoting social justice with a recent Advancing Curiosity award to the eScience Institute\u2019s Data Science for the Social Good program at the University of Washington. During the summer, a team developed new methods for detecting dilution of minority votes and created an open-source tool to identify coronavirus disinformation on news websites.\n\nEngaging With Minority-Owned Financial Institutions for Cash Management\n\nAnother way Micron uses our strength and resources to drive lasting change is through the firms we choose to manage our capital investments. Throughout 2020, Micron allocated $250 million in cash and cash equivalents to be managed by minority-owned firms, which has a multiplying effect in the economies of underrepresented communities.\n\nThis effort includes allocating $100 million for management under Academy Securities, a veteran-owned firm, and $100 million under Ramirez Asset Management, Inc., an affiliate of Samuel A. Ramirez & Company, Inc. which is the oldest and largest Hispanic-owned investment bank in the U.S. A final $50 million allocation to RBC Global Asset Management will support an impact investment strategy that aims to reduce wealth gaps in predominantly Black neighborhoods and increase access to homeownership, affordable rental housing, community facilities and small business loans.\nHealth & Safety\n\nProactive efforts to prevent occupational illnesses and injuries allow us to maintain a safe, healthy and secure workplace.\n\nOur safety vision is straightforward: We strive for an incident-free workplace. Micron already has a tradition of world-class safety performance, but making further improvements requires dedicated effort, resources, commitment and tenacity, and it involves everyone at every level of our organization. Across our business, Micron is evolving safety to a value so embedded in our culture that it becomes instinctual.\n\nOur manufacturing locations are certified to ISO 45001:2018 safety and occupational health management systems, setting a foundation for an effective and auditable safety program. In early 2020, we introduced a new program known as Live Safe to move us from a compliance-based to a more proactive, risk management-based approach to safety. Live Safe creates a unified corporate safety culture by engaging managers at all levels, identifying program champions, establishing a formal training structure and common safety practices across our global facilities, and reinforcing critical technical programs that focus on fundamental hazards that our team members may face. The program rollout coincided with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. While this timing required us to adapt training to be delivered virtually, it also created a proving ground that empowered team members to own their personal safety \u2014 and senior leaders to show their care and concern for the safety of our team members, contractors and vendors.\n\nOne of the tenets of our safety methodology \u2014 and our COVID-19 response \u2014 is to \u201ccoach and be coached.\u201d Our teams showed both leadership and humility as we ramped up global safety protocols, allowing us to see the effectiveness of this mindset in action.\n\nOur approach to safety, which is multilayered and involves all team members, is summarized below:\n\n**Health & Safety Committees**\nAt every manufacturing site, comprising both management and nonmanagement team members\n- Promote overall operations and communications regarding safety\n- Ensure messaging reinforces safety programs, recognizes safe behaviors and highlights engagement activities\n- Align our environmental, health and safety (EHS) management system and associated guidance with the latest ISO 45001 certifications\n- Participate in third-party audits through the RBA\u2019s Validated Assessment Program\n\n**Managers & Supervisors**\n- Lead, implement and maintain safe, secure and compliant work areas\n- Participate in regular area safety assessments where they walk through their work environments looking for unsafe conditions and behaviors. They also participate in behavioral safety assessments in which they observe their teams at work and share constructive feedback, including correcting unsafe behaviors. When issues are identified through an area safety walk or a behavioral assessment, we track corrections and timely closeouts. We also track that team members complete all required safety training.\n\n**All Team Members & Contractors**\n- Help identify, eliminate and control EHS hazards and risks\n- Follow all EHS policies, procedures and applicable legal requirements, including those contained in Integrity Matters: The Micron Code of Business Conduct and Ethics\n\nSafety is not a lack of incidents. Rather, safety is the sum of actions we take that help prevent incidents from occurring. As part of the Live Safe program, we have strengthened our safety key performance indicators and established a set of leading indicators \u2014 proactive actions we take to keep us all safe. We have also implemented leader-led, activity-focused key performance indicators that better measure management behaviors and engagement for safety, as well as enhancements to our technical safety program.\n\nFor example, all leaders in manufacturing participate in regular area safety assessments where they walk through their work environments looking for unsafe conditions and behaviors. They also participate in behavioral safety assessments in which they observe their teams at work and share constructive feedback, including correcting unsafe behaviors. When issues are identified through an area safety walk or a behavioral assessment, we track corrections and timely closeouts. We also track that team members complete all required safety training.\n\n**Recordable Injury Rate**\n\n| Year | Rate |\n|------|------|\n| 2018 | 0.32 |\n| 2019 | 0.14 |\n| 2020 | 0.16 |\n\nRates are based on 200,000 hours worked. Starting in 2020, contractors are included in the recordable injury rate.\nWhile we are proud of this performance, we recognize that we can do even more, knowing that serious injuries can happen even with a low recordable injury rate. To this end, we are strengthening our focus on serious injury prevention by tracking potential and real life-altering injuries. These injuries are often associated with our nine critical risks. We aim to reduce these serious injuries by placing ownership on each site leader. If an incident occurs on a Micron site, we require leaders to take action to help prevent a similar incident in the Micron network. Our goal is to reach zero life-altering injuries by FY22.\n\nEnsuring Safe Use of Chemicals in Manufacturing\n\nMicron is an industry leader in the responsible use of chemicals, gases and byproducts that are part of manufacturing. We focus on protecting our team members by identifying chemical hazards through a rigorous approval process, eliminating or substituting these substances, implementing engineering controls, and providing information about hazards to team members through training. As appropriate, we provide team members with personal protective equipment and conduct regular medical checks and monitoring for concentrations of hazardous substances. Micron has implemented a risk-based approach of analyzing and controlling hazards for the lifecycle of hazardous chemicals and gases. A global team, coordinating with local teams at each manufacturing and technology development site, provides training, assesses risk, mitigates hazards and responds to incidents. Worldwide teams work closely with all elements of manufacturing, including leadership, equipment and engineering teams, and fab support and facilities personnel. These teams follow a risk-based program developed by the Center for Chemical Process Safety. It is built on 20 elements that are essential to a successful process safety strategy. To discover and mitigate any safety concerns on fab workstations and facilities systems, teams primarily use a risk assessment tool known as a hazard and operability study (HAZOP). Worldwide, Micron team members have completed over 1,000 HAZOPs since 2010.\n\nThe global process safety and hazard review team is now leading a project to build a database of safety-critical information for all the gases and chemicals used at Micron. Through partnerships with process and equipment engineering teams, our efforts continue to reduce overall risk for our manufacturing and technology development sites. Micron also takes a long-term approach to eliminating the use of high-hazard materials from the workplace and from our products, working across our industry to develop alternatives with lower risk. Although these are not regulatory requirements for Micron in most countries, we view this as a best practice that positions Micron as an industry leader to ensure the safety of our team members and their communities.\n\nMaintaining a Safe & Healthy Workplace During COVID-19\n\nAs Micron has responded to the global spread of COVID-19, the past year has tested us in countless ways. It has also shown us the importance of preparation, teamwork and willingness to adapt our plans as a situation evolves. Micron\u2019s safety protocols often went well beyond local, state and federal requirements. In most Micron locations, our response to COVID-19 began before the first case of the virus was detected. As a global company, we conduct planning related to emergencies of all types, including pandemics and infectious diseases. We have navigated localized epidemics near our facilities in Asia in the past, so we had protocols ready to deploy when the first cases were reported and the virus began to spread. Our pandemic emergency preparedness plan (PEPP) provided the framework for our response, outlining risk-based categories that could be applied uniformly to mitigate risk and keep workers safe at our sites worldwide.\n\nAs COVID-19 spread, several groups acted swiftly, procuring masks and other personal protective equipment and overseeing the adaptation of our work practices. We also quickly developed contact tracing procedures, using technology such as wearable devices that allowed us to rapidly determine team members\u2019 exposure risk. Given that many team members in our manufacturing facilities perform work that cannot be done remotely, it was essential that we adopt safe distancing and cleaning protocols that would allow our business to continue operating. Micron developed dynamic plans for how individuals could move safely through each of our facilities. We also upgraded HVAC systems and installed bipolar ionization technology that efficiently removes the coronavirus from a building\u2019s air flow. With COVID-19 vaccines now available, we have launched a task force to monitor vaccine availability for team members.\n\nMore than a year after the outbreak began, we are proud of our approach and our ability to protect more than 40,000 team members in 17 countries while maintaining our global operations. Micron continues to adapt on-site work protocols to prioritize the health and safety of our team members. We carefully assess risk in each location to protect our teams and support business needs. The return of team members to Micron sites will be based on a range of considerations, such as virus prevalence, location, job role and business needs. Meanwhile, we continue to enforce the strong preventative measures we implemented at our sites from the start of the COVID-19 outbreak and deploy new protocols as needed to promote safety.\nWellness\n\nCreating an injury- and illness-free workplace is a minimum expectation, but it is only one aspect of Micron\u2019s efforts to keep team members safe and healthy at work.\n\nA focus of our well-being and benefits teams in 2020 was using every possible means to deliver robust mental and emotional health services, tools and resources to team members and their families. However, ensuring well-being amid the uncertainty of COVID-19 went well beyond helping team members cope with challenges.\n\nSeveral existing programs were enhanced to provide more services or modified from an in-person delivery to a virtual environment. We created new roles for team member advocates, a resource we launched in 2019, to provide a single place where team members could turn for advice on challenges related to careers, family, finances, health and other concerns. We also expanded our Choose Well, Live Well program, one that combines site-level and global assistance, in these meaningful ways:\n\n- Increasing team member access to free mental health and counseling support by offering two additional sessions per issue (from six to eight), which is above industry standards\n- Offering free microcounseling sessions that connected team members to local mental health experts\n- Adding financial tools and work-life coaching for U.S. team members, and stress, anxiety and depression programming globally\n- Providing critical-incident stress management services and emotional support sessions for team members dealing with the trauma of social justice events\n- Launching a work-from-home toolkit, offering guidance for healthy approaches to working remotely\n- Hosting a workshop to help managers lead remote teams during COVID-19 and care for charges\u2019 well-being\n- Easing social isolation during lockdown by hosting shared sessions on a variety of topics; promoting mindfulness sessions; planning activities to prevent burnout; and helping team members socialize, learn healthy habits and recharge\n- Launching live online fitness sessions and a library of recorded exercise videos, with courses ranging from high-intensity training to mindful mobility and yoga\n- Encouraging team members to earn incentives by participating in well-being challenges and measuring their progress\n- Increasing our online learning library to include free webinars on parenting, stress reduction, COVID-19 uncertainty, and diversity and inclusion\n- Offering workshops and webinars featuring experts on social, emotional, intellectual, financial, occupational and physical welfare topics\n- Launching virtual support groups where team members in similar situations can share advice as they deal with challenges related to health, parenting, elder care or other circumstances\n- Introducing a virtual daily chat session to give people a place for fun and social connection during their workday\n- Offering a wellness day to all Micron team members, giving them a chance to recharge\n- Launching live online fitness sessions and a library of recorded exercise videos, with courses ranging from high-intensity training to mindful mobility and yoga\n- Encouraging team members to earn incentives by participating in well-being challenges and measuring their progress\n- Increasing our online learning library to include free webinars on parenting, stress reduction, COVID-19 uncertainty, and diversity and inclusion\n- Offering workshops and webinars featuring experts on social, emotional, intellectual, financial, occupational and physical welfare topics\n- Launching virtual support groups where team members in similar situations can share advice as they deal with challenges related to health, parenting, elder care or other circumstances\n- Introducing a virtual daily chat session to give people a place for fun and social connection during their workday\n- Offering a wellness day to all Micron team members, giving them a chance to recharge\n\nWellness is much more than just cardiovascular and physical health. It\u2019s also about mental and emotional well-being. Knowing that resources are just a phone call away has helped team members manage stress from the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nChelsea Brown\nGlobal Well-Being Manager\nProfessional Development\n\nTo attract and retain people with exceptional capabilities, we invest in the ongoing learning and development of our team members, fostering a work environment that inspires creativity, leadership and collaboration.\n\nUsing a \u201clearn and grow\u201d approach, we create an environment where team members and leaders are inspired to grow, empowered to learn and connected to resources and opportunities that nurture personal growth and performance. We encourage them to choose their own development priorities and take initiative in using resources that Micron provides to advance their personal development.\n\nMicron\u2019s primary program for assessing performance and promoting professional development is called Reach Performance. This program encourages higher levels of performance by establishing clear individual performance expectations, supporting team member development and enabling leaders to be better coaches. It begins with setting individual goals through conversations, progresses through periodic check-ins and culminates with feedback and performance analyses. At every step along the way, Micron strives to create a high-performance culture that is motivating and to inspire and empower team members to do their best.\n\nInspiring Team Members to Grow\n\nLearning can take many forms. Team members have access to on-demand training options like web-based learning, workshops and on-site university courses. They can also take technical and business skills training through our internal learning management system and through third-party systems for cultural awareness, personal and professional skills building and industry-relevant research. In addition, a rotational program helps new hires get an in-depth understanding of their functional teams.\n\nTeam members can also access the Micron-TLP Technical Journal, an in-house, peer-reviewed archival journal with articles published by members of the Technical Leadership Program, as well as a variety of technical seminars. Micron\u2019s learning management system allows team members to view courses that have been assigned to them or search the catalog and self-assign items. They can also request or register for instructor-led learning or access online learning. As team members expand their capabilities and become qualified for new roles, our internal job opportunities allow them to grow within the company.\n\nMicron\u2019s CEO, Sanjay Mehrotra, joined over 400 other U.S. companies in signing the Pledge to America\u2019s Workers, which identifies workforce investments that will prepare workers for tomorrow\u2019s job market. As part of the pledge, we have committed to providing approximately 10,000 enhanced career opportunities over the next five years through apprenticeships, work-based learning programs, continuing education, on-the-job training and reskilling. We will not only increase opportunities for existing team members, but we will also prepare students for tomorrow\u2019s careers by implementing new programs and partnerships with educational institutions and creating a scholarship program for underserved populations.\n\nMicron resources are also available to help our team members prepare their educational plans and select programs that further their interests and career development. Micron offers a continuing education program, providing tuition for eligible team members pursuing higher education.\ndegrees, and an education assistance program for those seeking additional industry-related courses and certifications. In 2020, we nearly doubled the continuing education benefit offered to all U.S. team members and expanded the program globally.\n\nTo promote Micron\u2019s goal of enabling the workforce of the future, we launched a new training platform, Micron University, to promote a growth mindset among all team members. As part of Micron University, we introduced a digital skills platform with training on critical technology trends, including artificial intelligence, cloud computing, data science and digital security. Team members can select a training opportunity by level of expertise, and leaders can identify learning opportunities that are relevant for their team members. A skills advisory board assesses the offerings periodically to identify future skill needs and propose solutions for developing them in our workforce.\n\nBy providing participating team members with ownership of their learning process, we foster a productive learning mindset that empowers our people to identify development priorities, find resources to support their development and intentionally engage in new experiences in a meaningful way.\n\n**Encouraging Collaborative Learning**\n\nOur team members learn from and teach one another through feedback, coaching and mentoring, which we view as equally important points on the professional development continuum. We define feedback as observations of how team members perform at a specific point in time, coaching as an exercise in inquiry that helps them reach their potential, and mentoring as a sustained, organic relationship that can help clarify possible new career paths for team members.\n\nWhile we do not offer centralized programs around these types of team member interactions, we are building awareness of their power and allow business functions to develop opportunities that best suit them. For example, we recently launched a virtual coaching platform for a small subset of leaders and developed a course on impact coaching. A training course on best practices for evaluating performance was delivered to more than 5,000 global leaders. We offer a common mentoring playbook that is used across all our professional development possibilities. That handbook, accessible by all team members, is available in English, Simplified and Traditional Chinese, Japanese and Malay.\n\nTo promote collaboration across teams, Micron uses the Emergenetics tool, which encourages team members to actively embrace diversity of thought and behaviors. After filling out a questionnaire, team members receive a profile that gives them greater understanding of their actions at work and at home. Leaders can use their team members\u2019 results to enhance team effectiveness. Since this tool was introduced, more than 14,400 leaders and team members have received their customized profiles. Teams may also participate in in-person or e-learning sessions to learn how to apply profile insights.\nDeveloping Leadership at Every Level\n\nMicron focuses on building capabilities and accelerating the success of leaders at key levels in the company through a model that defines the attributes and capabilities that all leaders need to be successful. It supports current and emerging leaders at key transition points during their careers while also providing learning experiences for continued growth, including feedback, coaching and mentoring. Resources are designed globally and delivered locally, with the majority available in a virtual format in 2020 due to COVID-19. This model, called Micron Leadership Accelerated, includes several key programs.\n\nIgnite\nIgnite is a five-week program for individuals aspiring to move into leadership roles. Ignite exposes these team members to global people leadership expectations and responsibilities prior to committing to a leadership career path. With over 300 participants a year, Micron uses the Ignite program to build our next generation of leaders.\n\nCore Management\nThis program is a mandatory learning experience for new managers either promoted within or hired into Micron. It focuses on managerial and performance fundamentals and covers Micron\u2019s leadership philosophy, behaviors to be successful and leadership styles. Participants walk away with a solid understanding of what it takes to lead effectively at Micron. The migration of the Core Management experience to a virtual platform has increased both the reach and influence of the program.\n\nLeadership Conductor\nThis experience supports leaders of leaders and focuses on self-leadership, team leadership and business leadership. Participants network and learn about enterprise thinking and decision-making through simulated exercises customized to their learning objectives. With 90 completions before being paused for COVID-19, we hope to relaunch this in-person program in the latter part of FY21.\n\nLeadership Circuit\nBuilt with busy Micron leaders in mind, the Leadership Circuit comprises 13 short courses ranging in duration from two to four hours. They are open enrollment and built around topics that leaders can select to address their immediate needs. Focus areas include communication, decision-making, emotional intelligence, growth mindset, coaching and storytelling. These workshops have quickly become our most popular offerings, with almost 2,300 completions in FY20.\n\nLeadership Flash\nContinuing the theme of supporting busy leaders, Leadership Flash is our series of microlearning documents that capture best practices and application guidance on 22 key principles of leadership. Topics include effective one-on-one meetings, leadership of distributed teams, team health, leadership through change, situational leadership and conflict management.\n\nOther Resources\nThe resources available to leaders extend beyond our workshops and self-guided options. A 360-degree leadership assessment was launched in late FY20 to offer leaders a holistic leadership skill assessment and action plan, along with senior and executive leadership coaching. We also offer a suite of resources, both facilitated and self-guided, that smooth leadership transitions at all levels of the organization.\n\nThe leadership circuit course including the tools and framework provided were very useful, comprehensive and interactive. We can apply what we learned in our day-to-day activities to help us become better leaders and better represent Micron values.\u201d\n\nSenior Manager in Sales, India\nCommunities\nWe transform the communities where our team members live and work through our philanthropy and people. Our grants, programs and volunteers focus on promoting human potential through STEM education, basic human needs and equitable opportunities for all.\n\nFor decades, Micron has given back to the communities where our team members live and work. We\u2019ve strengthened this relationship among team members, our communities and our company in recent years by aligning all philanthropic efforts under the Micron Gives program.\n\nUltimately, our giving programs revolve around our corporate value of people. We provide resources and tools to elevate how team members donate time and money to their favorite causes. Micron Gives also inspires the next wave of innovators and educators by developing and funding programs to promote science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education, with a focus on underrepresented groups. Alongside our team members, we also invest in our communities through charitable causes that address basic human needs.\n\nThe Micron Foundation has supported the communities where we live, learn, work and play since 1999. In calendar year 2020, the company\u2019s corporate programs worked together with the foundation to address the challenges that communities faced due to the pandemic and the systemic racial inequalities further magnified by the pandemic. The Micron Foundation doubled its charitable giving, distributing nearly $24 million in grants and funds to match team member contributions. In total, 57% of Micron team members participated in volunteering and giving, raising $4.8 million in team member donations (matched by $8 million from the Micron Foundation) and contributing more than 150,000 volunteer hours to their communities worldwide.\n\nDonations were delivered to charitable organizations worldwide whose missions aligned to Micron\u2019s charitable priorities, with a focus on basic human needs, social justice and education. As part of this response, the Micron Foundation established a $10 million COVID-19 relief fund, which is helping global efforts to promote economic recovery and provide much-needed community resources for food banks, child care, hospitals, school meal plans and online learning resources. Micron also distributed 367,000 masks, 10,000 gloves and 3,000 face shields to health care workers.\n\nMicron accelerated the role and influence of our team members by matching their philanthropic donations two to one. In total, the Micron Foundation contributed $8 million in matching funds \u2014 quadrupling donations from 2019. Throughout the year, more than half of all Micron team members participated by giving either money or time, more than doubling the engagement rate for 2019.\n\nTo advance social justice, Micron, its team members and the Micron Foundation donated more than $1 million to the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. Throughout 2020, Micron continued to deepen our relationships with historically Black colleges and universities and awarded numerous grants to support student success.\nCOVID-19 Response\n\nMicron\u2019s citizenship efforts have always emphasized meeting the basic needs of people in our communities. In 2020, these endeavors focused mainly on responding to the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nIn 2020, the Micron Foundation created a COVID-19 relief fund to address many of the challenges communities faced during this time, including increased demand for medical and personal protective equipment, the transition of workplaces and schools to remote settings, economic insecurity, inadequate access to housing, and hunger.\n\nProtecting Health & Safety\nHealth care-related grants included a donation to Give2Asia, which partnered with leading Chinese public health organizations to protect front-line health workers and hospitals. Our contribution supplied food, lodging and mental health treatment for these front-line workers. The Micron Foundation also funded a research team at the National University of Singapore that is developing an artificial intelligence-based platform for treating infectious diseases like COVID-19. Other significant grants went to Protezione Civile in Italy, the American India Foundation, and Boys and Girls Clubs in Idaho to provide full-day emergency child care for essential workers.\n\nImproving Access to Education\nIn the pandemic\u2019s early months, the Micron Foundation awarded grants to organizations to promote remote learning and distance education, including the Digital Inclusion Fund in Idaho and a number of schools in Italy. The grants tackled multiple problems at once \u2014 both launching online solutions for a large number of students and creating equal access to the internet. These grants continue to help schools and students in communities with Micron facilities where schools are still operating remotely.\n\nProviding Economic Relief\nThe Micron Foundation supported the most vulnerable members of communities through grants to organizations such as the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund for Idaho, the Silicon Valley Community Foundation and the Community Foundation for Northern Virginia, which each provide funds to trusted organizations assisting low-income individuals affected by the crisis. Knowing that the pandemic is disproportionately infecting and killing African Americans, Latinos and other people of color, Micron gave $1 million in grants to nine U.S. organizations that offer key services to minority families, particularly those dealing with poverty or economic loss.\n\nIn addition, team members at Micron\u2019s sites have raised funds for other organizations in their areas. Many of these charities act as umbrella groups, sharing resources with other nonprofits and aid groups in their regions. For example, over 1,000 Taiwanese team members raised NT$8 million (US$267,000 at the time) for the Taiwan Fund for Children and Families\u2019 COVID-19 Home and School Care Project. Their fundraising, matched two to one by Micron, helped 2,500 families and 500 children in need of emergency aid.\n\nSolving Hunger\nAddressing hunger has been a major priority for the COVID-19 relief fund. Grants have included gifts to the Rotary Club of Muar in Malaysia, the Akshaya Patra Foundation in India, and the Idaho Foodbank and Utah Food Bank in the U.S. Additional funding came from our team members. In Singapore, for example, team members donated over 3,500 pounds of food to the Food Bank Singapore, while others participated in the annual Walk for Rice, taking 256 million steps that translated into meals for 7,000 families.\n\nWith equitable opportunity for all as our guide, Micron Gives\u2019 success is measured across our three primary pillars \u2014 creating a culture of giving at Micron, enriching our communities and inspiring learning.\u201d\n\nDee Mooney\nExecutive Director of the Micron Foundation\nSTEM Education Programs\n\nTo be a global leader in memory and storage solutions, Micron relies on its talented scientists and engineers. Cultivating innovators and those who teach them aligns naturally with how and why we give back.\n\nAs we fulfill our overall mission of transforming how the world uses information to enrich life for all, we are increasingly focused on developing STEM pathways that are not only robust but also accessible to a more diverse population.\n\nIn 2018, the Micron Foundation committed $1 million to STEM programs at higher education institutions in Virginia and introduced Virginia diversity and opportunity grants. With a focus on women and underrepresented minorities in science and engineering fields, we have provided 10 grants to date, benefiting more than 50 institutions in Virginia. In 2020, we helped launch Boise State University\u2019s Micron Academy for Inclusive Leadership, a student-led initiative to address social injustice, strengthen leadership skills and build a sense of community for underrepresented students.\n\nDespite the challenges presented by COVID-19, Micron adapted and continued many of its STEM education initiatives, accelerating learning and growth for students throughout the world. Our STEM grants totaled over $5 million in 2020, benefiting more than 600,000 students.\n\nWhile our popular Chip Camp \u2014 a summer camp for young teens \u2014 was canceled due to the pandemic, we quickly pivoted to offer a virtual Tech Camp. The online format allowed us to expand our reach, with approximately 165 students from across the U.S. and Canada taking part. Micron enrolled ethnically and economically diverse participants in the free camp by connecting with Native American tribes in Idaho, the refugee community in Boise, and groups such as the National Center for Children and Families and Techbridge Girls. Camp organizers mailed laptops to children who didn\u2019t have them and then met with each virtually to be sure they were set up correctly.\n\nMicron was also one of few companies to continue its summer internship program, providing valuable summer internships to 205 students from over 60 institutions. In addition, a cross-functional Micron team led a public engineering design challenge to create a more accessible and effective robotic solution for disinfecting rooms with ultraviolet light, which could protect workers against COVID-19. More than 70 designs, including many from university teams, were submitted from around the globe.\n\nMicron also organized other STEM outreach programs and events worldwide over the past year, including some held before the spread of COVID-19:\n\n- Micron interns in Malaysia introduced young women to programming and embedded systems during a collaborative two-day workshop with the Penang Science Cluster in Malaysia.\n- Micron was included on the 2020 Taiwan Railways of Popular Science tour, a STEM-themed train that brings activities to students via a four-day railway tour through Taiwan.\n- The Micron Women\u2019s Leadership Network chapter in Shanghai invited seventh-grade students on-site to learn about Micron and engage in STEM activities.\n- Micron provided funding for hundreds of U.S. students transitioning from elementary to secondary schools to increase their confidence in math and computer science classes.\n- Members of the Micron Young Professionals in China assembled boxes containing educational STEM materials for youth in their area.\n- Micron team members volunteered at the National Taiwan Science Education Center.\n\nMicron - Taoyuan, Taiwan\n\n\u00a9 Micron 2021\nHeart of Micron\n\nMicron team members are passionate about using their time and skills in service of others. These people and their stories were featured in Heart of Micron posts on Micron\u2019s website and intranet. Throughout 2020, many individuals found ways to help their communities stop the spread of COVID-19 and cope with the challenges of isolation. Others, such as these dedicated team members, supported worthy causes such as hunger relief and education.\n\nDaniela Bazzana\nTechnician, Vimercate, Italy\nLeft her job and family for a month to care for patients in Italy\u2019s COVID-19 epicenter\n\nMatt Ulrich\nEngineer, Boise, Idaho\n3D-printed face-shield headbands for health care workers\n\nIris Sun\nCustomer Sales Specialist, Shenzhen, China\nExpedited delivery of ventilators for temporary hospitals in Wuhan\n\nMaxie O\u2019Neill\nSenior Procurement Manager, East Kilbride, Scotland\nSent extra N95 and surgical masks to a nearby hospice\n\nIris Sun\nCustomer Sales Specialist, Shenzhen, China\nExpedited delivery of ventilators for temporary hospitals in Wuhan\n\nAnabil Chaudhuri\nEngineer and Process Owner, Lehi, Utah\nComposed a classical Indian violin song called \u201cMelody of Hope\u201d and performed it for fellow team members\n\nSarah Hunter\nCustomer Sales Specialist, Bracknell, England\nProcured infusion pumps for intensive care units in Germany\n\nDoug Kellis\nEquipment Engineer, Boise, Idaho\nDelivered food to homebound adults\n\nViral Gosalia\nSenior Manager for OEM Sales, Bengaluru, India\nPrepared and delivered food to needy strangers\n\nGaurav Singh\nAlgorithm Characterization Engineer, Hyderabad, India\nHelped the high-risk elderly community order food and supplies from home\n\nDaniela Bazzana\nTechnician, Vimercate, Italy\nLeft her job and family for a month to care for patients in Italy\u2019s COVID-19 epicenter\n\nBryan Roberts\nManager of Manufacturing Central Team Shops, Boise, Idaho\nLed a team that built plexiglass shields for patients to protect medical staff from COVID-19\n\nKathy Radford\nSenior Director of Pricing and Operations, Boise, Idaho\nSecured masks and sanitizer for Metro Meals on Wheels volunteers\n\n\u201cI learned to be grateful for what I might have taken for granted previously.

In FY20, these processes did not identify any significant risks. |\n| 205-2        | Communication and training about anti-corruption policies and procedures | The Micron Code of Business Conduct and Ethics informs team members and business partners about our compliance protocols to avoid corruption. This information is communicated to all of Micron's governance body members, full-time and part-time team members, and contractors via the company intranet and new hire onboarding. As of September 2020, 100% of governance body members and 99% of team members in all of Micron's regions completed an annual certification to abide by the code. Micron's compliance and ethics team also provides live, interactive training sessions on core C&E topics, including anti-corruption. In 2020, more than 1,000 team members attended these live training sessions worldwide. Micron and its subsidiaries expect suppliers to adopt and implement the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) and Micron codes of conduct regardless of local business practices or social customs. Micron's supplier requirements standard communicates code of conduct expectations annually through the training and business reviews. In FY20, all new Micron suppliers received communication on this topic during the onboarding process, which every supplier must agree to as a condition of doing business. |\n| 205-3        | Confirmed incidents of corruption and actions taken | All reports made in good faith are investigated thoroughly and appropriate action is taken in cases that are substantiated.
