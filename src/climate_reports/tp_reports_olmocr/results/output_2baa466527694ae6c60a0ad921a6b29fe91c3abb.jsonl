Our 2022 fiscal year began Oct. 3, 2021, and extended to Oct. 1, 2022.\n\nIn preparing this report, we referenced the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards (2021) and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standards. This report has been prepared in reference to the GRI: Universal Standards. Additional information on Tyson Foods\u2019 policies and programs that support sustainability initiatives is available at tysonfoods.com.\n\nBUILDING A MORE SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEM\n\nAt Tyson Foods, our purpose is to feed a growing world and continually raise expectations for how much good food can do. We\u2019re committed to delivering high-quality protein to billions of people around the world. We also hope to help address issues like food insecurity and hunger by continually working to make protein products that are responsibly produced and affordable. We are further working to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in our supply chain and assess and manage forest degradation risks for select commodities we rely on.\n\nWe take a data-driven approach to sustainability, strengthening our foundations to create a food system that will continue thriving in the years ahead. In 2022, we amplified the actions we\u2019re taking through our sustainability pillars: reimagining our people and community impact, driving product responsibility from farm to table, and working toward sustaining natural resources and achieving net zero. We are continuing that work in 2023.\n# Table of Contents\n\n| 2 | Company and Strategy |\n|---|----------------------|\n| 2 | About This Report    |\n| 4 | A Message from Our CEO |\n| 5 | A Message from Our EVP, CFO |\n| 6 | About Tyson Foods |\n| 7 | Governing Responsibly for the Future |\n| 8 | What Matters to Tyson Foods |\n| 9 | The Formula to Feed the Future |\n| 10 | Our 2030 Goals |\n| 13 | Reimagining Our People and Community Impact |\n| 14 | How We Supported People and Communities |\n| 15 | Supporting Education and Career Development |\n| 17 | Diversity, Equity and Inclusion |\n| 20 | Human Rights and Labor |\n| 21 | Employee Health, Safety and Wellbeing |\n| 23 | Community Investment |\n| 25 | Driving Product Responsibility from Farm to Table |\n| 26 | How We Drove Product Responsibility |\n| 27 | Animal Health and Welfare |\n| 29 | Innovation and Disruptive Technologies |\n| 30 | Product Quality and Safety |\n| 31 | Sustainable Packaging |\n| 33 | Nutrition, Access and Affordability |\n| 35 | Responsibly Managing Natural Resources to Achieve Net Zero |\n| 36 | How We Worked to Sustain Natural Resources |\n| 37 | Climate Action |\n| 39 | A Climate-Smart Future |\n| 41 | Forest Risk Management |\n| 42 | Water |\n| 43 | Waste |\n| 44 | Data Center |\n| 45 | Corporate Metrics |\n| 46 | Food |\n| 46 | Animal Welfare |\n| 47 | Environment |\n| 49 | Workplace |\nWelcome to the Tyson Foods FY2022 sustainability report\u2014the culmination of another year working to make Tyson more sustainable, responsible and innovative.\n\nFrom the humble beginnings of one chicken farmer with a drive to feed his family, to an international company transforming how we feed a growing global community for the future, our story is one of humbly but boldly pursuing infinite possibilities. I\u2019m excited to share the progress we have made against our sustainability ambitions but, just as much, I\u2019m proud to introduce the new ambitions our team members have worked so hard to create\u2014ambitions that will accelerate our work in the years to come.\n\nWe know big, ambitious goals related to systemic challenges require a high level of collaboration. We\u2019re navigating macrotrends that are transforming the future of protein\u2014climate change, finite natural resources, demographic shifts, the imperative of worker and community wellbeing and rising needs and expectations for nutritious, affordable protein. As one of the world\u2019s largest protein providers and a consumer-facing company, our business is centered around strategies that deliver the food consumers love and that create long-term value for our customers, shareholders and other key stakeholders.\n\nTAKING A LOOK BACK\n\nIf we\u2019re going to feed the world, today and in the future, we need to consider new ways of doing business that will improve environmental compliance and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As a member of the World Economic Forum\u2019s Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, I\u2019m proud of Tyson\u2019s ambition to reach net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across global operations and supply chain, including Scope 1, 2 and 3, by 2050. As part of Tyson\u2019s ongoing efforts to manage greenhouse gas emissions and drive climate-smart agricultural practice adoption in our supply chain, we undertook a rigorous data quality exercise in FY2022, and developed our accounting framework and model for GHG emissions of cattle enrolled in our Climate-Smart Beef Program. Ensuring our data is of the highest possible quality enables us to not only track our progress against our science-based targets and net zero by 2050 ambition, but also work to provide data to our customers and incentivize farmers and ranchers to adopt practices that have been shown to have reduced emissions. These efforts will continue with a re-validation of our targets in adherence to Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) criteria.\n\nThroughout FY2022, we also made significant strides to support the people that make our business possible: our diverse workforce of passionate, talented team members. We invested $300 million in wage increases for our hourly workforce in the United States. We allocated $60 million to partner with social impact company Guild to expand our Upward Academy program, resulting in team members gaining access to more than 175 programs from more than 35 universities and learning providers.\n\nAnd, because we recognize the importance of welcoming diverse voices to the conversation\u2014and then supporting them when they arrive\u2014we have dedicated over $2.4 million since 2020 to support the path to U.S. citizenship for immigrant employees. As a partner in the Tent Coalition for Refugees, we also committed to hiring more than 2,500 refugees over three years in the United States. To help alleviate hunger, Tyson committed $2.5 million to address food insecurity by partnering with Feeding America\u00ae member food banks, and we continue to find ways to donate and divert our products from becoming food waste. We are proud to say that seven of our U.S. plants now hold gold-level Zero Waste to Landfill validation, as well as one plant with silver-level Zero Waste to Landfill validation.\n\nThrough it all we recentered our focus on driving product responsibility from farm to table. For example, to inspire shared responsibility for animals in our supply chain, we launched Tyson\u2019s first Animal Welfare Awareness Week, emphasizing our dedication to ensuring that animals in our supply chain are provided appropriate care.\n\nLOOKING FORWARD\n\nEvery day, we are working to provide better, more nutritious protein options to the people we serve. Now, as we look to the future, we\u2019re setting a new course for sustainability, reimagining our social impact and designing responsibility into products from the get-go.\n\nIn collaboration with our Enterprise Leadership Team, I was pleased to present our new strategic sustainability goals to our Board this year, setting new priorities that will guide Tyson\u2019s efforts into 2023 and beyond. Since FY2021, the Company\u2019s Executive Incentive Plan has included certain \u201cPeople Goals\u201d performance modifiers to promote and reward behaviors in support of diversity, equity and inclusion, health and safety, and talent development, ensuring accountability for our People Goals across the business. I look forward to seeing as we\u2014together with our suppliers, partners, and employees\u2014continue to find increasingly sustainable ways to Feed the Future.\n\nDonnie King\nPresident & CEO\nTyson Foods\nAt Tyson, we are continuously working to support the communities where we live and work and ensure our products are responsibly produced. We see ourselves as a catalyst in creating a food system that is more sustainable and equitable for future generations. And partnerships now and in the future will be key to our success.\n\nThe landscape of sustainability is constantly changing, and we are committed to evolving our strategy to keep pace. In FY2022, we once again revisited our priorities and refreshed our sustainability strategy, the Formula to Feed the Future. We are proud to announce the launch of our 2030 long-range strategy. Enterprise-wide, cross-functional teams led by senior leaders shaped our new goals, embedded in our business. We are excited to develop and expand initiatives that will now help us focus and invest in our key priorities to achieve our timebound goals, creating value for both our business and society.\n\nOur team members are the foundation for everything we do at Tyson Foods and we are committed to taking the best possible care of our people. And, through our commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI), we are also ensuring a culture of respect and acceptance where every team member is equally empowered to thrive and advance within the company.\n\nCaring for our people doesn\u2019t mean only looking after our direct workforce; it means taking steps to care for the people and communities in our value chain. That starts with taking steps to evaluate and address human rights risks and continues with finding more and better ways to give back to the communities we call neighbors.\n\nAs part of our mission to improve the accessibility and affordability of nutritious food, we want to expand delivery of fresh protein to even more people with our partners\u2014especially in areas of food scarcity. In the coming years, we also aim to improve the nutritional profile of our core branded portfolio\u2014ensuring more products qualify as a good source of protein and complying with the FDA\u2019s sodium guardrails.\n\nWe know that to create a more sustainable food system, we need to look far beyond Tyson\u2019s walls. We recognize the need for market-based solutions to address GHG emissions in our protein value chain. Being advised by scientists from the Environmental Defense Fund on nitrogen management and The Nature Conservancy on grazing practices has enabled us to create a novel program to reduce GHG emissions from pasture to production: Climate-Smart Beef. With the support of scientists, suppliers and other industry partners, we have developed a robust model to calculate the GHG emissions of select beef products, from pasture to production, and work with supply chain partners to adopt agricultural practices with reduced emissions. And in our feed supply chains, we aim to accelerate the adoption of climate-smart farming practices across millions of acres of crops, in ways that we hope will also improve farmer livelihoods and support underserved producer communities. We plan to grow and scale our Climate-Smart Beef Program and row crop work through Tyson\u2019s participation in USDA\u2019s Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities grant program, for which Tyson was selected as an award recipient and is in the final stages of grant award negotiation. We are also exploring how this work can help our key customers meet their own ambitious climate targets, and we invite them to join our growing dialogue.\n\nThrough strategic investments, we believe we can find creative solutions to advance progress towards our 2030 sustainability ambitions. Staying the course on sustainability is more important now than ever. We invite you to join us and our partners as we work to lead a transformation in global food systems.\n\nJohn Randal Tyson\nExecutive Vice President & CFO, CSO\nTyson Foods\nTyson Foods is one of the world\u2019s largest food companies and a recognized leader in protein. We seek to leverage our scale and influence to make the highest quality protein more sustainable and accessible worldwide.\n\n**OUR BUSINESS IN NUMBERS**\n\n- **$36.8B** Total Assets\n- **$53B** FY2022 Sales\n- **$108M** R&D Spend\n- **142K** Employees\n- **140** Countries\n\n**SALES BY SEGMENT**\n\n- Beef 36%\n- Chicken 32%\n- Prepared Foods 18%\n- Pork 10%\n- International/Other 4%\n\n**SALES BY DISTRIBUTION**\n\n- Retail 44%\n- Foodservice 29%\n- International 15%\n- Industrial/Other 12%\n\n**GLOBAL WORKFORCE**\n\n- U.S. 87%\n- Outside of U.S. 13%\n\n**TOTAL INDEPENDENT FARMERS**\n\n- Grain 11,345\n- Chicken 3,865\n- Cattle 2,896\n- Hog 919\n- Turkey 89\n\n**A YEAR IN ESG ACHIEVEMENTS**\n\n- Zero Waste to Landfill Validation: Seven gold-level sites and one silver-level site\n- North American Meat Institute\u2019s Environmental Recognition Awards: 44 sites\n- Clean Water Awards: Three awards across U.S. poultry and egg sites\n- Wastewater And Pretreatment Awards and Recognition: Five sites\n- Alliance for Water Stewardship Certification at three sites: Finney County, Seguin, North Richlands Hills\n- NWEA Gold Safety Award and WEF Burke Award: Lexington plant\n- McDonald\u2019s Global Supplier of the Year Award\n- Fortune\u2019s #1 Most Admired Company (Food Production Category): Sixth consecutive year\n\n---\n\n1.

U.S.-based poultry, livestock and grain supply partners.\nThe global landscape of food production is evolving rapidly. At Tyson Foods, we aim to meet protein needs while continuously raising the bar on our sustainability strategy by considering the changing landscape in our Formula to Feed the Future and 2030 goals. A structure of governance and accountability is key to achieving this.\n\n**OUR APPROACH**\n\nOur efforts to grow responsibly help us better serve all our stakeholders. Accurate trend forecasting is integral to our future as a leading global protein producer. For example, by using the latest climate science, we plan to find opportunities to innovate our own practices in an effort to reach science-based targets for greenhouse gas reductions, and help advance industry thinking on important issues and trends.\n\nIn this context, ESG is no exception. In fact, it is a priority for Tyson Foods, embedded at the highest level of our company\u2019s governance\u2014our Board of Directors (Board)\u2014and supported by our Enterprise Leadership Team (ELT). It is a standing item on governance meetings, with key updates reviewed once a quarter.\n\nThroughout 2022, we further expanded our communication on ESG initiatives. For example, the Chief Sustainability Officer (John R. Tyson until September 2022) and VP of Sustainability produced a quarterly report to communicate our progress to create a long-term strategy.\n\n**ESG OVERSIGHT**\n\nOverall ESG oversight sits with our Board and its committees, which include:\n\n- Audit Committee.\n- Compensation and Leadership Development Committee.\n- Executive Committee.\n- Governance and Nominating Committee (Risk Committee).\n- Strategy and Acquisitions Committee.\n\nOur president and chief executive officer (CEO) leads Tyson\u2019s ESG approach. The Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (EVP-CFO, CSO), John R. Tyson, leads our sustainability strategy teams, reporting regularly to our CEO and the Governance and Nominating Committee of Tyson\u2019s Board of Directors.\n\nThe EVP-CFO is supported by a team of professionals who facilitate progress toward our ESG goals. Our CEO and EVP-CFO work with Tyson\u2019s ELT and senior leadership to oversee our ESG strategy, including communications, disclosures and reporting.\n\nOur Ethics, Compliance and Legal team handles all disclosures related to governance. For more information about our Board and corporate governance practices, visit Investor Relations at tysonfoods.com or refer to our FY2022 Proxy Statement.\n\n**GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS**\n\nAs well as driving sustainability internally, we routinely engage with policymakers and other government officials on issues that matter to Tyson Foods and our stakeholders. During 2022, we advocated and lobbied on various issues, including, for example, energy permitting, agricultural standards, labor issues and childcare, water and packaging developments, immigration issues and animal care.\nFrom discussions with our stakeholders, we know they expect a long-term commitment to sustainability from Tyson Foods. We are therefore continually working to tailor our approach to the topics that matter most, taking into consideration the evolving global food landscape and changing factors.\n\nTo better understand the ESG topics that are most important to our stakeholders, in 2021 we conducted an extensive materiality assessment. Through it we engaged a broad group of stakeholders to understand their priority issues.\n\n**TYSON\u2019S ESG MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT PROCESS**\n\nOur materiality assessment followed four defined steps:\n\n1. **Engage with Stakeholders:**\n   We identified several core stakeholder groups for engagement: senior leaders, employees (both salaried and hourly), customers, consumers, investors, suppliers, government, academics, and NGOs and industry associations.\n\n2. **Identify Issues:**\n   With inputs from industry peers, ESG ratings and standards organizations, a media scan and our own enterprise risk management, we defined 20 potentially material ESG issues.\n\n3. **Prioritize Issues:**\n   We conducted 36 interviews and collected more than 7,500 survey responses across all 10 stakeholder groups. Based on the feedback, we ordered our material topics according to key stakeholder priorities and specific consideration for our customer viewpoints and needs.\n\n4. **Build and Validate Our Materiality Matrix:**\n   We combined survey and interview inputs to develop a materiality matrix which illustrates each issue\u2019s importance to both Tyson Foods and our stakeholders.\n\n**VISUALIZING OUR MATERIAL ISSUES**\n\nThe resulting materiality matrix reflects our understanding of a wide range of ESG issues and how we are responding to stakeholder feedback. We used it to identify issues that our internal working groups\u2014groups established to develop ambitious ESG goals and actions\u2014will address in the coming years.\n\nOur material issues are closely interconnected, and we are working to establish appropriate key performance indicators and goals. During our 2021 assessment, three issue areas were identified as being of primary importance to Tyson Foods and our stakeholders:\n\n- Animal health and welfare.\n- The wellbeing and talent of our team members.\n- Stewardship of natural resources.\n\nEach of these three areas is critical to the future of our business as, to succeed in a global marketplace, we must be the employer and protein source of choice. For this reason, these three primary issue areas are also reflected in the three pillars of our Formula to Feed the Future strategy.\n\n**Key:**\n- Environmental\n- Social\n- Governance/other\n\n---\n\n3 In the context of our ESG materiality assessment, material issues are defined as those issues at Tyson that have the potential for positive and negative repercussions but for which no formal monetary threshold has been applied or determined.\nTo build a more sustainable food system for the future, we need to take a targeted approach to enhancing how we operate.\n\nWe recognize that, in today\u2019s world, food companies must keep pace with population growth and increased food demand while also managing climate risks and opportunities. This includes, in part, engaging supply chain partners on solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while innovating to deliver products that are produced responsibly, address nutrition insecurity and meet evolving consumer preferences.\n\nWe have refreshed our ESG strategy, the Formula to Feed the Future, with recognition and input from stakeholders across our value chain. Formula to Feed the Future is a cohesive, long-term, enterprise-wide plan which is embedded in our growth strategy and was developed against a backdrop of global food system pressures.\n\nCONTINUOUSLY EVOLVING OUR PLAN\n\nThe Formula to Feed the Future was developed to help drive progress on our disclosures and performance on priorities identified through our materiality assessment process. However, the ESG landscape is in constant flux, and we want to ensure our strategy evolves in line with the latest available science and in consideration of current market and food system factors. That\u2019s why we built on our existing goals, launching a holistic enterprise-wide 2030 plan with a new, comprehensive set of sustainability goals.\n\nDEVELOPING OUR GOALS\n\nWe\u2019ve worked hard to rally around the issues that were identified as priorities during our materiality assessment. The goals and ambitions in our 2030 plan were developed by evolving working groups comprising leaders and team members from cross-functional teams and business units, and with oversight and involvement from senior leadership. We considered how each new goal could help us further integrate sustainability principles into everything we do.\n\nOther key factors included stakeholder insights from our materiality assessment, ESG trends, expectations of ESG raters and standard-setters, best-in-class goals set by other companies, and Tyson\u2019s current initiatives in priority areas. We also incorporated input from key partners such as suppliers where relevant. Our work was guided by an ESG advisory services firm, Corporate Citizenship, that provided guidance in the process.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve established our 2030 goals, we are mobilizing stakeholders to build momentum behind our Formula to Feed the Future strategy.\n\nAll of which is underpinned by a strong foundation of corporate governance, business ethics, supply chain management, and data privacy and cybersecurity.\nREIMAGINING OUR PEOPLE AND COMMUNITY IMPACT\n\nGOAL 1\nBy 2030, 100% of locations with >250 team members will have access to programs covering healthy workplace meals, nutrition education and health check-ups.\n\nGOAL 2\nBy 2030, 100% of Tyson\u2019s plants will be rated at or above the risk-prevention level on Tyson\u2019s Safety Risk Profile based on leading indicators for building a safety culture.\n\nGOAL 3\nBy 2030, improve the wellbeing of frontline team members through workplace design enhancements in all Tyson plants.\n\nGOAL 4\nBy 2027, develop and deploy a supply chain management approach to Responsible Sourcing, which helps to identify, assess and mitigate ESG and human rights related risks and enable more sustainable sourcing for our business.\n\nGOAL 5\nBy 2030, double small and diverse supplier spend from our baseline of Q3\u2013Q4 2022 and Q1\u2013Q2 2023.\n\nGOAL 6\nAchieve and sustain pay equity for our team members by conducting regular pay equity reviews.\n\nGOAL 7\nBy 2030, achieve diverse composition of Tyson\u2019s Board of Directors by broadening Board recruitment efforts to include consideration of more diverse candidates, with attention to ensuring our Board has individuals with diverse experiences, backgrounds, beliefs and lifestyles.\n\nGOAL 8\nBy 2030, achieve diverse representation in senior leadership by broadening recruitment and development efforts to include consideration of more diverse candidates, with attention to ensuring leadership is represented by individuals having diverse experiences, backgrounds, beliefs and lifestyles.\n\nDIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION (DEI)\nAlongside our people and community goals, we have set a vision for the future of DEI at Tyson Foods. We aim for Tyson\u2019s \u201cCulture of Caring\u201d to honor every team member in unique, meaningful and impactful ways, empowering each of us to profitably grow our business and thrive in our careers through our commitment to DEI.\n\nWhen done well, this will attract, develop and retain top talent while delivering the necessary innovation needed to win with consumers and customers. Our success will be measured by our engagement and how we honor one another.\nOUR 2030 GOALS\n\nDRIVING PRODUCT RESPONSIBILITY FROM FARM TO TABLE\n\nNUTRITION, ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\n\nGOAL 1\nImprove nutritional profile of core branded portfolio:\n\u2022 At least 85% of protein-centric products (not including bakery or bacon) will qualify for at least a good source of protein by 2030.\n\u2022 75% of our products will be in compliance with the 2021 FDA sodium guardrails by 2030.\n\nGOAL 2\nIncrease transparency of product nutrition through efforts to ensure accurate and clear information is provided on labels regarding food sourcing, ingredient lists, nutritional information and allergens.\n\nGOAL 3\nExpand delivery of fresh protein to more consumers, team members and communities\u2014especially those in areas of food scarcity\u2014by leveraging channel partners and production locations.\n\nPACKAGING\n\nGOAL 5\nDesign all Tyson Foods branded products\u2019 packaging to be recyclable, home compostable or reusable by 2030.\n\nGOAL 6\nIdentify strategic partnerships with industry organizations and stakeholders to facilitate infrastructure changes needed to improve circularity of packaging and packaging-related components.\n\nGOAL 4\nInvest in resources to help schools and communities increase availability, awareness and affordability of culturally appropriate products through product innovation and culinary insights.\nWORKING TOWARD SUSTAINING NATURAL RESOURCES AND ACHIEVING NET ZERO\n\n---\n\n**GOAL 1**\nSubmit Science Based Target (SBT) for revalidation within the required time frame, based on updated guidance from the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi), including setting a Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) target for land-based emissions reductions and removals.\n\n---\n\n**GOAL 2**\nBy 2030, establish a pathway to using 50% renewable electricity (purchased and self-generated) across domestic operations.\n\n---\n\n**GOAL 3**\nReduce carbon emissions in our protein value chain:\n- Verify sustainable beef production practices on >5 million acres of U.S. cattle-grazing land by 2025.\n- Conduct an updated, enterprise-wide Forest Risk Assessment, with consideration of emerging international laws, and use the assessment to reassess deforestation goals and country-specific commodity action plans.\n\n---\n\n**GOAL 4**\nExpand Climate-Smart Row Crop Practices:\n- Support climate-smart practices on 25% of acres needed to raise grains to feed our birds by 2025\u2014with efforts to purchase 100% of our feed ingredients from suppliers engaged in climate-smart practices by 2030.\n\n---\n\n**GOAL 5**\nBy 2025, develop Contextual Water Plans at 11 of our high-risk locations in the U.S.\n- By 2025, re-evaluate process for managing water-related risks in operations and communities where we operate, with consideration of emerging water risk management frameworks, stakeholder input on assessing and managing risks in water-stressed locations, and available tools to determine true cost of water.\nWith the help of our hardworking team members\u2014all 142,000 of them working at over 400 facilities, offices, hatcheries and distribution centers globally\u2014Tyson Foods is feeding the next generation and beyond.\n\nPeople are central to all we do at Tyson Foods, and we aim to attract and retain the best talent. To achieve this and enable our people to reach their full potential, we offer a range of family- and wellness-focused benefits programs. This includes health care and opportunities for team members to develop their work and life skills beyond Tyson.\n\nMost of our team members work at facilities and processing plants throughout the U.S., but they represent countries from around the world. A culture of DEI is central to how we empower our team members and create a sense of belonging. Nurturing and developing every single one of our people is a top priority, which is why, in 2022, Tyson worked hard to fill over 16% of open positions with internal candidates and welcomed 62,178 new hires.\n\nWe know being a good employer means taking steps to support our team members in their personal lives as well as their professional ones\u2014including, for example, assistance with securing childcare, a step that can also help clear a barrier to work attendance. It\u2019s why we are piloting three different childcare programs to determine the most appropriate role for a global protein leader to support its workers. It is our hope that by helping team members with childcare, Tyson will stabilize its workforce and better prepare children for school.\n\nBeyond our facilities, we extend support to refugees, partner with thousands of independent local farmers and ranchers, and aid community initiatives for hunger relief. By putting people first, we continue to grow Tyson\u2019s business while supporting our team members and communities to thrive.\nHOW WE SUPPORTED\nPEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES\n\n\u2014 Invested over $100 million in wage increases to our hourly workforce\n\u2014 Hosted enterprise-wide team member engagement survey in June 2022 with a high engagement score of 77\n\u2014 Scaled and expanded Upward Academy virtually, in partnership with Guild. Upward Academy Online fully funds educational opportunities for U.S. team members\n\u2014 18 million pounds of protein donated to food banks, pantries and hunger relief organizations\n\u2014 28% women in management positions\n\u2014 Recognized by Together We Grow for our commitment to promoting diversity and inclusion in the food and agriculture industry\n\u2014 Committed $1.5 million in FY2022, through the Tyson Immigration Partnership, to help immigrant employees from 160 countries acquire U.S. citizenship\n\u2014 Piloting three childcare programs to determine the best way to remove attendance barriers for our workforce that are caused by a lack of childcare options, and better prepare children for school\nWe\u2019re committed to providing support for our team members with a variety of programs and a holistic benefits package so they can thrive inside and outside of the workplace.\n\nOur goal is to be the most sought-after place to work in the food industry. To get there, we\u2019re investing in our people with training opportunities and skills development that help them meet their professional aspirations. Twice-yearly performance appraisals reinforce continuous growth, with valuable feedback that helps employees and managers engage on annual efforts to deliver against personal development goals and help our people meet their objectives.\n\n**215**\n\nDuring summer 2022, we hosted 215 interns across U.S. locations, training the next generation of food industry innovators and leaders.\n\n**LANGUAGE CENTER OF EXPERTISE**\n\nIn September 2022, we launched our very own language center of expertise (LCOE), which supports team member access to all of Tyson\u2019s benefits and services through multi-language communication and outreach.\n\nThe LCOE provides a centralized hub for language and culture information, with access to translation, consultation and video resources to ensure all team members can thrive in their career journey and feel a sense of belonging at Tyson Foods. This program continues to scale, with plans underway to expand services, including on-demand access to remote interpreters, document translation, cultural consultation and in-language training videos.\n\n**SIX YEARS OF UPWARD ACADEMY**\n\n2022 marked the sixth anniversary of Upward Academy\u2014our adult education program designed to help team members develop important life skills. On-site, face-to-face classes are now available across 50 Tyson locations, with options like English as a second language, high school equivalency, U.S. citizenship, and financial and digital literacy. We also expanded our services with an in-plant career development pathway called Upward Academy IET. Supported by external adult education providers and community colleges, the pathway provides frontline team members with job skills training and workforce certifications at no cost.\n\nIn July 2022, we partnered with Guild to further expand Upward Academy virtually. Upward Academy Online fully funds educational opportunities for U.S. team members and offers them free of charge. The certifications our team members can earn range from short courses to associate, bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees. Tyson Foods has committed $60 million for the program over the next four years. It is available to all U.S.-based team members from day one of employment.\n\n**PREPARING LEADERS FOR THE FUTURE**\n\nTo be as effective as possible, we need to equip our leaders with the knowledge to take Tyson and our workforce into the future. NEXT is our agile development opportunity, created for select leaders, that builds leadership skills through business scenarios, networking opportunities and increased organizational knowledge of Tyson. The program helps our leaders accelerate their adaptability and preparedness for changing business landscapes. Each participant is paired with an internal coach from Tyson\u2019s director and vice president teams. These coaches provide tailored support and feedback to drive participant development.\n\nParticipants are 26% more likely to be promoted internally, while 33% of those who complete NEXT have been selected for stretch roles or roles that represent an increase in job scope. This stronger leadership pipeline helps foster greater engagement and retention rates, increased coaching capabilities and a strong, seasoned coaching culture.\nHELPING IMMIGRANTS FIND A SENSE OF HOME\n\nTyson Foods is a place where anyone can find a home, no matter where you come from. To support this, since 2020, we have invested over $2.4 million in supporting immigrant team members to transition to life in the U.S.\n\nIn particular, we employ interpreters, community liaisons and chaplains to guide immigrants through the process, alongside our free English as a second language and citizenship classes. We have also funded free legal and citizenship services, helping hundreds of team members become citizens, and thousands more get counseling on immigration issues.\n\nWe support our team members because it\u2019s the right thing to do. We were honored to have this dedication recognized with the prestigious 2022 \u2018Keepers of the American Dream\u2019 award from the National Immigration Forum for being an advocate for immigrants in the workforce.\n\nTHE TENT COALITION FOR REFUGEES\n\nIn September 2021, Tyson Foods\u2014alongside 32 other major companies\u2014announced our participation in the Tent Coalition for Refugees (Tent). In 2022, we built on this commitment at Tent\u2019s U.S. Business Summit on Refugees.\n\nDuring the event, 45 participating companies committed to collectively hiring more than 22,000 refugees over the next three years. Tyson alone committed to hire 2,500 refugees over three years in the United States\u2014reaching 1,300 refugee hires by the end of 2022.\nOur workforce represents up to 159 distinct nationalities with more than 59 distinct languages spoken across our facilities. We recognize the power in this diversity and are committed to nurturing it, creating an inclusive company where team members feel unconditionally welcomed.\n\n**EMBEDDING DEI**\n\nWe believe DEI is a key differentiator\u2014one that enables us to realize our vision and mission and, in the process, increase shareholder value. Our commitment to DEI not only drives innovations that positively impact product development, our marketing strategy, and customer engagement; it also informs how we value one another.\n\nTo embed DEI across our company, we started with encouraging our business units and Human Resources leaders to adopt more inclusive hiring practices. This is led by Tyson\u2019s Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer, Paul Davis, with support from senior leadership.\n\nIn 2022, we refreshed our DEI website\u2014an online hub where our diverse stakeholder base can learn about, and share in, our commitment to foster a safe, inclusive workplace. The site also highlights the engagement and impact Tyson team members make in our enterprise and in our communities.\n\n**Recruitment**\n\nWe know nurturing the diversity of our workforce is our strength. It allows us to innovate and bring unique offerings to our customers, while building better relationships with customers, consumers and suppliers. We engage with military, LGBTQ+, civil rights and educational organizations as part of our recruitment strategy.\n\nInclusively Engaging Top Talent\n\nTo attract diverse talent, our talent acquisition team partners with many educational and community organizations, such as the National Urban League. The league is a nonpartisan historic civil rights organization that advocates for economic and social justice for African Americans and against racial discrimination in the U.S. We have also partnered with the Thurgood Marshall College Fund to ensure a more equitable talent pipeline.\n\nAdditionally, in 2022, we engaged with several Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) for internships and recruitment, including Prairie View A&M University, South Carolina State University and Tuskegee University.\n\nCreating Pathways to the Workplace\n\nWe continue to support military veterans in our hiring processes. This includes, in part, a focus on expanding our reach across the U.S. through leveraging technologies such as HirePurpose\u00ae. And, with our latest sourcing and talent attraction tool, we are connecting industry-leading companies with diverse job seekers. The platform was initially for transitioning military job seekers only, but we are now also leveraging it to source additional talent from diverse backgrounds.\n\n**DRIVING DIVERSITY FROM THE TOP**\n\nIn a bid to drive more inclusive recruitment, we incorporated considerations for candidate diversity into our leadership\u2019s annual incentive plan score card, which encourages interviewing of diverse candidates by hiring teams. As such, while we continue to employ diverse recruitment practices, our 2022 data appears lower than the previous year.\n\n86% of open Director Level and Above roles included diversity candidate consideration during the interview process in FY2022\n\n92% of Director Level and Above Open roles included diversity candidate consideration during the interview process in FY2021\nFOSTERING INCLUSIVITY AND TEAM MEMBER ENGAGEMENT\n\nTyson is committed to creating a culture of safety, belonging and empowerment for all. Our \u201cCulture of Caring\u201d honors every team member in unique, meaningful and impactful ways. It empowers everyone to join in profitably growing our business and to thrive in their careers through a commitment to DEI.\n\nAs an equal opportunity/affirmative action employer in the U.S., our policies comply with all federal, state and local employment laws.\n\nBusiness Resource Groups\n\nOur Business Resource Groups (BRGs) are volunteer, team member-led groups, which help Tyson celebrate the unique cultures of our team members and inform our DEI strategy. BRGs offer internal network opportunities, attract diverse team members, provide space to promote innovative ideas and solutions and create opportunities for mentoring and career development.\n\nCurrently we have eight BRGs, actively engaging in our enterprise and in our communities.\n\nIn 2022, we enhanced the governance of our BRGs by developing a BRG Governance and Structure Guide, which outlines how BRGs form and operate at Tyson. While BRGs are led by our team members, they receive support from various internal functions, including:\n\n- DEI executive council which ensures alignment with the BRG Governance Structure.\n- Office of DEI which champions BRGs and their needs.\n- DEI employee council which helps develop plans to execute the company\u2019s DEI priorities, goals and strategies.\n- Executive sponsors from within the senior business leadership team.\n\nSkills and Inclusivity Training\n\nKey to developing a culture of shared DEI ownership is ensuring our team members understand pressing current issues and how they can help develop a more inclusive Tyson Foods. In 2023, we delivered a variety of voluntary DEI training, including:\n\n- Neuroleadership Day of Learning featuring Joshin, a company that provides comprehensive solutions for disability and neurodivergence support in the workplace.\n- Anti-racist Leadership, a fireside chat hosted by our CFO, John Randal Tyson, sponsored by our African Ancestry Alliance Business Resource Group, to discuss the role leaders have to address racism in corporate America.\n- Women in Leadership Panel: Celebrating and Embracing Allyship, a panel event hosted by our Women\u2019s Business Resource Group that featured some of our female Board of Directors and Executive Leadership Team, providing team members with an opportunity to learn collectively and develop professionally.\n\nWe also commenced work to establish a platform that will host required DEI/inclusivity training for new and existing team members.\n\nExpanding Accessibility\n\nIn 2022, Tyson introduced Joshin, an in-house vendor partner for disability and neurodiversity support. This has created a safe place for employees to self-disclose and get confidential support while also establishing a pathway to disability and neurodivergence training. It\u2019s just one more way we\u2019re showing we value team members of all abilities, championing how our differences are our strengths.\nCompensation and Benefits\n\nTo maintain our culture of safety and belonging, we make consistent efforts to enhance our compensation and benefits offerings.\n\nWe have designated lactation areas to support mothers at our corporate and plant locations and continuously evaluate opportunities to add more lactation facilities. In 2022, we also enhanced our paid parental leave, providing eight weeks\u2019 leave for team members who are primary parents, and two weeks for those who are secondary parents. All team members who work on a regular, full-time basis are eligible for this benefit after one year of service.\n\nTo care for our people in their times of need, we have a $10,000 lifetime maximum travel assistance benefit to ensure team members who are unable to access an abortion, or who require gender-affirming care, can obtain transport, lodging and meals associated with their medical needs.\n\nLearn more about our benefits.\n\nSUPPLIER DIVERSITY PROGRAM\n\nOur supplier diversity program provides economic opportunities for diverse suppliers by stimulating growth through spend and engagement with small and diverse suppliers. In 2022, we dedicated full-time resources to supplier diversity, with oversight from senior leadership to develop a stronger framework for this process.\n\nAlso, throughout the year, our procurement team:\n\n\u2022 Began the intensive process of cleaning and classifying our supplier data to understand supply chain makeup and inform growth strategies.\n\u2022 Added requirements to our internal procurement policy for good faith efforts and the inclusion of diverse suppliers when engaging in sourcing activities.\n\u2022 Increased engagement with diverse supplier certification agencies.\n\u2022 Started a monthly Diverse Supplier Spotlight Series.\n\nSupplier Inclusion Summit\n\nThe supplier diversity team includes procurement team members and leaders, as well as representatives from our DEI teams. In March 2022, our supplier diversity team began planning our Supplier Inclusion Summit, which took place on June 20, 2023. The summit began with an evening reception hosted by Tyson leadership and included a full day of networking opportunities with company leadership, matchmaking between suppliers for enhanced partnerships, supplier enrichment sessions and a featured panel discussion with leaders from Tyson customers.\n\nThe summit provided the opportunity for impactful conversations on the importance of building and nurturing a diverse supply chain. The event supports our efforts to build a robust supplier diversity program that is aligned with Tyson\u2019s values while delivering on our core strategies of winning with customers, consumers and team members.\n\nFor small and diverse suppliers, the summit was a chance to learn about opportunities with Tyson and enrich strategic relationships with other suppliers. For non-diverse suppliers, the summit let them connect with diverse suppliers and Tyson stakeholders who may be able to support their needs.\n\nOur suppliers are encouraged to provide opportunities such as Tier 2 relationships that enable diverse suppliers to build capacity.\n\nSUPPORTING DIVERSE COMMUNITIES\n\nAs a protein company that employs a global workforce dedicated to feeding the world, our philanthropic efforts center on two key areas:\n\n\u2022 Food access and nutrition\n\u2022 Immigrant and refugee support and resettlement\n\nIn 2022, we donated $250,000 through our Asian American and Pacific Islander grants to the following groups: Arkansas Coalition of Marshallese, National Association of Asian American Professionals, Family Support Services, Asian Americans Advancing Justice | Chicago, and Ethnic Minorities of Burma Advocacy and Resource Center. These donations were part of a larger $500,000 commitment to Stop Asian Hate, which was an initiative that Tyson\u2019s executive leadership team supported by allowing grant allocations to be led by the Asians & Allies BRG.\n\nWe also invested $1 million to support equitable hunger relief in local communities through our investment in Feeding America\u00ae\u2019s Multi-Donor Equitable Food Access Fund. This funding will be distributed in the form of grants to food banks that serve people living in rural areas and communities of color disproportionately impacted by hunger.\n\nIn 2022, Tyson Foods became a member of the Women\u2019s Business Enterprise National Council to increase resource sharing and our visibility of supplier networks.\nEnsuring people are treated with dignity and respect is essential to our business.\n\nTyson Foods strives to uphold the highest ethical standards and practices in all we do, across our operations. Our Core Values, Code of Conduct, Team Behaviors and Team Member Promise guide our behaviors and those of our team members. We reinforce these behaviors through internal communication and annual compliance training.\n\nAs well as our Code of Conduct, we maintain a dedicated Global Anti-Corruption Policy, which establishes our expectations around maintaining ethical and integrity standards. It also details the steps we expect anyone working on our behalf to follow to prevent instances of corruption and bribery, as well as the training all team members complete to ensure ongoing compliance.\n\nGLOBAL HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY\n\nWe maintain a Global Human Rights Policy, which is discussed in more detail in our Global Human Rights and Modern Slavery Statement. Our Global Human Rights policy applies to all team members, our Board of Directors, Tyson subsidiaries and the joint ventures over which we have majority ownership.\n\nTyson\u2019s human rights initiatives are spearheaded by a cross-functional Human Rights Steering Committee, which is led by a delegate of our Chief Compliance Officer and includes key input and participation from our business operations. The Steering Committee\u2019s goal is to support Tyson in its development, execution and continuous improvement of human rights matters and issues. The Steering Committee also supports initiatives relating to human rights, including, but not limited to, development of policies and procedures, conducting human rights assessments, and reporting on human rights matters, such as communications, goals, and metrics.\n\nWe maintain policies and practices that follow the human rights principles set forth in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. We are also signatories of the Department of Transportation (DOT) Transportation Leaders Against Human Trafficking pledge.\n\nRespecting Team Members\u2019 Rights\n\nTo be an employer of choice, it is vital all employees are informed about and empowered to act on their rights. We post clear, conspicuous notices of our team members\u2019 workplace rights in prominent, high-traffic locations in all facilities, including cafeterias, break rooms, hallways and hiring centers to maximize visibility. Versions of our team members\u2019 rights are available in multiple languages to help employees navigate any language barriers.\n\nIn addition to enhancing team member awareness, we also respect team members\u2019 right to choose whether they want to engage in collective bargaining. Currently, 32 Tyson locations are represented under active collective bargaining agreements.\n\nETHICS AND COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS\n\nTo support accountability and transparency, we maintain a 24-hour, multilingual Ethics Line where team members can voice ethics complaints or concerns about employment practices, harassment and discrimination, management and more. Team members can also ask questions about policies or request professional ethics insights using a web reporting page, TellTysonFirst. This helps us address common questions and better understand ethics and compliance issues for team members.\n\nIn 2022, the Ethics Line received 5,641 reports. Of these, 2,094 were investigated by the ethics team, with 83% unsubstantiated and 17% resolved. A large proportion of reports (3,520) were referred to the proper teams for resolution. See page 53 of the Data Center for a full breakdown of reports received.\n\nWe are also proactive in our social compliance efforts through our Social Compliance Auditing program, which, in 2022, covered 47 Tyson facilities and select suppliers, such as third-party sanitation providers. These labor, health and safety, environmental performance and ethics audits are based on the widely used Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) standard, in which SMETA auditors use global social compliance audit criteria to verify adherence to the four pillars of social compliance standards in labor, health, safety, environment and business integrity. Moving forward, we plan to increase auditing frequency and are planning to implement additional compliance measures for sanitation providers that will use a third-party auditor to conduct random supplier audits.\n\nTyson has a devoted compliance team that maintains company policies and monitors third-party risk, compliance with sanction laws and conflicts of interest. The team also supports the social compliance audits by meeting with our team members at the plants, providing documents and information to the auditors and supporting any remedial efforts. The compliance team also maintains the company\u2019s Code of Conduct and facilitates the annual Code of Conduct Training.\n\nSUPPLIER CODE OF CONDUCT\n\nTyson Foods\u2019 Supplier Code of Conduct details our values and the ethical standards we expect from all our supply chain partners, including those related to human rights. We expect our suppliers to make the same commitments in their labor practices by having controls in place that:\n\n\u2022 Verify the employment eligibility of their employees.\n\u2022 Prohibit inappropriate recruiting practices and fees.\n\u2022 Ensure no forced labor or child labor is being used or human trafficking is occurring.\n\u2022 Respect the right of employees to freely associate, organize and bargain collectively.\n\u2022 Ensure compliance with applicable wage and hour laws.\n\u2022 Prohibit discrimination, harassment and workplace violence.\n\u2022 Provide options for employees to report concerns without fear of retaliation.\nThe health and safety of our team members is a key value. That\u2019s why we\u2019re committed to delivering the training, innovation and resources team members need to be safe.\n\n**OUR APPROACH**\n\nOur goal is to achieve year-over-year reductions in workplace injuries and illnesses. To realize this, we need to continue nurturing a culture of shared safety ownership, starting from the top. Effective communication between governance teams enables quick and efficient resolution of safety issues. Dedicated hourly team member safety councils, plant safety councils and business unit safety councils meet to address and solve safety issues. An Executive Safety Council convenes quarterly to align on key enterprise safety objectives. Additionally, we\u2019ve established a Safety Center of Excellence to provide best practice support for safety professionals in our plants.\n\nTo ensure team members know what\u2019s expected of them, front line team members complete a minimum of 13 hours of compliance, safety and food safety training annually. New hourly employees also receive up to 120 hours of classroom and on-the-job orientation. Apart from safety compliance training, our special emphasis on safety leadership training continued in 2022. We redesigned our safety leadership platform, modernizing and digitizing training materials, which are now available across the enterprise.\n\nUnfortunately, we were saddened during the year to experience some very serious road- and manufacturing-related losses, resulting in six fatalities. Such losses reinforce our commitment to ongoing training and communication so we can continue building a safe work environment for all.\n\n**Using Technology to Promote Safety**\n\nTyson Foods\u2019 overarching focus for 2022 was aligning approaches to workplace health and safety across various business units. Part of our \u201cOne Tyson\u201d approach, this included digitizing processes and procedures, as well as training, to deliver a standard approach to health and safety.\n\nWe also introduced a new goal to digitally enable all aspects of the safety function. A major aspect of this is our new Safety Risk Profile and associated dashboard. This risk profile measures leading indicators of safety\u2014such as risk reduction efforts, corrective actions and regulatory compliance\u2014as opposed to only lagging indicators. While lagging indicators enable effective response to incidents and issues that have already occurred, leading indicators will help us understand the efficacy of our preventative measures.\n\nWe track performance in all manufacturing facilities in our safety dashboard; plants that score at or above the mid-tier prevention level demonstrate strong safety values. Our goal is for all Tyson manufacturing plants to be rated at or above the mid-tier risk-prevention level by 2030.\n\n**Oversight and Recognition**\n\nTyson Foods is committed to third-party and internal auditing and regular reporting. We work with facilities to close recommendations highlighted in audits and share findings across the business. Importantly, completion of post-audit corrective actions is tracked at the enterprise level and plays a part in a plant\u2019s safety risk profile score. We use digital knowledge sharing tools to share audit corrective actions throughout the enterprise. In addition, we publicly report our annual progress on injury, illness and retention rates. Frequent safety audits from plant and corporate safety and health professionals are essential parts of our continual improvement in workplace safety. We also audit domestic production facilities using SMETA\u2019s gold-standard social auditing criteria, with most facilities receiving zero or one finding.\n\nEach year, we honor locations that achieved specific measurable safety goals. We also celebrate team members who share innovative safety solutions. The awards help reinforce our values of providing a safe workplace for our team members. Our award criteria raise awareness of key safety issues, promote continual improvement and recognize locations for making significant progress.\nPROMOTING A CULTURE OF HEALTH AND WELLNESS\n\nWe take a proactive approach to employee wellbeing, exploring and piloting ergonomic technologies, mixed-reality technologies and digital analytics to enhance our workplaces.\n\nTo encourage a healthier workforce, we are also expanding access to affordable, high-quality health care. We provide team members and their families with health, life, dental, vision and prescription drug benefits. In fact, we require all regular, full-time team members who have completed 59 days of employment to have health care coverage through the company-sponsored health plan or an external one.\n\nWe are also piloting subsidized on-site childcare and adjusting schedules to flex with workforce needs. In April 2022, we broke ground on a childcare facility at our Humboldt site, which will provide affordable services for team members at our Humboldt facility.\n\nLearn more about healthcare for Tyson team members.\n\nInvesting in Our Team Members by Investing in Our Facilities\n\nIn 2022, we completed development of two state-of-the-art facilities and commenced construction on an additional two: Bowling Green, Kentucky and Danville, Virginia. These new facilities have all been designed to include common and wellbeing areas for team members. In August 2022, we also announced investment of $200 million in our Amarillo, Texas plant to expand and upgrade operations, including a wellbeing area for the site\u2019s 4,000 team members.\n\nBright Blue Clinics\n\nEveryone should have access to effective health care; however, we recognize people in rural areas often struggle to find convenient, local treatment options. We have established seven health clinics (\u201cBright Blue Clinics\u201d) near our plants in rural communities across the country. These clinics offer quality and affordable help for team members and their families.\n\nThe health centers, operated by Marathon Health, provide primary and preventative care, including health screenings, lifestyle coaching, health education and behavioral health counseling. During 2022, they had over 20,000 visits, representing a 100% increase in engagement versus 2021. The differentiated experience delivered to our team members and their families\u2014from reduced wait times and ease of scheduling appointments to a whole-patient health focus\u2014has resulted in market-leading patient satisfaction scores.\n\nEnhancing Inclusive Benefits for All Team Members\n\nFor 2023, Tyson has expanded our benefits to be more inclusive of all team members at an estimated annual cost of more than $8.4 million. This includes access to:\n\n- Two Smart Cycle benefits through Progeny\u2019s family-planning services.\n- Additional $800,000 coverage for gender dysphoria.\n- Wigs coverage following hair loss due to illness, injury or treatment.\n- Increased adoption allowance, up to $10,000 per adoption.\n- $10,000 lifetime maximum travel assistance\u2014applicable to those who require an abortion and/or those unable to receive gender-affirming care.\n\nLearn more about our benefits.\nWith targeted giving programs and investments, we\u2019re helping the communities we serve to thrive by strengthening relationships between our operating locations and the places our team members and their families live.\n\nOur rural processing plants operate in areas where Tyson Foods is often the largest employer. We aim to address social challenges that disrupt lives, such as housing, transportation, childcare, team member culture/integration and health care.\n\nWe address hunger relief and insecurity by expanding access to protein. We also help provide disaster relief through our Meals that Matter\u00ae program and engage in strategic investments and partnerships that yield positive social change for all stakeholders. At a local level, our plant teams select community giving projects to support, while our Giving Together matching program empowers all team members to volunteer and give back to nonprofits.\n\nIn 2022, we continued embedding community investment activities further into our business, integrating workforce programs (such as financial literacy training and ride-shares) into our HR team\u2019s activities, and product and financial donations into the goals of our sustainability operations team.\n\nCOMMUNITY GIVING PROGRAM\n\nOur Community Giving program helps communities thrive by strengthening connections between Tyson sites and the areas where our people and their families live. Through the program, we are scaling giving activities for existing community programs that have positive outcomes for local residents.\n\nWe target philanthropic efforts strategically, focusing on two areas:\n\n- Food access and nutrition\n- Immigration and refugee support and resettlement\n\nAnd, to maximize the impact of our program, we look to partner with international, national and regional organizations that can help us deliver positive impact at scale.\n\nHELPING KIDS THRIVE\n\nOur Tyson K\u201312 business has long supported school foodservice programs through grants, awarding nearly $225,000 in funding over the past eight years. In FY2022, we earmarked funding for 10 grants, totaling $50,000. Half of this was distributed in five grants of $5,000 through our Hunger Heroes campaign. The other $25,000 was allocated to six recipients through our Great Grant Giveaway program. We have set similar grant-giving numbers for FY2023.\n\nLearn more about Tyson\u2019s K-12 program.\nFIGHTING HUNGER ACROSS THE U.S.\n\nIn 2022, Tyson Foods committed $2.5 million to address food insecurity in partnership with Feeding America\u00ae member food banks. In September, during Hunger Action Month\u00ae, Tyson also donated 2.5 million pounds of protein\u2014the equivalent of protein needed for 10 million meals.\n\nWe allocated $1 million of our Feeding America\u00ae donation to Equitable Food Access grants. These aim to improve access to nutritious food among people experiencing the highest rates of food insecurity, with a focus on underrepresented communities and/or people in rural communities. The other $1.5 million was used by Feeding America\u00ae and member food banks to expand capacity to repack bulk or private label protein products into family-size quantities, increasing the types of protein that can easily be donated and distributed.\n\nTyson Foods is also a founding participant in the Military Family Advisory Network\u2019s (MFAN) Combat Military Hunger Task Force. Its role is to identify the most efficient, scalable and sustainable methods of delivering food directly into the hands of military families who need it most.\n\nDISASTER RELIEF\n\nOur work to provide aid to communities recovering from natural disasters continued in FY2022 with the donation of 150,000 pounds of protein across Kentucky, Tennessee and other states devastated by the 2021 tornadoes. In partnership with Walmart, we located our Meals That Matter\u00ae disaster relief trailer at the Walmart Supercenter in Mayfield, Kentucky, with volunteers from our grill teams in Tennessee, Indiana and Arkansas on site distributing food.\n\nFollowing the flooding in Hazard, Kentucky in July 2022, we resumed our partnership with Walmart to donate two million meals for storm relief. Again, our grill teams stepped up to assist in distributing over 500,000 pounds of protein to feed families and relief workers.\n\nOur 2022 disaster relief efforts also included donating more than one million pounds of protein and deploying disaster relief efforts to support storm victims, volunteers and first responders in Florida following Hurricane Ian. We partnered with Walmart to distribute meals to those in need in Fort Myers and the surrounding areas. We also partnered with Publix, Feeding America\u00ae and three of their local food banks to provide protein to people affected by the storm.\n\nOne in eight people, including one in six children, in America is food insecure. As food banks continue to face increasing demand, we\u2019re thankful for partners like Tyson, whose ongoing food and fund donations are supporting our network\u2019s efforts to increase access to protein, a high-need item, and ensure equitable access to food for communities facing hunger.\u201d\n\nErika Thiem\nChief Supply Chain Officer,\nFeeding America\u00ae\n\n640,000\n\nWe have worked with community organizations across hundreds of donation events, including donating 640,000 servings of protein to tribal citizens experiencing food insecurity.\nWhen it comes to responsible food, we\u2019re focusing on creating accessible, affordable products that meet the nutritional needs of people all around the world and evolving how those products are made and packaged.\n\nThroughout our operations, we\u2019re driving continuous improvement in animal welfare, working to develop packaging that is more sustainable and expanding our portfolio of innovative protein options to meet varying health and lifestyle needs and personal preferences. And, through it all, we are committed to upholding the highest quality and safety standards, embedding best practices to raise the bar on what good food means.\n562 FarmCheck\u00ae audits completed.\n\nThe FarmCheck\u00ae audit program scope is based on a statistical analysis of each protein supply chain. This allows Tyson Foods to determine the number of farms to be audited annually so that, over a three-year period, we can be 99% confident that 95% or more of our supply chain complies with program standards.\n\nDeveloped an Antibiotic Stewardship Framework, following publication of our position statement in FY2021, to facilitate regular, transparent assessments of practices throughout our global supply chain.\n\nSupported startups and other companies focused on emerging proteins, new technologies for food and worker safety and sustainable food production through Tyson Ventures.\n\nInaugural Tyson Foods\u2019 Global Animal Welfare Awareness Week, an enterprise-wide celebration focused on enhancing our animal welfare culture.\n\nAchieved 35% recycled content in corrugated packaging on average.\n\nQuarterly Global Animal Welfare Council meetings to discuss emerging issues and the future of our animal welfare program, as well as to ensure alignment on animal welfare policies and practices.\n\n---\n\n4 Percentage of recycled content in corrugated packaging is the average recycled content of our suppliers\u2019 corrugated packaging products in 2022. The actual percentage of recycled content in packaging is highly dependent on box volume, box mix, acquisitions, divestitures and specification changes that can continually fluctuate from year to year. In addition, the average is close to the theoretical maximum of 40% for our industry class (refrigerated/frozen products, products that provide no internal load support and relatively heavy-weight selling units).\nWe are on a mission to raise the world\u2019s expectations for how much good food can do by continuously improving the welfare of animals entrusted to our care. It\u2019s a mission that underpins our aspiration to be the world leader in animal welfare, delivering compassionate care that is grounded in sound science.\n\nWe embrace our moral and ethical responsibility to provide appropriate care. Our priority is ensuring animal health and welfare standards are implemented, enforced and verified across our supply chain. To support this, we continuously update our policies and procedures to reflect current science and meet current legal standards and practices known to improve animal welfare outcomes. We also evaluate emerging technologies to drive continuous improvement.\n\nBOARD OVERSIGHT FOR PROGRESS\n\nThe Tyson Foods Office of Animal Welfare (OAW), established more than 16 years ago, leads our efforts. Supported by internal and external subject matter experts, the OAW uses key welfare indicators to measure, monitor and manage animal welfare. Amongst other responsibilities, the OAW oversees implementation of the FarmCheck\u00ae program. This includes engagement with an external advisory panel, delivering on research objectives, and execution of the on-farm verification program. Through FarmCheck\u00ae, third-party auditors assess farms that supply to Tyson, ensuring they meet expectations on animal welfare.\n\nIn 2022, 562 audits were conducted through the FarmCheck\u00ae program. Deficiencies are noted at each audit and corrective action plans are created with input from the farmer, and various Tyson teams including animal welfare, live operations and procurement.\n\nPartnering for Successful Animal Welfare Outcomes\n\nWe work with an external Animal Welfare Advisory Panel, an internal Global Animal Welfare Council, and a team of animal welfare specialists embedded across our business units who work to deliver on our animal welfare mission and vision.\n\nWe formed our external Animal Welfare Advisory Panel in 2012 as part of the FarmCheck\u00ae program. The panel\u2019s direction helps to ensure we\u2019re taking a leadership position on the most relevant and critical areas of animal welfare.\n\nThe Panel\u2019s intent is to maintain a balanced dialogue that includes experts from various fields, including academia, regulatory, production and science, to bring diverse perspectives on animal behavior, health, welfare, production and ethics.\n\nThis external panel guides current animal welfare topics and helps to:\n\n- Determine ways to improve our FarmCheck\u00ae program.\n- Advise us on research priorities and projects.\n- Alert us to emerging issues or technologies that may affect our industry and business.\n- Help us understand proactive approaches we can take to address areas such as ethical issues, consumer interests, and new research and technologies.\n\nThe Panel continues to help us identify potential gaps and opportunities for improvement in animal welfare, such as focusing our research on poultry lighting, environmental enrichments, facility design and animal housing.\n\nIn late 2020, Tyson Foods launched a global initiative to bring together the best animal welfare minds within our company. The result was Tyson Foods\u2019 Global Animal Welfare Council, which meets quarterly to discuss timely and emerging issues, the future direction of the company\u2019s animal welfare program, and to ensure alignment on animal welfare practices and policies.\n\nIn addition to the Global Animal Welfare Council\u2019s work to standardize animal welfare across our global operations and share best practices, Tyson Foods maintains global animal welfare policies providing consistency in key areas of program governance and animal welfare expectations in operations.\n\nFIVE DOMAINS OF ANIMAL WELFARE\n\nTyson Foods adoption of the Five Domains animal welfare framework is a key driver in enhancing our animal welfare culture. The progressive framework allows us to better communicate about and assess the dynamic continuum of animal welfare. It supports animal welfare through four domains\u2014nutrition, physical environment, health and behavior, which ultimately contribute to the fifth domain, the mental state of the animal. The model is specifically designed to capture the complexity of welfare states, facilitate welfare assessments and incorporate growing knowledge of welfare science into practical applications.\n\nIncorporating the Five Domains into our daily conversations and actions is essential for Tyson Foods to drive continuous improvement in our welfare program and culture throughout our global operations.\n\nLearn more about the Five Domains.\nFrom a practical perspective, the Five Domains align with our focus on key welfare indicators to drive continuous improvement in animal-based outcomes, and they more intentionally make the connection between specific actions or conditions and welfare outcomes so that opportunities can be more quickly identified and addressed. With this awareness, a stronger connection is forged between individual roles and responsibilities and how they influence the animal\u2019s life experience. This greater understanding and appreciation allows for an individual to better evaluate the animal and their own performance and actually talk about welfare in a relatable and actionable manner\u2014not only empowering our team members and reinforcing the importance of their roles, but cementing accountability in the welfare space.\n\n**ANIMAL WELFARE AWARENESS WEEK**\n\nCulture is a critical but complex facet of a robust animal welfare program. Our culture is grounded in comprehensive animal welfare training, awareness, empowerment and accountability. It\u2019s why, in 2022, we were proud to launch Tyson\u2019s first global annual Animal Welfare Awareness Week. During this enterprise-wide celebration, team members from across our global operations explored several key topics, including:\n\n- Integrating the Five Domains.\n- Driving individual and team accountability.\n- Tyson Foods\u2019 new animal welfare tagline: \u201cEvery animal. Every day.\u201d\n\nThe week-long campaign also featured videos and takeover posts from team members to raise awareness of animal welfare and foster engagement. These posts reached over 18,000 people on Instagram, TikTok, Facebook and LinkedIn.\n\nLearn more about Animal Welfare Awareness Week.\n\n**SEE IT? STOP IT!**\n\n\u201cSee it? Stop it!\u201d holds everyone accountable for ensuring compliance with Tyson Foods\u2019 animal welfare expectations. It simply states that if an individual sees something that is not or may not be compliant with our expectations, it is their responsibility to address it, report it or elevate it.\n\nWe combine this approach with our concept of 100/0. Every individual is 100% accountable for their actions and there are 0 excuses if things don\u2019t go as planned. That doesn\u2019t mean areas for improvement won\u2019t occur, but it does mean individuals take responsibility for addressing issues when they arise.\n\n**ENSURING ANTIBIOTIC STEWARDSHIP**\n\nTyson Foods\u2019 Antibiotic Stewardship Position Statement describes our responsibility in managing antibiotic use within our supply chain and our approach to combatting antibiotic resistance. Tyson Foods has also developed an Antibiotic Stewardship Framework which provides a platform to assess antibiotic stewardship practices throughout our global supply chain.\n\n99.43%\n\n\u2014\n\ntotal birds raised without the use of medically important antibiotics\n\n**Researching Responsible Antibiotic Use**\n\nTyson Foods is dedicated to preserving the health and welfare of animals within our supply chain while protecting food safety and public health.\n\nWe are a founding member of the International Consortium for Antimicrobial Stewardship in Agriculture (ICASA), a public-private collaboration launched by the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research in 2019. In 2022, through our engagement with ICASA, Tyson Foods contributed to various projects promoting antibiotic stewardship advances across beef and pork supply chains.\n\nExamples of research grants we have delivered in 2022 include:\n\n- A grant to develop a sustainable, practical system for individual beef producers to evaluate and report their antimicrobial usage in context of others across the beef feedlot industry (Kansas State University).\n- A grant to research the optimal time for vaccine application against *M. hyosynoviae*, which will result in significant prevention of swine lameness and the reduced use of antibiotics for disease control (University of Minnesota College of Veterinary Medicine).\n- A grant to identify factors that cause swine lameness (University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine).\n\nFind out more on these grants and others.\nFrom farm to table, we\u2019re innovating throughout the value chain to meet the world\u2019s changing\u2014and growing\u2014food requirements.\n\n**DISRUPTING THE INDUSTRY WITH TYSON VENTURES**\n\nThrough our investment arm, Tyson Ventures, we support startups and companies with breakthrough ideas. We focus our investments on sustainable proteins and innovations for a changing world, including:\n\n- **Emerging Proteins:**\n  Food innovation in proteins that can provide more sustainable nutrition to a growing global population.\n\n- **Enabling Technologies:**\n  Technologies that enhance traceability, worker safety, automation, machine learning and AI to create a more agile food supply chain.\n\n- **People, Planet & Agriculture:**\n  Solutions that create a more responsible food system through improved animal welfare, diagnostics, circular economy, water management, packaging and land stewardship.\n\n**Tyson Ventures Demo Day**\n\nIn 2022, Tyson Ventures held our first Demo Day\u2014a Shark Tank-style event for startups focused on sustainability and transforming the way the world eats. An executive judging panel, made up of leaders and Tyson Ventures\u2019 investment committee, was held virtually.\n\nThe panel heard from entrepreneurs pitching solutions for Tyson Ventures\u2019 investment strategy on topics from animal welfare to robotics. As a result, we introduced six companies to partners within the business to continue conversations regarding their work. Following its success, we intend to host a second Demo Day in 2023 focused on upcycling.\n\n**UNDERGOING A DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION**\n\nTyson is undergoing a digital transformation to enhance efficiency and productivity. Part of this shift is integrating cutting-edge technology platforms into manufacturing operations.\n\nTo achieve this, we first focused on expanding digital monitoring of our production lines to boost connectivity between our international manufacturing facilities, allowing sites to link to a shared digital platform with real-time manufacturing data. This empowered teams with the insights needed to make quicker decisions and predictions about improvements for efficiency. The digital platform also acts as an internal communication platform, letting colleagues collaborate on solutions and share team wins.\n\nThroughout 2022, we began integrating this technology into our plants. To date, 17 sites are connected to an online live-tracking database, and we are beginning to expand the solution to sites in the U.S. Additionally, some of our new plants in China have been purpose-built for connectivity and process automation. It is anticipated that the information from these facilities will allow Tyson to be more visual and transparent, as well as encouraging a spirit of competition and shared growth between plants.\n\n**DIGITAL FEED MONITORING**\n\nTo improve operational efficiency and compliance, in August 2022, we introduced a Feed Outage Tracker pilot. Traditionally, each mill has kept paper records regarding feed levels. Our tracker, developed in-house by our Law Department, is modernizing data management with online storage and performance dashboards.\n\nThe tracker sends weekly reports to participating mills. These include metrics for each mill, insights into what is causing outages or out times and notes for improvement. Each month, a leadership report is sent to the VPs of Live Operations and mill leadership.\n\nAt the end of FY2022, we had 3 mills piloting the tracker, with an expansion to 6 mills planned for early FY2023 and potential to launch the tool at all poultry feed mills by the end of FY2023. We anticipate that over time, this automated direct-to-stakeholder reporting can enhance business efficiency by identifying improvement opportunities to reduce live costs and pinpoint feed outage hotspots.\nAs a global food producer, ensuring the quality and safety of our products is of paramount importance.\n\n98.2%\n\u2014\nof supplier facilities and Tyson plants producing edible human food are GFSI certified\n\n100%\n\u2014\nof alleged noncompliance issues in noncompliance or inspection reports issued by global regulatory authorities are responded to in writing\n\nZero\n\u2014\nregulatory enforcement actions in FY2022\n\nOur commitment to robust food quality and safety standards extends throughout our value chain\u2014all the way from farm to customer\u2014and we are continuously looking for opportunities to enhance our practices.\n\nTyson Foods\u2019 food safety and quality assurance professional network comprises thousands of operations, engineering, supply chain and procurement team members who co-own food safety and quality. This integrated, cross-company approach is designed to nurture a culture of shared ownership for food safety and quality control.\n\nOur Laboratory Services Network is also involved in food safety testing and research, while our plants are frequently inspected by the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Safety And Inspection Service (FSIS).\n\nRead about our Sentinel Site Program\u00ae.\n\nMONITORING SAFETY\nWe honor our commitment to producing safe, high-quality food by conducting regular food safety audits. These assessments help inspire consumer confidence and provide detailed insights that inform improvements to our food safety practices.\n\nSee full list of certifications.\n\nAudits are conducted internally by corporate and plant food safety teams. Standards, such as those benchmarked by the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI), create a baseline against which we measure our efforts. We also engage third-party certification entities to provide real-time feedback that helps us pursue continuous improvements.\n\nAs well as auditing our operational processes, we ensure nutrition labels meet Tyson\u2019s own product transparency standards, as well as comply with applicable labeling requirements under federal and state laws. For products sold in the United States, labeling is most often subject to labeling regulations and guidelines administered by the USDA and FDA.\n\nOur nutrition team works closely with our regulatory and law teams. This collaboration helps keep the business informed on current nutrition labeling policy so our packaging and labeling reflects the latest nutrition-related regulations. We are compliant with the FDA\u2019s Nutrition Facts label on FDA products within our portfolio, and we follow guidance from the USDA for meat and poultry products. This means our new nutrition labels give visual emphasis to calories and serving size; contain updated information specific to added sugars, dietary fat, and vitamins and minerals; and meet the FDA\u2019s serving sizes and labeling requirements for certain package sizes.\n\nFOOD QUALITY AND SAFETY ASSURANCE\nIn the United States, we are closely regulated by the FDA and the USDA FSIS, and our food plants strictly adhere to global food standards.\n\nIn 2022, our Food Quality and Safety Assurance team continued to focus on identifying current and emerging risks for the food industry to maintain regulatory compliance. We\u2019re proud that 100% of our U.S. facilities are certified to GFSI standards globally.\n\nProduct Recalls\nIn FY2022, we experienced zero product recalls.\n\nInforming National Avian Influenza Control Protocols\nEach year we run thousands of health tests on our poultry. The results inform national avian influenza control protocols. Given the 2022 avian flu outbreak in the U.S., this was a particularly important aspect of our research processes that year.\nPackaging is crucial for delivering safe food to consumers, and it is imperative that food preservation isn\u2019t compromised. We look for robust packaging solutions that can withstand every stage of the value chain\u2014from production, packing and distribution through point of sale and all the way to consumer use.\n\n**OUR APPROACH**\n\nBy 2030, we want all Tyson Foods branded products to be recyclable, home compostable, or reusable. To support this goal, we are exploring alternative materials and processes, and rethinking the packaging used across our entire product portfolio.\n\nFor example, we are considering alternatives for expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam trays in our poultry business. In 2022, we launched APET (Amorphous-Polyethylene Terephthalate) fresh poultry trays to replace some EPS foam trays and incorporated a new \u201chigh abuse\u201d side-end-seal film that is more resistant to abrasion, tearing and cutting. Also, in 2022, we successfully conducted a pulp fiber tray test with Tyson\u2019s Trimmed & Ready\u00ae line as an alternative to EPS foam trays. An in-commerce test of new pulp fiber trays met the action criteria of performing at the same level or better than existing trays and received favorable consumer feedback. To continue these efforts, we are working to test additional pulp fiber tray technologies with select Jimmy Dean\u00ae products in FY2024.\n\n**Plastic Reduction**\n\nWe are also looking for opportunities to reduce the overall plastic content in packaging. In FY2023, we initiated a pilot test for flow-wrap packaging for select case-ready ground beef products. The flow-wrapping technology uses less plastic than a conventional tray-and-film-wrap packaging and the pilot test successfully demonstrated Tyson\u2019s ability to convert flow-wrap materials in case-ready ground beef products, with potential to decrease the amount of plastic needed for packaging.\n\n**Innovations in Paper-Based Packaging**\n\nWe have identified a formable plastic film-laminated paperboard tray where the consumer removes the film after use and recycles the remaining paperboard. If commercialized, this packaging innovation can significantly reduce dependence on heavy rigid plastic up to 90% and increase overall recyclable content for some of our consumer-facing products.\n\nWe are also evaluating options for how we can use more post-consumer recycled (PCR) content in both paper-based and plastic packaging. We have on average 35% PCR content in our corrugated packaging.6\n\n**Reusable Packaging**\n\nWe are pushing to incorporate more reusable materials in our own operations as well, through the introduction of reusable plastic crates (RPC\u2019s) within Tyson facilities, and looking for opportunities to expand our use of reusable systems within our operations. Moving to an RPC system within our operations reduces our reliance on single-use cardboard, making this solution both a circular and waste-reduction option.\n\nWhen it finally reaches its end of useful life, we aim for our packaging to be disposed of as responsibly as possible. We are always looking for the best options in the consumer-packaged goods sector, with careful consideration of the science, current disposal infrastructure, and consumer practices, to find more sustainable packaging solutions.\n\nThis is why we are seeking strategic partnerships with industry organizations and stakeholders to facilitate the infrastructure changes needed to improve circularity of packaging and packaging-related components. We believe that, taken together, investing both in the packaging materials we use in our products and in the infrastructure to responsibly dispose of packaging materials is the right path forward for our products and consumers.\n\n---\n\n6 The average recycled content in Tyson\u2019s corrugated containers purchased in FY2022 is comprised of 29.1% PCR and 5.9% Post-Industrial Recycled (PIR).\nMaking Packaging More Recyclable with Lahli\u2122 Morning Protein Bites\n\nIn 2022, we launched our new brand, Lahli\u2122. Lahli\u2122 was designed to target a market segment which desires more health-conscious convenience products and packaging designed for recyclability. One packaging goal for the Lahli\u2122 product was to minimize plastic use by eliminating unnecessary rigid plastic trays without impacting packaging integrity.\n\nUsing our packaging design principles and extensive consumer research, we worked with Amcor Flexibles North America to develop a flexible packaging solution. The pouch utilizes recycle-ready, in-store drop-off film that provides customers with a sustainable disposal option. The pouch carries a How2Recycle\u00ae label to communicate instructions for how to recycle packaging in place of disposal.\n\nLahli\u2122 plans to continue sourcing packaging that is designed for recyclability and has reduced plastic content where possible. The brand is also exploring the possibility of new pulp fiber bowls and is launching an initiative to encourage in-store drop-off recycling of breakfast bowl lidding film.\n\nMaking Our Products Easier to Recycle\n\nIn 2022, we initiated a program to develop and implement \u201crecycle-ready\u201d replacements for PVC-based overwrap films on fresh meat products. We also partnered with Amcor on recycle-ready forming/nonforming flexible film for use across the Jimmy Dean\u00ae frozen portfolio. The pouch is constructed from thermoformable base webs and top-lidding films that bear the approved H2R recycle icon\u2014a recognized icon that instructs consumers to deposit empty packaging in in-store/on-site collection sites. The Jimmy Dean brand plans to roll out additional products using these films in 2023 and 2024.\n\nAlso in 2022, our Hillshire\u00ae Snacking tray platform has received the Association of Plastic Recycler (APR) certification and met their critical guidance criteria. The structure allows the trays to be recycled by stores and facilities where polypropylene (PP-S) materials can be effectively recycled. Our product platform includes such familiar snacking formats as Hillshire Small Plates and Hillshire Bistro Bites found in your local grocer or club.\nEmpowering consumers to make healthy choices through product labeling transparency.\n\nWe believe making protein more accessible is key to helping our customers take control of their own wellbeing. Using science-based best industry practices, Tyson\u2019s Research & Development teams work constantly to make products more nutritious while remaining affordable to families around the globe.\n\nOur teams have been working hard to prepare our products for incoming updates to FDA allergen requirements, with sesame joining the list of major food allergens from 2023. We are also updating our nutrition facts to meet revised legislation in Canada.\n\nLearn more about Culinary Innovation.\n\nEDUCATION PROGRAMS\n\nTyson Foods and the American Meat Science Association have collaborated and hosted a short course for college students who are studying meat science, food science, nutrition and engineering for the past six years. Our Beyond Fresh Meats Short Course continued in spring 2022 with approximately 50 individuals taking part in our \u201cDinner Sausage, It\u2019s More Than Just the Sizzle!\u201d course at the Tyson Discovery Center in Downers Grove, IL. Within this program, undergraduate and graduate students (and professors) complete rotations to broaden their technical skill set while gaining an understanding of the daily responsibilities of R&D food scientists.\n\nNutrition Education and Involvement\n\nDuring 2022, our registered dietitian nutritionists supervised two interns, acting as mentors to these future dietitian professionals. We also continued to meet with nutrition students at the University of Arkansas each semester to introduce them to the role of corporate dietitians.\n\nOur nutrition team is actively involved with the Arkansas Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (Dieticians in Business and Communications practice group), North American Meat Institute and National Pork Board. We also provide input based on current policy issues, consumer trends and nutrition research.\nOUR PRODUCT PORTFOLIO\n\nWe offer a diverse portfolio of nutritious products that fit well within healthy eating patterns and provide a variety of benefits to consumers\u2019 health and wellbeing. More than half of consumers are seeking to add protein to their diets. Protein is a necessary nutrient for growth and development, building muscle, helping maintain a healthy weight and curbing hunger, among other things. We offer a wide variety of protein choices to meet consumers\u2019 lifestyle needs and personal preferences, including both traditional protein and plant-based protein. The Tyson nutrition and R&D teams continually evaluates new products and reformulations to ensure we are providing the best tasting and most nutritious products to meet consumers\u2019 needs and interests. The teams\u2019 hard work was proven successful in 2022 as Tyson received the Community Wellness award from the North America Meat Institute (NAMI), while Hillshire Farms All Natural Fully Cooked Pork Chorizo Crumbles was awarded with The National Restaurant Association\u2019s Food and Beverage Award (FABI).\n\nSee Our Brands.\n\nWHITE HOUSE COMMITMENTS\n\nIt was an honor for Tyson Foods to be present at the 2022 White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition and Health. The event brought attendees together to end hunger and increase healthy eating and physical activity by 2030, so fewer Americans experience diet-related diseases like diabetes, obesity and hypertension.\n\nIn support of this goal, by 2030 we intend to:\n\n\u2022 Invest $250 million in the charitable food system to expand access to affordable, nutritious protein and build greater system capacity to reach every community equally.\n\u2022 Invest $20 million to help make nutrition education more accessible to children, workers and communities through initiatives such as our Upward Academy program.\n\u2022 Increase the nutrient density of our protein portfolio to improve nutritional value.\n\nOur Lahli\u2122 Morning Protein Bites are a delicious, protein-packed way to start the day, containing vegetables, cage-free eggs and chicken raised with no antibiotics ever.\n\nOur Hillshire Farm SNACKED! Turkey with Chocolate Chip Cookies won Parents Food Awards 2022 prize for Best Mixed Snack Pack.\n\n7 Made with eggs laid by hens in an environment without cages.\nBuilding a more sustainable food system is critical to our future as a leading protein provider. That\u2019s why we are working with all our stakeholders to find ways to improve the resilience of our food systems.\n\nFollowing the announcement of Tyson Foods\u2019 net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions aspiration, we have taken a step back to put our best foot forward. Embedding the Formula to Feed the Future strategy into our business has resulted in the creation of new positions, retitling of roles to reflect new responsibilities and development of a new management-level working group.\n\nWe also conducted a materiality assessment, which included supplier input, to understand how our use of natural resources is viewed by stakeholders. The findings informed our pillars, which resulted in an overhaul of our company-wide approach to sustainability. We believe such preparatory work has increased the transparency with which we operate, as well as strengthening our voice in global stakeholder conversations.\nHOW WE WORKED TO SUSTAIN NATURAL RESOURCES\n\nRECOGNIZED\n\nBy the North American Meat Institute in 2022 for continuous environmental improvement at 44 plants\n\n78 plants and other facilities received recognition for their environmental management practices. The Environmental Recognition Award recognizes a company\u2019s dedication to continuous environmental compliance improvement, as witnessed by the development and implementation of Environmental Management Systems (EMS)\n\nANNOUNCED\n\nIn 2021, our ambition to achieve net-zero GHG emissions, including Scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions, by 2050\n\nCONTINUED\n\nAlliance for Water Stewardship certification for three U.S. plants\n\nACHIEVED\n\nZero Waste to Landfill (ZWTL) gold-level validation at seven U.S. plants in FY2022 where 95% to 99% of certain waste streams has been diverted from landfills\n\nDEVELOPED\n\nA GHG emissions accounting framework for beef to model emissions and verify emission reductions from pasture to production through supply chain partners\u2019 adoption of more sustainable agricultural practices\n\nDIVERTED\n\n35.5 tons of organic waste from our Springdale, Arkansas headquarters through our Composting Waste Program in partnership with Food Loops since the pilot began in 2018\nA leader in the food industry, Tyson Foods is also working to lead greenhouse gas emission management and reductions within the beef industry by re-imagining our supply chain from farm to plate and looking for ways to work with suppliers to adopt our climate-smart agricultural practices.\n\n**OUR NET-ZERO AMBITION**\n\nWe understand the importance of reducing GHG emissions to help keep global average temperature increases to well below 2.0\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and to support efforts to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. We continually aspire to achieve net-zero emissions for Scope 1, 2 and 3 by 2050.\n\n**Evolving Our Baseline**\n\nAs a large and constantly evolving company, periodic updates to our GHG baseline are required as we acquire new business and expand operations to ensure continued alignment with the GHG Protocol. The process involves Tyson\u2019s sustainability and global impact team working closely with the environmental compliance and other teams who collect and manage emissions data.\n\nWe are continually working to ensure our targets are supported by the right data. Throughout FY2022, we worked to improve the accuracy and completeness of our emissions data, including:\n\n- Conducting electronic surveys of our sites using data questionnaires to identify emissions sources.\n- Re-baselining and calculating a comprehensive Scope 3 emissions footprint, using the latest guidance and protocols.\n\nTaken together, these steps will help ensure the completeness of direct and indirect emissions data, informing more accurate and comprehensive accounting. Our improved, expanded base year will also support progress against our net zero by 2050 commitment, and our ongoing alignment with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).\n\nFollowing our original Science Based Target, which was approved in FY2018 by SBTi, we will submit a revised target in line with the SBTi\u2019s updated 1.5\u00b0C ambition, and include a Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) target for land-based emissions reduction and removal, within the required time-frame.\n\n---\n\n8 Our GHG emissions for global operations are calculated according to the GHG Protocol, using the operational control approach.\n9 Rounded to one decimal place. This data includes our U.S. operations (96% of revenues in FY2022).\n10 In FY2018, we conducted an initial screening and estimation of Scope 3 emissions using data from WRI and Ecofys. In FY2022/FY2023, we completed a full Scope 3 emissions inventory using FY2019 data. This will be followed by an update for FY2022, which will inform our resubmission to the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi).\nENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS\n\nTyson Foods continues to develop and implement an Environmental Management System (EMS) at all domestic locations. The EMS is designed to facilitate compliance with federal, state and local environmental requirements. Key elements include environmental policy, operational standards, task management and incident tracking software, compliance auditing, learning management system and data mining. The EMS is directed by the Corporate Environmental Services Department and implemented by facility management teams. The Corporate Environmental Services Department is charged with identifying and addressing opportunities for continually improving Tyson\u2019s EMS.\n\nIndustry-Leading Efforts\n\nAs well as driving internal progress, we look to leverage our insights to encourage industrywide improvements. We participate in various industrial trade organizations, including frequently presenting on various environmental topics to other members. Several team members participate in environmental committees for industry organizations, sharing insights on key topics and environmental developments.\n\nRENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS\n\nWe have a goal to establish a pathway to using 50% renewable electricity, both purchased and self-generated, across domestic operations by 2030. Aligned with this domestic aspiration, we are also making investments in renewable electricity within our international business operations.\n\nIn Thailand, we are using solar energy systems to reduce dependence on diesel-generated power. The first phase of this project includes a one-megawatt photovoltaic module installed at Tyson Thailand\u2019s Chonburi plant, which is projected to reduce carbon emissions by 2,100 MT annually once completed. Additionally, Tyson Poultry Thailand has completed installation of a \u201cSolar Street\u201d for lighting around the facility, and is exploring a new solar project using floating panels installed on ponds located on the facility property.\n\nPILOT RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS AT OUR PLANTS\n\nTyson Foods has partnered with NW Natural and BioCarbN to convert biogas from wastewater facilities into renewable natural gas (RNG). During January 2022, we brought this process online for our Lexington, Nebraska plant. A second facility, located in Dakota City, Nebraska was initiated at the beginning of 2023.\n\nBetween October 2021 and September 2022, the process generated over 93,000 MMBtu of biogas\u2014enough to heat approximately 2,092 homes annually. At full capacity, the two projects combined are expected to produce about 240,000 MMBtu of RNG each year\u2014enough RNG to provide heat for more than 5,400 homes annually.\nWe approach greenhouse gas emissions holistically, considering GHG emissions outside our direct operations. This includes gaining robust insights into our agricultural supply chains and the activities that contribute most to our GHG emissions footprint.\n\nOur supply chain approach includes identifying areas where we can have maximum impact to reduce Scope 3 emissions. This includes working with cattle ranchers and row crop farmers to adopt climate-smart practices. Tyson has been selected as a grant award recipient in the USDA\u2019s Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities grant program, which is a combined total investment of $152 million to accelerate the adoption and implementation of climate-smart practices and support underserved producers and U.S. rural agricultural communities. This program would allow for improved farmer and rancher livelihood, increased carbon sequestration and reduced GHG emissions in Tyson\u2019s supply chain.\n\n$152M\n\nTyson Foods is planning to launch a $152 million effort to support adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices as a selected grant award recipient in the USDA\u2019s Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities grant program.\n\nCOLLABORATING TO ADDRESS BEEF-RELATED EMISSIONS\n\nWe see significant opportunity in our beef value chain to work with our suppliers to transition to regenerative agricultural practices with reduced GHG emissions. We are collaborating with supply partners, academics and environmental advisors\u2014like The Nature Conservancy (for advice on grazing-related emissions) and Environmental Defense Fund (for guidance on feed inputs and nitrogen balance)\u2014to reimagine the future of beef production and help us achieve our ambitious sustainability goals.\n\nTo take on beef-related emissions, we first need an in-depth understanding of how and where they arise. Throughout FY2022, we developed a dynamic accounting framework and model that enables per-head assessments of carbon intensity for cattle enrolled in our Climate-Smart Beef Program, exploring the impact of activities such as farming processes, feed choices and grazing practices. Our feedlot partner, Adams Land & Cattle, was critical to this process, supplying key data to inform our assessment model. They also trialed our model, integrating it into their existing cattle performance management system to calculate greenhouse gas emissions for the cattle at their feedlot enrolled in the program, as well as when they go to harvest.\n\nWe engaged Deloitte to refine and automate our data integration model to drive efficiency, accuracy and real-time, on-site emissions monitoring. Now, we are working with consultants SCS Global Services to verify our methodology and model-align with relevant ISO standards.\n\nClimate-Smart Beef\n\nOur Climate-Smart Beef Program\u2014a first-of-its-kind innovation for a company our size and the most significant investment we\u2019ve made to date on our sustainability journey\u2014uses Science Based Targets and first-hand rancher experience to drive climate-smart agricultural practices. The goal? Reduce GHG emissions in the beef supply chain while creating additional value and profitability for everyone involved.\n\nTogether with scientists from the University of Arkansas and Dr. Greg Thoma at Colorado State University, we can better characterize a decarbonization pathway for beef in our supply chain. To accomplish this, we will incentivize producer and feedlot adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices while investing in research on how to reduce methane emissions.\n\nAs well as reducing emissions, it is our hope that participating producers and feedlots will gain other land and water benefits, including minimizing soil erosion, reducing water run-off, improving water quality and helping conserve habitats.\n\nWe know our Climate-Smart Beef Program is just the beginning. We aspire to verify sustainable beef production practices on >5 million acres of U.S. cattle-grazing land by 2025.\nLOCAL GRAIN SERVICES SUSTAIN\n\nThe Tyson Foods Local Grain Services (LGS) program was created to support direct sourcing of corn from farmers in the communities where we operate. LGS offers resources and strengthens relationships with farmers to ensure our chickens are fed the highest quality local grain.\n\nThe program\u2019s latest initiative, LGS Sustain, is designed to help farmers adopt climate-smart practices on row crop land. To ensure it works for everyone, we have developed LGS Sustain as a farmer-focused, farmer-driven program, drawing on supplier insights to understand what support they want and need to adopt agricultural practices with reduced emissions.\n\nParticipants will receive educational and technical assistance to update processes along with access to industry-leading partners. They will also receive funding to adopt new practices which are intended to preserve the longevity of agriculture, such as cover crops, nutrient management and reduced tillage.\n\n50%\n\nLast year nearly 50% of the corn in our chicken feed was sourced from local farmers.\nAs a food company, we rely on healthy land to safeguard our future. It\u2019s why we are driving responsible land use practices, including working to fully identify and manage deforestation risk across our global supply chain.\n\n**ADDRESSING DEFORESTATION**\n\nProtecting forest resources aligns with our purpose\u2014raising the world\u2019s expectations for how much good food can do. Through the company\u2019s Core Values, we strive to create value for our shareholders, customers, communities, and team members, while serving as a steward of the animals, land and environment entrusted to us. As noted in our Forest Protection Standard, Tyson sources commodities with potential risk related to deforestation in certain global jurisdictions. Accordingly, Tyson recognizes the need to protect forests and biodiversity, reduce our climate footprint, and conserve natural resources.\n\n**Risk Mapping Our Commodities**\n\nBased on a deforestation risk assessment conducted with Proforest in 2019, consisting of Tyson operations at the time and using the definition for deforestation from the World Wildlife Fund, Tyson was found to have low or no risk of deforestation across 94% of the then known land footprint for select commodities in our operations. Most beef and soy we source were determined to be at low deforestation risk due to U.S. origin. To proactively address the remaining 6% of our value chain that had unknown origins and risks, we developed a Forest Protection Standard, as well as country-specific commodity action plans (CAPs).\n\nTo continue this work, we are again seeking to update our Forest Risk Assessment, with consideration of changing definitions for deforestation under international law, and plan to reassess our deforestation goals and CAPs. We continue to work to enhance risk mapping and traceability in our international beef supply chains as we work toward our goals.\n\n**Engaging Suppliers**\n\nWe are also working with suppliers to reduce our global supply chain deforestation risk. Tyson expects its suppliers to meet set criteria for the prevention of deforestation. We recognize not all suppliers can meet new requirements immediately; however, Tyson expects suppliers to make the changes necessary to meet the requirements by the target sourcing dates.\n\n**Goals for Progress**\n\nWe have established several goals for commodities from high-risk countries. We\u2019re making progress toward these goals by aligning our practices with commodity-specific responsible sourcing initiatives. In 2022, Tyson Poultry Thailand, Tyson Thailand and Tyson Malaysia were certified to the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) Supply Chain Certification Standard, demonstrating the presence of systems for controlling RSPO-certified palm oil products. We are also driving change with our paper-based packaging suppliers by stating our preference for Sustainable Forest Initiative (SFI)- and Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified materials.\n\n---\n\n11 The World Wildlife Fund generally defines deforestation as \u201cthe purposeful clearing of forested land.\u201d\nWater is a critical resource for all life. As such, we recognize the vital responsibility we have to use water resources efficiently and in a manner that preserves product integrity and quality, which is why we partner on solutions to manage water risks and use.\n\n**OUR WORK WITH THE ALLIANCE FOR WATER STEWARDSHIP**\n\nAcross our business operations, we are applying the latest science and engineering insights to our water stewardship approach. As a member of the Alliance for Water Stewardship, we contribute to local water resource protection and preservation by adopting the International Water Stewardship Standard. We also involve supply chain partners in efforts to innovate shared water stewardship practices.\n\n**Establishing Contextual Water Targets**\n\nSetting contextual water targets helps us contribute to better-quality water where we operate and work with stakeholders in the local watershed to manage water risks and stress. To do this, we are working toward a goal to develop Contextual Water Plans at 11 high-risk locations in the U.S. by 2025.\n\nThrough these contextual water targets and water stewardship plans, facilities with Contextual Water Plans will also set site-specific targets for five main water-related outcomes, inside and outside the facility line. These are:\n\n- water quantity\n- water quality\n- water governance\n- important water-related areas\n- water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)\n\nThe stewardship plans will be evaluated annually by each site, with short (one-year), medium (five-year) and long-term (10-year) targets assessed to ensure alignment with the contextual needs of the facility and its stakeholders.\n\n**A Site-By-Site Approach**\n\nWe implement site-specific initiatives to help reduce water consumption, as well as quality targets to reduce nutrient risks to water sources. To date, we have completed water plans at seven sites:\n\n- Finney County, Kansas\n- Seguin, Texas\n- North Richland Hills, Texas\n- Amarillo, Texas\n- Vernon, Texas\n- Dexter, Missouri\n- Temperanceville, Virginia\n\nOur plans consider the interests of local stakeholders, and we set water governance and water-related area targets to promote and enhance good relationships across local watersheds. We also have a water access, safety and hygiene target, highlighting our commitment to equal water access for communities who depend on it.\n\n**Wastewater Treatment and Initiatives to Reduce Fresh Water Use**\n\nOur facilities implement water efficiency and reuse technology, including efficient nozzles for cleaning, water-efficient appliances in restrooms and water reuse in condenser frameworks. Additionally, Tyson partners with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to study the conversion of meat processing wastewater into drinking water.\n\nWhere we reuse water, our food safety and environmental teams continuously work to lower contamination risks and keep our products safe. Our procedures are further regulated by EPA programs such as the Clean Water Act, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) and state regulatory programs.\n\n**WRI Aqueduct Alliance**\n\nWe appreciate the importance of achieving a water-secure future by understanding, evaluating and mitigating global water risks. It\u2019s why we joined the Aqueduct Alliance group\u2014created by the World Resources Institute (WRI). As a member, Tyson Foods consults with the WRI on our water stewardship work, including strategies, data, economic analysis and risk and impact evaluation.\n\nThe WRI supported us on our first steps toward water stewardship, helping us conduct international and domestic water risk assessments. They also helped us pilot our first contextual water target. Because of this, the WRI and the Aqueduct Alliance remain an invaluable and trusted strategic partner to Tyson Foods.\nWe believe in finding ways to keep resources in use for as long as possible, diverting operational waste from landfill and developing projects to recycle more materials.\n\nAs stewards of the land, we work to ensure as few as possible of the world\u2019s precious and finite resources are wasted. We strive to be good stewards of natural resources through actions such as waste-data tracking and monitoring, composting and diverting waste from landfill wherever possible.\n\n**AVOIDING WASTE FROM THE START**\n\nThe best way to reduce waste is to avoid it from the get-go. This is the thinking behind our Chonburi facility in Thailand going 100% paperless for manufacturing systems\u2014production, food safety, quality assurance and safety\u2014in frontline operations. The site has implemented a digitally connected solution that helps unify all systems into a single system.\n\nThe result is that 188 paper-based forms have been removed. Information is instead consolidated to tablets, which means team members can communicate and respond to data in real time while simultaneously cutting the site\u2019s waste footprint.\n\n**DIVERTING PRODUCT PROCESSING AND FOOD WASTE**\n\nWe are converting operational byproducts, which would otherwise be waste, into valuable products to help minimize or eliminate what we send to landfill, while creating additional value. For example, in our animal processing operations, non-human-edible protein waste can be used to create animal feed, biofuels and fertilizer.\n\nIn 2022, we composted 10,313,225 pounds of food waste and yard trimmings and partnered with animal rescue sanctuaries to donate 681,228 pounds of fresh meat. We also donate human-edible food to hunger relief organizations to be distributed to those who need it most.\n\n**Diverting Waste from Landfill**\n\nEight Tyson Foods plants have achieved Zero Waste to Landfill validation through a combination of reducing production waste and reusing or recycling materials. We were awarded gold level by third-party validation at our Tennessee, Arkansas, Kentucky and Georgia locations where we diverted 95% to 99% of waste away from landfills. While there is always more work to be done, it is a meaningful milestone toward our domestic waste-reduction goals.\n\n**RESPONSIBLY MANAGING HAZARDOUS WASTE**\n\nAs well as diverting waste from landfill, we ensure the proper disposal of hazardous materials and waste through our Hazardous Waste Management Standard. This standard is based on federal requirements as well as Tyson-specific and industry standards, and includes guidance on the segregation, signage and container requirements to which all U.S. plants must adhere.\n\n**An Innovative Waste Management Approach**\n\nWe know emissions from waste are a contributor to our Scope 3 carbon footprint. Due to this, we have initiated a Black Soldier Fly Larvae (BSFL) project as a potential method of reducing waste to landfill at our Tyson Malaysia facility.\n\nThe BSFL have a life cycle of approximately 45 days and, based on current research, just one kilogram of BSFL can consume over 20 tonnes of waste.\n\nThe larvae themselves can then be harvested as animal feed for fish-farming enterprises; their waste serves as nutrient-rich fertilizer in vegetable farming and horticulture.\n\nTo further explore this promising initiative, we have begun sending waste samples for decomposition testing using BSFL to our supplier, Bumi Sinaran. We are excited to be taking steps toward a more sustainable waste-treatment system for Tyson Foods and will continue supporting new and revolutionary technologies while we progress on our sustainability journey.\n\n---\n\n12 Source: Ferrarezi, Rhuanito & Cannella, Lorenzo & Nassef, Abdel & Bailey, Donald.

Furthermore, these emissions are not expected to represent a material quantity of emissions.\n\n\\(^{17}\\) Although our products may result in indirect emissions associated with their storage and preparation (e.g., emissions associated with refrigeration, freezing and cooking), they do not result in direct emissions during use. Because of complexities in estimating indirect emissions associated with the wide variety of products we sell, we have limited quantification of emissions of use of sold products to direct emissions.\n\n\\(^{18}\\) Our products may result in indirect emissions associated with their end-of-life treatment (e.g., emissions associated with packaging waste or food waste). Production of packaging is expected to have higher emissions than disposal of packaging and is accounted for under Purchased Goods and Services. Additional complexities exist in estimating indirect emissions associated with disposal of packaging and potential food waste, and an estimation for this category is likely to have a high degree of uncertainty.\n\n\\(^{19}\\) Though we do own a small amount of land that is leased to farmers, the emissions from these activities do not comprise a material quantity of emissions.\n\n\\(^{20}\\) We do not operate franchises.\n## ENVIRONMENT CONTINUED\n\n### Waste Generation\\(^{21,22}\\)\n\n|                        | FY2019 | FY2020 | FY2021 | FY2022 |\n|------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Waste Generated (million pounds) | 2,423  | 6,482  | 2,947  | 2,999  |\n| Waste to Landfill (million pounds) | 366    | 1,283  | 440    | 645    |\n| Waste Diverted from Landfill (million pounds) | 2,057  | 5,199  | 2,507  | 2,345  |\n| Recycle and Beneficial Reuse\\(^{23}\\) Rate | 85%    | 80%    | 85%    | 78%    |\n| Landfill Waste Intensity (pounds landfilled to produce 100 pounds of finished product) | 114    | 3.95   | 1.36   | 2.03   |\n| Zero Waste to Landfill Certifications | 0      | 0      | 3      | 8      |\n\n### WORKPLACE\n\n#### Workforce\n\n|                        | FY2019 | FY2020 | FY2021 | FY2022 |\n|------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| U.S.                   | 122,000| 120,000| 120,000| 124,000|\n| Outside U.S.           | 19,000 | 19,000 | 17,000 | 18,000 |\n\n#### Team Members by Gender\\(^{24}\\)\n\n|                        | FY2019 | FY2020 | FY2021 | FY2022 |\n|------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Men                    | 60.05% | 60.17% | 60.48% | 60.35% |\n| Women                  | 39.95% | 39.83% | 39.52% | 39.65% |\n| Women in Management Positions | 26.19% | 26.62% | 28.21% | 28.64% |\n| Women in Junior Management Positions | 27.35% | 28.11% | 29.54% | 29.39% |\n| Women in Top Management Positions | 16.67% | 14.55% | 15.09% | 20.00% |\n| Women in Management Positions in Revenue-Generating Functions | 16.55% | 16.79% | 17.43% | 17.38% |\n| Women in STEM-Related Positions | 17.27% | 19.44% | 17.50% | 18.43% |\n\n---\n\n\\(^{21}\\) This data includes our U.S. operations (86% of revenues in FY2022).
