But you don't have to go back 118 years to witness how we have transformed the ways people move and connect.\n\nLast year, we were proud to launch our inaugural Integrated Sustainability and Financial Report, building on more than two decades of sustainability reporting at Ford and giving our stakeholders a more holistic view of our performance. This year we have continued to evolve our process to better show the indelible link between our commitment to sustainability and our continued success, for generations to come. In Ford's second Integrated Report, you'll see what we've accomplished in the last year alone. We'll show how we've revolutionized and electrified some of the most popular, iconic vehicles, helping to shape the future of zero-emissions transportation. You'll see unprecedented investments in sustainable manufacturing and jobs to help drive the next century of progress. You'll see the continued impact of Ford and the Ford Fund to strengthen communities around the world. And you'll see how we're investing in the talent, capabilities, and technologies that will help build sustainable and ethical growth for Ford and for our shared future.\n\nAll of this is because the future of this company centers on a purpose bigger than building vehicles. We are helping to build a better world, where every person is free to move and pursue their dreams. A world that is fully electric. A world that is more equitable, inclusive, and sustainable. And in doing so, we are putting people, the planet, and our shared prosperity first.\n\nWe're glad to have you along for the ride.\nAbout This Report\nThe value of our business is rooted in our purpose to help build a better world where every person is free to move and pursue their dreams.\n\nThat means that we are directing our investments to what\u2019s good for all people and the planet. It also means we are setting the pathway for a strong business that will continue for decades to come. We will win by being financially healthy and effective in sustainability, which we believe are mutually dependent objectives.\n\nBased on our most recent materiality assessment, this year\u2019s report includes four main sections \u2013 Driving Innovation and Sustainable Growth, Putting People First, Protecting the Environment, and Creating Responsible and Ethical Growth \u2013 which reflects Ford\u2019s significant sustainability initiatives and impacts.\n\nTo supplement this report, we are also publishing our first Human Rights Report and our first narrative Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Report.\n\nYou can also find all our indexes in our ESG Data Book and Additional Downloads page.\n\nRead more about the reporting scope, boundaries and data assurance process we used in this Report on p.108\n\nWe welcome you to share with us your feedback and any comments you may have at sustaina@ford.com.\nFord Fundamentals\nLetter from Bill Ford and Jim Farley\n\nFor all of us at Ford, the truest mark of success is whether we leave the world a better place for the next generation. From our earliest days to the present day, Ford has followed that north star.\n\nWe invented the moving assembly line and the $5 workday, scaled the Model T, forged the Arsenal of Democracy, and converted our plants to make ventilators and masks during the pandemic. Each generation faces different challenges, but our purpose has always been the same: to help build a better world, where every person is free to move and pursue their dreams.\n\nToday, our industry and our world are going through a period of immense change. We believe it gives us the opportunity to create the most value for the company and our customers since Henry Ford scaled the Model T. But the change in our industry makes it even more important to stay true to the values that have defined our company. We publish this report to hold ourselves accountable and determine if we are truly moving the needle on the issues that matter.\n\nClimate change, for example, is among the biggest challenges of our generation. We all share the responsibility to address the threat it poses our economy, our health, and our way of life. Just like the Model T revolutionized mobility, we believe electrification can do the same for reducing carbon emissions. So, we have been transforming our business to lead the electric revolution at scale, creating distinct but complementary businesses \u2013 Ford Model e, Ford Blue and Ford Pro \u2013 that will help us compete and win in the new era of electric and connected vehicles.\n\nWe are introducing all-electric versions of our most popular, iconic nameplates \u2013 the F-150 Lightning, the Mustang Mach-E, and the E-Transit van \u2013 and scaling production to reach a target of producing more than 2 million electric vehicles per year by 2026. We are also leading a new era of sustainable manufacturing, re-thinking not just what we build, but how we build. In Tennessee and Kentucky, we have made the largest one-time U.S. investment by any automotive manufacturer to construct the most sustainable manufacturing facilities in our history. Around the world, we are dedicating more than $50 billion through 2026 to accelerate our zero-emission vehicle plan and create an ultra-efficient manufacturing system for our vehicles and the batteries that power them, helping us achieve our goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. Our aspiration is to achieve a business model that goes beyond net-zero and becomes a net-positive for both the environment and the economy.\n\nInvesting in electric vehicles is the right thing to do for our children and grandchildren. It is also the right thing to do for our business. The demand for our first-generation electric vehicles has far exceeded expectations. We believe we can profitably grow as we invest in electric vehicles, connectivity, and modernization. We plan to maximize the potential offered by digital, connected vehicles to make our products more accessible, more inclusive, and safer to drive than ever before. We are proving that you can drive prosperly and protect the planet at the same time, and investors are taking notice.\n\nAt Ford, we have always strived to take the long view on the environment, even when it was unpopular. We were one of the first industrial companies to publish our progress towards sustainability, one of the first automakers to support the Paris Agreement, and the only full-line American automaker to partner with California on more stringent emissions standards. Now, we intend to lead the industry in another respect by putting a spotlight on human rights.\n\nFord is publishing a Human Rights Report \u2013 a first for the company and for our industry. It will examine how our materials are sourced, where our products are manufactured, and how our labor standards measure up. Countries around the world are defining access to clean air and water as fundamental human rights. We at Ford agree \u2013 and are setting clear targets for reducing the global emissions of our entire supply chain.\n\nWhenever the world faces disruption and uncertainty, Ford has stepped up to shape it for the better. We are at our best when we are creating something larger than ourselves. In this time of profound change, we will answer the call to lead our industry towards a more sustainable future, while giving our customers the very best of Ford.\n\nBill Ford\nExecutive Chair\nJim Farley\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFord at a Glance\n\nFacts and figures\n\n182,790 employees in 43 countries\n\n76% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2035 from a 2017 base year, approved by Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi)\n\n50% reduction in Scope 3 GHG emissions per vehicle kilometer from use of sold products by 2035 from a 2019 base year, approved by SBTi\n\n$136.3B revenue and $10.0B company adjusted EBIT\n\n78% freshwater reduction in water use since 2000\n\n9M FordPass\u2122 app and Lincoln Way\u2122 members in the U.S.\n\n3.8m\u00b3 water use per vehicle produced\n\n83% of our European fleet received New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) 5-star ratings in 2021\n\n89 zero waste to landfill sites globally\n\nOver 20,500 charging stations (over 70,000 plugs) and growing on the BlueOval\u2122 Charge Network in North America\n\n200,000+ charging stations in Europe on the FordPass Charging Network in partnership with NewMotion\n\n$1.3M donated to disaster relief efforts around the globe\n\n$74.4M in charitable contributions to strengthen communities worldwide\n\n10 awards granted from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in 2021, doubling the number of TOP SAFETY PICK awards\n\n83% of our European fleet received New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) 5-star ratings in 2021\n\n89 zero waste to landfill sites globally\n\n120M facemasks donated to at-risk communities in all 50 U.S. states and hosted on-site COVID-19 vaccination clinics\n\nOver 20,500 charging stations (over 70,000 plugs) and growing on the BlueOval\u2122 Charge Network in North America\n\n200,000+ charging stations in Europe on the FordPass Charging Network in partnership with NewMotion\n\n$1.3M donated to disaster relief efforts around the globe\n\n$74.4M in charitable contributions to strengthen communities worldwide\n\n10 awards granted from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in 2021, doubling the number of TOP SAFETY PICK awards\n\n83% of our European fleet received New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) 5-star ratings in 2021\n\n89 zero waste to landfill sites globally\n\n120M facemasks donated to at-risk communities in all 50 U.S. states and hosted on-site COVID-19 vaccination clinics\nOur Purpose in Action\n\nOur purpose is to help build a better world, where every person is free to move and pursue their dreams.\n\nAnd this purpose has set us apart as a company for more than a century.

When catastrophic flooding hit Germany, Yvonne was shocked to see her inbox filled to the brim with Ford employees who asked how they could help before the rain had even let up.\n\nYvonne got to work organizing projects, with support from Ford Fund. Feeling the Ford family come together in this way was a shining light in a dark time, and really showed what Ford is all about.\n\nWatch this video to learn more about Yvonne\u2019s story\n\nA Ford Dealer Family for Two Generations Steps Up to Do What\u2019s Right\n\nJuan Martin Simone is a second-generation Ford dealer in Argentina, and the Ford dealership, the first in South America, is not the only thing Juan inherited from his father. He inherited a sense of responsibility in building public trust \u2013 an obligation to his community to help and do what\u2019s right. Today, Juan and his family continue to embody this spirit at the dealership. So, when he heard about a local non-profit group stepping in to help those in need, he got involved, helping the group build a school from scratch for a low-income province by providing food, financial resources and, of course, Ford trucks.\nFord Motor Company has a long history as an automotive and sustainability pioneer.\n\nDoing the right thing is in our DNA. Bill Ford himself is a passionate environmental leader and has spearheaded Ford\u2019s sustainability efforts for over two decades. We were the first OEM to begin reporting on sustainability 23 years ago, and we continue to challenge ourselves to lead, not just within automotive, but beyond. And we have done this while continuing to deliver the iconic vehicles and rewarding experiences people expect from Ford.\n\nBut we\u2019re not resting on our laurels. We\u2019re imagining the future of mobility, and building for it. By reducing emissions and waste from our operations and pushing the boundaries of innovation and technologies, we aim to reach carbon neutrality no later than 2050. And when we say carbon neutral, we are accounting for our entire impact on the planet \u2013 from vehicle emissions, to the power in our factories, to our suppliers. The breadth and depth of this commitment is characteristic of how Ford approaches any major challenge \u2013 with authentic commitment, purposeful ingenuity, and energizing passion throughout the organization.\nOur Leadership in Sustainability \u2013 continued\n\n2014\n- Implement Partnership for a Cleaner Environment (PACE) program\n- Become a signatory to the UN CEO Water Mandate\n- Announce a saving of more than 10 billion gallons of water\n\n2015\n- Develop the Ford Mobility plan, advancing connectivity, mobility, self-driving vehicles, and big data\n- Begin exploring self-driving vehicle technology\n- Launch the new, lightweight all-aluminum F-150\n\n2016\n- Develop the Transportation Mobility Cloud with Ford-owned Autonomic\n- Meet our goal, set in 2010, to reduce operational GHG emissions per vehicle produced by 30% (eight years early)\n- Celebrate 10 years of soybean-based foam in more than 18.5 million vehicles built in North America\n- Conduct first formal UN human rights saliency assessment\n\n2018\n- Develop the Transportation Mobility Cloud with Ford-owned Autonomic\n- Meet our goal, set in 2010, to reduce operational GHG emissions per vehicle produced by 30% (eight years early)\n- Celebrate 10 years of soybean-based foam in more than 18.5 million vehicles built in North America\n- Conduct first formal UN human rights saliency assessment\n\n2019\n- Launch Sustainability Aspirational Goals\n- Achieve double A rating for CDP Climate and Water\n\n2020\n- Launch Mustang Mach-E\n- Design and Produce a new powered air-purifying respirator and new ventilators, in collaboration with the UAW, produce face masks at Ford\u2019s Van Dyke Transmission Plant for internal Ford use and provide millions to local healthcare workers and communities\n- Contribute over $1.13 million to worldwide COVID relief through employee donation match; Direct $3 million to community organizations\n- Offer 155,000 charging stations in Europe on the FordPass Charging Network, in partnership with NewMotion\n\nWith so much still to do and guided by our purpose, Ford will continue to be at the forefront of positive change, helping to build a better world for everyone.\nUnleashing the Ford+ Plan\n\nTo advance the transformation of our global automotive business, Ford is accelerating the development and scaling of breakthrough electric, connected vehicles, while leveraging our iconic nameplates to strengthen our operating performance and take full advantage of a century of engineering and industrial expertise.\n\nFollowing the 2021 introduction of the Ford+ Plan \u2013 which has been called the company\u2019s biggest opportunity for growth and value creation since Henry Ford scaled production of the Model T \u2013 we are now forming two distinct, strategically interdependent, auto businesses \u2013 Ford Blue and Ford Model e.\n\nTogether with the Ford Pro business, these new complementary organizations will help unleash the full potential of the Ford+ Plan, driving growth and value creation and positioning the company to outperform both legacy automakers and new EV competitors.\n\nFord Model e will be Ford\u2019s center of innovation and growth, to create incredible electric vehicles and digital experiences for new generations of Ford customers.

We had to make it a showcase of innovation. After all, the F-150 is the heart and soul of Ford. Electrifying this iconic truck demonstrates just how serious we are about zero-emission vehicles.\n\nJust as Henry Ford and the Model T revolutionized mobility, the F-150 will revolutionize zero-emissions transportation for a new era. The F-150 Lightning is a pillar of the more than $50 billion Ford is investing in electric vehicles globally through 2026. And the strategy is working \u2013 customer reservations nearing 200,000 for the F-150 Lightning demonstrate the appetite for an electric pickup truck. The Lightning is drawing interest from new customers at a record rate in North America, with more than 75% of reservation holders new to the Ford brand.\n\nTo meet high customer demand, Ford is planning to nearly double production to 150,000 trucks mid-2023. \u201cThe reality is clear: People are ready for an all-electric F-150 and Ford is pulling out all the stops to scale our operations and increase production capacity,\u201d said Kumar Galhotra, president of The Americas & International Markets Group, Ford Motor Company.\n\nThe F-150 Lightning will be built at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center, the same factory in Dearborn, Michigan where Henry Ford invented the assembly line and changed the world. And when it comes online in 2025, Ford\u2019s new BlueOval City plant in Tennessee will be a hive of technical innovation to build next-generation electric F-Series trucks.\n\nBlueOval City will be among the largest auto manufacturing campuses in U.S. history. Like the iconic Rouge complex in Michigan did a century earlier, BlueOval City will usher in a new era for American manufacturing, helping to create our vision for an ultra-efficient, carbon-neutral manufacturing system\u2014one that creates positive impacts on people and the environment.\n\nFord is committed to leading the electric vehicle revolution and bringing it to scale. Over the next two years, Ford aims to emerge as the clear No. 2 electric vehicle maker in North America and then challenge the No. 1 spot as huge investments in battery and electric vehicle manufacturing come onstream. Within 24 months, Ford will have the global capacity to produce 600,000 electric vehicles annually.\n\nFor both Ford and the American auto industry, the F-150 Lightning represents a defining moment as we progress toward a zero-emissions, digitally connected future. F-Series is America\u2019s best-selling truck for 45 years, the backbone of work across the country, and a trusted icon for generations of customers. Now we are revolutionizing it for a new generation.\u201d\n\nBill Ford, Executive Chair\n\nF-150 Lightning Features\n\n- EPA-estimated range of 320 miles on LARIAT and XLT with the available extended-range battery.*\n- Expected to be certified as a zero tailpipe emissions vehicle.**\n- The standard-range battery has a targeted 426 horsepower (318kW) and 775 pound-feet (1050 Nm) of torque.6\n- Models with extended-range battery is targeted to go from 0-60 mph in the mid-4-second range.7\n- Pro Power Onboard.\n- Standard 4x4 and independent rear suspension.\n- Mega Power Frunk\n- Seamless connectivity\n- Over-the-air software updates.\n- Vehicle-to-vehicle charging capability.\n\n*Based on full charge.

It\u2019s our roadmap to determine Ford\u2019s trajectory for the next 10-15 years \u2013 creating the single biggest opportunity to create value for the company since Henry Ford scaled the Model T. Ford+ serves as our roadmap for the future as we move with speed and ambition to fulfill our Purpose to build a better world.\n\nAlways-on Relationship with Customers\nBuilding a different kind of relationship with our customers is central to Ford+.\n\nAs we break away from the transactional, build and sell business model that has typified the auto industry for decades, Ford+ is characterized by close, enduring customer relationships based on our foundational strengths, improving financial performance and developing capabilities and investments in disruptive technologies.\n\nWe made great strides in 2021 to create more value for customers through our connected services, as evidenced below. In 2022, we will be focused on moving even faster, with scale, towards always-on and the digital, electric, connected future of our products.\n\n- Launching BlueOval Intelligence: Ford\u2019s next-generation, cloud-based platform for integrating electrical, power distribution, computing and software systems in connected Ford and Lincoln vehicles\n- Having nearly one million vehicles that are capable of receiving over-the-air (OTA) updates \u2013 scaling to more than 30 million OTA-capable vehicles on the road by 2028\n- Strengthening customer relationships, mobility, and accessibility with digitally enabled tools like FordPass and Lincoln Way, as well as incorporating online ordering, simplified financing and renewal options, vehicle pickup and delivery, and mobile repairs to better serve our customers\n\nFord+\n\n| Distinctive products and solutions | Always-on relationship with customers | Ever-improving user experience |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Turn around automotive operations, compete like a challenger | Care for each other | Capitalize on our strengths |\n| Treat customers like family | | |\n| Create must-have products and services | | Disrupt ourselves |\n| Simplify everything | | Partner for expertise and efficiency |\n| Modernize everywhere | | Lead the electrification revolution in areas of strength |\n\nWe\u2019re fueling Ford+ by further strengthening our core automotive operations and generating consistently healthy cash flow that will fund growth and create value.\u201d\n\nJohn Lawler, Chief Financial Officer\n\n- Extending digital lifestyles by fully integrating best-in-class technology\n- Speeding detection and resolution of quality issues using connected data \u2013 helping to raise customer satisfaction and lower warranty costs\n- Deploying distinctive technology like BlueCruise hands-free driving and Ford Pro\u2019s VIIZR Field Service tool and EV charging solutions to improve the user experience \u2013 and to capitalize on what is projected to be a $20 billion market for such services by 2030\nDelivering Ford+ \u2013 continued\n\nLeading the Electrification Revolution\nAs proof of our commitment to leading the electrification revolution, we are accelerating investments and increasing planned total spending on electrification, including battery development, to $50 billion from 2022 through 2026. This will double our electric vehicle capacity to 600,000 units by the end of 2023.\n\nFurther, we are:\n\u2022 Anticipating 50% of Ford\u2019s global vehicle volume to be fully electric by 2030, including from:\n  \u2013 Mustang Mach-E, which is bringing new customers to Ford\n  \u2013 F-150 Lightning, an all-electric member of the F-Series family, America\u2019s best-selling trucks, which amassed nearly 200,000 customer reservations by the end of 2021\n  \u2013 E-Transit commercial vans, which will be on the road later this year\n\u2022 Investing in battery technology and equipping Ford to design, engineer and manufacture its own batteries\n\nCreating a Business Dedicated to Commercial Customers\nIn 2021, we established Ford Pro: a game changer and growth accelerator for our commercial customers and our business \u2014 with anticipated company revenue of $45 billion by 2025, up from $27 billion in 2019.\n\nThis global vehicle services and distribution business within Ford is devoted to commercial and government customers, and led by Ford CV veteran Ted Cannis, who has been named CEO of Ford Pro and a corporate officer.\n\nFord Pro provides customers with greater value and higher productivity through:\n\u2022 The industry\u2019s most comprehensive and flexible range of electric and internal combustion commercial vehicles\n\u2022 Digital and physical services that can help optimize and maintain customer fleets\n\u2022 Public, depot and employee home charging of EVs for the next day\u2019s work\n\u2022 Bundled financing of vehicles, services and charging\n\nFord Pro creates a tremendous upside for customers, our business, and the communities we serve. As our customers grow and advance their electrification journey, we\u2019ll grow. And together, we will help build a stronger, and greener, global economy.\n\nTransforming our Culture\n\nFord+ Behaviors\nThe Ford+ Behaviors embedded in the Ford+ Plan are critical to helping us transform and win. If the Ford+ Plan outlines what we will do to change our business for the future, the Ford+ Behaviors are how our team members will work differently to seize this moment and write the next 100 years of Ford\u2019s legacy. They were developed with the input of more than 10,000 employees who helped further define what our behaviors mean in practice at Ford.\n\nTo deliver Ford+ and radically transform Ford from a traditional automaker to a business that builds lifelong, always-on customer relationships requires each and every member of our global team to work differently and adopt a Challenger Mindset. We are committed to helping our employees put these behaviors into action and are evolving our onboarding and up-skilling processes to cultivate exceptional talent across every level of the organization. We are also focused on recognizing and celebrating our Ford+ Champions, the employees who are embodying our behaviors and driving our transformation, through peer-driven storytelling and recognition programs.\n\nLeadership+\nWhen all of our teams are operating at their best, Ford can build a better world. Recognizing the power of our leaders in enabling our future, in 2021 we established Leadership+, our mechanism for delivering key messages and activations to elevate and add clarity to the role of a people leader. Leadership+ sets leaders up for success in their role as Ford+ activators and change agents by:\n\u2022 Building understanding of Ford+ and the Ford+ Behaviors\n\u2022 Redefining the role of a people leader and connecting it to the delivery of Ford+\n\u2022 Building new skills and habits that drive behavior change, using Ford+ as the framework\n\u2022 Leveraging supporting systems, tools, and processes to reinforce behavior change\n\nRead more in Driving Innovation and Sustainable Growth section on p.41\nRead more in Customer Experience, Marketing and Satisfaction section on p.74\nDelivering Ford+ \u2013 continued\n\nFord+ in Action\n\nCompete Like a Challenger\nWhen the semiconductor shortage disrupted production at our Kansas City Assembly plant, Site Manager Fred Thome had to make some quick decisions to launch the E-Transit on schedule \u2013 a critical goal in our electrification plans. In just 24 hours, his team put together a plan to focus exclusively on building the E-Transit, expertly avoiding a four-to-six-week delay. Further, by partnering with the UAW and the Vehicle Manufacturing, Engineering and New Models launch teams, they were able to keep the launch on track for our customers.\n\nDisrupt\nWith all eyes, even the U.S. President\u2019s, on the reveal of the all-electric F-150 Lightning, the stakes were high. Pulled ahead by more than five months to set the stage for Capital Markets Day, a cross-functional team from across the business came together to execute an accelerated launch plan from conception to reveal night in just 10 weeks. All in, the team is bringing the advanced technologies, new ownership services, strength, and capability of the electric future to our customers much sooner than planned.\n\nModernize\nFor commercial vehicle customers, fuel is a major cost, which makes fuel efficiency a major priority. That\u2019s why Nicolas Seguin (Manager, Mobility Analytics, Global Data Insights & Analytics) and his team developed Fuel Advisor. Using Ford\u2019s telematics platform and connected vehicle data, Fuel Advisor analyzes routes, tracks fuel consumption in real-time, and recommends where/when to refuel to save the most money. Fuel Advisor is another always-on tool, delivering value to customers long after their purchase.\n\nCare for Each Other\nLast year, India went through a crippling second wave of the pandemic. Hospitals ran out of medical oxygen almost immediately. So, the Ford Mobility Division in Chennai, India took it upon themselves to secure and expedite an international delivery of oxygen concentrators and cylinders with help from their Ford colleagues in China. A shipment that should have taken weeks took only a few days \u2013 and it helped save lives.\nA Conversation with Lisa Drake and Sue Slaughter\n\nLisa: Throughout our business, we\u2019ve all been impacted in some way by the global pandemic. We \u2013 along with the rest of the industry \u2013 have been dealing with a global semiconductor shortage that was accelerated by COVID-19. It is forcing us to rethink the way we operate and make changes to the supply chain so that it is more simple, flexible, and quicker to react when problems arise. Sue, how has purchasing navigated through this situation?\n\nSue: We are working together with our suppliers to ensure we have the supply we need to meet demand. And as we continue to integrate technology and digitally-enabled services into our vehicles, our need for computing power driven by things like chips, has gone up. We saw a similar challenge in our supply of critical materials as well. That is why it is so important that we not only think about how Ford can use our purchasing power to fuel our business needs, but also to advance our focus on sustainability.\n\nLisa: I\u2019m proud of how our team has worked to be creative and to keep delivering value to our customers. This is such a critical time for Ford, when we are continuing to invest in our business and making the move toward electrification. This is where our partnerships play a critical role in helping make our business more resilient over the long term. Our work with Redwood Materials, for example, is looking at ways to integrate recycled materials into Ford\u2019s domestic battery strategy. This is going to be critical to our sustainable leadership into the future.\n\nSue: Yes, by design, our collaboration with Redwood helps ensure that recyclable materials in battery manufacturing and ramping up research and development in batteries with the launch of Ford Ion Park, as an example. BlueOval City in Tennessee, will become a vertically integrated ecosystem for Ford to assemble the next generation of electric F-Series trucks and will include a BlueOval SK battery plant, key suppliers and recycling. Our new assembly plant at BlueOval City is designed to be carbon neutral and to send zero waste to landfill once fully operational. This is all part of our focus on innovation and sustainable growth. The investments we\u2019re making today will help us lead the electric revolution at scale, and in a way that has positive impacts on people and the planet.\n\nLisa: We\u2019re also focused on vertical integration in our EV manufacturing and ramping up research and development in batteries with the launch of Ford Ion Park, as an example. BlueOval City in Tennessee, will become a vertically integrated ecosystem for Ford to assemble the next generation of electric F-Series trucks and will include a BlueOval SK battery plant, key suppliers and recycling. Our new assembly plant at BlueOval City is designed to be carbon neutral and to send zero waste to landfill once fully operational. This is all part of our focus on innovation and sustainable growth. The investments we\u2019re making today will help us lead the electric revolution at scale, and in a way that has positive impacts on people and the planet.\n\nSue: That leads us into our aspirational goal of responsibly sourcing our raw materials. Moving toward the need for more batteries, it is more critical than ever that we maintain our sensitivity to how natural resources are used in our manufacturing process by conserving water, energy and raw materials and looking at alternative sources that we can use, so that we\u2019re not so concentrated forward.\n\nLisa: That\u2019s right. Part of our focus on ensuring a responsible and ethical supply chain is making sure that we are partnering with other businesses, suppliers, organizations and coalitions that have the same standards and commitments to a sustainable future as we do at Ford. There are so many aspects that come with that \u2013 from protecting the environment to respecting human rights and setting science-based targets towards carbon neutrality, for example.\n\nSue: Everything we make and everything that goes into our products throughout the supply chain must comply with not only local laws, but also follow our commitment to sustainability. And a company with the scale that Ford has can really influence the supply chain and business practices across our entire industry. Our membership with IRMA \u2013 the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance \u2013 is an example of this. When we joined IRMA, it was our commitment to consistently achieving that goal by forwarding best practices. We were the first automaker to join IRMA, so we\u2019re leading change within our industry and more broadly across industries with similarly aligned priorities to make progress.\n\nLisa: Another way we can make progress is through grassroots investments that can address the root causes of some of the human rights concerns within the critical mineral supply chain specifically. Take for example, how Ford and the Ford Fund, our philanthropic arm, are working with international partners to empower women working in copper and cobalt supply chains in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We\u2019re making lives better in a real and tangible way. Getting Ford involved in programs that support and promote women to work in our industry is important here.\n\nSue: It\u2019s a unique program and I am proud to see how our partners are investing in the next generation of women-led businesses and interested in how that might help transform our industry for the better. Speaking of women transforming our industry \u2013 you have a new role at Ford, helping to lead electric vehicle industrialization as part of our new business model.\nLiving our Purpose\n\nOur Sustainability Strategy\nGlobal Challenges and our Response\n\nPeople everywhere share the hope of making life better \u2014 for themselves, for their children, and for their business. Those dreams are our business.\n\n2021 was a tumultuous year around the globe. The pandemic continued, as did the focus on climate change and racial and economic inequality. At the same time, supply chain issues and demand for goods contributed to rising inflation, which in turn exacerbated inequalities. All contributed to a global mood of uncertainty and urgency. Ford is committed to doing our part to address these shared challenges, driven by our purpose and our commitment to future generations. This is what sustainability means to us.\n\nGlobal Challenges\n\nBuilding a Better World\n\nCommunities around the world are already feeling the impacts of climate change. The World Economic Forum (WEF) Global Risks Report 2022 identified climate action failure as the most severe risk on a global scale over the next 10 years. Ford\u2019s 2022 trend report showed that 81% of adults, globally, say climate change makes them concerned for their future. Yet, more than half of millennials and Gen Z-ers believe that by 2035 we\u2019ll have the technology in place to reverse the effects of climate change. And experts from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to COP26 have outlined the 2020s as a critical decade to make progress and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has brought a preview of the disruption that climate change could bring \u2014 highlighting inequality and inadequacies in our global healthcare system, disrupting economies and political dynamics within and between countries, laying social and economic justice concerns, and changing the way we live, work, and do business.\n\nAll businesses continue to face a challenging economic environment, due to market forces such as rising commodity prices, inflation, debt, and labor market gaps \u2014 and the policies and regulations that impact them.\n\nAs climate change worsens, extreme weather events are becoming more frequent, environmental justice is receiving increasing attention since the costs and challenges of which fall disproportionately on disadvantaged and low-income communities and the developing world. The physical impacts of floods, droughts, heatwaves, and storms, combined with environmental degradation, threaten food, water, health, and energy security.\n\nProtecting nature and its biodiversity is vital for the economy; all businesses depend on natural resources to support their commercial activities. Through the G7 2030 Nature Compact, the G7 Leaders called for the world to not only become net zero, but also nature positive. Nature and biodiversity were meaningfully incorporated into global climate negotiations for the first time at COP26. This represents a real paradigm shift in how nations, businesses, investors, and consumers view nature. Our economic activities should not only minimize impact, but also enhance ecosystems.\n\nConsumer expectations and regulatory requirements for products to be made in an environmentally and socially responsible manner are increasing. Legislation is in development or has been recently passed requiring companies conduct actions to address broader human rights, environment, and responsible material due diligence in our business and supply chain. For example, the German Due Diligence Law coming into effect in January 2023, requires companies to address environmental and human rights in their business and through all levels of the supply chain to prevent or minimize risks.\n\nFree to Move\n\nThe transition to electric and autonomous vehicles is creating a fundamental shift in driving and mobility. Increased vehicle connectivity, shared mobility and their enabling technologies (such as artificial intelligence (AI), big data & analytics, Internet of Things) have environmental and social implications, which consumers are becoming more aware of \u2013 from vehicle and road safety, to raw materials sourcing, to data security and privacy.\n\nThese technologies also have the capacity to increase access and mobility to new generations, making our transportation system more equitable and inclusive for more people, including people with a wide range of abilities.\n\nInfrastructure is also top of mind, as we contend with supply chain disruptions, changes in consumer preference for safer modes of travel, and increasing emphasis on developing sustainable infrastructure.\n\nTechnology trends, notably automation, AI, digitalization of tasks and services, are dramatically improving efficiency and productivity but may pose higher cyber and data security risks. The adoption of these technologies will also continue to shift the employment landscape.\n\nWe know what\u2019s good for the planet is good for our customers and our business. What makes me hopeful is that we have all of the tools we need to make a difference for generations to come. We now need to enact the right policies to use these tools effectively and consistently. At the same time, all of us need to consider a Just Transition as we move towards our electric future.\u201d\n\nBob Holycross,\nVice President, Chief Sustainability, Environment and Safety Officer\nGlobal Challenges and our Response \u2013 continued\n\nFree to Pursue Dreams\nThe widening income gap and the ongoing scourge of racism and economic inequality in the U.S. and around the world continue, creating tensions within and across borders. Even with rising awareness and social justice activism, inequity gaps still loom large \u2013 both highlighted and exacerbated by the pandemic, which has had a disproportionate impact on low-income communities, ethnic minorities, and women.\n\nConsumers are increasingly expecting companies to respond to social and economic issues that impact their workforce and the communities where they live, work, and serve.\n\nSocial justice and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) go hand in hand. It is incumbent on society as a whole, and businesses in particular, to innovate and adopt new ways to push for equity in employment, education, and everyday wellbeing, and to create greater DEI at all levels.\n\nSocial justice concerns also extend to the automotive industry. At a time when technology is transforming vehicles and how they are made and operated, workers from manufacturing through customer service may need new skills and knowledge. This is a part of the Just Transition challenge.\n\nAt COP26 in 2021, a select number of governments supported the conditions for a Just Transition internationally. This includes ensuring environmental sustainability as well as decent work, social inclusion, and poverty eradication. The creation of new industries, new jobs, and new skills gives us the opportunity to also create more equal and resilient economies and communities.\n\nOur Comprehensive Response\nHow well we adapt to these shared challenges from the global trends hinges on our ability to anticipate \u2013 and prepare. Driven by our Purpose, we are leaning into change and the disruption of the status quo to build a better world in which all people are free to move and dream \u2013 for generations to come.\n\nA key aspect of this change is our ability to leverage technology to power our transformation to electrification and build a sustainable electric vehicle ecosystem. We are aligning our ambitions with action and leading by example within our industry and among global companies working to build a better future.\n\nRead more in Our Sustainability Strategy section on p.28\n\nBuilding a Better World\nAchieving Carbon Neutrality\nFord has committed to achieve carbon neutrality worldwide across our vehicles, facilities and suppliers no later than 2050, and we have set out a strategic path to accelerate our progress, backed by science-based targets. This includes cutting GHG emissions across the use of our vehicles, driving energy efficiency and conservation in our facilities and manufacturing processes, and partnering with our suppliers to reduce their environmental impacts. Ford is the only full-line U.S. automaker to align with the Paris Agreement and to stand with the California Air Resources Board in support of stronger vehicle GHG emissions standards. And we are proud to stand with governments around the world working to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nWe are taking into account that this transition will vary from country to country, and in some emerging markets it may take longer. Given their progressive policies, we expect the leading markets like Europe, United States, and China to be carbon neutral before the rest of the world.\n\nRead more in: Climate Change section on p.83\nTCFD Report\n\nFree to Move\nLeading the Electrification Revolution\nFord is building the future of zero-emission vehicles and breaking constraints to lead the electric revolution, investing $50 billion from 2022 through 2026 in electric vehicles and the batteries that power them. Electrification amplifies the attributes our customers love, such as performance, capability, and convenience. Within our new line-up, disruptive technology allows us to enrich the customer experience and improve performance, safety, and accessibility. We\u2019re focusing on what we build and how we build them to make EVs that are sustainable, accessible, and affordable for more people. We\u2019re reducing the effects of our operations and supply chains through world-class facilities, including our commitment to sourcing 100 percent carbon-free electricity for our global operations by 2035. And by using recycled and renewable materials in our vehicles, we\u2019re reducing landfill waste and using fewer natural resources.\n\nA major component of EVs is the batteries that power them. We work with our suppliers and business partners for responsible raw material sourcing and enhance battery recycling, and to build out battery recycling and a domestic battery supply chain for our electric vehicles.\n\nCustomers\u2019 response to the electrification of our iconic vehicles \u2013 the F-150 Lightning, the Mustang Mach-E, and the E-Transit \u2013 has exceeded our expectations.\n\nTo provide EV customers with confidence on the road, Ford is delivering North America\u2019s largest public charging network, BlueOval Charge, with more than 20,500 charging stations and 70,000 individual charge plugs, and growing.6 Built-in charging solutions route customers to nearby charging stations, recommend where to charge on trips and provide easy access and payment via FordPass for a seamless customer experience.\n\nRead more in: Electrification and Connectivity section on p.44\nRedwood battery recycling story on p.97\nCarbon-Free Electricity and Energy Future section on p.91\nResponsibly Sourced Raw Materials on p.68\nGlobal Challenges and our Response \u2013 continued\n\nOur team has been successful in inventing new sustainable materials because we are willing to try things in the lab that others aren\u2019t. We had been warned that soy foam wouldn\u2019t work, and today it\u2019s in every Ford North American-built vehicle. Sustainability should be a consideration in every aspect of everything we do, and we need to be open to new, sometimes seemingly crazy ideas. It is tempting to think something won\u2019t work and give up before you\u2019ve started. If we could change that notion, then we can do anything!\u201d\n\nDebbie Mielewski, Ford\u2019s Technical Fellow of Sustainability\n\nDesigning truly incredible electric and software-driven vehicles \u2013 with experiences customers can\u2019t even imagine yet \u2013 requires a clean-sheet approach. We are creating an organization that benefits from all of Ford\u2019s know-how and capabilities, but that can move with speed and unconstrained ambition to create revolutionary new products.\u201d\n\nDoug Field, Chief EV and Digital Systems Officer, Ford Model e\n\nExpanding Access and Mobility\nWe are investing to help make mobility more seamless and accessible, while improving safety, efficiency, and sustainability. While the policy and legal framework around autonomous vehicles has not been fully developed, we remain focused on improving the technology, building a robust self-driving system, and offering affordable mobility solutions.\n\nWe are also considering the related issues of safety and data security. First, our customers and other stakeholders must trust that autonomous vehicles will operate as designed and vehicle safety is a top priority. Second, Ford has more access than ever before to data coming from apps, location services, and driving habits, and the opportunity to pull data from customers will only increase. If data is handled correctly, we have the opportunity to improve our customer relationships. It is imperative that our customers trust our ability to protect their data and ensure their privacy. This is why we adopt a holistic approach that includes policies focused on transparency, responsible data handling and use, and choice.\n\nSupporting a Just Transition\nFord identified addressing Just Transition as part of how we manage climate change, one of our salient human rights issue. We are developing a strategy where workers, communities, and our supply chain, as well as our customers, are being considered in the transition to a net-zero economy.\n\nBuilding a Diverse and Resilient Workforce\nFor decades Ford has enjoyed a strong employment reputation among traditional industrial companies. With the significant shift in skills needed to lead the electric revolution, we must prepare our workforce and compete for new talent in a more diverse, digital, and tech workforce.\n\nWe\u2019re investing more than $525 million in the United States over the next five years to train auto-technicians for electric vehicles. And we\u2019re developing programs through which our employees can develop and maintain the skills they need.\n\nProtecting Human Rights\nHuman rights and due diligence demands on our business including our supply chain continues to drive improvements in the industry. In 2020, the World Benchmarking Alliance recognized Ford as one of the leading companies in supply chain management and the leading automotive company in performance against the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark (CHRB).\n\nHowever, the average score for automotive companies in the CHRB-benchmarked sector indicates improvements in respecting human rights can be made particularly in demonstrating management of risks within their supply chain.\n\nRead more in: Human Rights and Supply Chain Management section on p.65\n\nPursue Dreams\nBuilding Ethical and Sustainable Supply Chains\nAs we strengthen our global sustainability commitment, we are faced with the challenge of bringing our global suppliers with us. With approximately 4,500 Tier 1 supplier sites around the world, our robust and sustainable supply chain is of crucial importance, with transparency the key to monitor supply and performance.\n\nOur strategy is to build supply base capacity that exceeds minimum regulatory compliance requirements and creates shared business value, primarily in four focus areas: protecting and respecting human rights, protecting the environment, responsibly sourced materials, and maintaining responsible business practices.\n\nRead more in: Climate Change section on p.83\n\nHuman Rights and Supply Chain Management section on p.65\nGlobal Challenges and our Response \u2013 continued\n\nFinancing our Future\nThe Sustainable Financing Framework we announced in November 2021 \u2013 on the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement \u2013 focuses on our ambitious plans in clean transportation, clean manufacturing, making lives better, and community revitalization.\n\nOur dealer and supply chain network will be critical to this transformation. Our Sustainable Financing Framework outlines how we\u2019re investing in environmental and social projects in this way \u2013 issuing an inaugural $2.5 billion Green Bond \u2013 is a first for a North American automaker.\n\nAt Ford, an amount equal to the net proceeds from sustainable financing will be allocated and invested in four areas:\n\n- **Clean Transportation** \u2013 Designing, developing, and manufacturing zero-emissions transportation, including electric vehicles and the batteries that power them across the full spectrum of design, development, manufacturing, and recycling.\n\n- **Clean Manufacturing** \u2013 Reducing further the environmental footprint of Ford\u2019s operations through renewable energy, sustainable water and wastewater management, waste management, and the circular economy.\n\n- **Making Lives Better** \u2013 Advancing economic opportunity and equity for underrepresented and/or disadvantaged populations including projects that help widen Ford\u2019s supplier and dealer diversity networks and social enterprises that benefit underrepresented populations.\n\n- **Community Revitalization** \u2013 Creating and renovating spaces to provide employment opportunities and access to essential services and amenities. Examples include the redevelopment of Michigan Central Station in Detroit\u2019s Corktown neighborhood into the center of a new mobility innovation district with community hubs, open spaces, and shared amenities.\n\nAt Ford Credit, an amount equal to the net proceeds from sustainable financing will be allocated and invested in two areas:\n\n- **Clean Transportation** \u2013 Offering automotive financing products for EV, Fuel Cell, other carbon neutral vehicles, or Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles which meet strict European emissions standards. Financing may also relate to installation of charging infrastructure for individual customers or dealers.\n\n- **Making Lives Better** \u2013 Expanding access to essential financing services and advancing economic opportunity and equity. Examples include supporting underserved, yet credit-worthy populations with access to credit or offering payment extensions to provide relief to customers impacted by public health emergencies, natural disasters, or other such events.\n\nFord also has $15.5 billion in revolving credit lines which now include key metrics that further align our financing actions with our commitment to operate a safe, sustainable, and successful business \u2013 including how the company is leading the electric-vehicle revolution.\n\nWinning businesses are financially healthy and lead in sustainability \u2013 it\u2019s not a choice, they rely on each other. We\u2019re again putting our money where our mouth is, prioritizing and allocating capital to environmental and social initiatives that are good for people, good for the planet, and good for Ford.\u201d\n\nJohn Lawler,\nChief Financial Officer\nOur Sustainability Strategy\n\nOur sustainability strategy is to make a positive contribution to society and the environment.\n\nA better world for all requires a future that\u2019s inclusive, equitable, and sustainable. As we continue our journey to electrification and carbon neutrality, we are committed to a strategy that addresses our people, our planet, and our customers. It is at the heart of our purpose, and it is driving our path forward.\n\nThat\u2019s why Ford is acting now to produce no-compromise electric vehicles like the Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning and E-Transit. And it\u2019s why we\u2019re aiming to reach carbon neutrality no later than 2050, by reducing emissions from our operations and throughout our entire supply chain, while pushing the boundaries of innovation and technology.\n\nWe\u2019re reimagining how EVs \u2013 and the batteries that power them \u2013 are designed, manufactured, and recycled, creating an all-new electric vehicle manufacturing ecosystem. We\u2019re also working closely with our suppliers, from factories to mines for raw materials, to both reduce carbon emissions and help the people and communities around them thrive.\n\nWe are building a more equitable and inclusive business through our focus on making a positive impact. Through our community engagements we are making lives better. And we are building a culture where everyone feels they belong. We are committed to leadership in human rights and the environment in every single part of our business, because fulfilling our purpose depends on it.\n\nOur Strategies\n\nOur approach to sustainability involves helping to meet the collective challenges the world faces, across a range of issues. We have developed these specific strategies to address them and achieve our Sustainability Aspirations outlined on the following page.\n\nPeople Strategy\n\nWe are fostering a culture of belonging for every employee and creating the freedom to move throughout the organization and pursue their dreams. We are committed to our DEI north star: We are family. We celebrate our differences. We all belong. Guided by these principles, we are focused on building a workforce that is equipped to meet the challenges ahead.\n\nHuman Rights Strategy\n\nWe are formally committing to respecting human rights through our policy, We Are Committed to Protecting Human Rights and the Environment, we are also working with our supply chain to make sure our suppliers and business partners do the same. We are addressing and evolving our Just Transition strategy as we move towards carbon neutrality and electrification.\n\nClimate Change Strategy\n\nAchieving carbon neutrality no later than 2050 is driving our climate change strategy. To achieve our carbon neutrality goal, we are focusing on three areas that account for approximately 95% of our CO\u2082 emissions \u2013 our vehicles, our operations, and our supply chain.\n\nSustainable Materials Strategy\n\nWe are committed to recycling plastics and using renewable, plant-based materials in production vehicle parts. Our closed loop recycling system maximizes aluminum recycling in our plants and minimizes the need for primary metal. We aspire to utilize only recycled or renewable content in vehicle plastics.\n\nCarbon-Free Energy Strategy\n\nWe are committed to reducing the effects of our operations and supply chains through world-class facilities, including our commitment to sourcing 100 percent carbon-free electricity for our global operations by 2035. To replace fossil-based generation, we\u2019ll be procuring a mix of wind, solar power, nuclear, geothermal, biomass, energy storage, and hydro.\n\nWater Strategy\n\nOur 2025 Global Manufacturing Water Strategy aims to continue Ford\u2019s position as a leader in water reduction and secure optimal freshwater availability in local communities. We continue to integrate more water-efficient processes and technologies as we work to further decrease our water consumption.\n\nWaste Strategy\n\nThe focus of our global waste strategy is to manage and minimize the waste we generate. We strive to reduce costs and keep waste out of landfill. We aim to eliminate single-use plastics from our operations by 2030 and aspire to reach true zero waste to landfill across our operations.\nOur leadership in sustainability enables our business today, sets us on the pathway for a continued strong business for decades to come, and will help build a better world, where every person is free to move and pursue their dreams.\n\n**Climate Change**\nAchieve carbon neutrality no later than 2050\n\n**Waste**\nReach true zero waste to landfill across our operations\nEliminate single-use plastics from our operations by 2030\n\n**Air**\nAttain zero emissions from our vehicles and facilities\n\n**Energy**\nUse 100 percent carbon-free electricity in all manufacturing by 2035\n\n**Water**\nMake zero water withdrawals for manufacturing processes\nUse freshwater only for human consumption\n\n**Materials**\nUtilize only recycled or renewable content in vehicle plastics\n\n**Safety**\nWork toward a future that is free from vehicle crashes and workplace injuries\n\n**Human Rights**\nSource only raw materials that are responsibly produced\n\n**Diversity, Equity and Inclusion**\nCreate a truly diverse culture where everyone feels like they belong\n\n**Access**\nDrive human progress by providing mobility and accessibility for all\n\n**Our Sustainability Aspirations**\n## Accelerating Progress\n\nAs we take leadership of the electric revolution, we can provide new sustainable vehicles and mobility solutions that positively impact health and safety around the world \u2013 from human rights to climate change.

When it comes to effective and strategic sustainability reporting, we must decide on what information is most important and to whom. Our materiality assessment helps us identify, refine, and assess key environmental, social, and governance issues to inform our corporate sustainability strategy and reporting.\n\nOur Materiality Process\nWe conduct materiality assessments every two years, and carried out our most recent analysis in early 2021. We consider material information to be of greatest interest to our stakeholders, so they can make informed decisions and judgments about the company\u2019s commitment to environmental, social, and economic progress.\n\nThe process involves:\n- **Identification**: We created and maintain a list of potential issues, grouped into four categories: Environment, Social, Governance, and Economic. These were identified through research that included a peer review, stakeholder interviews, a media scan, and an assessment of sustainability thought leadership from industry experts and associations.\n- **Prioritization**: We continue to identify and prioritize key challenges and opportunities that we address through our Ford+ plan and other initiatives.\n- **Review**: The results of the analysis were reviewed by a range of internal and external stakeholders. We made revisions based on the analysis to ensure that our process and list of issues were comprehensive and well understood, and reflected stakeholder views and feedback.\n\nOur Materiality Matrix\nThe materiality matrix plots the ratings of each issue. The x-axis represents the impact that economic, environmental, and societal issues have on our business, while the y-axis represents the influence on stakeholder decision-making. Issues found toward the upper right-hand corner of the matrix are of higher influence and importance to both Ford and stakeholders.\n\nAligning with the thoughts of some of our stakeholders, we believe that:\n- COVID-19 doesn\u2019t represent a material issue in and of itself; rather, it acts as an amplifier of the positive and negative impacts of other material issues\n- Just Transition and climate justice sit at the intersection of many material issues, but do not need to be called out specifically\n\nRead more about our approach to materiality and for definitions of material issues in our GRI Index in our ESG Data Book\n\nMateriality Matrix\n\n| Materiality Matrix | Impact on Ford | Influence on Stakeholder Decision-Making |\n|--------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Electrification and Alternative Fuels/Batteries | High | High |\n| Vehicle/Product Safety and Quality | High | Medium |\n| Economic Performance | Medium | Medium |\n| Climate Change, Air Quality and Renewable Energy/Energy Future | Medium | Low |\n| Employee Wellness, Health and Safety | Low | Low |\n| Human Rights and Supply Chain Management | Low | Low |\n| Transparency, Ethics and Integrity | Low | Low |\n| Human Capital and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion | Low | Low |\n| Mobility Solutions and Autonomous Vehicles | Low | Low |\n| Accountable and Inclusive Governance | Low | Low |\n| Socioeconomic Contribution and Community Engagement | Low | Low |\n| Sustainable Materials \u2013 Material Design and Management | Low | Low |\n| Water Use/Water Stewardship | Low | Low |\n| Waste Management | Low | Low |\n| Environment | Low | Low |\n| Economic/Innovation | Low | Low |\n| Society | Low | Low |\n| Governance | Low | Low |\nBuilding a better world can only be accomplished through collaboration. Finding a solution to the climate crisis will require meaningful participation from all of us, from government to environmental advocates and the private sector. Through dialogue with our stakeholders, we build trust, identify trends and emerging issues, and have the support we need to achieve both our business goals and sustainability aspirations.\n\nCeres Stakeholder Committee\nAs in recent years, a stakeholder team selected by Ceres provided recommendations for our future reporting. Representing a range of constituencies and expertise the most recent Ceres Stakeholder Committee convened on Feb. 28, 2022. Ford\u2019s responses to their recommendations are summarized below.\n\nCeres Recommendation:\nSupport strong fuel economy standards for model year (MY) 2027 through MY 2030.\n\nFord Response:\nWe believe that climate change is a shared global challenge that affects all of us. Ford has strengthened its support for commitments to limit global temperature increases consistent with the Paris Agreement. Ford seeks to achieve carbon neutrality globally no later than 2050 across our vehicles, suppliers, and facilities, and we have set out a strategic path to accelerate our progress, backed by science-based targets. Ford is the only full-line U.S. automaker committed to doing its part to reduce CO2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement and working with California for stronger vehicle GHG standards. Ford supports EPA\u2019s proposals to increase the stringency of fuel economy standards, which intend to deliver similar GHG reductions as the California Framework Agreement.\n\nCeres Recommendation:\nProvide more information about the full lifecycle impact of vehicles.\n\nFord Response:\nAutomobiles are among the world\u2019s most recycled consumer products. Over 85% of vehicle parts and materials are actually recycled and reused at their end of life. By using recycled and renewable materials in our vehicles\u2019 design, we\u2019re reducing landfill waste and using fewer natural resources. Ford is the largest automotive closed-loop aluminum recycler in the world. We worked closely with our aluminum sheet suppliers to create unique alloys just for closed-loop recycling.\n\nOur LCA-based studies evaluate potential environmental implications of vehicle raw materials and manufacturing: for example, recycled polymers, cradle-to-gate impacts of lithium-ion batteries, and additive manufacturing. We are collaborating with Redwood Materials to integrate battery recycling into our domestic battery strategy. Redwood\u2019s recycling technology can recover, on average, more than 95% of strategic materials such as nickel, cobalt, lithium and copper.\n\nCeres Recommendation:\nProvide more information around data privacy and driver and pedestrian safety as they relate to autonomous vehicles (AVs).\n\nFord Response:\nWe have adopted a holistic approach to protect customers\u2019 data and ensure their privacy that includes policies focused on transparency, responsible data handling and use, and choice. Ford has integrated cybersecurity with all stages of the vehicle lifecycle. We proactively assess the impact of cybersecurity on new areas such as data privacy, Ford Co-Pilot360 semi-automated driver assistance technologies and development of our fully autonomous vehicles.\n\nFord continues to collaborate with others to test autonomous vehicle technologies within several associations, as well as with lawmakers, regulators, and the public to realize the safety and societal benefits of autonomous vehicles.\n\nCeres Recommendation:\nStrengthen disclosure of supply chain risks and work to increase traceability and visibility within the supply chain.\n\nFord Response:\nIn 2021, we initiated battery supply chain mapping with RCS Global Group to gain greater transparency about the sources of the cobalt, nickel and lithium used in our EVs. This multi-commodity responsible sourcing audit program will strengthen our responsible sourcing capacity and drive continual improvements in transparency and responsibility in our raw material supply chains. Also, in 2021, we introduced a 100% response rate requirement from all in-scope suppliers for our cobalt due diligence program.\n\nCeres Recommendation:\nMake accessibility, meaning access to EVs and EV infrastructure, a focal point of Just Transition programs.\n\nFord Response:\nWe support a transition to electrification that is economically equitable. We are democratizing electric vehicles beginning with our iconic nameplates and are also expanding our charging network. Ford\u2019s BlueOval\u2122 Charge Network is the largest public charging network in North America offered by automotive manufacturing, with more than 20,500 stations (over 70,000 plugs) and growing. And, Ford is working to make electric vehicles more affordable by offering equitable and non-discriminatory financing for products that serve underserved borrowers. Financing may also relate to installation of charging infrastructure for individual customers.\nThe most significant risk factors applicable to our business are outlined below.\n\n**Operational Risks**\n\n**Ford+**: Our long-term competitiveness depends on the successful execution of Ford+, our plan for growth and value creation. Ford+ is focused on delivering distinctive and increasingly electric products plus always-on customer relationships and user experiences.\n\n**Climate Change**: The risks and opportunities associated with climate change shape the way we do business, including our global carbon reduction strategy focused on reducing emissions from our vehicles, operations, and supply chain. Extreme weather events such as storms or floods can disrupt production or component supplies, while droughts can affect our access to water for our operations, especially in water-scarce areas.\n\n**Public Health Issues**: Our financial condition and results have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by public health issues, including the health impacts of climate change and epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19. The impact of COVID-19, including changes in consumer behavior, pandemic fears, and market downturns, and restrictions on business and individual activities, has periodically created significant volatility in the global economy.\n\n**Safety Recalls**: Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy defects related to vehicle safety through safety recall campaigns. Our vehicles could be affected by defects that result in delays in launches, recall campaigns, or increased warranty costs.\n\n**Reliance on Suppliers**: We depend on our complex global supply chain to deliver components for our vehicles. Our products contain components sourced from suppliers that, in turn, source components from their suppliers. A shortage of key components, such as the semiconductor shortage, can disrupt the production of vehicles.\n\n**Cybersecurity Risks**: As we develop and produce vehicles with increased connectivity, operating, and security systems are more at risk from potential disruptions. We rely on information technology networks and systems, including in-vehicle systems and mobile devices to process, transmit, and store vital data. Despite data privacy and security measures, we are at risk of outages, cyberattacks, security breaches, or natural events, all of which could impact operational systems, compromise sensitive or personal information, or negatively affect the performance and safety of our vehicles.\n\n**Workforce Stability**: Our ongoing success depends on our ability to continue to recruit and retain a talented and diverse workforce that is highly skilled in engineering, software, technology, and other areas. Global competition for such talent is intense, with potential employees increasingly placing a premium on various intangibles, such as working for companies with a clear purpose, flexible work arrangements, and other considerations, and the loss of existing employees or an inability to recruit new employees could have an adverse effect on our business. Changes needing us to accelerate our ability to reskill, upskill and better develop our employees to complete our transformation to electrification also contributes to risk.\n\n**Macroeconomic, Market and Strategic Risks**\n\n**Market Competition**: Our products and services are subject to market acceptance as well as competition from other players in the automotive, mobility, and digital services industries. Although we conduct extensive market research before launching a vehicle or service, many factors within and outside our control can affect their success. For example, a shift in consumer preferences away from larger, more profitable ICE vehicles, due to rising fuel prices, a decline in the construction industry, or government actions or incentives, could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations in the near term.\n\n**Geopolitics**: With our global footprint and the increasing interconnectedness of the global economy, a geopolitical crisis or changes to/withdrawals from existing trade agreements could have an immediate and material impact on our results. The U.S. government has considered applying tariffs on automobiles, parts, and other materials that could disrupt existing supply chains, impose additional costs on our business, affect demand for our products, and make Ford less competitive.\n\n**Financial Risks**\n\n**Market Disruption**: Our business is susceptible to credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, and regulatory requirements, which may impact our ability to obtain unsecured funding at a reasonable cost. Moreover, if these events occur, Ford Credit may reduce the amount of receivables it purchases or originates because of funding constraints.\n\n**Government Incentives**: We receive economic benefits from national, state, and local governments around the world in the form of grants, loan subsidies, and tax abatements or credits. These incentives encourage manufacturers to establish or increase investment, workforce, and/or production. A decrease, expiration, or clawback of such incentives could impact our financial condition significantly.\n\n**Credit**: Ford Credit could experience higher credit losses, lower residual values, or higher return volumes for leased vehicles than expected. Credit risk (the possibility of loss from a customer\u2019s or dealer\u2019s failure to make payments according to contract terms) is heavily dependent upon economic factors such as unemployment, consumer debt service burden, personal income growth, and used car prices.\n\n**Pension and Other Post-retirement Plans**: The measurement of our obligations, costs, and liabilities associated with benefits related to our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans requires us to use assumptions to estimate the present value of projected future payments to all participants. If actual results are less favorable than our assumptions, we may recognize a substantial remeasurement loss in our results. In addition, if our cash flows and capital resources were insufficient to meet our post-retirement obligations, we could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, suspend dividend payments, or seek additional capital.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\n\nLitigation: We spend substantial resources complying with safety, emissions, and other standards and regulations. However, we cannot ensure that employees or individuals affiliated with Ford will not violate these regulations. Moreover, compliance with governmental standards does not necessarily prevent individual or class action lawsuits, which can entail significant cost and risk.\n\nProduct Modifications: The automotive industry is subject to safety, emissions, fuel economy, and other regulations that govern product characteristics, and these can differ regionally, nationally, or within a country. New regulations are continuously being proposed to address environmental concerns (including those relating to global climate change and its impact), vehicle safety, and energy independence, and the regulatory landscape can change quickly. To comply, we may need to substantially modify product plans.\n\nESG Disclosure: The EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) came into force on March 10, 2021, imposing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosure and reporting requirements on financial services participants, including investment firms and fund managers. The SFDR introduces disclosure obligations at both a firm and product level, requiring asset managers to disclose how sustainability risks are incorporated in their decision-making or outline the environmental or social benefits of certain products.\n\nRead more in our Form 10-K\n\nAdvancing STEM Education in the U.K.\n\n2021 marked the fifth year of our partnership with Primary Engineer \u2013 an educational nonprofit organization that encourages children and youth ages 3 to 19 to consider STEM and engineering careers. Employees from Ford\u2019s Dunton engineering campus volunteer their time at local schools training teachers on how to introduce engineering concepts, while helping lead a classroom-based engineering project that teaches students how to build electric vehicles. To date, the program has reached 65 schools and assisted 140 teachers and more than 3,483 students across the United Kingdom with the help of 45 Ford volunteers.\nBuilding the Future of Mobility\n\nDriving Innovation and Sustainable Growth\nOverview\n\nEverything we are doing \u2013 investing in electrification, enhancing connectivity, and developing new products and services \u2013 is to revolutionize and enrich the customer experience.\n\nOur approach is deeply rooted in customer insights, and we are creating an ecosystem around our products that drives deep loyalty. The foundation is our purpose \u2013 delivered through our Ford+ strategy \u2013 to help build a better world, in which every person is free to move and pursue their dreams.\n\nWe're investing in environmental and social projects. Based on our 2021 results, we see the Ford+ strategy is working, generating good progress in our financial, social, and business performance. Through our new Sustainable Financing Framework and our inaugural Green Bond, we're helping to drive human progress by investing in such key initiatives as Clean Manufacturing to create the future of industry. We also tied our Corporate and Supplemental Revolvers to sustainability-linked KPIs.\n\nWe will lead the electrification revolution. We are bringing electrification from the niche to the mainstream, electrifying our icons, including F-150 Lightning, Mustang Mach-E, E-Transit and Lincoln, and rapidly scaling up production and improving affordability.\n\nWe're investing $50 billion from 2022 through 2026 in electric vehicles (EVs), EV technology and charging infrastructure to remove obstacles and show customers the clear advantages of electric vehicles.\n\nFrom sustainability to performance to power and digital integration, Ford is creating capacity, capability, and convenience in our vehicles that were never possible before. And by working to close the loop on battery manufacturing, we can reduce emissions and even packaging. Through our focus on battery recycling, we will re-use valuable materials, recover precious metals, and help make electric vehicles more affordable.\n\nWe are expanding our capabilities to advance mobility innovations around the world. Our objective is to power the freedom to move every day, helping to make movement more accessible and seamless in cities while improving the safety and sustainability of the transportation ecosystem.\n\nSustainable Development Goals\nWe are contributing to the following UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):\n\nOur Sustainability Aspirations\n\nAccess: Drive human progress by providing mobility and accessibility for all\nEconomic Performance\n\n2021 Financial Highlights\n\n| Category                  | 2021       | 2020       |\n|---------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Revenue                   | $136.3B    | $127.1B    |\n| Net income/(loss)         | $17.9B     | $(1.3)B    |\n| Adjusted EBIT17           | $10.0B     | $2.5B      |\n| Adjusted EBIT margin17    | 7.3%       | 2.0%       |\n| Adjusted free cash flow17 | $4.6B      | $1.3B      |\n| Adjusted earnings per share17 | $1.59   | $0.36      |\n\nFull-year benefits from strong mix and net pricing, as well as lower warranty costs, more than offset the effects of the production losses and higher commodity costs. As a result, automotive EBIT of $7.4 billion and margin of 5.9% for 2021 were both significantly higher than in 2020.\"\n\nJohn Lawler,\nChief Financial Officer\n\nA Year of Important Progress on Our Ford+ Plan\n\nOur 2021 results show that our Ford+ Plan is working. We\u2019re seeing real traction and making tremendous progress in both our financial performance and the strategic direction of the business. Revenue, net income, and adjusted earnings before interest and taxes were all up, even though we sold nearly 250,000 fewer vehicles than we did in 2020 because of industry-wide semiconductor shortages and supply chain disruptions.\n\nWe continued to turn around our automotive operations and ensure Ford is competing to win in our areas of strength. We added exciting products to our lineup including the new Bronco, Bronco Sport, Maverick, and Mustang Mach-E \u2013 and announced new vehicles like the E-Transit, F-150 Lightning, and the next generation Ranger.\n\nOur operations outside of North America collectively posted their best results since 2017, largely driven by the success of our Global Redesign efforts. We have drastically de-risked and rationalized our global footprint and product lineup, including restructuring our business in India, and have vastly improved our earnings and cash generation power in the process.\n\nWe began to bring our vision of always-on experiences for retail and commercial customers to life, delivering over-the-air updates and fundamentally changing the culture of engineering inside Ford and driving the definition of next generation of connected vehicles.\n\nOur reinstatement of the quarterly dividend underscores our confidence in the improving run-rate of the business, and our ability to fund all future calls on capital.\n\nAccelerating Our Transformation, Unlocking New Growth Opportunities\n\nOur Ford+ growth plan is predicated on delivering a company adjusted EBIT margin of 8% by 2023, and the consistent generation of adjusted free cash flow to invest in accretive high-return opportunities, including electrification, connectivity, and customer-facing technology. At the top end of our 2022 guidance of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion in company adjusted EBIT, we would achieve that one year earlier than planned.\n\nIn March 2022, Ford accelerated our transformation by forming two distinct auto units \u2013 Ford Blue and Ford Model e \u2013 to enable us to compete and win against both new EV competitors and established automakers. Together with Ford Pro, these strategically interdependent businesses will help unleash the full potential of the Ford+ Plan and give us the confidence to raise our long-term company adjusted EBIT margin target to 10% by 2026.\n\nTo achieve this, we are increasing our planned global investment in EVs, including battery production, to $50 billion from 2022 through 2026. This will allow us to rapidly scale production capacity of our popular new electric vehicles to more than 600,000 by the end of 2023 \u2013 and grow that to an annual run rate of 2 million by 2026 when BlueOval City in Tennessee comes onstream. By then, electric vehicles will represent one-third of our global volume, growing to half by 2030.\n\nWith a focus on disciplined capital allocation, process simplification, and structural cost reduction, Ford Blue will serve as a profit engine for the company for years to come. It will generate the capital we need to fund a very exciting future \u2013 one that\u2019s both financially healthy and true to our purpose \u2013 and continues to create long-term value for shareholders.\n\nCorporate Issuer of the Year 2021\n\nFord has been awarded the International Financing Review\u2019s (IFR) Corporate Issuer of the Year for 2021 for funding a major electric vehicle push, while cutting costs and attracting the \u201cgreenest\u201d of capital \u2013 the largest ESG facility ever to be completed in the U.S. market. Ford was the first U.S. automotive manufacturer to issue a sustainability-linked loan.\n\nRead more about us delivering Ford+ on p.19\nElectrification and Connectivity\n\nLeading the Electrification Revolution\nWe are investing $50 billion in electric vehicles from 2022 through 2026 to electrify our icons, build out EV charging infrastructure, create a digital ecosystem with trusted customer service, and to take our suppliers on this journey with us.\n\nWe expect fully electric vehicles to account for 50% of our global sales volume by 2030. The demand for our first wave of EVs \u2013 Mustang Mach-E, E-Transit and F-150 Lightning \u2013 has exceeded our expectations. By the end of 2023, we will have the global capacity to produce 600,000 EVs annually to meet the demand.\n\nElectric vehicle customers are looking for a differentiated experience \u2013 more digital with remote services, always-on engagements, and products that get better over time. We are expanding our capabilities to serve these new customers and drive loyalty \u2013 and it\u2019s working. More than 90% of Mustang Mach-E owners said they would recommend it to others.\n\nWe are also mindful that this move to electrification will affect our key stakeholders, including our own employees. This is why we are considering a Just Transition \u2013 to accelerate our ability to reskill, upskill, and better develop our employees and people in the communities where we operate. We aspire to further our purpose of building a better world and providing people with tools to help them move forward and upward.\n\nOur electrification strategy is a critical component of Ford\u2019s goal to achieve carbon neutrality globally no later than 2050. Ford is the only full-line U.S. automaker committed to doing its part to reduce CO2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement and working with California for stronger vehicle GHG standards.\n\nAs part of this effort, Ford joined RouteZero, a global coalition working towards all sales of new cars and vans being zero emission vehicles by 2040 globally, and no later than 2035 in leading markets \u2013 to curb global warming.\n\nIn addition to electrifying vehicles in high-volume segments, another key component of our strategy is to ensure access to lower-cost, high-performing battery technology and create a closed loop manufacturing system. Through Ford Pro, we will also help small and large businesses globally transition their fleets to zero emission vehicles by providing a suite of support, including EV consulting, charging, telematics, service, and financing.\n\nAnd with more than 2,300 EV-certified dealers across all 50 states \u2013 and over 650 Commercial Vehicle Centers in the U.S., 90% of which are EV-certified \u2013 we stand ready to help customers make the transition to electric vehicle ownership.\n\n50% of Ford\u2019s global vehicle volume to be fully electric by 2030\n\nFord has signed the ambitious RouteZero initiative which aims to reduce carbon associated with road transportation. We join more than 50 businesses, cities, and regions that have pledged to work together toward 100% zero-emission cars and vans globally by 2040, and in leading markets no later than 2035. Electrification represents the most transformative change of our industry in over 100 years.\u201d\n\nStuart Rowley, President, Ford of Europe\n\nLincoln Celebrates 100 years and Announces All-Electric Portfolio by 2030\nAs the Lincoln brand celebrates its 100th anniversary in 2022, plans are underway for its exciting, electric future.

Along with our partner, SK Innovation, we plan to invest $11.4 billion and create nearly 11,000 new jobs at the Tennessee and Kentucky mega-sites.\n\nThe all-new mega campus in Stanton, Tennessee, called BlueOval City, will be among the largest auto manufacturing sites in U.S. history, encompassing vehicle assembly, battery production, recycling, training and technical education programs, and a supplier park. The vertically integrated system will deliver cost efficiency while minimizing the carbon footprint of the manufacturing process, including the potential to use local renewable energy sources such as wind, solar power, nuclear, geothermal, biomass, energy storage, and hydro. The assembly plant will be designed to be carbon neutral with zero waste to landfill once fully operational.\n\nBeyond its payload and towing capabilities, the F-150 hybrid and electric models both feature optional Pro-Power Onboard, a power back-up system that transforms the vehicle into a generator that can supply enough juice to run tools at your workplace or appliances on the go. The F-150 Lightning also has Intelligent Backup Power, the ability to power your home in an outage for 3-10 days.18\nIn central Kentucky, we will build a dedicated battery manufacturing complex called the BlueOval SK Battery Park with SK On, a wholly owned subsidiary of partner SK Innovation focused on the battery business. Twin battery plants on the site, as well as one in Tennessee, are intended to supply Ford\u2019s North American assembly plants with locally assembled batteries for powering next generation electric Ford and Lincoln vehicles. Three plants will be capable of producing up to 129 gigawatt hours annually, which will be expanded by mid-decade to 141 gigawatt hours, enough to build more than one million electric vehicles.\n\nOur investment in BlueOval City in Tennessee and the BlueOval SK Battery Park in Kentucky sets a new standard for scale, sustainability, advanced manufacturing, and training for the next generation of technology leaders.\n\nAfter investing $7 billion in Michigan since 2016, and committing $700 million for the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center a year ago, we are investing an additional $250 million across the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center, Van Dyke Electric Powertrain Center, and Rawsonville Components Plant to help increase production capacity of the F-150 Lightning to 150,000 trucks a year.\n\nWe are also collaborating with Redwood Materials, a leading battery materials company, to make electric vehicles more sustainable and affordable for Americans by localizing the supply chain network, creating recycling options for scrap and end-of-life batteries, and ramping up lithium-ion recycling. We believe battery recycling is essential for the success of an electrified future and has the potential to offer significant economic benefits.\n\nBlueOval City\u2019s assembly plant will harness Ford\u2019s global manufacturing expertise and cutting-edge technologies to deliver cost efficiencies and the quality that our customers expect. This will enable Ford to lead in the race to bring dependable, affordable, and advanced electric vehicles to even more Americans.\u201d\n\nKumar Galhotra, President of Ford Blue\n\nMeanwhile, we are working with other automakers in markets where we don\u2019t have scale but see opportunities. As part of our global alliance with Volkswagen, Ford will build a new electric vehicle for Europe based on its Modular Electric Drive, or MEB, architecture beginning in 2023. The arrangement, focused on small to mid-size electric vehicles, will lead to a highly differentiated experience for our European customers and expand Ford\u2019s zero-emission capabilities in the region.\n\nAnd to transform America\u2019s auto technician industry, we have made a $525 million investment across the U.S. during the next five years. The investment will go toward job training and career readiness initiatives to develop highly skilled technicians that can support our growing portfolio of connected electric vehicles.\nExpanding Global Electrification Capabilities\n\nOur electrification plans are global, with facilities in Europe gearing up for the industry-changing transition.\n\n100% of Ford\u2019s passenger vehicles in Europe will be zero-emissions capable by 2026 and all-electric by 2030\n\nGermany\nSpearheading our advance into an all-electric future is a new $1 billion investment to modernize Ford\u2019s vehicle assembly facility in Cologne, one of our largest manufacturing centers in Europe and the home of Ford of Europe. The investment will transform the existing vehicle assembly operations into the Ford Cologne Electrification Center for the manufacture of electric vehicles, Ford\u2019s first such facility in Europe. Ford\u2019s new European-built, volume all-electric passenger vehicle will roll off Cologne\u2019s production line in 2023.\n\nRomania\nWe will invest $300 million to build a new light commercial vehicle in 2023 at our Craiova Assembly Plant in Romania, including an all-electric version due to debut in 2024 \u2013 the first all-electric Ford volume vehicle to be built in Romania.

Halewood will be our first electric vehicle component in-house assembly site in Europe with production beginning in 2024.\n\nChina\nThe first Mustang Mach-E manufactured in China officially rolled off the assembly line in October 2021. Manufactured at Changan Ford\u2019s manufacturing plant in Chongqing, the locally produced Mustang Mach-E became available for delivery to customers in China by the year\u2019s end, providing Chinese customers with the driving pleasure associated with the electric SUV. Ford inaugurated 25 electric vehicle stores in major metropolitan areas by the end of 2021 and expects to expand to 61 stores within 2022.\n\nThe Mustang Mach-E in China\nThe award-winning Mustang Mach-E was officially delivered to the first customers in China on December 26, 2021. The locally produced Mustang Mach-E is being sold through a growing network of direct-to-customer Ford Select stores located in major Chinese metropolitan markets. Currently, there are 25 such stores in China dedicated to the sale of Ford electric vehicles.\n\n25 stores in China dedicated to the sale of Ford electric vehicles\nAccelerating Battery R&D\nTo accelerate research and development of battery and battery cell technology, we announced the establishment of the Ford Ion Park global battery center in southeast Michigan. Here, state-of-the-art equipment will be used to pilot new manufacturing techniques that will help the company quickly test and scale battery cell designs with novel materials.\n\nWe also recently increased our investment in Solid Power, an industry-leading producer of all-solid-state batteries for electric vehicles. Showing great promise, these batteries are designed to power longer-range, lower-cost, and safer electric vehicles using existing lithium-ion battery manufacturing infrastructure.\n\nResearch Goal: Recharging EVs as Quickly as Gas Fill-ups\nFord researchers have successfully completed an early step in collaboration with Purdue University: we have invented a new, patent-pending method for charging stations that could one day deliver significantly more power compared to today\u2019s leading systems.\n\nUsing liquid as an active cooling agent, the concept uniquely changes the liquid to vapor and could combine with in-development vehicle charging technology to lower the average time to recharge electric vehicles. This innovation could one day deliver significantly more power to charge electric vehicles than today\u2019s leading systems, making possible faster re-charging times if vehicle charging and other technology enhancements are made in parallel. Ultimately, this could lead to re-charging EVs as quickly as conventional gas station fill-ups.\n\nExpanding our EV Charging Network\nAlong with a variety of home charging solutions, Ford\u2019s BlueOval\u2122 Charge Network is the largest public charging network in North America offered by automotive manufacturing, with more than 20,500 stations (over 70,000 plugs) and growing. Built-in cloud-connected navigation routes customers to nearby charging stations, recommends where to charge on trips and provides easy access and payment via FordPass for a seamless retail customer experience.\n\nMeanwhile, we are teaming up with the nation\u2019s leading solar company, Sunrun, to facilitate easy installation of the 80-amp Ford Charge Station Pro and home integration system to generate Ford Intelligent BackUp Power. Customers will also have the opportunity to install solar energy on their home to power their household with clean, affordable energy and charge their F-150 Lightning with the power of the sun.\n\nAdditionally, our commercial vehicle arm, Ford Pro, launched Ford Pro Charging for managing commercial EV fleets and charging needs. To transition to electrification, fleet owners will receive software and commercial hardware infrastructure to support charging and energy management.\n\nIn Europe, the IONITY high-power charging network will grow 7,000 charging points by 2025, to create a supporting infrastructure as we accelerate the electrification of our vehicles.\n\nDeveloping Alternative Powertrains and Fuel Options\nAs we launch electrified versions of our most popular nameplates, we will continue researching and developing alternative powertrains and fuel options across all our vehicles, to provide customers with efficient, low-carbon alternatives. This effort includes the development of hydrogen fuel cell technology, with a primary focus on medium/heavy-duty vehicles to offer payload and uptime advantages that provide total cost-of-ownership benefits. Ford is partnering with the U.S. Department of Energy to develop and demonstrate five hydrogen fuel cell electric Class-5 Super Duty trucks through the DOE SuperTruck 3 program. The project\u2019s goals are cost, payload, towing, and refueling times that are equivalent to conventional gasoline trucks.\n\nSince not all commercial vehicle operators will make the move from the conventional internal combustion engine to all-electric vehicles, powertrain technologies, from mild hybrids to plug-in hybrids, give them the power of choice as a significant part of the next generation Transit Custom range.\n\nAlternative fuel vehicles can reduce GHG emissions on a well-to-wheels basis, which includes emissions from both producing and consuming the fuels.\n\nRead more about our Sustainable Financing Framework and our investment in Clean Transportation on p.27\nElectrification and Connectivity \u2013 continued\n\nConnectivity\nIn addition to electrification, the transformation of Ford vehicles includes making them \u201csmarter\u201d and connected through cloud-based technology, providing vital information and new capabilities to owners.\n\nFord, Google Technology Powerhouse\nIn 2021, Ford and Google announced a unique strategic partnership to accelerate Ford\u2019s transformation and reinvent the connected vehicle experience. Ford also named Google Cloud its preferred cloud provider to leverage Google\u2019s world-class expertise in data, AI, and machine learning (ML). As part of this new, six-year partnership \u2013 and beginning in 2023 \u2013 millions of future Ford and Lincoln vehicles at all price points will be powered by Android, with Google apps and services built-in.\n\nTo drive ongoing innovation, Ford and Google established a new collaborative group, Team Upshift. Leveraging the talent and assets of both companies, Team Upshift will push the boundaries of Ford\u2019s transformation, unlock personalized consumer experiences, and drive disruptive, data-driven opportunities. This may include projects ranging from developing new retail experiences when buying a vehicle to creating new ownership offers based on data, and more.\n\nAs Ford continues the most profound transformation in its history with electrification, connectivity, and self-driving, Google and Ford coming together establishes an innovation powerhouse truly able to deliver a superior experience for our customers and modernize our business.\n\nFord Power-Up Software Updates Strengthen Customer Relationships\nWith Ford Power-Up software updates, we can deliver regular vehicle enhancements to Ford owners, turning connected vehicle learnings into continuous quality improvements, new features, and capabilities. New Ford Power-Up features and enhancements already have been sent to owners of Bronco, F-150, Mustang Mach-E, and other vehicles as part of Ford\u2019s plans to produce 30 million vehicles with advanced software update capability by 2028. These capabilities are designed to strengthen customer relationships with digitally enabled tools like FordPass and Lincoln Way, online ordering, simplified financing and renewal options, vehicle pickup and delivery services, and mobile repairs. Such tools will extend digital support to customers by fully integrating best-in-class technology.\n\nThese services are expected to speed the detection and resolution of quality issues using connected data, which will help raise customer satisfaction and lower warranty costs, deploy distinctive connected functions like Ford\u2019s BlueCruise hands-free driver-assist technology, seamless Amazon Alexa Built-In hands-free home and vehicle voice commands, new features and upgraded software content, and EV charging to improve the user experience. Such connected services are projected to be a $20 billion market by 2030.\n\nMore than 30M Power-Up-enabled Ford and Lincoln vehicles by 2028\nMobility Solutions and Autonomous Vehicles\n\nThe Freedom to Move\nTo expand real-world experiences, we are investing to help make movement more accessible and seamless while improving the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of the overall transportation ecosystem \u2013 especially digital capabilities for developing robust mobility and connected vehicle services that benefit cities and citizens.\n\nMobility can help give people the freedom to move and pursue their dreams \u2013 including access to education, jobs, housing, and healthcare. Our vision for the future of urban mobility is a transportation ecosystem that helps improve how people get from point A to point B more seamlessly, deliveries to get people the goods they need, better parking, and traffic flow, while addressing such challenges as climate change and air pollution.\n\nWe continue to collaborate directly with cities and other key stakeholders to help them solve their mobility issues and deliver our own mobility products and services to help make lives better.\n\nPath to Autonomous Services Coming to Life: Lyft and Walmart\nFord remains focused on large-scale deployment of autonomous vehicles as a service \u2013 ride-hailing to move people and delivery to move goods \u2013 across multiple U.S. cities starting in our launch city markets of Austin, Texas, Miami, and Washington, D.C.\n\nWhile we continue to improve the technology and build a robust self-driving system with our partner Argo AI, we have also made progress over the last year in bringing these services to life through our collaboration with Lyft, one of the largest transportation networks in the U.S., and Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer.\n\nTogether, with Lyft and Argo AI, we announced in 2021 that we are deploying Ford autonomous vehicles, with safety drivers, on the Lyft network in Miami and in Austin, available this year. As vehicles are deployed, Lyft users within defined service areas will be able to select a Ford autonomous vehicle powered by the Argo Autonomy Platform to hail a ride.\n\nThis unique collaboration brings together all of the parts necessary to create a viable autonomous ride hailing service, including the autonomous technology, vehicle fleet, and transportation network needed to support a scalable business and exceptional experience for riders. This initial deployment phase will lay the groundwork for scaling operations across multiple markets over the next five years.\n\nFor delivery, we are working with Walmart and Argo AI to deploy an autonomous vehicle delivery service in Miami, Austin, Texas, and Washington, D.C. \u2014 Walmart\u2019s first multi-city autonomous delivery collaboration in the U.S. The delivery service will use Ford autonomous vehicles equipped with the Argo Autonomy Platform to deliver Walmart orders to customers. This multi-city service makes it possible for customers to place orders online for groceries and other popular items, while providing autonomous deliveries directly to their homes.\n\nBy testing and developing autonomous technology for urban areas, where customer demand is high, we are demonstrating the potential for autonomous vehicle delivery services at scale.\n\nFor Mobility Solutions: The City:One Program\nThe City:One program uses a community-centered approach to develop innovative mobility solutions that address safety, sustainability, equity, and accessibility to support the ever-changing mobility needs of cities and their residents.\n\nIn 2019-2020, we hosted City:One Challenges in four locations: Indianapolis, Michigan Central Station in Detroit, Austin, and Mexico City. In working with those communities, we generated more than 400 proposals and secured nearly $1 million in funding to support tangible and equitable mobility pilots for residents, workers, and visitors. In 2021, multiple Challenge winners began activating their mobility pilots to deliver real-world impact.\n\nFor example, in coordination with 20 local Detroit partners and eight high school students from Mercy Education Project, one of three Michigan Central Station City:One Challenge winners, the group launched a mobility hub in Roosevelt Park, Detroit. The young women, with community input, created a space that provided a welcome, safe environment with access to and information about mobility options including bikeshare and bike racks; access to Spin scooters and chargers; and real-time updates on transit, as well as extensive lighting, murals developed by local artists and a waiting area with WiFi, charging, and seating. The hub also offered COVID-19 vaccinations and testing through a partnership with Ford and Wayne Health/Wayne State University.\nDuring the last three years, Ford has been restoring historic buildings, including the iconic Michigan Central Station, constructing new ones and building out connected spaces in Corktown, Detroit to transform the area into Michigan Central, a mobility innovation district that brings together innovators to incubate and speed development of transportation solutions. While construction is still underway, innovation in the district is already happening. One example is a partnership with Newlab, a New York-based accelerator, that began in 2020. Together, Michigan Central and Newlab have created two innovation studios. One to address mobility issues on a macro scale with an EV track focused on electrifying commercial fleets, as well as an AV track focused on the first and last 50-feet of a journey of moving goods. The second, a civic studio \u2013 Accessible Streets \u2013 designed to improve transportation and access in the neighborhoods around Michigan Central Station \u2013 upholding our commitment to the local communities.\n\nIncubating Transportation Solutions\n\nDuring the last three years, Ford has been restoring historic buildings, including the iconic Michigan Central Station, constructing new ones and building out connected spaces in Corktown, Detroit to transform the area into Michigan Central, a mobility innovation district that brings together innovators to incubate and speed development of transportation solutions.

We\u2019re doing just that by conducting pilots and testing in and around Michigan Central. In collaboration with a Ford Fund and Gleaners Community Food Bank food delivery program called FREC (Ford Resource and Engagement Center) on the Go, we are operating a pilot through the summer of 2022 to deliver fresh produce to mobility-challenged senior citizens via an autonomous low-speed shuttle. The shuttle will make deliveries each month from the Ford Resource and Engagement Center in Southwest Detroit to the Rio Vista Co-Op Apartments senior living center.\n\nIn addition to our work with Argo AI, the Ford Autonomous Vehicle team is collaborating with Saline, Michigan-based Quantum Signal AI LLC, a wholly owned Ford subsidiary, to explore using a low-speed shuttle to operate autonomously on a fixed route with the help of remote operations and smart infrastructure.\n\nWhile the shuttle will operate autonomously with a safety driver, we are looking at how a remote operator from more than 40 miles away in Saline, could assist the shuttle if an unexpected condition arises, such as a fallen tree branch from a storm in the middle of the road.\n\nWe also are building off of our work in Saline and Miami, and have installed multiple Ford-designed smart infrastructure sensor nodes along the shuttle test route, which can relay information to an autonomous vehicle, so it knows what\u2019s happening on the ground before it even arrives at an intersection or other piece of roadway. For example, if the vehicle\u2019s sensors are blocked by a truck, the node helps the vehicle to see that a pedestrian or vehicle is approaching.\n\nTo improve how people and goods move in the future, we need to explore different mobility applications to understand how they can address real transportation needs in communities. We\u2019re doing just that by conducting pilots and testing in and around the Michigan Central.\n\nThe design of the shuttle from the interior to the exterior was created by our Experience Design (XD) team whose mission is to understand the customer and create value. The team will conduct focus groups to engage with residents about the pilot and to better understand the challenges they face when it comes to transportation and their freedom to move.\n\nAs a result of the six-month pilot, more than 20 residents will receive two deliveries per month complete with fresh milk and produce \u2013 highly requested items based on feedback \u2013 which is expected to provide an expected 10,000 pounds of fresh healthy foods.\n\nWe believe this type of autonomous application could be used in the future and could help support more frequent trips and deliveries in our communities. As a step in our journey, we will continue to use the open innovation platform at Michigan Central to build mobility solutions for the future.\nCollaborating for the Safe Deployment of Autonomous Vehicles\n\nFord continues to collaborate with others testing autonomous vehicle technologies within several business associations, as well as lawmakers, regulators, and the public to realize the safety and societal benefits of autonomous vehicles. Additionally, Ford participates in various consortiums addressing the safety challenges autonomous vehicles face through the development of industry best practices and standards. Some of Ford\u2019s collaborative efforts include:\n\nAMP \u2013 Ford has joined with other autonomous vehicle developers in the U.S., to form the Automated Mobility Partnership (AMP), which is geared towards the use of real-world driving data to inform the development of automated driving systems.\n\nAVSC \u2013 Ford is a founding member of the Autonomous Vehicle Safety Consortium (AVSC), convened by the SAE International and SAE Industry Technologies Consortia (SAE ITC). This consortium is working together to advance safer testing, development, and deployment of autonomous vehicles through the establishment of industry best practices. The following AVSC best practices have been developed and released to date: Fallback Test Driver, Operational Design Domain, Passenger-Initiated Emergency Trip Interruption, Data Collection, First Responder Interactions, Metrics and Methods for Assessing Safety Performance, Adapting a Safety Management System (SMS) for ADS Testing and Evaluation, and Evaluation of Behavioral Competencies.\n\nPAVE \u2013 The Partners for Automated Vehicle Education (PAVE) coalition is dedicated to educating the public about automated vehicles and the increased safety, mobility, and sustainability benefits they can provide.\n\nPEGASUS \u2013 Along with other autonomous vehicle developers, Ford has joined the Project for the Establishment of Generally Accepted quality criteria, tools and methods as well as Scenarios and Situations for the release of highly-automated driving functions. This effort is intended to identify areas for international collaboration and harmonization on safety assurance for automated driving systems, and initiate steps to make progress towards collaboration and harmonization.\n\nAmong our ongoing autonomous vehicle regulatory and policy efforts are the Alliance for Automotive Innovation and the Autonomous Vehicle Industry Association (formerly Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets), where we are working with industry to advocate for the safe and expeditious deployment of AVs while promoting the benefits of the technology. Ford is proactively engaged at the UNECE to shape requirements to allow for the deployment of autonomous vehicles at the national level to engage with authorities to bring these vehicles to market.\n\nIn 2021, Ford joined the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u2019s (NHTSA) AV Test Initiative. Through this voluntary initiative, NHTSA aims to provide an interactive tool that will keep the public up to date on the states and companies using autonomous vehicle technology on public roads, and we will support by sharing details about Ford\u2019s autonomous vehicles, testing, and operations.\n\nImproving Accessibility for People with Disabilities\n\nOur customers want choices \u2013 to be able to pick a vehicle they like with the features and accessories they need to drive safely and comfortably. This process can be particularly challenging for people with disabilities who want to be as mobile as everyone else. This is why Ford is transforming its design thinking to be more inclusive for customers with diverse abilities.\n\nThe Ford Accessibility Program, offering a variety of adaptable vehicles to meet different needs and budgets, makes it easier for persons with disabilities to get on the road. To broaden these capabilities in a high-tech world, we launched a series of internal webinars and events to raise awareness and increase engagement across the company on issues of vehicle accessibility. These learning events have included direct engagement with a group of customers who have one or more disabilities, to advance discussions on inclusive design practices. Ford is also continuing this inquiry as a member of the Autonomous Vehicle Alliance (AVA) and as a sponsor of AVA\u2019s most recent research on accessible and barrier-free autonomous vehicles, while actively participating in and helping facilitate informative webinar sessions organized by the AVA, Intelligent Transportation Society of America (ITSA), and other partner organizations.\nBuilding the Next Generation\n\nPutting People First\nOur purpose as a company is to help build a better world. It is a core value, ingrained in our DNA since our company\u2019s founding and it continues to drive us today. At the heart of this commitment is a pledge to care for each other and put people first in everything we do \u2013 whether we\u2019re designing vehicles and experiences for our customers; caring for and engaging with our employees; or uplifting and strengthening communities through our philanthropic efforts.\u201d\n\nMary Culler, President, Ford Motor Company Fund\n\nOverview\n\nOur commitment to care for each other shapes how we operate. People come first. As we take action and move into an exciting future \u2013 from addressing climate change to making the transformation to electrification \u2013 we are dedicated to making sure that all feel welcome and included.\n\nBecause when we build a better world for our employees, suppliers, dealers, community partners, and, of course, customers, we continue to earn trust and succeed as a company. And when we ensure a future that\u2019s inclusive, equitable and sustainable, we change the world in the right way.\n\nWe prioritize health and safety.\nFord has a commitment to deliver the highest level of safety and health to ensure the wellbeing of our customers and employees, and the broader communities where we live, work, and serve.\n\nWe care for each other.\nOur commitment to care for each other is a central part of the Ford+ Plan. We demonstrate our commitment with our actions, building our culture of belonging through training, awareness, and strong talent pipelines, as well as providing programs that protect the health, safety, and wellbeing of our employees.\n\nWe treat customers like family.\nWe have a responsibility to our customers. Treating customers like family is a key principle of our approach in every interaction.\n\nWe\u2019re focused on protecting and respecting human rights.\nWe empower employees to protect people and the environment, and expect that our suppliers and business partners do the same.\n\nWe\u2019re engaged on developing a Just Transition.\nAs a leader in sustainability and human rights, we believe we have a responsibility to the world around us. We can help with a Just Transition, support our communities, and contribute to a society that is more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable.\n\nWe are bringing our vision of always-on experiences to life for retail and commercial customers.\nBy elevating the customer experience, we continue to save time, uplift, and deliver ever-greater value. Our end-to-end solutions help lower total cost of ownership for our customers, and in particular, reduce complexity for commercial customers.\n\nSustainable Development Goals\nWe are contributing to the following UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):\n\nOur Sustainability Aspirations\n\n- **DEI:** Create a truly diverse culture where everyone feels like they belong\n- **Safety:** Work toward a future that is free from vehicle crashes and workplace injuries\n- **Human Rights:** Source only raw materials that are responsibly produced\nHuman Capital and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nEmpowering Our People To Improve Our Business\nFord is a family company in more ways than one. Our culture is anchored in shared beliefs and ideals and acting for the common good. We are fostering a culture of belonging for every employee and creating the freedom for them to move throughout the organization and pursue their dreams. Driven by our purpose, our employees are at the center of how we execute our transformation.\n\nThe Ford Culture\nFord has taken an unprecedented journey to shift its culture with a clear aspiration of where we are heading. We have a solid foundation with Our Purpose, Ford+, and our Ford+ Behaviors, and we have a plan to reach our aspiration to build a culture of empowerment and belonging.\n\nWe are capitalizing on new opportunities that are critical and belonging.\n\nWe are upskilling and reskilling employees in our transformation and Ford+ journey.\n\nEngaging With Employees\nEmployee engagement is vital to advancing our inclusive culture. We foster dialogue with our employees at all levels of the business through channels including; our intranet site and website; corporate publications and reports; social media; webcasts and executive Q&A sessions with senior management; labor-management committee meetings; regular \u201cGlobal Town Hall\u201d meetings with direct updates from senior leaders; and Employee Resource Group (ERG) initiatives. We heard from thousands of employees throughout the year, giving us a significant insight into where we have done well and where we need to apply more focus. In 2021, 87% of employees surveyed, which were primarily salaried employees, stated that they have the flexibility to balance the needs of their work and personal life. Employee responses also indicate that employees are excited about what Ford can accomplish in the future.\n\nOur efforts to build inclusive work environments and foster a culture of belonging in our U.S. manufacturing facilities is ongoing. In 2021, Culture Managers in Chicago, Kentucky, Kansas City and the Rouge implemented the Manufacturing Culture Playbook, which provides a framework for plant leaders to assess their work environments with the purpose of building plant-specific actions that anticipate, prevent, or address issues and sustain positive cultures. By mid 2022, all plants in the U.S. and Canada will be supported by a Culture Manager.\n\nFor more than two decades, Ford\u2019s Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) have provided support, outreach, mentoring, and development to all employees. ERGs are sponsored by our senior leaders and are open to all our employees. Our ERGs host a range of professional, educational, and cultural events as well as supporting our diversity-related efforts in recruitment and community outreach.\n\nTraining and Developing Our Talent\nOur future success depends on our people. We believe that ongoing training, learning, and development are critical elements to providing employees with insight into organizational skill needs, developing learning solutions to address those needs, and enabling them to improve performance through skills application is critical to our transformation. We continue to make learning and development opportunities a central part of our brand to help attract and retain top talent.\n\nIn 2021, we focused on energizing our 15,000+ people leaders to be catalysts, leading their teams to deliver Ford+, and building the foundation for long-term success.\n\nRead more about us delivering Ford+ on p.19\nWe deployed a new set of global talent assessments to help identify capability gaps across the organization, in the context of Ford+. In response, new developmental experiences for executives and people leaders are being designed and implemented. From a learning standpoint, focus areas include digital transformation, DEI, and new ways of working.\n\nWe have begun to replicate the Ford Software Academy model across other areas, including Leadership and Manufacturing. The transformation from internal-combustion-engine to electric vehicles demonstrates the opportunity to upskill and reskill our employees as part of a Just Transition strategy, as well as remaining competitive in the industry.\n\nMentoring is also a key strategy to engage our employees and help them grow. 2022 brings the launch of a new, 2-million-square-foot building forming the focal point. It will be integrated into the surrounding community and feature a range of mobility solutions.\n\nFor example, we\u2019re transforming our Research and Development Center in Dearborn into a high-tech campus with a new, 2-million-square-foot building forming the focal point. It will be integrated into the surrounding community and feature a range of mobility solutions.\n\nWe are actively reviewing opportunities to expand access to learning resources to employees in these countries to help them develop skills necessary to succeed in the global economy and prepare them for the transition to electrification.\n\nEmployees in these markets routinely access learning resources supporting development in critical business skills that include data analytics, design thinking, and electrification, along with power skills that include leadership, diversity and inclusion, and cross-cultural competence. The ability to conduct self-ratings for skills has also been instrumental in preparing for the workforce of tomorrow, with over 6,000 skills rated within IMG and 96,300 skills rated overall within Ford.\n\nWe are actively reviewing opportunities to expand access to learning resources to help our hourly workforce overcome barriers that inhibit self-development and individual growth.\n\nDeveloping Skilled Trades\nOur commitment to talent development is also illustrated in the development of our skilled trades workforce. Ford has committed $5 million in ongoing capital investment into the UAW-Ford Technical Training Center (TTC). In partnership with local community colleges, local, state and federal agencies, and union leaders, the TTC is a world-class center for apprentice training development and skilled trades recruiting and training. In 2021, almost 1,800 participants utilized training at the TTC as part of their development.\n\nDeveloping People in Emerging Markets\nOur International Markets Group (IMG) consists primarily of employees in countries recognized as emerging markets. Ford is working aggressively to deliver top quality learning resources to employees in these countries to help them develop skills necessary to succeed in the global economy and prepare them for the transition to electrification.\n\nEmployees in these markets routinely access learning resources supporting development in critical business skills that include data analytics, design thinking, and electrification, along with power skills that include leadership, diversity and inclusion, and cross-cultural competence. The ability to conduct self-ratings for skills has also been instrumental in preparing for the workforce of tomorrow, with over 6,000 skills rated within IMG and 96,300 skills rated overall within Ford.\n\nWe are actively reviewing opportunities to expand access to learning resources to help our hourly workforce overcome barriers that inhibit self-development and individual growth.\n\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion is not a program or initiative at Ford. It\u2019s about embedding DEI into how we operate as a company, while honoring the one basic need common to every single human on the planet: the need to belong.\u201d\n\nLori Costew, Chief Diversity Officer\n\nAttracting Tomorrow\u2019s Talent\nTomorrow\u2019s opportunities call for candidates with experiences of all kinds. Inclusive hiring is the foundation of what we believe and what we do. At Ford, we understand that our differences, and our uniqueness, help make us stronger and more innovative; they also reflect the customers we serve.\n\nWe\u2019re expanding our approach, our reach and shifting our skill and degree requirements to attract great talent in a competitive environment. We are also evolving how and where we source our talent as many employees are no longer bound to physical locations.\n\nAI is helping us eliminate bias in the recruitment process by putting students in front of us that we might never have considered before (and vice versa). This is a shift from where we were just two years ago where we recruited from a set list of schools. We now recruit from anywhere as part of our model and are able to go where the talent exists.\n\nIn our U.S. Recruiting, we have significantly expanded outreach to women, minorities, veterans, and people with disabilities. We\u2019re transforming campus recruiting using AI and are leveraging tech and platforms to reach new schools. We\u2019ve opened attendance at recruitment events and removed the blockages which kept students from attending.\n\nExploring the Future of Work\nIn March 2021, Ford announced an intent to shift to a hybrid work model for non-place-dependent global employees when people return to the office. To support leaders managing the transition to the hybrid work model, resources and training have been provided.\n\nNonetheless, it is important that our physical work environments support the next century of innovation at Ford. We have accelerated our campus transformation plans and are developing world-class workplaces centered on integration, interaction, and co-location. For example, we\u2019re transforming our Research and Engineering Center in Dearborn into a high-tech campus with a new, 2-million-square-foot building forming the focal point. It will be integrated into the surrounding community and feature a range of mobility solutions.\nRemote Employees\u2019 Freedom to Move\n\nAs the pandemic transformed the way we work, we found new ways to get things done. Working remotely all across the country, Ford Buyer on the Electrified Powertrain Team Leilani King discovered the value of work/life balance, saying, \u201cWhether it was early morning, or I was signing on from a tent on the Oregon Coast, the opportunities remote work presented made me far more motivated about my job.\u201d Leilani traveled as far as California, Oregon and Hawaii while still being there for her team. \u201cI\u2019m living our Ford\u2019s Purpose in a way that was never previously possible,\u201d she says.\n\nEmbracing Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nWe can only achieve Ford+ when everyone at Ford is able to be themselves to do their best work. In short, we are committed to our DEI north star: We are family. We celebrate our differences. We all belong.\n\nGuided by these principles, we are focused on building a workforce that is equipped to meet the challenges ahead \u2013 social justice concerns, DEI, Just Transition, and electrification \u2013 all important issues for Ford\u2019s employees, suppliers and the communities we serve.\n\nGovernance and accountability are core to making sustainable progress in our DEI commitments. In addition to regular discussions, quarterly updates with composition data are given to Ford Leadership and the Board of Directors. As a member of the CEO Action Pledge for Diversity and Inclusion, we have publicly pledged to act on supporting more inclusive workplaces.\n\nDEI Audits and Improvement Plans\n\nIn 2021, we extended our U.S. DEI Audit to seven major markets \u2013 Canada, China, Germany, South Africa, Mexico, U.K., and India. The audits encompassed a deep dive into each country\u2019s qualitative and quantitative data through focus groups, surveys, and interviews. We were able to gain insights into employee beliefs, all with a goal of developing a deeper understanding of how our team was feeling and why. While culture and issues differ around the world, a common theme emerged that not all our team members feel like they belong. We listened and now each Business Unit and Skill Team is committed to continued action.\n\nAnother insight gained is we were not leveraging our ERGs enough. Now multiple ERGs including Women of Ford, Ford Empowering Diverse Abilities (FEDA), Ford Pride, Ford Employees African Ancestry Network (FAAN), and Ford Hispanic Network (FHN), are providing input into improving the employee experience, product programs, and marketing. For example, ERGs provided input to help the campus transformation team better understand the needs of our employees. Their partnership led to spaces with more inclusive designs, greater accessibility, the addition of wellness rooms, quiet zones, and gender-neutral bathrooms.\n\nDEI Data and Insights\n\nData visibility is essential to building trust internally and externally. Not only have we launched a new DEI dashboard for senior leadership, but we also provide regular DEI updates in our Global Town Hall Meetings and through our internal websites.\n\nThrough all of these efforts, the \u201cBelonging\u201d Index scores increased significantly across all demographics in our 2021 annual sentiment (PULSE) survey.\n\n2021 Gender and Race/Ethnicity Metrics\n\n| Metric | Percentage |\n|--------|------------|\n| Of our global salaried workforce: | |\n| Female | 28.1% |\n| Minority groups, of which: | |\n| African American | 22.5% |\n| Asian | 5.8% |\n| Hispanic/Latino | 4.3% |\n| Other Minorities | 2.2% |\n| Of our 15 Board Directors: | |\n| Women | 4 |\n| Minority groups | 2 |\n| Of our 39 corporate officers: | |\n| Women | 7 |\n| Minority groups | 7 |\n\nThrough experiential learning and engagement we\u2019ve been able to foster open dialogue across the company and build empathy with events like the Truth & Reconciliation Day in Canada, Juneteenth in the U.S., Global DEI Week, and the global Day of Understanding. None of these events would have been successful without passionate employee volunteers teaching and organizing.\u201d\n\nAmal M. Berry, Senior Manager, DEI\nGender and Racial Diversity Goals\nIn 2021, we created Aspirational Goals to increase the gender representation and racial diversity of our senior leadership. These goals are tracked quarterly by every Skill Team and Business Unit Leader. We are seeing progress in the diversity of senior leadership \u2013 an increase in women leaders globally and an increase in racial minorities in the U.S. indicate that we are on track to reach our 2025 Aspirational Goals.\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity\nOur EEO-1 report provides a snapshot of our U.S. demographics as of year-end 2021, based on occupational categories prescribed by the federal government that aggregate jobs with widely varying skill requirements. Approximately 95% of all Ford Motor Company hourly and salaried positions fall into just four of the 10 categories. The usefulness of this data for measuring diversity success, and for making direct comparisons to the workforce of other companies or other industries with different job structures, is therefore extremely limited.\n\nTo address these shortcomings, Ford has developed a more robust supplemental report that disaggregates technical jobs in fields such as engineering and information technology, which pose recruiting challenges that are very distinct from non-technical roles. The supplemental report also provides more nuanced breakdowns of diversity at various managerial levels.\n\nWe are committed to equal pay for equal work. Employee compensation in each market should be fair and equitable, irrespective of gender, race, or similar personal characteristics. Equal pay for equal work applies to all forms of pay, including base salary, incentives, bonuses, and other forms of compensation.\n\nRead more about our equal pay policy in our Human Rights Report\nRead more in our U.S. EEO-1 and Ford Supplemental Diversity Report\n\nOur DEI Recognitions 2021\nAwards from external organizations are proof points we are building the Ford brand around the world and help us attract candidates in the global competition for talent. Internally we celebrate employees who serve as DEI champions. In 2021, more than 40 individuals and teams around the globe were honored with DEI Employee Awards to recognize their contributions in creating a culture of belonging. They were selected from a group of 300 nominations.\n\nFor the fourth year in a row, Ford was recognized on the Bloomberg GEI which tracks the performance of public companies in the areas of inclusive culture, anti-sexual harassment policies, pay equity, female leadership and talent pipeline, and pro-women brand.\n\nDuring Global DEI Week, Ford employees around the world were invited to participate in the first ever DEI Art Challenge. One-hundred team members from 11 countries expressed themselves by creating an art piece that showed what diversity, equity, and inclusion mean to them.\n\nRight: Jose Mala Neto\nBelow left: Peter Watson\nBelow right: Pustin Mccandles\nHuman Capital and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion \u2014 continued\n\nU.S. Racial Equity\nStakeholders and subject matter experts work alongside our Racial Equity Director to ensure equity in employee policies, processes and procedures. These efforts help reduce bias and remove challenges along the employee journey that might prevent equitable career development. One example is our Level Up Sponsorship program which matches high-potential talent from underrepresented groups with sponsors.\n\nWe\u2019re also providing opportunities for our employees to learn and share their experiences with race. The Dare to Care in the Living Room series has brought insight and built empathy across multiple topics including the violence against Asian Americans and the experience of being women of color.\n\nGiving our employees a forum to share their experiences and reaction as they manage their response to social injustice issues outside of Ford is important to us. We worked with our ERGs to develop wellness sessions for members on a regular cadence that catered to the needs of our diverse populations. For example, we partnered with our ERGs to offer wellbeing sessions for our employees and UAW workers after the trial of Derek Chauvin in the George Floyd murder and with our Veterans after the U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nOn Juneteenth, a federal holiday marking the celebration of freedom from slavery, we took action to acknowledge and remember those who did not.\n\n\u201cEvery Child Matters\u201d designed orange shirts to honor the Global Caring Month. For the sixth consecutive year, Ford Credit China has participated in the Blue Ribbon Disability Awareness Day in recognition of Indigenous children and to increase awareness in every aspect of political, social, economic, and cultural life.\n\nBuilding an Inclusive Workforce\nOur FordWorks inclusive hiring program helps us deliver on-the-job training and employment opportunities to neurodiverse individuals. Equitable pay and continual development of FordWorks employees are core values of the program. In 2021, we were recognized by the Disability Equality Index (DEI), a joint initiative of Disability:IN and the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) as a Disability Equality Index Best Place to Work, for the fifth year in a row. Our score of 100% demonstrates our adherence to leading disability inclusion practices featured in the DEI.\n\nFord Empowering Diverse Abilities (FEDA) has several members who collaborate on accessible vehicles. Their collective expertise includes both hardware and software development. Emily Obert, co-president of FEDA, is an engineer who uses a wheelchair. She is part of the AV Experience Design team, and her lived experiences help inform better, more intuitive AV products and experiences.\n\nDEI Education and Inspiration\nThe global DEI audits also uncovered varying levels of awareness and understanding, which can impact empathy and employees\u2019 ability to relate to others\u2019 experiences. This is why we are investing heavily in opportunities for learning and education. Our DEI Learning Strategy follows the sequence: Creating Awareness, Deepening Our Understanding, and Leading with Action.\n\nWe increased traditional learning opportunities, with courses including Women Rising, Understanding Systemic Racism, and Men as Allies. Significant learning resources are also available on demand on the Degreed interactive learning platform.\n\nDegreed offers all Ford salaried employees diverse learning opportunities for professional and personal development. The curated educational resources (over 250,000 courses and 3 million articles/videos) cover numerous topics, including many dimensions of diversity, equity, and inclusion and allow for a self-guided learning approach. The DEI Learning Plan on Degreed is designed to meet people where they are on their DEI journey and provide a space to create awareness, deepen understanding, and lead with action to cultivate a culture of belonging for all. As of the end of January, we have 52,670 total users in the platform.\n\nIn U.S. manufacturing facilities, over 70 UAW and salaried employees are certified to train new employees as part of the onboarding program about the importance of DEI including the UAW-Ford commitment and behaviors critical to creating a respectful workforce.\n\nIn addition, we held numerous global programs to raise awareness and inspire our employees.\n\n\u2022 In China, Ford Credit organized various programs during the Global Caring Month. For the sixth consecutive year, Ford Credit China has participated in the Blue Ribbon Project to provide rehabilitation training for eligible children with autism and their parents for free.\n\n\u2022 In Europe, International Day of Persons with Disabilities was celebrated through a series of events aimed at promoting the rights and wellbeing of persons with disabilities in all spheres of society and development and to increase awareness in every aspect of political, social, economic, and cultural life.\n\n\u2022 In Canada, Ford held its first ever National Truth and Reconciliation day in recognition of Indigenous children placed in assimilation schools in Canada by holding dialogue and panel discussions. Employees wore \u201cEvery Child Matters\u201d designed orange shirts to honor the healing journey of Indigenous communities; for the children who survived Canada\u2019s residential schools, and remember those who did not.\nHuman Capital and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion \u2014 continued\n\n\u2022 In our International Markets Group (IMG), colleagues in countries including Australia, India, and South Africa, launched the IMG Learning Zone to promote awareness and understanding on key diversity related topics and to advance inclusion among all ethnic and gender groups.\n\nA Look Ahead\nOur DEI journey is ongoing. Making sustainable progress is our core focus and we will continue to hold ourselves accountable. In 2021, each corporate officer had a DEI objective and in 2022 this was expanded to all salaried employees globally. We will continue building our data gathering and metrics capability in order to leverage actionable insights. This includes a voluntary self identification initiative to gather multiple demographics intended to provide more accurate and robust data including multiple gender options and LGBTQ+ status.\n\nWhile metrics and actions are important, the sense of belonging that occurs when we get this right is game changing for our team and Ford+. We are committed to building DEI into our policies, systems, and processes in order to create sustained change across the business.\n\nDEI in Dealerships\nFord is committed to transforming our independent Ford and Lincoln dealer network to better represent the communities we serve, and we are working with dealers to understand the customer and dealership employee experience. In the U.S. we are helping to increase the number of female and minority owned dealerships. In 2021 we increased Black-owned dealerships by 15% and plan to continue this progress.\n\nIn 2021, we worked with a third party on a survey to help dealers globally better understand their environment and their communities. We sought to understand current DEI efforts in Ford dealerships, and analyzed the potential impact of DEI efforts on the employee and customer experience.\n\nBased on the data collected from the nearly 200 dealers located in our 10 most diverse U.S. markets, we learned that dealers with women and employees of color in management positions largely outperformed the dealers who lacked diversity in management.\n\nBest practice sharing will help all dealers identify their own gaps and provide ideas on how to better acquire, develop, and retain key talent that can assist the dealership in their efforts to better represent the communities they serve.\n\nWe leveraged dealer council and national meetings to drive home the thought \u201cI need to represent my community.\u201d Not only is it the right thing to do, but it increases business opportunities as well by enhancing customer experience for everyone who walks into the stores.\n\nFor example, a Ford dealer in Texas who participated in our study and conducted their own internal assessment identified a DEI blind spot and an opportunity to ensure that Spanish speaking customers were able to be helped by dealership employees who can speak Spanish, and they also enhanced their website and social media to be in both English and Spanish languages.\n\nSupplier Diversity and Inclusion\nDiversity and inclusion permeates the core of our company \u2013 from the diversity of our product offerings and global workforce, to our strategic partners, supply base, and dealers. We remain committed to support, develop, grow, and promote our diverse suppliers while expanding the economic impact and growth in the community for a more sustainable future.\n\nIn 2022 we will launch the Ford Software Academy, designed to provide our talent with a space to learn, grow, collaborate, and build their capabilities. More than a collection of courses, the Ford Software Academy will be a fully realized journey, sponsored by business leaders, and built to support career-long learning. This investment in our employees will demonstrate our commitment to competing like challengers with best-in-class talent.\nIn 2021, Ford purchased goods and services worth:\n\n- **$7.46B** from minority-owned suppliers\n- **$1.15B** from women-owned businesses\n- **$0.13B** from veteran-owned companies\n- **$5B** from small businesses\n\nTo date, we have sourced over $170 billion in goods and services with diverse-owned businesses in the U.S. In an effort to expand our spend, Ford made a strategic decision to identify global initiatives to support businesses owned by people from diverse backgrounds, beginning with women-owned businesses. We are in the discovery phase of expansion, identifying current suppliers that could qualify as a women-owned business.\n\nTo ensure diverse suppliers are considered through the entire supply chain, Ford has added Supplier Diversity and Inclusivity language into the Purchasing Global Terms & Conditions. We are encouraging suppliers to establish a Supplier Diversity & Inclusion program with specific goals and metrics on diverse supplier spend. Diverse spending by Tier I suppliers is part of our consideration for sourcing opportunities.\n\nFord is an active participant in supplier development diversity programs including:\n\n- **MentorWE** \u2013 helps certified women owned businesses to advance and develop their businesses through executive mentors. The program was co-developed with the Great Lakes Women\u2019s Business Council (GLWBC). In 2021, a MentorWe Technology cohort was developed for women in technology.\n\n- **Driving A Better Tomorrow (DABT)** \u2013 spotlights diversity, inclusion, and sustainability for our supply team. In 2021, DABT brought awareness to the Ford Purchasing and Supplier Technical Assistance community on the importance of education with sessions highlighting Ford of Mexico\u2019s Schools Program which provides education for children in need and the Lighthouse Program, which gives girls in India the opportunity to attend school. This set the tone for a program on eradicating child labor.\n\n- **Collaborative Growth Initiative** \u2013 the Michigan Minority Supplier Development Council\u2019s Collaborative Growth Initiative (CGI) Program is intended to assist high-performing Minority Business Enterprises (MBEs) by strategically growing their businesses.\n\n- **Tier 2 (Widening the Inclusion Network) WIN Program** \u2013 is designed to further develop our Tier 1 partners Supplier Diversity programs through coaching, mentorship, and thoughtful partnerships with other diverse businesses.\n\nUsing the Michigan Minority Supplier Development Council (MMSDC) UniTier Tier II diverse reporting platform, Ford captured and reported Tier I suppliers\u2019 commitment to the growth and development of diversity in the supply chain. Through UniTier reporting, Ford Tier I suppliers spent more than $3 billion with certified diverse suppliers.\n\n**Supplier Diversity and Inclusion Awards 2021**\n\nWe are proud of the external recognition our supplier diversity efforts have received:\n\n- WeConnect International, Top 10 Global Champions in Supplier Diversity. We were the only automotive company to receive this award\n- WBENC, Top Corporations \u2013 Gold\n- Disability:IN, DEI Index \u2013 Score of 100\n- Great Lakes Women\u2019s Business Council, Excellence in Supplier Diversity\n- National Minority Supplier Development Council, Corporation of the Year\n- Michigan Minority Supplier Development Council, Corporation of the Year\nEmployee Health, Safety and Wellbeing\n\nCaring for each other is core to Ford. At Ford Motor Company, we strive to put people first and create a culture that\u2019s focused on doing the right thing \u2014 and that includes employee health, safety, and wellbeing.\n\nAfter all, our most valuable asset is our people. From a strong and caring response to COVID-19 to ensuring a safe and healthy work environment on site and at home, health, safety, and wellbeing are an essential part of the Ford culture.\n\nCaring for Our People\nFord is a Fortune 500 company with a family feel. Promoting safety, health, and wellbeing is a collective effort, and everyone at Ford plays an essential role. Following workplace health and safety guidelines is our way of contributing to the broader community. However, simply complying with applicable laws and regulations is not enough. That\u2019s why many of our internal standards go beyond what\u2019s required to meet our commitment to our workforce in all our locations. As a salient human rights issue, not only are we focused on physical health and safety, but our employees\u2019 mental health and wellbeing are a priority as well.\n\nOccupational Health and Safety\nSafety at Ford Motor Company is guided by our Health and Safety Commitment, \u201cOur Most Valuable Asset is our People, there can be No Compromise.\u201d This commitment is the basis of our safety culture and applies to all employees, contractors, and visitors performing work at our locations globally.\n\nEmployees at every level are responsible and accountable for the company\u2019s overall safety initiatives and performance. Safety performance is managed by Senior Leadership through Plant Operation Reviews (POR), Manufacturing Safety Councils (MSC), and Plant Safety Review Board meetings (SPRB).\n\nWe continually monitor and improve workplace safety through our internal Safety Operating System (SOS). Safety performance is measured with leading and lagging indicators. The leading indicator is Global Corrective Action Completion Percentage, this tracks the closure of corrective actions by due date. Lagging indicator is Global Lost-Time Case Rate.\n\nSafety Operating System\nThe global Safety Operating System (SOS) is an internal tool that ensures the work environment within our facilities is safe for our employees and meets or exceeds all regulatory and Company safety requirements. It provides a structured framework that enables the delivery of consistent results by ensuring the SOS principles are an ongoing, proactive process which is directed by leadership.\n\nThe process validates that each global manufacturing facility has the capability and the adherence to meet our safety requirements. The SOS is designed to prevent and reduce incidents through the implementation of the different elements such as: Incident Investigation and Analysis, Training, Risk Assessment, Emergency Preparedness, and other sections which incorporate the health and safety of our employees daily.\n\nThe results of each location\u2019s SOS self-assessment are reviewed globally by the Manufacturing Vice President, each Manufacturing Director in their Manufacturing Safety Council meetings, and at each facility during their plant Safety Process Review Board meetings. The Safety Operating System continues to mature and adjust as new standards and processes are added to our facilities and the use of technology is expanded.\n\nOur SOS is designed to prevent and reduce incidents. In addition, we have internal hazard identification, risk assessment, and incident investigation processes implemented throughout our organization. Requirements pertain to contractors and all personnel on Ford majority-owned facilities, including Pre Task Analysis (PTA) identifying work hazards and mitigation, in case of occurrence. All PTAs are monitored by Ford. Contractors are instructed to report any job hazards to their supervisor and Ford representative.\n\nFord has a longstanding history of working with unions that represent production workers, skilled trades, and engineers to improve health and safety for our employees and workplaces. We are committed to supporting these unions and collective bargaining to ensure the health and safety of our union represented employees and locations. The company has designated members of management that interact with Union representatives at local, national, and global levels, to ensure we have open communications and collaboration to work through contractual requirements.\n\nOne of the strengths of the safety organization is the dedicated resources we have placed within our manufacturing engineering teams to ensure that engineered systems are designed and installed resulting...\nin safe operations for our employees. We also have safety resources assigned to oversee high-risk construction contractor work. Our dedicated resources in these critical areas of our business, along with robust standards and procedures, assure we provide safe conditions and a safe workplace at every Ford facility.\n\nSafety training is an essential strategy to help us achieve our aspiration of a future that is free from workplace injuries. We have a long history of developing industry best in class safety training programs. Our safety training matrix lists all safety topics, the frequency for each training course, the personnel that are required to complete training, and who manages the training and training format.\n\nWe conduct regular communications and promotions on key safety issues to promote occupational health and safety. We have robust reporting processes, including all injuries, hazards, and near-misses, so we can corrective actions are taken and prevention measures are implemented. We also share safety best practices via multi-industry groups, within and outside the automotive sector, and collaborate to address common issues.\n\nOur Safety Record\nIn 2021, we continued to focus on identifying potentially fatal events and high-potential incidents involving our employees and contractors globally. From these incidents, global corrective actions are initiated and tracked to ensure that the identified causal factors are addressed. These corrective actions are tracked weekly to ensure timely completion.\n\nDue to these efforts, we have had very good success with reducing these types of events including two consecutive years without a workplace fatality in 2019 and 2020. Unfortunately, in 2021, we did experience three fatalities within our operations, two employees and one service contractor. Because each loss of life is unacceptable, cross-functional teams worked extensively to identify and implement controls to address the hazards which created these life-changing events.\n\nCOVID-19 Response\nWe continue to rely on our best-in-class COVID-19 playbook to guide our response to the ongoing pandemic and the protocols we developed remain in place. Our goal is to keep all of our people safe and help limit the spread of the virus in the communities in which we live and work. We continue to closely monitor and follow health and wellness guidance from experts around the world. We also strive to keep our employees educated about the virus, its symptoms, and preventative measures they can take.\n\nKeeping our place-dependent employees healthy and safe is an overarching goal. From the factory floor to the loading docks to the office, our employees are crucial to the company\u2019s performance.\n\nWe welcomed the availability of vaccines and recognize their value. Globally, we\u2019ve partnered with our unions to provide on-site COVID-19 vaccinations for our employees at numerous facilities.\n\nIn November 2021, Ford became the first U.S. automaker to require vaccinations for salaried employees. Additionally in November 2021, our Canadian employees, both hourly and salaried, were also required to disclose their vaccination status.\n\nWellbeing\nOur global, holistic approach to wellbeing encompasses the financial, social, mental, emotional, physical, and professional needs of our employees. Foundational to our wellbeing philosophy is providing a broad array of...\nresources and solutions to educate employees, build capability, and meet individual and organizational wellbeing needs and goals. Wellbeing is an integral part of our total rewards strategy. We are working to address business and employee challenges through a multi-channel approach that provides our diverse populations and global regions flexibility and choice to meet their specific needs.\n\nWe use data-driven insights gathered through surveys, focus groups, and claims data to understand employee needs and prioritize our wellbeing efforts. Some examples of our global wellbeing initiatives include building our global pool of trained and certified Mental Health First Aiders to provide peer to peer mental health support, Mindfulness clubs, and World Mental Health Day observances, among other things.\n\nWe also launched a new employee experience with a global wellbeing site, self-guided tools, and access to the professional support and resources to help employees achieve their own sense of wellbeing. In addition, we provide financial wellbeing support through access to investment advice and financial literacy sessions. We are committed to creating an environment where employees and People Leaders care for each other as we deliver the business objectives outlined in our Ford+ strategy.\n\nTo demonstrate ways we care for our employees, we focused many of our wellbeing efforts on mental and emotional resources mentioned above and also including the following:\n\n- Live chats with our leadership and mental health experts to help decrease stigma as well as raise awareness of mental health and issues such as burnout\n- Global Employee Assistance Programs which provide counseling support 24/7\n- DEI Wellbeing focused sessions\n\nEnabling Vaccine Availability\nWhen Ford employees were struggling to find COVID vaccines, Wendy Burkett, Director of Global Safety and Francesca Litow, Medical Director, got to work. After some dogged persistence with the Wayne County (MI) Dept. of Health, they were able to secure vaccinations for the following Monday, just two days away. Over a busy weekend, Wendy and Francesca engaged IT and Communications to quickly create an alert system and by 9:00 a.m. Monday, 800 of their colleagues were getting vaccinated.\n\nWe also set up immunization centers on-site at each of our two South Africa plants for employees and their dependents, on-site contractors, dealers, and suppliers and we administered 14,785 vaccine doses.\n\nSetting A New Standard\nToday as we excel into the future of revolutionizing our products through electrification, we have the unique opportunity to transform the industry\u2019s approach to manufacturing by focusing on human centered design. By leveraging the strategies proven successful in Ford office environments, coupled with conducting our own research, we have formulated five key priorities focused on health equity and wellness to address the occupational demands prevalent in manufacturing. It is our intention that through these priorities, Ford will not only improve the working conditions and health of its essential workers, but also lead the transformation of the industry\u2019s business-as-usual approach to manufacturing by focusing on environmental stewardship and social equity. These priorities, above all, aim to exemplify the power of Ford+.\n\nHealth Equity\nEveryone has a fair and just opportunity to be as healthy as possible.\n\nLearning and Growth\nEncourage exploration and development of soft skills and lifelong learning.\n\nEngagement and Choice\nEmpower choice of how to work, rest and play when possible and appropriate.\n\nCulture and Understanding\nAdvocate work-life integration and understanding of individual differences.\n\nEnvironmental Impact\nAlign our operations to our organizational values.\nHuman Rights and Supply Chain Management\n\nRespecting Human Rights\nOur commitment to respecting human rights is unwavering.\n\nFord\u2019s commitment to human rights was evident when Henry Ford introduced the $5 workday in 1914, launching the company\u2019s effort to democratize mobility and help create the middle class. This commitment stems from our purpose of helping to build a better world for all, and continues to guide our decision-making and actions both today and in the future. As we remain focused on respecting and supporting human rights within the company, we are also working with our suppliers and business partners to do the same.\n\nFormally committing to respecting human rights through our policy, We Are Committed to Protecting Human Rights and the Environment, we are also dedicated to a broader aspect of human rights \u2013 having a positive impact on the health, safety, and wellbeing of the communities where we live and work.\n\nWe have developed our social sustainability aspirations to align with our purpose to build a better world. To achieve these aspirations, Ford\u2019s Human Rights strategy, aligned with the United Nations Guiding Principles (UNGP) on Business and Human Rights, focuses on:\n\n- embedding the corporate policy into the business\n- due diligence processes to identify, prevent, mitigate and account for human rights impacts\n- providing remedial actions when needed\n- transparency with our stakeholders about our processes and actions\n\nGovernance of human rights issues begins with our CEO and Board of Directors and cascades through the organization, providing a framework to assess risk through the identification of salient human rights issues, conduct due diligence, and report transparently about our actions and processes. Ford conducts human rights risk assessments across its global facilities, in addition to the saliency assessment.\n\nIn 2021, our Salient Human Rights Governance team, with oversight from our Director of Global Sustainability, continued to manage and track our action plans to prevent, manage, and remediate salient human rights issues. This process helps us track the effectiveness of our due diligence systems and performance and indicates opportunities to further improve our efforts to address human rights, including those that affect how we source materials responsibly.\n\nBecause of our deep commitment to these issues, this year Ford has developed a stand-alone Human Rights Report, the first in the industry, to address our salient human rights issues, how they are managed, and the key actions that demonstrate our progress. It provides a more detailed look at our human rights activities and accomplishments, as well as the governance structure and practices in place to ensure implementation of our human rights strategy.\n\nIdentifying Our Salient Human Rights Issues\nWe conducted our third saliency assessment in line with the UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework (UNGPRF) to identify and prioritize salient human rights issues that apply throughout our business and supply chain. The saliency assessment helped us identify which human rights are considered at risk of the most severe negative impact through the company\u2019s activities and business relationships, and any emerging issues that ought to be monitored closely.\n\nOur Salient Human Rights Issues\nThrough our human rights saliency assessment, we have identified 10 salient human rights issues that apply throughout our business, our supply chain, and other business partners in our value chain.\n\n| Issue | UN SDGs |\n|-------|---------|\n| 1. Access to water and sanitation | 1, 2 |\n| 2. Air quality | 1, 2 |\n| 3. Child labor | 1 |\n| 4. Climate change | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 |\n| 5. Equal and fair wages | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 |\n| 6. Forced labor and ethical recruitment | 1, 2 |\n| 7. Harassment and discrimination | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 |\n| 8. Human trafficking | 1, 2 |\n| 9. Occupational health, safety and wellbeing | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 |\n| 10. Product safety and quality | 1 |\n\nMost salient Human Rights Issues for Ford\n\nRead more about the assessment process and actions we are taking to address these issues in our Human Rights Report.\nHuman Rights and Supply Chain Management \u2013 continued\n\nHuman Rights Within Ford\nOur commitment to respect human rights starts with our employees. We strive to maintain a safe and healthy work environment, do not tolerate harassment and discrimination, and follow ethical recruitment practices. Across Ford, we act with integrity and transparency, creating safe, inclusive workplaces.\n\nRead more about our Approach to Human Rights in our Human Rights Report\n\nThe global pandemic has sparked us to look at wellbeing in a more holistic way, considering the mental health of our employees in addition to their physical health. From labor protocols to care for site-dependent employees during the pandemic, to helping employees keep their skills current during the transition to EVs, we are committed to doing the right thing.\n\nExternal Recognition\nWe are receiving external recognition for our efforts. When Just Capital assessed how companies serve their workers, communities, shareholders and governance, customers and environment, we ranked #1 in the Automobile and Parts category and 20th overall.\n\nWe also participated in the World Benchmarking Alliance (WBA) Just Transition Framework for the first time in 2021. We scored as leaders on social sustainability and human rights in the automotive sector but we still have work to do to improve transparency and impact. We are taking action to address transparency in our Just Transition strategy.\n\nJust Transition\nElectrification represents a revolution in the auto industry, as it reshapes the future of work. We are mindful of the impacts on our employees, our supply chain, our communities, and our customers. We are addressing and evolving our Just Transition strategy as we move towards carbon neutrality and electrification.\n\nFord\u2019s transformation is shaped and impacted by complex external societal, geopolitical, and environmental factors. Digital transformation is reshaping how, where, and who works today.\n\nDigitization has disturbed business models across industries and new value streams emerge that require new skills and approaches. The global community is vastly underprepared for the upcoming impact of automation. McKinsey identified that <5% of jobs are fully automatable today, however 60% of jobs are at least 30% automatable.\n\nWith these changes Ford should consider accelerating our ability to reskill, upskill, and better develop our employees and people in the communities which we operate. We are introducing a new learning strategy to prepare Ford for today and into the future.\n\nSupporting a Just Transition will take ongoing effort. We believe that our initiatives to create employment at BlueOval City, invest in job training and career readiness initiatives for the next generation of technicians, introduce a new learning strategy at Ford, and democratize electrification are steps in the right direction. We are working to increase electrified vehicles and charging access as well as to develop new mobility solutions.\n\nRead more about our Just Transition plan in our Human Rights Report\n\nOur Human Rights Commitments\nAligned with the UNGP on Business and Human Rights, we are committed to respecting the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labour Organization (ILO)\u2019s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the United Nations Women\u2019s Empowerment Principles, and the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC). Our Global Framework Agreement (GFA) with IndustriALL Global Union reiterates our commitments to our global labor community.\n\nReskill Pilots\nSkill Sprint Program: a i4cp Next Practice Award Winner\nFaced with a disruption in our European markets due to factors including a shift in customer behavior, the move to a carbon-neutral transportation and a demand for device integration, we developed a Skill Sprint Program to enhance capability in the U.K. workforce at all experience levels. Ford of Europe put into effect four priority sprints, covering skills, environment, innovation, and digitization, to reskill and redeploy personnel, compete for talent against tech companies outside the automotive industry, and instill a continuous learning culture. The program, which has trained 1,400 people across disciplines and functions, was the i4cp Next Practice Award winner in 2021.\n\nLearn to Code Academy\nDigital transformation and our Ford+ Plan are driving major shifts in the skills required to successfully deliver for our customers. To help us develop software talent from within the company, Ford Credit is piloting a Learn to Code Academy which will reskill 20 non-technical talent for junior-level software engineering role using a 16-week experiential learning program. Other companies have used this curriculum with 95% success rate, and we are thrilled to see how it could address our software talent needs.\nHuman Rights and Supply Chain Management \u2013 continued\n\nHuman Rights in Our Supply Chain\n\nOur commitment to human rights extends to our supply chain. Ford\u2019s supply chain sustainability strategy is to build supply base capacity that exceeds minimum regulatory compliance requirements and creates shared business value.\n\nIn 2021 we established a formal Supplier Code of Conduct that applies clear requirements and expectations for all Ford suppliers in areas related to human rights, the environment, responsible material sourcing and responsible business practices. Available in eight languages, the new Supplier Code requires all suppliers to produce their parts, or the processes they utilize to produce their parts.\n\nThe Supplier Code of Conduct is incorporated within Ford\u2019s Global Terms and Conditions. In 2022, we are planning to integrate sustainability metrics into our production sourcing decisions to support supplier engagement and performance improvement.\n\nRead more about the Supplier Code of Conduct in the Our Approach to Human Rights section of the Human Rights Report.\n\nBuilding Supplier Capacity\n\nTraining and auditing of our suppliers is a key element of our due diligence process to enable a responsibly sourced supply chain.\n\nAs members of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) and Drive Sustainability, we supported the development and expansion of human rights and working conditions e-learning training modules and webinars launched in lieu of in-person training during the COVID pandemic. We extended invitations to suppliers based on risk assessment results.\n\nTo build supplier capacity on tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold (3TG) and cobalt due diligence, we leveraged resources such as the RMI eLearning Academy and our own Ford developed modules to train nearly 100 supplier companies in 2021.\n\nFord plans to continue collaboration with industry organizations to develop e-learning training. These trainings are a key element of our due diligence process.\n\nAssessing Our Supply Chain\n\nGiven the size and complexity of our supply chain, we focus on supplier sites with a higher risk for substandard working conditions based on their location, the type of parts they supply to Ford, or the processes they utilize to produce their parts.\n\nOur 2021 supplier risk assessment included data from suppliers representing over 85% of our production global spend. The risk assessment supports our audit selection processes and provides key insights into how we can improve our human rights program.\n\nIn terms of raw material sourcing, we identify and prioritize human rights risks based on the governance in place in raw material countries of origin and the vulnerability to child or forced labor through raw material extraction, harvesting, or processing.\n\nAuditing Our Supply Chain\n\nWe conduct Sustainability Self-Assessment Questionnaires (SAQs) with our production suppliers. The SAQ is based on the Global Automotive Sustainability Guiding Principles and Practical Guidance, which have been developed through a collaboration of global original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).\n\nA growing element in our due diligence efforts, the SAQ is aligned with the Supplier Code of Conduct, and as such is used to assess supplier sustainability and to support Ford in identifying social and environmental risks throughout our supply base.\n\nWe are in the process of scaling the SAQ to our entire production supply base with the goal of 100% response rate, enabling us to verify that supplier policies and practices meet the standard of our Supplier Code of Conduct. In 2022, we are planning to use this information to integrate sustainability into our sourcing decisions.\n\nThird-party social responsibility audits let suppliers know whether they meet their contractual obligations to Ford and our expectations while highlighting areas for improvement. As an RBA member, we use its Validated Audit Protocol (VAP) to assess labor, health and safety, management systems, ethics and environmental issues in our supply chain. By the end of 2021, we had conducted 1,227 supplier audits and 1,676 follow-up assessments worldwide since our program began.\n\nFord is First U.S. Automaker to Join IRMA\n\nFord is proud to become the first American automaker to join the initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA), expanding the company\u2019s commitment to safeguard human rights, communities where such work is done, and the broader environment. IRMA works to advance responsible mining practices, providing third-party verification and certification against comprehensive environmental and social criteria for all mined materials.\n\nFord\u2019s IRMA membership is another step towards the company\u2019s human rights aspiration to responsibly source all raw materials used within vehicles globally \u2013 a journey Ford has been taking steps toward for over 20 years.\n\nAs an IRMA member, Ford communicated expectations to key suppliers to source mined material from suppliers committing to and/or participating in IRMA certification. We reached out to suppliers providing parts containing aluminum, steel, rare earth elements, palladium, cobalt, lithium & nickel. Suppliers were asked to identify sources of mined materials and complete a Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) Risk Readiness Assessment (RRA) to better understand our supply chain\u2019s current ESG practices and gaps as well as commit to engaging with IRMA in 2022.\n\nCASE STUDY\n\nFord is First U.S. Automaker to Join IRMA\n\nFord is proud to become the first American automaker to join the initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA), expanding the company\u2019s commitment to safeguard human rights, communities where such work is done, and the broader environment.

Suppliers were asked to identify sources of mined materials and complete a Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) Risk Readiness Assessment (RRA) to better understand our supply chain\u2019s current ESG practices and gaps as well as commit to engaging with IRMA in 2022.\nDue to the wider restrictions and site-level safety measures related to COVID-19, we had limited access to conduct audits at our planned supplier sites. In response, we utilized RBA\u2019s remote supplier audit process, including external validation and certification by the RBA, for a portion of our 2021 audits. For any nonconformances found during the audit process, we require suppliers to develop corrective action plans. We also provide suppliers with corrective actions needed to address gaps in alignment with Ford\u2019s Supplier Code of Conduct based on their SAQ responses.\n\nOur experience with audits demonstrates the willingness of suppliers and the effectiveness of the process to achieve progress at the facility level. We did not choose to end any supplier relationships due to unresolved audit findings in 2021.\n\nResponsibly Sourced Raw Materials\n\nWe aspire to source only raw materials that are responsibly produced. Sourcing responsibly the thousands of different materials is an important human rights issue. We continue to maintain a leadership position in addressing human rights issues associated with conflict minerals. We have a raw materials sourcing strategy that expands our due diligence program beyond conflict minerals to include mica, cobalt, lithium, rubber, and copper.\n\nIn 2021, we began mapping and auditing our EV battery material supply chains. The program will strengthen our responsible sourcing capacity, allow for better risk assessments, and drive continual improvements in transparency, and responsibility in our cobalt, lithium, and nickel supply chains.\n\nAdditionally, we launched a new cross-functional team, the Responsible Materials Council (RMC), to build capacity among Ford skill teams to educate suppliers, advocate for transparency, and influence ESG considerations in sourcing and designing decisions.\n\nTo help accomplish this strategy, Ford participates in industry and cross-industry associations and engagements that standardize tools, processes, and expectations so global suppliers can responsibly source materials.\n\nEmpowering Women with Responsible Mineral Sourcing Pilot Program\n\nFord is working with its international nonprofit and grant making partners to support and promote a pilot program that will empower women working in the copper and cobalt supply chains in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The region has emerged as a key resource for critical metals that have become the keystone of the energy transition as the automotive industry electrifies more vehicles.\n\nThe Promoting the Empowerment of Women in Copper and Cobalt Mineral Supply Chains program aims to increase access to profitable, sustainable enterprises by training women on financial education, business management, mining innovation and leadership, and formalizing women\u2019s Artisanal and Small Mine cooperatives that allow equal access to market opportunities. The program will track the impact of and inform future public policy and private programs through an analytical study on women in cobalt and Artisanal and Small Mines supply chains. The program addresses poverty, one of the root cause of child labor, and demonstrates how Ford is already taking action in response to the 2021 Action Pledge for the UN\u2019s International Year for the Elimination of Child Labor.\n\nThis program will help minimize poverty of women in the cobalt supply chain and address one of the root causes of child labor. The pilot project is an example of how the auto industry can improve conditions in mineral supply chains, empower women, and protect the rights of the most vulnerable.\u201d\n\nSue Slaughter, Purchasing Material Cost and Supply Chain Sustainability Director\nVehicle/Product Safety and Quality\n\nWe have processes and systems in place to confirm that our vehicles align with stringent internal guidelines on safety design and Ford-specified levels of performance for Public Domain tests (see our 2021 vehicle safety highlights). We regularly re-evaluate and update these guidelines, ensuring continuous improvement.\n\nTo achieve high levels of safety performance, we conduct engineering analyses, computer simulations and component, subsystem and full-vehicle crash tests at several sites in the United States and Europe, including crash-test facilities, the VIRTTEX (Virtual Test Track Experiment), and the Research and Innovation Center in Dearborn, Michigan.\n\nFord\u2019s practice is not to use animals for safety testing nor to ask or fund others to do so on our behalf, unless required by law or where there is not an acceptable alternative for critical safety research. We will continue to be leaders in creating, developing, and validating alternative methods to proving and providing product safety.\n\nGlobal Safety Ratings\nFord continues to receive high marks and accolades in public and private crash testing assessments. However, New Car Assessment Programs (NCAPs) vary widely with differing protocols and evaluation criteria, and are continually updated. Consequently, it is increasingly difficult to achieve top ratings across all regions. Nonetheless, we are proud that so many of our vehicles have received 5-star ratings globally, and we continue to place considerable emphasis on our performance in these assessments.\n\nOur 2021 Vehicle Safety Highlights:\nIn 2021, Ford doubled the number of TOP SAFETY PICK awards from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, bringing the total number of awards to 10. The TOP SAFETY PICK award requires top scores in six test categories: driver- and passenger-side small overlap front, moderate overlap front, original side, roof strength, and head restraints. Also, the vehicles demonstrated good-rated or acceptable-rated headlight performance and superior or advanced front crash prevention for vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-pedestrian accident avoidance systems.\n\nUnited States: U.S. NCAP (NHTSA)\n\u2022 For the 2021 model year, eight Ford and four Lincoln nameplates were rated with 5-star overall vehicle scores (as of January 2022). This represents 100% of the Lincoln fleet.\n\nUnited States: Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS)\n\u2022 Ford claimed 10 Top Safety Pick/Top Safety Pick+ Awards for 2021: Escape, Edge, Explorer, Corsair, Aviator, Bronco Sport, F-150 Crew Cab, F-150 SuperCab, Mustang Mach-E, and Nautilus. This represents 63% of the Ford/Lincoln nameplates receiving the TSP/ TSP+ awards.\n\nEurope: Euro NCAP\n\u2022 Ford had 10 Euro NCAP 5-star rated vehicles in 2021: Mustang Mach-E, S-Max, Galaxy, Fiesta, Focus, Mondeo, Kuga, Explorer, Puma, and Edge. These vehicles represent 83% of our fleet on sale in Europe.\n\nChina: China NCAP\n\u2022 Explorer and Equator were awarded the 5-star rating by China NCAP in 2021.\n\nChina: C-IASI (China Insurance Automotive Safety Index)\n\u2022 Escape was awarded all Good Ratings on safety assessment protocols by C-IASI in 2021.\n\nRead more about Product Safety and Quality in our Human Rights Report\nFord\u2019s advanced active safety technology fitted to commercial vehicles helps customers avoid accidents and minimize the expense and downtime of crash repairs.\n\n**Euro NCAP Advanced Awards**\nWith millions of vans on Europe\u2019s roads, the safety of commercial vehicles is key to improving safety for all road users. Ford\u2019s advanced active safety technology fitted to commercial vehicles helps customers avoid accidents and minimize the expense and downtime of crash repairs. In a new initiative testing the performance and effectiveness of active safety systems on many of Europe\u2019s best-selling vans, covering almost all sales, the Ford Transit and Transit Custom both excelled.\n\nThe Transit and Transit Custom were selected to receive the highest-level Gold award from independent vehicle safety authority Euro NCAP. The tests assessed the performance of autonomous emergency braking systems that help to protect vans and other road users, including pedestrians and cyclists.\n\n**U.S. Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) commitment**\nPre-Collision Assist with Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) helps drivers to avoid certain crashes. Ford pledged to equip a minimum of 95% of all new lightweight vehicles (under 8,500-pounds) with AEB in the U.S. market by September 2022. Ford is now 1 of 12 OEMs meeting the commitment ahead of time at 96%. Ford is continuing their commitment for the next phase for vehicles in the 8,501 to 10,000-pound range by 2025/26. Ford has improved its commitment in this heavier weight class from 62% in 2020 to 75% in 2021. Ford will also be selling AEB equipped vehicles in Canada at similar levels.\n\n**Ford Co-Pilot360\u2122 Technology**\nDriving is meant to be enjoyed. From the beginning, Ford has been inspired by this truth: that all people have the right to move more confidently and freely through the world. But on our increasingly distracted and crowded roads, enjoyment often turns to stress. We can all use more confidence on the road. Available Ford Co-Pilot360\u2122 Technology has features to help keep you in command, from the driveway to the highway. It\u2019s helping you know what\u2019s in your blind spot, and when to slow down. It\u2019s the nudge that helps you stay inside your lane and on the right track. It\u2019s not being daunted by a tight parking spot or the steepest hill. Not being surprised by a pedestrian or unexpected stop. It\u2019s backing up with a trailer or hitching it with ease. It\u2019s in the big stuff, like hauling precious cargo, and the little details, like being able to keep both hands on the wheel when a few raindrops become a downpour. It\u2019s a clear view of the road ahead and the path behind you. It\u2019s being set free to love every moment of the journey.\n\nThe 2022 F-150 Lightning truck with available Ford BlueCruise allows for true hands-free driving on prequalified sections of divided highways called Hands-Free Blue Zones that make up over 130,000 miles of North American roads. Ford Co-Pilot360\u2122 2.0 includes Auto High Beams, Blind Spot Information System (BLIS) with Cross-Traffic Alert, Lane Keeping System and Pre-Collision Assist with Automatic Emergency Braking. We\u2019ve equipped the F-150 Lightning with available smart technologies designed to make it easy to hook up your trailer with Pro Trailer Backup Assist, Trailer Reverse Guidance, Smart Hitch and Trailer Brake Controller to help you control it. Plus, it has available Onboard Scales that help keep you informed on what you\u2019re towing and hauling whether it\u2019s for work or recreation.\nVehicle/Product Safety and Quality \u2013 continued\n\nOnboard Scales\nThis available feature offers a scale that measures payload weight automatically based on the specific capability of the F-150 Lightning. It then displays the approximate payload weight in the truck. Load information is displayed in the center touchscreen with a graphic representation of the truck or on a mobile phone through the FordPass\u2122 App. Additionally, the truck can be set on scale mode, which zeroes out the current load and allows for approximate weighing of additional items loaded onto the pickup.\n\nPro Trailer Backup Assist\nWhether you\u2019re a novice or a seasoned pro, backing up with a trailer can be challenging. This available feature makes it as easy as turning a knob \u2014 simply rotate in the direction you want the trailer to go and Pro Trailer Backup Assist responds accordingly.\n\nTrailer Reverse Guidance\nAvailable Trailer Reverse Guidance gives extra assistance when you\u2019re backing up a trailer, enhancing visibility via cameras in the sideview mirrors and visual guides in the center dash screen. You get a clear view of where the trailer\u2019s going while Trailer Reverse Guidance coaches you along the way.\n\nPro Trailer Hitch Assist\u2122\nAvailable Pro Trailer Hitch Assist helps you to hook up your trailer more easily by automatically controlling the steering wheel, throttle, and braking to align the hitch ball and trailer coupler. All the driver needs to do is hold down a button and control the gears. The driver is then alerted to help ensure that the coupler is high enough to clear the hitch ball. Once the two are aligned, the truck stops and you lower the trailer onto the tow ball.\n\nSmart Hitch\nAvailable Smart Hitch is designed to help you easily load trailers and practice safe towing. Smart Hitch measures the tongue weight of a trailer being connected to help the customer distribute trailer weight correctly. After the trailer is set up in the center touch screen, Smart Hitch calculates its appropriate tongue weight and provides guidance on weight distribution or hitch overloading on the screen or on the FordPass App. The truck will indicate if the current hitch weight is too high or low, and can even guide owners through properly tensioning a weight-redistributing hitch.\n\nBringing Collision Avoidance Into View\nWe are building on a long-standing relationship with Mobileye, part of Intel, to develop our camera-based detection capabilities for driver assist systems. Mobileye will provide its EyeQ\u00ae family of devices, alongside vision-processing software, to support Level 1 and Level 2 driver assistance systems across our vehicles globally. New production vehicles will incorporate EyeQ chips and software to support features under our Ford Co-Pilot360 technology. This includes the Lane-Keeping System, Auto High-Beam Headlamps, Pre-Collision Assist with Automatic Emergency Braking, and Intelligent Adaptive Cruise Control.\n\nPreproduction screen shown and is subject to change\nVehicle/Product Safety and Quality \u2013 continued\n\nCombating Heatstroke in Vehicles\nOn average, a child dies from vehicular heatstroke every nine days in the United States. In response, we have developed a Rear Occupant Alert System that gives an \u201cin-vehicle\u201d warning via our SYNC\u00ae system. Introduced in the 2020 model year Escape and Corsair, the system is included in all four-door 2021 model year vehicles equipped with SYNC, meeting the 2019 Voluntary Agreement. The feature will be deployed globally where feasible. Ford will continue to enhance warning notifications for future models and research technologies that can detect in-cabin occupant presence. These features will help address scenarios beyond those defined by the 2019 Voluntary Agreement, and should enhance effectiveness in minimizing and potentially avoiding pediatric vehicular heatstroke cases.\n\nKeeping Occupants Safe\nPrecompetitive Partnerships\nTo enhance the safety of vehicle occupants, we work alongside other automotive manufacturers through the U.S. Council for Automotive Research (USCAR) and Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers\u2019 Association (CVMA), and collaborate with other manufacturers through Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the European Council for Automotive R&D (EUCAR), the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). We often publish the results in peer-reviewed journals and scientific publications.\n\nPost-Crash Response\nOur SYNC in-car connectivity helps occupants to call for assistance after an accident, and can give first responders potentially life-saving information, quickly and efficiently. In addition to providing the operator with a GPS location, SYNC in-car connectivity relays data on impact velocity, crash type, safety belt use, and airbag deployment, helping emergency services respond appropriately.\n\nMost of our vehicles also carry the SOS Post-Crash Alert System\u2122, which alerts passers-by and first responders to a vehicle\u2019s location.\n\nIn parallel to a mandatory EU regulation on Automated Emergency Calling Systems for new vehicles in 2018, a UN regulation to harmonize all in-vehicle systems on a global scale has also been adopted.\n\nProduct Quality\nInternal and external measurements of quality and brand promotion help us assess our performance and determine where we can make improvements. All Ford plants are accredited to ISO 9001:2015.\n\nMonitoring Quality and Satisfaction\nWe are on a continuous mission to make product quality one of the principal reasons why customers buy Ford, time and again.\n\nWe use warranty repairs as a key metric to measure initial quality, but go beyond warrantable items alone and include measures of customer excitement to measure our products.\n\nWe use the Quality Net Promoter Score (QNPS), which measures the ownership experience at three, 12 and 36 months in service. QNPS provides a comprehensive and holistic view of quality by capturing both customers\u2019 \u201cdislikes\u201d and \u201clikes\u201d (e.g., \u201cThings Gone Right\u201d). This new tool will give us more timely, actionable insights that align with various industry performance indicators of quality, such as the annual studies conducted by J.D. Power and Associates:\n\nOur 2021 Quality Achievements\n\u2022 Initial Quality Study: J.D. Power Initial Quality Study (IQS) results improved versus 2020. Ford ranked seventh among 15 OEMs and at industry average. Ford brand tied the industry average; Lincoln improved, ranking third among 14 premium brands. Lincoln Corsair, Ford Ranger and Ford Super Duty ranked within the \u201cTop 3\u201d of their respective segments.\n\u2022 Automotive Performance, Execution and Layout Study (APEAL): Ford ranked 5th among the 18 mass market brands. Lincoln ranked 4th among the 13 premium brands. Ford Mustang Mach-E and Bronco Sport were first in their segments, Compact SUV and Small SUV respectively.\n\nSafety Research Partnerships\nOccupant protection and crashworthiness\n\u2022 Evaluating the safety performance of lithium-ion batteries with Sandia National Laboratories and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Effort includes developing mechanical, thermal and electromechanical multi-physics modeling capabilities to help predict lithium-ion battery performance and damage when subjected to an impact.\n\nTechnical challenges of self-driving vehicles\n\u2022 Founding member of the American Center for Mobility, using its state-of-the-art facility for developing and validating test methods for self-driving vehicles.\n\nVehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) safety communication systems\n\u2022 Ford envisions that the future of transportation will be increasingly electric, connected, and autonomous. C-V2X is an essential component of the next generation connected transportation network. Ford plans to deploy cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) as soon as practicable subject to a conducive regulatory environment in individual markets. The ability to interact with vehicles, infrastructure, pedestrians, bicyclists, and others can help ensure safer streets to the benefit of all citizens.\n\nCybersecurity\n\u2022 Ford\u2019s long-standing commitment to protect our customers extends to the company\u2019s software-led transformation to create always-on ownership experiences. We recognize that this transformation comes with challenges such as cybersecurity, which is why Ford has integrated cybersecurity with all stages of the vehicle lifecycle. This includes following established global cybersecurity standards (UNECE R155) for automakers, and proactively assessing the impact of cybersecurity on new areas such as data privacy. Ford Co-Pilot360 semi-automated driver assistance technologies, and development of our fully autonomous vehicles.\n\nDriver distraction\n\u2022 Partnering with universities and organizations such as the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, we are researching driver distraction and analyzing data from large-scale naturalistic driving studies.\n\nDriver Assist Technologies\n95% of nameplates with the technology available for Pre-Collision Assist with Automatic Emergency Braking, Lane Keeping Alert, and Adaptive Cruise Control\n85% of nameplates with the technology available for Automatic High Beam Controller\nGRID\n\nThe Global Recall Implementation Database (GRID) is modernizing the analysis and execution of field service actions for safety, compliance, emissions, and customer satisfaction issues. With GRID, global teams can now communicate in a single tool across five major regions to expedite service fixes to customers on a global scale.\n\nGRID launched in late 2020 and expanded to eight major IT launches in 2021. The program had been used to manage investigations globally by users across multiple organizations within Ford.\n\nImproving Our Quality Processes\n\nWe are investing additional time and attention to continue improving in vehicle quality and customer safety. We are working to ensure quality, customer satisfaction, and recall actions have more visibility and support at all levels of the company. We have started to see a reduction in the number of the field service actions and affected units when comparing 2020 with 2021.\n\n\u2022 Potential safety or safety compliance items are assessed through a long-standing global process utilizing a core cross-functional team with additional subject experts when necessary. The cross-functional team assesses issues and escalates through a series of designated forums of increasing leadership levels within Ford. This process can ultimately lead to review of an item at the vice-president level and become a safety recall. The core cross-functional teams exist and operate in each business region and the regional teams all come together in a global forum to share information.\n\n\u2022 We are measuring the time to issue resolution with a \u201cshot clock\u201d \u2013 leveraging Quality Early Detection and using Over The Air Update (OTA) capability for faster issue resolution.\n\n\u2022 We are increasing our use of advanced data analytics and machine learning to help with the earlier detection of potential issues across our vehicle portfolio, even before delivering the vehicle to the customer. Our Early Quality Issue Suite draws on multiple data sources, from connected vehicles to customer service calls, to accelerate the investigative process. This tool minimizes time from detection to correction by combining this information with automatic anomaly detection and root cause analysis.\n\n\u2022 New tools will enable us to trace parts and subsystems more precisely to vehicle-specific builds when an issue arises, rather than issuing wider recalls targeting a date range of vehicle identification numbers, which generally involve broad vehicle populations that may not all be affected.\n\n\u2022 We continue to improve investigation tracking and dealer engagement processes. Using an integrated data management system, we will soon be able to monitor all stages of a quality investigation. This will lead to faster decisions, improved parts availability, and global sharing of best practice solutions.\n\n\u2022 We are now implementing processes to address potential customer concerns in a faster way, even before delivering the vehicle to the customer.\n\n\u2022 We have implemented quality data dashboards for timely identification and resolution of customer concerns.\n\nBattery Safety Core Team\n\nAs we progress towards electrification, new technologies mean Ford must be more mindful of how to handle incidents that arise. Our new Battery Safety Core Team, which was formalized in 2021, has developed an incident investigation system for electrification batteries that is separate from our existing protocol for ICE battery incidents.\n\nThe Team is tasked with ensuring that employees know how to respond to e-battery issues. They also focus on making sure that incidents are not indicative of a more widespread problem. The team shares its experiences and findings with the product development team, as well as with other OEMs.\nCustomer Experience, Marketing and Satisfaction\n\nImproving the Customer Experience\nUnderstanding the customer experience is essential for achieving the Ford+ Plan\u2019s goal of providing distinctive, real-world solutions, always-on customer relationships, and ever-improving user experiences.\n\nUnderstanding the Customer\nWith our insights about customer behaviors and lifestyles, we can build emotional connections with customers and what matters most to them as they build better lives and pursue their dreams. Only through knowledge and empathy can we build customer loyalty over time.\n\nWe understand that customers want speed, convenience, personalization, and seamless experiences across every part of their lives. And when customers trust a brand, they report high levels of loyalty, opportunity for growth, and intention to recommend the brand to others. It\u2019s not enough to offer quality products and solid services \u2013 we need to deliver fast, personalized, and trusted experiences. Every interaction, every day, is a chance to earn trust and loyalty through honesty, expertise, and care.\n\nTreating Customers Like Family\nIt starts with valuing our customers as members of the Ford family. In fact, treating customers like family is part of Ford\u2019s heritage. And all of our employees play a critical role. To build a culture of customer-centricity, we are empowering our employees with new learning opportunities and tools, such as a support program that gives them quick assistance to resolve vehicle issues for themselves or their friends and family.\n\nWe are on a mission to enhance the entire customer journey, from the dealership to the FordPass app, and everything in between. Every touchpoint, from purchase through setup, repair, maintenance, and renewal, is covered as we seek to foster a network of loyal customers and brand advocates. And as we lead the electric revolution with connected, all-electric vehicles and Ford Pro\u2019s leading commercial vehicle line-up, we are creating distinctive services that help people more easily manage EV lifestyles and businesses enjoy the advantages of electrification.\n\nFord: Always-on\nAs the pandemic raged on, disrupting business as usual, our approach to our customers has been changing and accelerating to meet evolving expectations \u2013 moving from a one-time sales and buying interaction to embracing the entire customer experience throughout the vehicle ownership cycle. Always-on. This change impacts everything we are doing at Ford, from how we design the in-vehicle experience to establishing a connected, transparent infrastructure to how we build commercial vehicles.\n\nFor many Ford owners, their vehicle is a reflection and extension of their lifestyle \u2013 and we want to help them make the most of it.\n\nThe Evolving Role of E-Commerce\nThe retail environment is evolving rapidly with changing customer preferences triggered, in large part, by the difficulties of the pandemic. We\u2019ve seen an acceleration to online shopping and a demand for convenient, remote experiences like pickup and delivery, and the use of mobile service vans that come right to the customer\u2019s door.\nIn March 2021, we launched our Mustang Mach-E Cart and Checkout commerce platform in the U.S. and Europe, providing an end-to-end online experience that includes financing, trade-in appraisal, accessories, and more. Customers can choose to do everything online and even have their vehicles dropped off at their front door. The feedback has been excellent, customers love the process, especially the transparent pricing tool.\n\nThe learnings from Mustang Mach-E\u2019s online experience will inform our next phase of eCommerce capabilities \u2013 and a similar experience will be used for F-150 Lightning.\n\nIn China, we have set up a new EV organization to sell direct to customers either online or through Ford Select city stores, starting with the Mustang Mach-E. We had 25 stores at the end of 2021 and will be on track to open 100 within five years.\n\nIn this environment, it is essential to listen to customers and deliver experiences that meet their needs. Even as customers return to dealerships, they want to engage with stores in new ways using the digital, remote, and touchless experiences we now provide.\n\nAs a result of these circumstances and our always-on approach, Ford\u2019s ranking in the Forester customer experience index improved from 13th to 8th in 2021.\n\nPickup and Delivery\n\nStrengthening our commitment to provide an elevated level of customer support, we began pickup and delivery services in the early days of the pandemic, when some Ford dealerships realized that customers would appreciate getting their vehicles serviced while staying safe in the comfort of their home. The process is simple \u2013 customers call their local dealer to schedule an appointment and request an at-home or at-work pickup. On the day of service, customers receive updates via phone, text or e-mail to keep them informed of their vehicle\u2019s progress, and it\u2019s delivered back as soon as the service is complete.\n\nThe experience was well received, and dealerships saw a rise in customer satisfaction scores. In 2021, we expanded the popular service by making it available to all of our 8.5 million FordPass Rewards members, adding an extra level of convenience for regular vehicle maintenance calls and showing our customers that we value their time. It also aligned with our aspiration to be the industry leader in remote services by the end of 2021, which includes hundreds of mobile service vans, loaner vehicles, and vouchers to ride-sharing services.\n\nDiscover Your Ford\n\nThe need for customer education doesn\u2019t stop after the vehicle is delivered. It\u2019s an ever-evolving journey, and as life events and vehicle uses change, so does the need for additional learning. Discover Your Ford, launched in 2021, caters to the different learning styles of customers to provide the best possible education experience.\n\nA user-friendly, direct-to-customer learning experience, Discover Your Ford offers customers the flexibility to discover more about their new vehicle when and where they want, including live stream sessions focused on specific vehicle features, a digital feature guide, and an on-demand video library full of short helpful tips on setting up and using their vehicle.\n\nCustomers can even schedule a guided virtual tour, so they can video chat with a Ford product expert for a more personalized experience. The learning platform is initially targeted for the Ford F-150, Mustang Mach-E, Bronco Sport, and Bronco. More vehicles will be added as they become available.\n\nExpanding Loyalty and Membership Programs\n\nMembership of our FordPass and Lincoln Way apps increased to more than 9 million members in the U.S. This community forms the foundation of our advocacy programs. In the U.S., our FordPass Rewards Visa rewards customers for everyday spending. Now we are strengthening our FordPass Rewards program \u2013 already one of the most comprehensive auto industry loyalty programs in North America \u2013 by adding Blue, Silver, and Bronze tiers to reward and recognize our most loyal customers.\n\nEach higher tier unlocks exclusive membership benefits, giving customers even more ways to redeem points. Members in the top two tiers, Silver and Blue, will be eligible for complimentary Pickup and Delivery services. Members also have access to exclusive partnership offers and discounts with Costco and others. Additionally, FordPass app customers have access to information on FordCredit and recalls, vehicle health alerts and access to emergency services, all at no cost.\n\nWe are expanding the program through experiential tiers and the FordPass Rewards Visa Card, as we build out similar loyalty programs in other markets like Canada.\n\nFord Pro: Redefining Value for Commercial Customers\n\nFord Pro is the global business and brand within Ford dedicated to government and commercial customers of all sizes to help them accelerate productivity, improve uptime, and lower operating costs through connected services and work-ready gas and electric vehicles.\n\nWe are reinventing the entire customer experience with our new tech-enabled Ford Pro Solutions. Ford Pro Solutions Teams work with customers one-on-one throughout the journey to design, set up, and implement the right solution for their business \u2013 constantly evaluating needs and providing access to Ford Pro\u2019s experts in areas like charging, data, and digital services.\n\nMobile Vehicle Spa\n\nOil changes, washes, checking tires, and handling everyday \u201cdings\u201d on a vehicle are chores that eat up precious time. So Lincoln Strategy Manager Justin Counts and his team disrupted the status quo with a Mobile Vehicle Spa that brings service to customers! With a lot of convenience (and a touch of luxury), the pilot program in Houston, TX, creates value beyond the purchase and makes being a Lincoln owner even more of a pleasure \u2013 another way Ford is always-on for customers.\nCustomer Experience, Marketing and Satisfaction \u2013 continued\n\nWe\u2019re going to give commercial customers even more reasons to choose and rely on Ford. Our team understands that when customers win, we win, so we\u2019re completely focused on unlocking tremendous value for them.\u201d\n\nTed Cannis, CEO, Ford Pro\n\nThey also work closely with dealers customizing solutions for their customers. For businesses that want to go electric, we don\u2019t just email a set of directions. Customers can engage Ford Pro Solutions Teams to work hand-in-hand on their transition, to help understand how they use their vehicles and help design, install, and operate the right charging infrastructure.\n\nAs Ford Pro grows its business, it is introducing Ford Pro Intelligence, a cloud-based platform that powers a suite of digital services that supports a commercial customer\u2019s total fleet operation.\n\nThe biggest pain point we hear from commercial customers about managing their fleet \u2013 even more than lowering costs \u2013 is not having a single place to access all of their information across vehicles and service. Ford Pro Intelligence solves this problem by integrating Salesforce with always-on access to the Ford Pro services they need to increase productivity and keep the focus on their customers.\n\nServices, which are being rolled out in stages, are designed to generate higher levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty, include:\n\n- Ford Pro Vehicles \u2013 Commercial trucks and vans, including gas, diesel, hybrid, and electric versions, upfitting to meet the needs of almost any business \u2013 E-Transit and F-150 Lightning Pro are two of the latest examples of Ford\u2019s continuing commercial vehicle innovation\n- Ford Pro Charging \u2013 Integrated and end-to-end solutions for home, public, and depot charging for customers to make a seamless transition to electric vehicles with customer support to help plan, install, operate, and maintain an electric fleet\n- Ford Pro Software \u2013 Business productivity tools that link gas, diesel, and electric vehicles together to manage fleets holistically, on Ford or non-Ford vehicles, to improve uptime and cut costs\n- Ford Pro Service \u2013 A network of commercial-focused dealers across the country with uptime tools embedded like mobile service which reduces downtime by servicing customer needs where convenient for their business\n- Ford Pro Financing \u2013 Simplified financing, invoicing, and bundled solutions to make back-office management as hassle-free as possible\n\nFord Pro connected uptime tools combine data, digital services, and human support to get vehicles back into operation. This has shown a 40% reduction in days down in parts related cases. The network effect of Ford Pro\u2019s connected solutions can potentially reduce total cost of ownership anywhere from 10% to 20%.\n\nOur Dealerships\n\nOur dealers are on the front lines of customer engagement. Dealers are the face of Ford in their communities. In many cases our dealers are the first to introduce customers to Ford and Lincoln products, services and experiences.\n\nOur dealers are transforming to meet the moment as customer behavior changes.\n\nFord has extensive dealer training through a formal dealer employee training curriculum. Included in this program are courses related to financing and financial services with Ford. To ensure responsible financing of our dealers, we monitor customer concerns and work with dealers to resolve the complaints. In 2021, we worked with a third party on a global survey to help our dealers better understand their environment and their communities. We leveraged dealer council and national meetings to drive home the thought \u201cI need to represent my community.\u201d Not only is it the right thing to do, but it increases business opportunities as well.\n\nMore than 20 dealer interviews were conducted to gain insights and share best practices. We learned about great initiatives our dealers have, such as female employee lunch and learns, flexible hours program and remote work options for employees, and employee conversation meetings to share experiences. Best practice sharing will help all dealers identify their own gaps and provide ideas on how to better acquire, develop, and retain key talent.\nCustomer Experience, Marketing and Satisfaction \u2013 continued\n\nWe see this as a long-term initiative that will strengthen the customer experience while improving our dealers\u2019 business. The work done was presented to the Ford National Dealer Council, who are now supporting us in raising awareness at all Ford Dealerships.\n\nReimagining Business as Usual\nThe COVID-19 pandemic forced Ford and our dealers to reimagine \u201cbusiness as usual.\u201d The new normal includes more remote and touchless experiences, as people shop for and reserve cars online. The pandemic has accelerated digital, remote, and touchless experiences as customers are engaging in new ways. This spurred us to accelerate digital, remote, and touchless experiences and also to make strategic choices, prioritizing work that leads to transformational change.\n\nAs the pandemic continues, we\u2019ve employed return-to-work playbooks, staff training sessions, cleaning protocols, personal protective equipment (PPE), and other health and safety protocols to keep our employees and customers safe.\n\nLincoln\u2019s Partnership with Calm\nOur commitment to wellbeing has never been stronger. To help customers in their pursuit of mental wellbeing, Lincoln has partnered with Calm, a leading meditation and mindfulness app, to offer owners a complimentary one-year premium membership to the service.\n\nSales and After-Sales Service\nTo meet the demand for a touchless experience, we have expanded our pickup and delivery service from a few pilot stores to a global program that delivered more than 100,000 remote service events in 2021. In China, we\u2019ve completed almost 30,000 pickup and delivery events for Ford and Lincoln customers, and seen a 30% uptick in demand for this service through the WeChat app.\n\nCustomers want the flexibility to learn about their new vehicle, when and where they want. In the U.S. we\u2019ve introduced Discover Your Ford, a user-friendly customer education program that includes guided virtual tours, live stream sessions, a digital feature guide, and an on-demand video library. In South America, we launched the pre-onboarding Virtual Booking and 360Guide.\n\nOnce their car has been delivered, our customers are looking for more remote and digital solutions as well as experiences that offer ease, convenience, transparency, and personalization. We developed our Mobile Service program to bring vehicle maintenance and light service to our U.K. and U.S. customers at home or work. Mobile service is also being deployed in key International Markets such as Thailand where we are also modernizing with Remote Technical Assistance for Dealers through SWIS \u201cSee What I See\u201d utilizing high tech headsets for two way communication between Dealer Technicians and Ford Engineers.\n\nThe Sonoma County Wine Growers, with more than 1,800 members in Northern California, is planning to advance its sustainability efforts, with the help of the Ford Pro suite of electric vehicles, charging and telematics services. Ford Pro and the growers are launching a pilot program that will add F-150 Lightning Pro pickups, E-Transit cargo vans, and Ford Pro Intelligence products and services to three pilot farms.\n\nThe farms are being outfitted with Ford Pro charging stations to complement the solar power that has been a critical part of the group\u2019s push for sustainability since 2014. Ford Pro Intelligence services are expected to help optimize their gas and electric fleets by providing always-on access to vehicle health reports and other data that help reduce operating costs, vehicle downtime, and fuel consumption.\n\nThe heart of the mission: to demonstrate how electric vehicles and web-based fleet management tools can help the agriculture industry increase productivity, improve sustainability, and lower the total cost of fleet ownership.\nFordPass App Helps Rescue Stolen Transit Full of Dogs\n\nFord is now equipping all new vehicles with built-in modems as standard to add vast connected vehicle functionality, including the ability to pinpoint locations remotely. This feature came in handy in the U.K. when a man\u2019s Transit Custom, with a bunch of dogs in the back, was stolen. The dogs were dropped off and found later in a park. The thieves\u2019 next move in the Transit showed up on FordPass, which traced the van to another part of the park where police seized the vehicle.\n\nTime is money for our hard-working business customers; so we\u2019re focused on keeping them on the road through programs like Ford Pro and our Ranger Support Teams in Australia, Thailand, and South Africa.\n\nResponsible Marketing\n\nWhen it comes to our marketing and advertising we want to ensure that we are representing the diversity of our customer base and their perspectives in an authentic way. To that end, our focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion extends beyond who we show in our advertising to how we source the creative development and production of our content across all mediums.\n\nWe have programs in place to ensure that we are not only giving opportunities to content creators from underrepresented groups but we are also trying to provide training and mentorship on our sets and throughout our marketing process.\n\nWe are also pushing to produce our marketing assets as sustainably as possible and continue to grow best practices from our EVs all the way through to how we shoot social content.\n\nOur four initiatives on Responsible marketing include:\n\n\u2022 Ford is a member of Green the Bid. Through this partnership we are trying to guide the shift in marketing commercial production industry towards sustainable and regenerative practices.\n\n\u2022 As a founding partner of Free the Work, Ford champions underrepresented creators across different roles within marketing commercial production process.\n\n\u2022 Ford is also a sponsor of the Streetlights program where we fund and support entry level on set production training as well as union qualification days for people in established roles. All of this is in support of providing training and job placement across different marketing production roles for people in underrepresented groups who have not gotten access before.\n\n\u2022 Ford has also pledged with AICP\u2019s Double the Line effort. With this pledge, we fund paid, on set training for black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) candidates to get useful experience in the marketing production industry.\n\nAs a company we are interested in helping all of our customers pursue their dreams. We work to assure that our marketing, product offerings, and services meet the needs of and attract our current customers as well as potential customers from a broad variety of backgrounds. And we always assure that all of our marketing work is routinely monitored and reviewed for legal and compliance.\n\nTechnology for All\n\nMaking advanced technologies available to millions of people has been part of Ford\u2019s DNA since its founder Henry Ford introduced the Model T to open highways to all mankind. That spirit guides our approach to new innovations, including remaining the only automaker to offer complimentary FordPass features such as remote vehicle starting and unlocking and SYNC 911 Assist that can automatically call emergency responders after a crash. Meantime, other automakers have moved these highly desirable features to subscriptions with monthly costs.\nSocioeconomic Contribution and Community Engagement\n\nStrengthening Communities\n\nThrough our philanthropic arm, the Ford Motor Company Fund (Ford Fund), we work with nonprofit organizations, community partners and across the global Ford network to provide access to resources and opportunities that build equity and help underserved and underrepresented communities reach their highest potential.\n\nIn 2021, Ford Motor Company and Ford Fund invested $74.4 million in charitable contributions to help strengthen and serve communities around the world. Our initiatives included empowering nurses to run their own mobile healthcare centers, serving communities that need health services the most, providing vocational training to Thai children living on the street, supporting literacy and STEM activities for students in the United Kingdom and more.\n\nOur desire to build a better world has always been a part of Ford. Our community engagement work dovetails with our Human Rights and Climate Change initiatives as we work to strengthen communities and make people\u2019s lives better.\n\nMobilizing Our Team to Support Communities\n\nFord is proud to have employees who lead the charge in community engagement, not just within the company, but also within their professional fields and local communities. Each year, tens of thousands of employees around the world volunteer in community service projects, bringing skill, enthusiasm, and teamwork to nonprofits, helping to get essential jobs done while the organizations focus on serving people in need.\n\nSeptember marks Global Caring Month, our annual month-long focus on community service and giving back. In 2021, Ford Fund awarded $700,000 in grants to support the humanitarian efforts of 149 employee-nominated community organizations in 34 countries.\n\nFord Volunteer Corps\n\nManaged by Ford Fund, Ford Volunteer Corps is a global network of thousands of Ford employees and retirees who have logged more than 1.7 million hours volunteering across six continents since 2005 \u2014 building homes or gardens, renovating schools, feeding the hungry, installing clean water systems, and more.\n\nInspiring the Next Generation of STEM Careers\n\nIn order to inspire the next generation of inventors and mobility makers and build the workforce of tomorrow, we must engage today\u2019s students with the STEM subjects of science, technology, engineering, and math. To that end, Ford has been at work over the past three decades creating vibrant, cutting-edge educational opportunities that change lives. These programs engage thousands of middle school, high school, and college students, who go on to make a big impact in their STEM careers.\n\nFor example, Ford is Strategic Partner of FIRST\u00ae, helping to build engineers and scientists of the future. We actively sponsor teams in 87 high schools and in 136 elementary and middle schools located across the United States. More than 240 Ford employees mentor students during the year, working together to sharpen students\u2019 knowledge of STEM.\n\nIn Detroit, we\u2019ve sponsored the Detroit Hispanic Development Corp.\u2019s FIRST Robotic Competition teams, as well as creating a career technical education program and providing funding to update their machining shop.\n\nThe Ford Motorsports team is leaning into DEI and STEM as well, using racing to rev up engineering interests among Detroit high school girls. Teammates partnered with the Girls in Engineering Academy to create workshops that expose the girls to aerodynamics, wind tunnels, pit stop demonstrations, and more. The girls also met the inspiring Shelby Hall, a top Ford off-road racer.\n\nFord employees mentor students during the year\nInvesting in Communities Through Ford Fund\n\nIn our corporate home of Southeastern Michigan and around the world, Ford Fund develops and funds initiatives that meet basic needs, provide access to essential services, help build new skill sets, and open pathways to high-quality jobs. Key 2021 highlights include:\n\n- **Ford Resource and Engagement Centers** are a Ford Fund innovation that brings nonprofit partners together in a collaborative environment to support surrounding communities. Following months of limited or modified programming, all five of our global community resource centers reopened for in-person programming and services. Our two facilities in Detroit, along with centers in Romania, South Africa, and Thailand served residents with essential food distribution, tax and legal services, entrepreneurship programs, job training, and more.\n\n- Through the Motor City Kares initiative, we provided two Black-owned Michigan dental providers with custom Ford Transit vans converted into mobile dental clinics to provide access to critically-needed oral healthcare services to residents in Southwest Detroit and across Southeast Michigan.\n\n- Ford\u2019s investment in restoring the historic Michigan Central Station and surrounding buildings and area into a new 30-acre mobility innovation district expands our reach in the Detroit area. Michigan Central serves as an open platform for partnerships, bringing together innovators, established brands, educators, policymakers, foundations and investors from Detroit and around the world in a dynamic urban ecosystem to co-create mobility solutions that can help make the world better, more accessible for everyone. Ford and other partners are also creating educational and alternative learning solutions at Michigan Central, designed to skill and reskill people for the jobs of today and the future. These programs will target underserved and underrepresented groups, building a better world in the communities where we work.\n\n- Leveraging the company\u2019s mobility expertise, we are using a low-speed autonomous vehicle shuttle to deliver 10,000 pounds of fresh food to mobility-challenged seniors in the Michigan Central impact area in Southwest Detroit during a six-month pilot.\n\n- **Disaster relief** is an important aspect of Ford Fund\u2019s work. Around the world, we contributed more than $1.3 million to disaster relief efforts in 2021. We donated $100,000 and mobilized more than 2,000 employee volunteers to support flash flooding relief in Germany. In the U.S., we worked closely with emergency response organizations, nonprofit partners, local Ford dealers, and regional team members to assist with relief and recovery efforts following Hurricane Ida and the devastating tornadoes in Kentucky.\n\n- Through numerous mentoring, entrepreneurship, and educational initiatives, we helped hundreds of thousands of students, women, Black, and Hispanic people of all ages and stages of life build new skillsets, remove barriers to economic success and create opportunities for growth. For example, in 2021 Ford Fund awarded $50,000 in grants to the winners of a pitch competition focused on social enterprises run by women.\n\n**COVID: #FinishStrong**\n\nSupporting communities as they continue to battle the ongoing consequences of the pandemic remained a focus in 2021.\n\n- A leader in COVID mitigation efforts, we were one of the first automakers to continuously make personal protective equipment for our workforce, healthcare workers, first responders, and the public. In March 2021, we fulfilled our commitment to donate 120 million masks to at-risk communities with limited access to PPE. Working with Ford Fund\u2019s nationwide network of nonprofit partners, we provided adult and child-sized masks to community organizations, Ford dealers, state and local officials, schools, and first responders in all 50 states.\n\n- Through Ford Fund\u2019s longstanding partnerships in the Black and Hispanic communities, we brought together CEOs from 11 of the nation\u2019s leading multicultural organizations in a #VaxWithFacts public service announcement to provide trusted info about the COVID-19 vaccine. The organizations featured in the public service announcement are all members of Ford Fund\u2019s multicultural advisory committee. Created in 2017, the committee serves as an advisory council to help Ford Fund and each of the participating nonprofits shares insights into key issues affecting communities of color.\n\n- We opened a community vaccine center in Craiova, Romania, and administered more than 14,600 vaccinations to some of the community\u2019s most vulnerable residents.\n\n- When COVID cases surged in India and Brazil, we provided $200,000 in emergency funding to assist nongovernmental organizations delivering food, cleaning supplies, and other essential items.\n\n- In partnership with Ford South America, we distributed 80 masks donated fulfilling our commitment to at-risk communities.\n\n- More than 1.7M employee volunteer hours since 2005\n\n- Invested to strengthen communities since 1943\n\n- In partnership with Ford South America, we distributed food, hygiene, and medical kits to more than 8,000 families in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela.\n\n- Read more about how we strengthened and served communities in 2021 in the Ford Fund annual report.\nBuilding a Healthier Planet\n\nProtecting the Environment\nThis generation is the first to feel the impact of climate change, and the last that can do anything about it. Ford is leading the electric revolution and standing for stronger standards to protect both people and the environment as we progress towards a zero-emissions transportation future. We have always been a leader in sustainability and are continuing in our efforts to leave future generations with a cleaner planet.\u201d\n\nBob Holycross, Vice President, Chief Sustainability, Environment and Safety Officer\n\nOverview\n\nWe\u2019re doing our part to address the urgency of climate change and accelerating our progress to carbon neutrality no later than 2050.\n\nWe\u2019re reimagining how EVs \u2013 and the batteries that power them \u2013 are designed, manufactured, and recycled, creating an all-new electric vehicle ecosystem. And creating good jobs and a growing business that delivers value for everyone who relies on Ford.\n\nWe\u2019re aiming to achieve carbon neutrality no later than 2050.\n\nFord is committed to being fully carbon neutral worldwide across our vehicles, facilities, and suppliers no later than 2050.\n\nWe\u2019re accelerating the electrification revolution.\n\nWe\u2019re acting now to ramp up production of our zero-emissions vehicles. We\u2019ve pledged to work towards sales of all new cars and vans being zero-emission globally by 2040 and are on track to have 50% of our global vehicle mix fully electric by 2030.\n\nWe\u2019re matching our ambition with action.\n\nFord is the only full-line U.S. automaker to align with the Paris Agreement and to stand with the California Air Resources Board in support of stronger GHG standards from vehicles.\n\nWe\u2019re changing how our products are made.\n\nWe\u2019re reducing the effects of our operations and supply chains through world-class facilities, including our commitment to sourcing 100 percent carbon-free electricity for our global operations by 2035. By using recycled and renewable materials in our vehicles\u2019 design, we\u2019re reducing landfill waste and using fewer natural resources.\n\nSustainable Development Goals\n\nWe are contributing to the following UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):\n\nOur Sustainability Aspirations\n\n- **Climate Change:** Achieve carbon neutrality no later than 2050\n- **Air:** Attain zero emissions from our vehicles and facilities\n- **Water:** Make zero water withdrawals for manufacturing processes\n  Use freshwater only for human consumption\n- **Energy:** Use 100 percent carbon-free electricity in all manufacturing by 2035\n- **Materials:** Utilize only recycled or renewable content in vehicle plastics\n- **Waste:** Reach true zero waste to landfill across our operations\n  Eliminate single-use plastics from our operations by 2030\n\nRead more about our Sustainable Financing Framework on p.27\n\nRead more about our road to Carbon neutrality on p.84\nClimate Change\n\nAchieving Carbon Neutrality\n\nOur climate is changing faster than the world can keep up. Rising sea levels, droughts and forest fires indicate the urgency of the situation. A comprehensive effort is needed to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nIn fact, Ford is working to minimize its impact on climate change aligned with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (Paris Agreement). We are committed to doing our part \u2013 it\u2019s a strategic priority, one of our salient human rights issues, and integral to our purpose of helping make a better world. And it\u2019s driving our transition to electrification and our goal of achieving carbon neutrality no later than 2050.\n\nOur Long-Term Aspirations and Near-Term Commitments\n\nTo achieve our carbon neutrality goal, we are focusing on three areas that account for approximately 95% of our CO2 emissions \u2013 our vehicles, our operations, and our supply chain. The steps we\u2019re taking are:\n\n- Electrifying our iconic vehicles beginning with the Mustang Mach-E, the F-150 Lightning, and the E-Transit. By 2026, we expect annual production of more than 2 million EVs. By 2030, we expect EVs to represent half of global volume. In Europe, we expect 100% of our cars to be fully electric by 2030. Two-thirds of commercial vehicle sales in Europe will be all-electric or plug-in hybrid by 2030 and all commercial vehicles in Europe will be zero emission by 2035.\n- Investing in EV technology and charging infrastructure to remove obstacles to electrification. We\u2019re investing $50 billion in electric vehicles and battery production from 2022 through 2026.\n- Investing in sustainable manufacturing to create an ultra-efficient, carbon-neutral manufacturing ecosystem. Our new mega-sites in Tennessee and Kentucky are ushering in an era of sustainable electric vehicle manufacturing.\n- Working with our suppliers to reduce their emissions and develop science-based emissions reduction targets in line with the Paris Agreement.\n\nAchieving our long-term carbon neutrality goal is ambitious and complex. To ensure near-term progress, we have developed science-based interim targets and joined global coalitions working towards our common goal.\n\nThis builds on our previous commitments to President Biden\u2019s agenda to reduce GHG emissions in the United States by 50-52% by 2030, have 50% of our global sales volume being EVs by 2030, the UN\u2019s Business Ambition Pledge for 1.5\u00b0C, and to the New Deal for Europe initiative to devise a comprehensive Sustainable Europe 2030 Strategy. We\u2019ve also joined the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Better Climate Challenge to reduce GHG emissions from our facilities by at least half in the same timeframe.\n\nThe above pledges are backed by interim targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Our emissions targets call for a 76% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2035 from a 2017 base year, and a 50% reduction in Scope 3 GHG emission per vehicle kilometer from use of sold products by 2035 from a 2019 base year.\n\nThis goes beyond tailpipe emissions, and includes reducing vehicle emissions from a fuel-cycle perspective (well-to-wheels) which include the production and consumption of fuel during vehicle use. Our Scope 1 and 2 operations target is aligned with the SBTi 1.5\u00b0C path, while our use of sold products (vehicle) target is consistent with the well-below 2\u00b0C target. These targets do not include offsets and are strictly GHG reduction targets.\n\nAddressing climate change is a global issue that no company, industry, country, or organization can achieve on its own. It will require collaboration to drive progress.\n\nFuture Carbon-Neutral Transportation\n\n| EV: Electric vehicle; CCS: carbon capture and storage; FCEV: fuel cell electric vehicle; HEV: hybrid electric vehicle; ICEV: internal combustion engine vehicle; PHEV: plug-in hybrid electric vehicle |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Carbon Capture: Atmospheric or Industrial CO\u2082, Biomass | CO\u2082 or C | Carbon Sequestration (CCS) | Fossil Fuels+ CCS |\n| Electricity Generation | Electricity | Electrolysis | H\u2082 | E-fuel Production | E-Fuels Biofuels |\n| EV | Water | FCEV | ICEV, HEV, PHEV |\n\n76% target emissions reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2035 from a 2017 base year\n\n50% reduction in Scope 3 GHG emission per vehicle kilometer from use of sold products by 2035 from a 2019 base year\nThe Road To Carbon Neutrality\n\n**NEAR**\n- 70k+ Charging Network\n- Launch F-150 Lightning, All-Electric E-Transit\n- Dearborn truck plant, Michigan assembly plant and several new buildings on our Research and Engineering and Corktown campuses powered by 100% renewable electricity\n- Suppliers submit GHG reduction targets\n- In 2 years have 600,000 EV capacity\n\n**2025**\n- BlueOval City building electric F-Series and battery packs with SK Innovation\n- All Michigan manufacturing facilities sourced with 100% carbon-free electricity\n- North American and EU new programs launched with 20% recycled and renewable content in plastics (programs from China and Turkey with 10%)\n\n**2026**\n- Invested $50B in EVs\n- 100% passenger vehicle range in Europe will be zero-emissions capable, all-electric or plug-in hybrid\n\n**2030**\n- EV Commitments\n  - Globally: 50%\n  - U.S.: 50%\n  - EU: 100% of passenger cars, 2/3 of commercial vehicles sales\n  - Lincoln: 100%\n  - Reduce GHG emissions from U.S. manufacturing facilities 50% (Better Climate Initiative)\n  - Eliminate single-use plastics from our operations\n\n**2035**\n- Meet SBTi Commitments (76% reduction in facilities, 50% reduction in vehicle use emissions)\n- Work towards 100% zero-emission cars and vans in leading markets (RouteZero pledge)\n- 100% carbon-free electricity for our global operations\n- 100% of commercial vehicle sales in Europe will be zero-emission\n\n**2040**\n- Work towards 100% zero-emission cars and vans globally (RouteZero pledge)\n\n**2050**\n- Carbon Neutrality\n\n**Ford Joins Global Climate Change Pledge**\nFord is proud to work with RouteZero, a global coalition working towards 100% fully electric vehicles globally by 2040, and in leading markets no later than 2035.\n\nAt COP26, the UN Climate Summit in November 2021, Ford joined with more than 50 businesses, cities and regions committed to rapidly accelerating the transition to zero-emission vehicles to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nSignatories also committed to \u201csupporting a global, equitable, and Just Transition.\u201d\n\nIt is fundamental to our company values that we continue to lead the way in reducing the impact our plants have on the environment. We are committed to long-term sustainability and delivering environmental initiatives that are good for people, good for the planet, and good for Ford.\u201d\n\nAndrea Cavallaro, Operations Director, International Markets Group and South America\nClimate Change \u2013 continued\n\nWe will continue to work with partners in the public and private sector including the Climate Leadership Council and the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions Business and Environmental Leadership Council. Our goal is to show our leadership and advocate for stronger GHG standards, climate resiliency, and infrastructure that help remove obstacles and build the market for electric vehicles.\n\n**Ford\u2019s Approach and Progress Toward Our Aspirations**\n\nOur current climate strategy, built on our long history of using science-based GHG pathways, is focused on the deep decarbonization of our value chain and aims to integrate consumer wants and needs, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success. Our carbon-neutral approach analyzes information on the environment, customers, technology, legislation, energy, competitive approaches, and life cycle assessments (LCAs). As climate science and technology develops, we will further refine and adjust our science-based GHG targets to accelerate our progress.\n\nHere are some key highlights on Ford\u2019s progress and approach. More detailed information can be found in the Reducing our Vehicle CO2 section below.\n\n**Vehicles**\n\nElectrification is a key strategy to address the urgency of climate change. However, for the transition to electrification to be successful, we must make the electric vehicles that our customers want and demand. We are responding by taking our most iconic, popular vehicles electric \u2013 the Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning, and E-Transit.\n\nCurrently we are on track to achieve 50% fully electric vehicle sales globally by 2030, and 100% fully electric passenger vehicle sales in Europe. Two-thirds of commercial vehicle sales in Europe will be all-electric or plug-in hybrid by 2030 and all commercial vehicles in Europe will be zero emission by 2035.\n\n**Operations**\n\nOur operational goals include both Scope 1 and 2 emissions for manufacturing and non-manufacturing locations. To achieve these goals, we are focusing on improving efficiency and increasing our use of carbon-free electricity.\n\nIn addition to our 2035 SBTi target, we have committed to reduce our global manufacturing Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 18% by 2023 from a 2017 base year.\n\nAs an example, our new BlueOval City assembly plant in Tennessee is designed to be carbon neutral, send zero waste to landfill, and use freshwater only for human consumption at the start of production in 2025.\n\n**Helping Our Dealers to Reduce Carbon Footprint**\n\nIn Germany, we support our dealers with energy consulting services to reduce their carbon footprint, resulting in 5,000 tons of CO2 reduction for 200 dealers.\n\n**Suppliers**\n\nOur new Supplier Code of Conduct mandates that all Tier 1 production suppliers minimize their impact on climate change aligned with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (Paris Agreement), striving towards carbon neutrality. It also requires that our suppliers enforce a similar code of practice and require that their subcontractors do the same. The Supplier Code of Conduct requires suppliers to:\n\n- Report their Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions and water usage data to Ford if requested.\n- Establish science-based GHG reduction targets, action plans, and transparent reporting mechanisms.\n\nThis year we conducted a supplier survey to identify each supplier\u2019s GHG reduction targets. If they did not yet have one, they are required to submit their targets by the end of 2022. Then we can develop a joint roadmap with our suppliers on our journey towards carbon neutrality.\n\nWe have also established internal targets for increasing engagement with our supply chain partners, including building on our successful CDP Supply Chain reporting program and our Partnership for A Cleaner Environment (PACE) programs.\n\n**Supporting Our Customers**\n\nFord is building the future of zero-emissions vehicles and breaking constraints to lead the electric revolution, investing $50 billion from 2022 through 2026 in electric vehicles and the batteries that power them. We\u2019re not only electrifying our signature nameplates in areas where millions of customers already rely on Ford vehicles, we\u2019re showing our customers the clear advantages of electric vehicles \u2013 from sustainability to performance, power, and digital integration, Ford is creating capacity, capability, and convenience in our vehicles that were never possible before.\n\n**F-150 Lightning Charges into the Future**\n\nElectrification amplifies the attributes our customers love, such as performance, capability and convenience. For example, F-Series, America\u2019s best-selling truck for 45 years, charges into the future with the F-150 Lightning \u2013 a powerhouse that delivers a targeted 563 horsepower and 775 lb.-ft. of torque \u2013 the most torque of any F-150 ever \u2013 a smooth, quiet, and exhilarating drive, a high-tech front trunk, and the ability to power your home for at least three days, if needed.\n\nWithin our new line-up, disruptive technology allows us to enrich the customer experience and make the transition to electric vehicles simple.\n\n**Ford Europe**\n\nFord of Europe\u2019s clear vision to be \u201cAll in on EVs\u201d is central to us achieving our sustainability objectives. Not only does it address the largest portion of our CO2 emissions as a region, it provides a sustainable foundation and catalyst for further change, as we drive forward our carbon neutrality plans for our facilities, supply chain and transportation network.\n\nWe are well on the way to achieving our objective of 76% reduction in scope 1 and 2 emissions and 100% carbon-free electricity in our manufacturing operations by 2035. We are now focused on developing plans to address one our biggest challenges, how to transition our extensive, global supply base to carbon neutrality.\n\n100% carbon-free electricity in our manufacturing operations by 2035\nAt Ford, we understand the urgency of climate change, and we have a role to play. We are delivering exciting electric vehicles for the many rather than the few. As we take leadership of the electric vehicle revolution, our goal is to not only build high-quality vehicles at scale, but to do so in a way that creates a positive impact on people and the environment.\"\n\nCynthia Williams, Global Director Sustainability, Homologation and Compliance\n\nBuilt-in charging solutions route customers to nearby charging stations, recommend where to charge on trips and provide easy access and payment via FordPass\u00ae for a seamless customer experience.\n\nFor public consumption, the BlueOval Charging network has over 250,000 charge points in Europe \u2014 and it\u2019s growing \u2014 helping give customers confidence that they can get where they want to go. In Europe, Ford is a founding member and shareholder in the IONITY consortium \u2014 delivering high-power charging stations along motorway routes and at key European locations. The number of IONITY high-power charging points will more than quadruple to around 7,000 by 2025.\n\nIn terms of GHG impact, vehicle use is the main source of emissions. Use-phase CO\u2082 emissions depend on many factors, including the energy source and the way the vehicles are driven. Using the GHG Protocol methodology and preliminary data to estimate emissions from vehicle on-road use, we calculate that our vehicles sold in 2021 will produce approximately 250 million metric tons of CO\u2082e from fuel production and combustion over a 150,000 mile lifetime, on a well-to-wheels basis.\n\nSupply chain responsibility is best addressed in partnership with other manufacturers and suppliers. Thus, the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) founded the Responsible Supply Chain Initiative (RSCI) with 14 founding members from the automotive industry. We are working with the VDA and others to improve our understanding of supply chain risks and to help the suppliers with a consistent approach. As a result, RSCI is developing a standardized test procedure for evaluating the sustainability performance of automotive suppliers. RSCI is launching initial pilot assessments in 2022. The RSCI audit platform will facilitate suppliers\u2019 sharing of audit results and avoiding any duplication of efforts.\n\nMinimizing our Supply Chain Impacts\n\nWe rely on thousands of suppliers to provide materials, components, and services for our vehicles. By sharing what has worked well at Ford, we can help them cut costs, improve quality, and become more sustainable. We engage with our supply chain to understand our collective environmental footprint and work with selected suppliers through target setting and cascading best practices to reduce their carbon emissions, energy consumption, water use, and waste.\n\nBy sharing successful initiatives with nearly 80 key suppliers through our Partnership for a Cleaner Environment (PACE) program, we are cascading best practices through our supply chain. So far, our suppliers have implemented projects in at least 13 countries: United States, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Germany, India, Mexico, Poland, Serbia, South Africa, and Thailand. Around 182 million gallons of water savings are expected between 2020 and 2030 through PACE suppliers. FastPACE, a streamlined version of PACE, is helping reduce the impact of key partners in China, India, Thailand, and South Africa. Supplier participation has increased from 2020 to 2021 by over 60%. As a result, FastPACE suppliers are on track to save an estimated 4,909 metric tons of CO\u2082 and 24 million gallons of water over the next three years.\nAlthough we focus on improving tailpipe or tank-to-wheels (TTW) emissions, we also continue to study well-to-wheels (WTW) impacts in keeping with our carbon-neutrality aspiration. These include the production (well-to-tank, or WTT) and consumption (TTW) of fuel and electricity during vehicle use. WTW emissions vary between vehicle, engine type, and energy source. Our Scope 3 SBTi vehicle CO\u2082 target is based on WTW emissions.\n\nWe acknowledge the fact that WTT emissions are part of the total vehicle life cycle; however, these emissions are beyond our direct control. We, therefore, look to address these impacts in collaboration with a range of partners, including fuel and electricity producers, infrastructure developers, and governments.\n\n**Advances in Engine and Transmission Technologies**\n\n**Gasoline Engines**\n\nAs we develop our electric vehicles, we are ensuring that our internal combustion engine (ICE) powertrains continue to provide a desirable balance of performance, fuel economy, and durability while meeting increasingly stringent criteria emissions requirements. Our EcoBoost engines are deployed across nearly 100% of the portfolio, and combine engine downsizing, turbocharging, direct fuel injection, and twin-independent variable cam timing to improve fuel economy without compromising performance.\n\nWe\u2019ve recently coupled our 3.5L EcoBoost engine with hybrid technology in the PowerBoost\u2122 Full Hybrid F150, offering significant fuel savings along with enhanced capability, such as providing exportable power. Additionally, we\u2019ve incorporated advanced full and plug-in hybrid systems in multiple vehicles globally, including our new Maverick hybrid truck, achieving EPA-estimated 42 miles per gallon in the city* for under $20,000 in the U.S. In Europe, the Kuga is number 1 in its segment for all plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs).\n\n*2.5L Hybrid powertrain. Actual mileage will vary.\n\n**Diesel Engines**\n\nModern diesel engines offer reduced CO\u2082 emissions and fuel consumption, especially in commercial applications requiring heavy load and towing capability. Thanks to advanced diesel engine technology, they can achieve 20\u201330% better fuel economy than comparable gasoline engines in specific markets and segments, such as light\n\n**Electrification represents the most transformative change of our industry in over 100 years and at Ford of Europe, we are leading the way in our ambition to create a sustainably profitable all-electric future. We\u2019re doing this with both passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles, providing customer choice while delivering CO\u2082 performance.\u201d**\n\nStuart Rowley, President Ford of Europe\n\n---\n\n**CDP Carbon: Ford 2021 Reported Emissions**\n\n- Vehicles-tailpipe (TTW): 77%\n- Vehicles-energy production (WTT): 7%\n- Suppliers: 13%\n- Misc: 2%\n- Facilities: 1%\n\nWell to Wheel (WTW) = Well to Tank (WTT) + Tank to Wheel (TTW)\n\n95%+ of our emissions are from vehicle use, facilities and suppliers.

We continue to optimize these benefits in our EcoBlue and Powerstroke offerings.\n\nIn Europe, the 2.0-liter Ford EcoBlue diesel combines the refinement and performance traditionally associated with Ford diesel, with emission control solutions capable of addressing the challenge of Real Driving Emissions (RDE). The Kuga, Transit, and Transit Custom offer a mild hybrid version of the 2.0-liter EcoBlue, completing the lineup of efficient powertrains and adding an electrified option, with further improved fuel economy and Auto Start/Stop.\n\nAdvanced Transmissions and Drivelines\nWe continue to optimize our transmissions by upgrading electronic controls to improve fuel economy and emissions. We have introduced a 7-speed automatic transmission for Ford Fiesta and Puma (including mild-hybrid variants), while most Ford vehicles will continue to use the 8-speed automatic transmissions for front-wheel-drive vehicles, and a 10-speed automatics for rear-wheel-drive vehicles. Our transmission team is now shifting focus to develop innovative technology for electrified vehicles.\n\nAlternative Fuels and Powertrains\nAlternative fuel vehicles enable our customers to reduce their CO2 footprint during the transition to electrification. Depending on infrastructure, technology development, policy, and customer acceptance, our path toward a long-term carbon-neutral portfolio will be powered by some combination of electricity, hydrogen, and hydrocarbon fuels from sustainable sources. Examples of hydrocarbon fuels are sustainable biofuels and fuels synthesized from electricity, water, and carbon. Synthetic fuels made from electricity are often called \u201ce-fuels.\u201d We anticipate that different regions will adopt different solutions and different mixes of electricity, hydrogen, and hydrocarbon fuels.\n\nAlternative fuel vehicles can reduce GHGs on a well-to-wheels basis, which includes emissions from both producing and consuming the fuels. Compared to conventional gasoline (E10) vehicles, GHG emissions are about 15% lower for diesel and compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles, 25% lower for B20 (20% biodiesel blend) and 30% lower for E85 (85% ethanol from corn). Even more reduction is possible with FCVs (50% lower GHGs using hydrogen from steam methane reforming) and EVs (60% lower when charged with U.S. average grid electricity). When hydrogen and electricity are produced using carbon-free energy, the in-use GHG reduction is up to 100% on a well-to-wheels basis.\n\nWe offer our customers many vehicles that are capable of using these reduced-GHG fuels. All our diesel vehicles are compatible with low-level biodiesel blends (B20 in U.S., B7 in Europe). Also in Europe, our Transit, Transit Custom, Transit Courier, Transit Connect, and Ranger are compatible with paraffinic diesel (EN 15940) such as HVO/E-diesel. Paraffinic diesel can be blended with standard fossil diesel fuel resulting in up to 33% renewable content.\n\nIn motorsports, the M-Sport Ford World Rally Team is combining both alternative fuels and electrification. All FIA WRC Rally competitors will use a fossil-free fuel in the 2022 season, blending synthetic e-fuel and biofuel elements to produce a fuel that is 100% sustainable. The new M-Sport Ford Puma Hybrid Rally is Ford\u2019s first electrified competition car.\n\nReducing Emissions in Our Operations\nImproved energy efficiency and conservation in our facilities and manufacturing processes have resulted in a 35% reduction in our GHG footprint since 2017. Using energy more efficiently, procuring power from carbon-free sources, reducing GHG emissions from our operations, and making our transportation and\n\nVehicles Powered by Alternative Fuels\n\n| Renewable Biofuel Vehicles | CNG and LPG Vehicles | Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles (FCVs) |\n|---------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|\n| **Fuel**                  | **Benefits**        | **Models**                       |\n| Ethanol, made from fermented corn sugars or sugar cane, is usually blended with gasoline (e.g., E10, E15, E22 or E85); ethanol from non-food feedstocks is technically feasible | Biofuels made from renewable resources may reduce CO2 emissions | E85 FFV (U.S.): F-150, F-250, F-350, F-450 Super Duty, Police Interceptor Utility, Transit, Transit Connect, Transit Cutaway/Chassis Cab, E-350, E-450 Cutaway and Stripped Chassis |\n| Renewable diesel and biodiesel can be made from soy, canola, rapeseed, corn or palm oil, or animal fats, and mixed with fossil diesel | Next-generation biofuels made from plant cellulose use stems and leaves, reducing competition for food crops | E85 FFV (Europe/in France and Sweden only): Kuga, Fiesta, Puma, Focus, Transit Connect |\n| Biodiesel via transesterification (FAME) typically has lower blends (B5,B7, B20) | Lower well-to-wheels CO2 emissions than gasoline or diesel vehicles | B20 (U.S.): F-250, F-350, F-450, F-550, F-600, F-600, Super Duty Pickups and Chassis Cabs; F-650 and F-750 Medium Duty Chassis Cab |\n| Paraffinic renewable diesel produced via hydrotreating (HVO) or the Fischer-Tropsch process can be blended at higher concentrations (R33 up to R100) | Lower non-CO2 emissions | R33 (Europe EN 590): Transit, Transit Custom, Transit Courier, Transit Connect, Ranger |\n| **Benefits**              |                     | Wide range of U.S. commercial vehicles with CNG/Propane prep kits: F-250, F-350, F-450, F-550, F-600, F-600, Super Duty Pickups and Chassis Cabs; F-650 and F-750 Medium Duty Chassis Cab |\n| Biofuels made from renewable resources may reduce CO2 emissions | Zero-emission electric vehicles (taiiplo) with only-water and low-temperature heat as by-products | R100 (Europe EN 5944-2): Transit, Transit Custom, Transit Courier, Transit Connect, Ranger |\n| Next-generation biofuels made from plant cellulose use stems and leaves, reducing competition for food crops | Lower well-to-wheels CO2 emissions than gasoline or diesel vehicles | R100 (Europe EN 5944-2): Transit, Transit Custom, Transit Courier, Transit Connect, Ranger |\n| Lower non-CO2 emissions | Zero-emission electric vehicles (taiiplo) with only-water and low-temperature heat as by-products | R100 (Europe EN 5944-2): Transit, Transit Custom, Transit Courier, Transit Connect, Ranger |\n\nIn motorsports, the M-Sport Ford World Rally Team is combining both alternative fuels and electrification.

BlueOval City is designed to achieve carbon neutrality, send zero waste to landfill, and use freshwater only for human consumption once fully operational. The $7 billion investment supports our goal of creating a sustainable American manufacturing ecosystem as it creates jobs for the local communities and builds on Ford\u2019s position as America\u2019s leading employer of hourly autoworkers.\n\nlogistics more sustainable and efficient all play a role in reaching our carbon neutrality goal. We are also mindful of opportunities to have a positive impact in the local community and surrounding ecosystem. This work is guided by our global manufacturing carbon reduction strategy.\n\nOur energy-efficiency and conservation efforts over the past decade have focused on improvements to lighting, compressed air, rotating equipment (fans, pumps and motors), and heating systems. We\u2019ve also improved processes and consolidated and/or closed plants to improve utilization of operations. The net effect of these efforts is a 35% absolute reduction in our global manufacturing GHG emissions target in 2017, eight years early, through initiatives such as installing LED lights and updating our painting operations.\n\nOur present manufacturing target is an 18% absolute reduction in GHG by 2023. To achieve this, we are focused on securing a renewable and reliable energy supply for our manufacturing plants, making these facilities even more efficient, and leveraging data to drive decisions.\n\nWe report our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, participate in emissions trading schemes such as the EU European Trading Scheme (EU ETS) and adhere to a number of carbon reduction initiatives in the United States, Europe, Mexico, Canada, and other countries.\n\nLooking to the future, we are focused on driving energy efficiency throughout the manufacturing processes. We\u2019re incorporating energy-efficient best practices as we build new offices. Our Research and Engineering and Corktown campuses will achieve an Energy Utilization intensity that is 50% better than historical Ford office spaces. And in Dearborn, the new Research and Engineering Center under construction is designed to be carbon neutral when it is occupied in 2025. These and other efforts make progress toward achieving our 2035 SBTI target of 76% GHG reduction in combined manufacturing and non-manufacturing locations.\n\nWe\u2019ll be measuring our progress. Sustainability linked performance metrics align our financing actions with our commitment to operate a safe, sustainable and successful business \u2013 elements that are fundamental to the Ford+ Plan for growth and value creation.\n\nRead more about our Sustainable Financing Framework on p.27\n\nMeeting Customer Preferences\n\nOur global fuels migration path and our technology migration plan are based on delivering high-quality vehicles that consumers desire while responding to the risks associated with climate change.\n\nGiven the urgency of the climate crisis, we are focusing on electrification, prioritizing all-electric versions of our most iconic models, the Mustang Mach-E, the Ford-150 Lightning, and the E-Transit commercial van. Our strategy is to make the electric vehicles the most capable vehicles we have embracing a clean-sheet approach to designing, launching and scaling breakthrough, high-volume electric and connected products and services for retail, commercial, and shared mobility.\n\nElectrification of these nameplates is delighting existing customers and bringing new customers to Ford. 70% of our Mustang Mach-E customers are new to Ford. More than 75% of F-150 Lightning reservation holders are new to the Ford brand.6\n\nHowever, we understand that not all of our customers are ready to make the switch to EVs. So we\u2019re offering a full range of efficient engine types with plug-in hybrids and \u201ctraditional\u201d hybrids filling the spectrum from internal combustion engines to the all-electric Mustang Mach-E. Providing our customers with efficient, low-carbon alternatives during the transition to carbon neutrality is critical as we research and develop alternative powertrains and fuel options for our vehicles.\n\nModernizing Manufacturing in Thailand\n\nWe are modernizing our Thailand manufacturing operations with a $900 million (THB 28 billion) investment in new technologies and systems, the company\u2019s largest-ever single investment in Thailand. Part of the Ford+ Plan for growth and value creation, the investment supports production of the next-gen Ranger pickup truck and Everest SUV.\n\nFord Thailand Manufacturing and AutoAlliance Thailand are making significant efforts to support environmentally friendly initiatives, including using renewable energy, reducing CO\u2082 emissions, and practicing zero waste to landfill.\n\nThe overall investment brings Ford\u2019s manufacturing facilities in Thailand in line with the latest global efficiency, flexibility, and quality processes, through extensive upgrades and new state-of-the-art manufacturing technologies and accompanying training for Ford employees and suppliers.\nOn the commercial side, our goal is to provide our customers with greater value and higher productivity through the industry's most comprehensive and flexible range of electric and internal combustion commercial vehicles. With Ford Pro, we're incorporating digital and physical services that can help optimize and maintain customer fleets and offering public, depot, and employee home charging of EVs for the next day's work.\n\nWe will continue to improve fuel economy and reduce CO\u2082 emissions across our global vehicle portfolio to minimize the environmental impact associated with their use, while rapidly increasing the sales rate of our electrified vehicles.\n\n**Climate Change Reporting**\n\nWe are committed to transparently reporting our climate change strategies and their resilience. We have received the 2020 CDP ratings and received A ratings for both Water and Climate (our 3rd year in a row as \"A\" for climate and 7th for water) and have issued climate change scenario reports since 2019. This year we have produced a consolidated report that combines our Climate Change Scenario Report and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Index. The report outlines our strategies, World Energy Outlook 2021 Scenarios, the resiliency of our strategies to those scenarios, and how we will monitor and review the impacts of climate change on our strategies.\n\nRead more in our TCFD Report\nRead more in Electrification and Connectivity section on p.45\nCarbon-Free Electricity and Energy Future\n\nOur goal of achieving 100 percent carbon-free electricity in all manufacturing by 2035 will be bolstered by the potential dedicated investments in wind, solar, geothermal, hydropower, and biomass.\n\nWe are committed to reducing the effects of our operations and supply chains. In addition to developing world-class facilities, sourcing 100 percent carbon-free electricity for our global operations by 2035 is a key strategy to help us achieve this goal.\n\nSecuring Carbon-Free Electricity\nTo replace fossil-based generation, we\u2019ll be procuring a mix of wind, solar power, nuclear, geothermal, biomass, energy storage, and hydro. One strategy is to secure carbon-free electricity through relationships with local utilities, power producers, and independent project developers. And we\u2019re already making progress.\n\nAll manufacturing facilities in Ohio, New York, and Mexico will be sourced with 100% carbon-free electricity by 2022 year end. All manufacturing and large commercial facilities in Michigan are expected to be sourced with 100% carbon-free electricity by 2025. Not only does this reduce our emissions, but it also improves the local environment and adds resiliency to the local grid.\n\nSustainability-linked performance metrics include increasing the percentage of renewable electricity consumed in Ford\u2019s global manufacturing plants.\n\nRooftop Solar Array\nAlso in Michigan, DTE Energy, the state\u2019s largest producer of renewable energy has commissioned a new rooftop solar array at a parking garage at Ford Research & Engineering Center in Dearborn, Michigan. The 2,159-panel array includes an integrated battery storage system and will be used to power newly installed electric vehicle (EV) chargers. The solar array can generate 1.127 million kWh of clean energy, avoiding 880 tons of CO2, which has the environmental benefit equal to the carbon sequestered by nearly 980 acres of U.S. forests in one year.\n\nThe new solar array is just one of several steps both companies are taking to reduce carbon emissions. In 2019, Ford became the first corporate customer to enroll in DTE\u2019s MiGreenPower voluntary renewable energy program. Through the program, Ford is purchasing 525,000 megawatt hours annually of Michigan wind energy from DTE\u2019s Isabella and Fairbanks wind parks.\n\nModernizing Plants for Energy Efficiency\nWe\u2019re modernizing plants in South Africa and Thailand with an eye towards energy efficiency. We\u2019re also ensuring our new plants are energy efficient. Ford has been in talks with utilities to procure carbon-free energy and hopes to harness geothermal energy to provide both heating and cooling for the facilities.\n\nIn Europe, Ford is already using 100 percent carbon-free electricity to power: Dunton and Daventry in the U.K., the Craiova plant in Romania, and all facilities in Cologne, Germany including the vehicle assembly and engine plants, as well as the Research Center in Merkenich. We expect that Europe will be among the first global regions to become carbon neutral.\n\nJiangling and Changan Ford Hangzhou Plants, China\nFord Joint Venture Jiangling Automobile production plant is currently planning the installation and use of solar panels. The planned 300,000 solar photovoltaic panels are expected to generate 60 million kWh of solar power and reduce carbon emissions by more than 50,000 tons annually.\n\nThe Jiangling Plant will join the Changan Ford Hangzhou Plant, which completed the installation of solar photovoltaic panels in 2019. In 2020, the Hangzhou Branch\u2019s annual solar power supply reached 13 million kWh, accounting for 25% of the total power consumption of the plant and reducing nearly 10,000 tons of carbon emissions.\n\nSilverton Plant, South Africa\nNew advanced technologies and systems are being developed at the Ford Silverton Assembly Plant in Pretoria, to support expanded production of the all-new Ranger pickup truck, starting in 2022. Silverton is moving towards energy self-sufficiency and carbon neutrality, while increasing annual installed capacity to 200,000 vehicles for domestic sales and export to 100+ global markets. The first phase of Project BlueOval already is underway with the construction of solar carports for 4,200 vehicles at the Silverton Plant.\n\nPacheco Plant, Argentina\nOur Pacheco plant in Argentina is making strides on environmental responsibility on a variety of fronts. In 2021, it achieved more than 50% of renewable electrical energy consumption and recycled 93% of total waste generated as of November 2021. It is reducing kWh usage in compressed air generation from 36% to 25% and completing energy meter installation in all manufacturing facilities. Lastly, it is creating a native forest comprised of 120 local species to capture carbon emissions.\n\nRead more about our Sustainable Financing Framework on p.27\nAir Quality\n\nWe believe that everyone is entitled to breathe clean air. Reducing air pollution is vital to protecting people and the environment \u2014 and our efforts to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.\n\nThrough our research and vehicle development, we are working to reduce emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter that pollute the air, in accordance with increasingly stringent standards around the world.\n\nStandards Continue to Tighten\n\nInternal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) emit hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. These pollutants can affect air quality, particularly in urban areas, and potentially impact human health.\n\nFord is proud to comply with all global criteria emission standards as they are introduced. The enforcement of such standards has led to lower vehicle emissions and, along with actions in sectors beyond transportation (residential, commercial, and industrial), have led to major improvements in air quality in many cities in recent decades. In communities where air pollution and climate change are disproportionate burdens today, access to electric vehicles can help provide health, economic, and mobility benefits. Ford\u2019s electrification strategy not only reduces GHG emissions, but also improves local air quality.\n\nSeveral countries and states are announcing plans to ban ICEVs or implement 100% zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) sales targets to further improve air quality.\n\nOur Progress in China\n\nAll Ford manufacturing facilities in China have taken various measures to significantly reduce emissions. From 2020 to 2021, plants reduced VOC emissions by 19% (3.7g/m\u00b2), equivalent to an annual reduction of more than 250 metric tons of VOC emissions through various management and engineering investment measures, contributing to cleaner air.\n\nRegional Emissions Standards\n\n| Already Compliant or Surpassing | United States | Europe | China | Other Regions |\n|---------------------------------|---------------|--------|-------|---------------|\n| Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Tier 2 regulations | \u2022 National stage-6a (China-6a) LDV and HDV emissions standards nationwide | \u2022 Euro 6d Real Driving Emissions (RDE) standards | \u2022 India: Bharat Stage VI | |\n| California\u2019s Low Emission Vehicle II (LEV II) program | \u2022 National stage-6b (China-6b) LDV emission standards in five cities and provinces | | \u2022 Brazil and Argentina: PROCONVE L-6 and standards based on Euro 5 | |\n| | | | \u2022 Middle East: Standards based on Euro 2, Euro 3, Euro 4 and Euro 5 | |\n| | | | \u2022 S.

We have a responsibility to use and manage water sources efficiently and sustainably.\n\nOur Water Strategy\nOur long-term approach reflects the need to understand water challenges in their local context, with extraction policies and practices designed to make sure our operations do not adversely affect other users\u2019 access to water.\n\nOur 2025 Global Manufacturing Water Strategy, the third iteration of our water strategy, aims to continue Ford\u2019s position as a leader in water reduction in manufacturing processes and secure optimal freshwater availability in local communities. It targets a 15% reduction in absolute freshwater usage. Ford has already reduced its annual freshwater consumption by over 78% since 2000; that\u2019s over 12.5 billion gallons of water saved compared to 2000 usage. Our global water conservation actions are equal to providing a year\u2019s worth of water to 1.4 million homes.\n\nWe will continue to work towards our existing aspirational goals of freshwater for human consumption only and zero water withdrawals for manufacturing. This includes establishing local ecosystem performance goals and improving water discharge quality, with a focus on direct discharge plants. We are examining how water cycling impacts communities and how to better emulate the natural system.\n\nOur new plant in Tennessee aspires to make zero freshwater withdrawals for assembly processes by incorporating water reuse and recycling systems. Stakeholders responded positively to our goal of preserving water and striving for full water recycling.\n\nWhat Is Freshwater?\nFreshwater, the main source of drinking water around the world, is recognized as essential for human life and wellbeing in Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standard 303. The GRI defines freshwater as surface water, but our definition is broader, including both surface water and groundwater.\n\nWe are applying freshwater reduction methods as well as improving our water quality discharges at our sites that mimic the behavior and performance of the local ecosystem.\n\nWe have made progress toward our aspiration of using freshwater only for human consumption in our facilities that are in water-scarce regions, such as Mexico, China, and South Africa. In 2021, our use of alternative water exceeded 7% in these regions. Additionally Chennai Engine and Assembly have joined our Chihuahua Engine facility in achieving this goal by using zero freshwater for its manufacturing processes.\nWater Use and Stewardship \u2013 continued\n\nReducing Operational Water Use\nWater use and recycling are occurring at Ford plants around the world. We continue to integrate more water-efficient processes and technologies as we work to further decrease our water consumption.\n\nAbsolute water was down nearly 9% from the year prior and down 27% from the 2019 strategy baseline \u2013 an almost 78% reduction from the initial 2000 water strategy.*\n\n*Data updated May 23, 2022.\n\nHowever, these reductions were largely attributed to vehicle manufacturing down time associated with the global microchip shortage.\n\nOur South Africa Silverton Plant has the aspirational goal of being net zero and carbon neutral as well as full water recycling.\n\nOur CDP A List achievements\nFord earned a place on the CDP \u201cA List\u201d for protecting water security again in 2021. We have received an A score rating from CDP for water reduction for seven years in a row and are one of only 119 companies globally to earn such an award for water security. We were also on CDP\u2019s Climate Change \u201cA list\u201d for the third straight year. We are one of the two North American OEM to obtain double A List status.\n\nWater Strategy Progression\n\nVersion 1\n- Efficiency (external metric)\n- Recycle/Reuse (track)\n\nVersion 2\n- Efficiency (external metric)\n- Recycle/Reuse (track)\n- Alternative Water Source (metric)\n  - Aspirational goals:\n    - Freshwater for Domestic use\n    - Zero water for Manufacturing\n\nVersion 3\n- Efficiency (external metric)\n- Recycle/Reuse (track)\n- Alternative Water Source (metric)\n  - Aspirational goals:\n    - Freshwater for Domestic use\n    - Zero water for Manufacturing\n    - Ecosystem Performance\n    - Water Discharge Quality\n\nCASE STUDY\nFord India\u2019s Drive for Zero Water Consumption\nAt Ford\u2019s Chennai Vehicle Assembly and Engine Plant, freshwater consumption is down to an incredible 1.17 m\u00b3 per vehicle \u2013 from 7.3 m\u00b3 per vehicle only a decade ago. Having identified an alternate source of water to treat, for use in non-production activities, the smart water efficiency processes are used to recycle almost 100% of industrial wastewater for use in manufacturing.\n\nFord\u2019s Sanand Vehicle Assembly & Engine Plant in Gujarat has zero water discharge, with a 110,000 m\u00b3 rain water harvesting pond used for pallet washing, irrigation, and in the cooling towers.\n\nFord\u2019s Global Business Technology & Business Center in Chennai (GTBC) can also claim zero discharge, thanks to its 100% reuse of treated wastewater for dual plumbing, horticulture, and cooling tower chiller. Ford GTBC \u2013 opened in 2019 \u2013 earned its Platinum green building rating at launch; the highest possible certification for sustainable buildings. The globally recognized certificate not only factors in water conservation but also sustainable design, architecture, and building material resources; energy conservation including use of renewable energy resources; indoor environment quality; and innovation and development.\nWaste Management\n\nWaste: Reach true zero waste to landfill across our operations\nEliminate single-use plastics from our operations by 2030\n\nReducing Waste\nReducing waste reduces our impact on the planet \u2014 and optimizes efficiency in our resource-intensive industry. We reuse or recycle any waste we do generate wherever possible, avoiding the landfill and providing us with an additional supply of valuable resources.\n\nMeeting Our Waste Targets\nThe focus of our global waste strategy is to manage and minimize the waste we generate. We strive to reduce costs and keep waste out of landfill. Our waste targets remained largely unchanged despite COVID-19. We made some operational adjustments based on impacts at site level but our initial glide path remains constant.\n\nIn 2021, Ford facilities around the world sent approximately 16,300 metric tons of waste to landfill, 7% less than in 2020.\n\nOver five years from a 2017 baseline, we are targeting a 35% reduction in waste sent to landfill, a 15% reduction in waste generation, and a 25% reduction in general trash. We are developing a strategy to achieve our aspiration of eliminating single-use plastics from our global operations by 2030.\n\nGoing for Zero\nIn addition to our focus on reducing waste to landfill at our facilities, we are focused on minimizing the amount of waste we generate. Beginning in the third quarter of 2021, all Ford manufacturing plants in China achieved zero waste to landfill (ZWTL). Waste generated in all factories will either be managed for thermal destruction with or without energy recovery or recycled instead of being sent to landfills for final disposal. All of our European facilities have acquired ZWTL status, which means they send absolutely no waste to landfill. Globally Ford has 89 ZWTL manufacturing and non-manufacturing sites and 74% of global manufacturing sites are true ZWTL.\n\nTo ensure that more of our facilities reach ZWTL status, we continue to implement a range of waste reduction initiatives.\n\nThese include:\n\u2022 Implementing new technologies and programs that minimize waste\n\u2022 Standardizing the tracking and sorting of waste to increase recycling and reuse\n\u2022 Focusing on the five main sources of waste to landfill at each facility\n\u2022 Working with suppliers to increase the use of eco-friendly packaging\n\nReducing the Impact of Packaging\nPackaging is crucial for protecting components on their journey to our facilities. Using standardized containers and materials helps to optimize payloads and lower costs. In many locations, we have agreements with packaging providers so that containers are collected, stored, and forwarded to other suppliers.\n\nBefore we launch a new vehicle, we work with suppliers to review how components and production parts will be packaged. Our packaging guidelines for North America and Asia Pacific require our suppliers\u2019 packaging to have at least a neutral, if not positive, environmental footprint, achieved through the use of 100% recycled, renewable or recyclable materials.\n\nReducing End-of-Life Impacts\nWe proactively review non-dimensional materials such as lubricants and paints within our manufacturing operations. Going beyond applicable regulations, we are developing a timeline to further reduce substances of concern in our facilities, including those that are carcinogenic or environmentally persistent.\n\nPackaging that Avoids the Landfill\nPackaging for assembly line components used to end up in landfills. Not any more. The team at the Dagenham Engine Plant in the U.K. have been honored for creating the FrameTray system (FTS), injection-molded trays and lids that can be endlessly recycled. The FTS is saving millions of dollars and offers a 50% increase in packing density. It\u2019s a cost-effective innovation that\u2019s now positively helping other parts of the supply chain \u2013 as well as the planet.\n\n35% reduction in waste sent to landfill target by 2030\nSustainable Materials\n\nOur commitment to using sustainable materials is part of our history, our present \u2013 and our future.\n\nAutomobiles are among the world\u2019s most recycled consumer products. Although many products could be 100% recycled, few are. Over 85% of vehicle parts and materials are actually recycled and reused at their end of life with the vehicle\u2019s metallic portion being highly recycled. Rather than focusing on end of life metal recycling which is already a great success, we focus on using recycled and renewable content in plastics and closed loop recycling.\n\nBy using recycled and renewable materials in our vehicles\u2019 design, we\u2019re reducing landfill waste and using fewer natural resources.\n\nPlastic in Vehicles\n\nAs the amount of plastic usage in vehicles has grown, we have focused on increasing the sustainability of plastics in our vehicles\u2019 design with the goal of using 20% recycled and renewable plastics in new vehicle designs for North America and Europe by 2025 and 10% for China and Turkey. Our aspiration is to utilize only recycled or renewable content in vehicle plastics.\n\nMuch of recycled and renewable content comes from waste products generated by other industries. We use the ISO 14021 standard in accounting for this content, and track our progress using the highest volume variant of our nameplates.\n\nUsing Recycled Materials for Vehicle Parts\n\nRecycling plastics keeps waste out of landfills and decreases the consumption of natural resources and energy. We transform recycled plastic bottles into carpeting, underbody shields, and wheel liners and use post-consumer nylon and polypropylene carpeting for cylinder head covers, fans and shrouds, cam covers, and carbon canisters.\n\nTeams in the EU are working on our recycled content strategy as well as starting research projects like the Green Factory of Tomorrow, where we are improving operational efficiency and better management of natural resources and waste in our manufacturing process.\n\nUsing Renewable Materials for Vehicle Parts\n\nRenewable, plant-based materials also play a role in our sustainability strategy. Ford currently has launched a dozen industry-first, plant-based materials in production vehicles since 2007, establishing a reputation as a leader in this space. These robust materials are often lighter in weight, improving fuel economy. They also sequester carbon during the plants growing phase, reducing global warming impacts, and they require less energy to manufacture. Ford first sustainable materials include soy foam, wheat straw, rice hulls, tree-based cellulose, coconut fiber, and coffee chaff.\n\nFor example, soy seat cushions, backs and headrests have been used on every Ford North American built vehicle (over 18.5 million vehicles) for more than a decade. Bio-based foams on Ford vehicles have collectively reduced GHG emissions by over 240 million pounds using over 730 billion soybeans, which also produces extra revenue for U.S. farmers. Soy foam reduces petroleum dependence by over 5 million pounds annually.\n\nFord was also the first in the industry to launch wheat straw storage bins, rice hull filled electrical wiring covers, and tree-based cellulose composite armrest substrates and console substrates.\n\nThrough a partnership with McDonald\u2019s USA we have incorporated coffee chaff \u2014 the dried skin of the coffee bean \u2014 to reinforce headlamp housings.\n\nOur Sustainable and Emerging Materials group continues to pioneer the development of new sustainable plastic materials including algae fiber reinforced plastics and polymer resins made from renewable feed stocks.\n\nWe\u2019re testing whether the tree-based cellulose composites, that were incorporated into Lincoln Continental consoles, can be used in other applications.\n\nOur partnership with McDonald\u2019s and our use of ocean plastics in the Bronco Sport exemplify our approach to the circular economy \u2013 deriving value from waste material, or \u201cupcycling.\u201d Our goal is to migrate these sustainable materials to other vehicles and applications.\n\nClosing the Loop in Recycling\n\nFord\u2019s approach to the circular economy is not limited to just parts inside the vehicle. Ford is the largest automotive closed-loop aluminum recycler in the world. We worked closely with our aluminum sheet suppliers to create unique alloys just for closed-loop recycling. Our closed-loop system recovers aluminum scrap during parts stamping but keeps the various aluminum alloys separated so they can be recycled back into fresh alloy for new vehicles, which saves 95% of the energy that would be required to create new aluminum from raw ore.\n\nThis closed loop recycling system is used to build the F-Series, recovering up to 20 million pounds of high-strength, military-grade, aluminum alloy per month. This is how Ford maximizes aluminum recycling in our plants and minimizes the need for primary metal.\n\nBronco Sport Parts from 100% Ocean-Harvested Plastic is an Industry First\n\nWe are adding to our legacy of using sustainable materials in vehicles by being the first automaker to use 100% recycled ocean plastics to produce automotive parts.\n\nWiring harness clips in Ford Bronco Sport models are made of ocean-harvested plastic from discarded fishing nets. These nets are called \u201cghost gear\u201d because of the number of marine animals that get trapped in them and the length of time they remain in the ocean wreaking havoc. The strength and durability of the nylon material equals that of previously used petroleum-based parts but at a cost saving, and requires less energy to produce. The ocean plastic is collected by workers in the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea, promoting healthier marine life and providing jobs.\n\n\u201cThis is another example of Ford leading the charge on sustainability,\u201d said Jim Buczkowski, vice president of research and Henry Ford technical fellow. \u201cIt is a strong example of circular economy, and while these clips are small, they are an important first step in our explorations to use recycled ocean plastics for additional parts in the future.\u201d\n**HP Collaboration for Circular Economy Strategy**\n\nFord is continuing to drive the future of automotive 3D printing, this time teaming up with HP to innovatively recycle spent 3D printer powders and parts turning them into injection-molded vehicle parts \u2013 an industry first.\n\nThe recycled materials are being used to manufacture injection-molded fuel-line clips installed first on Super Duty F-250 trucks. The injection molded parts are better for the environment with no compromise in the durability and quality standards Ford and its customers demand.\n\nThey have better chemical and moisture resistance than conventional versions, are lighter and cost less. The Ford research team has identified other fuel-line clips that could benefit from this innovative use of material and are migrating it to future models.\n\n\u201cFinding new ways to work with sustainable materials, reducing waste and leading the development of the circular economy are passions at Ford,\u201d said Debbie Mielewski, Ford technical fellow, Sustainability. \u201cMany companies are finding great uses for 3D printing technologies, but, together with HP, we\u2019re the first to find a high-value application for waste powder that likely would have gone to landfill, transforming it into functional and durable auto parts.\u201d\n\n**Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) Research**\n\nOur LCA-based studies evaluate potential environmental implications of vehicle raw materials and manufacturing; for example, aluminum production and recycling, recycled polymers, cradle-to-gate impacts of lithium-ion batteries, environmental benefits of using second-life EV batteries, and additive manufacturing.\n\nIn the EU, we are preparing for expected regulations related to LCAs.\n\n**Recycling Batteries with Redwood**\n\nBatteries are at the heart of our electrification strategy. We are collaborating with Redwood Materials to integrate battery recycling into our domestic battery strategy. Redwood\u2019s recycling technology can recover, on average, more than 95% of strategic materials such as nickel, cobalt, lithium, and copper.\n\nThese materials can be recycled and remanufactured in a closed-loop where Redwood produces anode copper foil and cathode active materials for future battery production. Using domestically produced battery materials from as much recycled content as available, will help ensure valuable materials in products re-enter the supply chain, reducing our reliance on the existing commodities supply chain and overseas component manufacturing that will be quickly overwhelmed by industry demand.\n\nLonger-term, Ford and Redwood plan to work together on the best approach to collect and disassemble end-of-life batteries from Ford\u2019s electric vehicles for recycling and remanufacturing to help reduce the cost associated with battery components and raw materials to manufacture all-new batteries.\n\n**Minimizing Substance of Concern**\n\nWe also work to minimize substances of concern in our products and facilities. We have developed a list of targeted chemicals compiled from international, authoritative sources and engage suppliers to reduce these substances through process efficiencies, product replacements, or reformulation.\n\n**Our work with Redwood will, by design, help ensure the infrastructure is in place to cost-effectively recycle end-of-life Ford batteries to create a robust domestic materials stream and drive down the cost of electric vehicles.\u201d**\n\nLisa Drake, Vice President, EV Industrialization \u2013 Ford Model e\n\n---\n\n**What is a typical vehicle**\n\nAround 40,000 parts\u2026\n\nusing 1,000 materials\u2026\n\nand 10,000 chemical substances\u2026\n\n17% plastics, elastomers, textiles (area to improve)\n\n4% other\n\n75% metals (already highly recycled)\n\n4% liquids (already recycled or reused)\nBuilding Value Together\n\nCreating Responsible and Ethical Growth\nAt Ford, we are proud of being a trusted company, known for acting with integrity. Last year, we modernized and simplified Ford\u2019s Code of Conduct to build upon this trust and increase transparency around what it means to work at or with Ford. We\u2019ve made understanding and demonstrating our values easier than ever before.\u201d\n\nBeth Rose, Chief Compliance, Ethics and Integrity Officer\n\nOverview\n\nWith our capacity to adapt to change, our business can meet new challenges and goals, not only to create value for our stakeholders, but to do so ethically \u2013 to maintain our long-term viability and accountability as a trusted international business partner leading the next revolution in transportation under the Ford+ umbrella.\n\nThrough our electrification, mobility, connectivity, and sustainability strategies, we are transitioning to a model that emphasizes services, relationships, renewable resources, and human and social capital.\n\nCreating value responsibly and ethically \u2013 building trust in all we do \u2013 spurs this transformation, helping us drive progress and make positive impacts to meet the collective challenges the world faces across a range of sustainability issues.\n\nIn fact, we are actively working to build a better world, with fewer obstacles and limits, so that everyone has the opportunity to pursue their dreams. We know that trust earned with global stakeholders will be our most important asset in dealing with the critical issues covered in this report, including transparency and ethics, global data analytics, privacy and protection, government regulations and policy, and corporate governance and engagement.\nTransparency, Ethics and Integrity\n\nEthics and integrity are a big part of who we are as a company. We always keep ethics and compliance at the heart of our business practices, as we believe that trust in our brand is earned by acting with honesty, expertise, and care.\n\nThat\u2019s why we strive to provide clear policies, effective communication, and engaging training to make it easy for our people to do the right thing and comply with existing laws, regulations, and policies.\n\nThese efforts indicate how important transparency is to Ford \u2013 a key part of our culture that starts at the top and permeates throughout the organization.\n\nServing Others with Integrity and Competence\nA company known for integrity is an invaluable quality that takes years and decades to secure and reinforce. That\u2019s why our Corporate Compliance, Ethics and Integrity Office provides training and communication tools to help our people comply with legal obligations and policies that maintain the highest levels of integrity.\n\nUpholding High Standards of Ethical Conduct and Communicating Openly\nIn unpredictable times, especially during such challenges as a global pandemic and supply shortages, Ford strives to maintain open channels in communicating with all of our stakeholders, with no surprises. For example, Ford\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley uses his Twitter and LinkedIn accounts to disseminate information. And, we now report monthly on vehicle production, dealer inventory, and retail sales instead of the quarterly reporting done by others in the industry. This transparency has been helpful to our investors during the worldwide semiconductor shortage.\n\nUpdating our Code of Conduct\n\nEmployee Code of Conduct\nFord is recognized around the world as a leader in corporate ethics and social responsibility, an accomplishment we are proud of and never take for granted. Ethical behavior begins with treating all members of our extended family of employees, suppliers, and customers with fairness and respect. It is more than compliance with the law. Our values support the cultivation of an environment that is physically and emotionally safe for all, where our differences are truly valued, and where everyone can bring their whole selves to work.\n\nThe Code of Conduct helps Ford employees, suppliers, and customers around the world understand and embrace what we believe in and how we conduct our business, including our aspiration of becoming the world\u2019s most trusted company. It covers areas related to human rights, the environment, and lawful business practices. It is publicly accessible and available in 12 languages.\n\nIn 2021, we updated our Code of Conduct to make it more accessible \u2013 it\u2019s now on our website and in interactive digital formats for the general public as well as employees; it\u2019s easier to understand and follow \u2013 it went from summarizing our 69 policies to clearly demonstrating 17 commitments (policies), including Ford\u2019s We Are Committed to Protecting Human Rights and the Environment policy. And it\u2019s written in more simplified language to increase transparency about what it means to work at and do business with Ford.\n\nRead more in our Code of Conduct\nSupplier Code of Conduct\nAs we increasingly turn our attention not just to the emissions of the vehicles we build but also to the environmental and human rights impacts of making them, we have taken a big step by strengthening the code of conduct that we expect our suppliers to follow. With hundreds of companies involved in building Ford vehicles, supplying everything from fasteners to software, our new Supplier Code of Conduct applies not only to the company\u2019s Tier 1 suppliers, but to their suppliers as well. It is available in eight languages, accessible to everyone.\n\nOur Supplier Code of Conduct mandates that our suppliers maintain responsible business practices:\n\u2022 Conducting business free from bribery and corruption\n\u2022 Maintaining effective privacy and cyber-security practices\n\u2022 Complying with applicable trade and customs rules.\n\nSuppliers are also required to protect and respect human rights, protect the environment and responsibly source materials.\n\nRead more in our Supplier Code of Conduct\n\nAnti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption\nOur many facilities around the world need to comply with a wide range of national laws and governmental enforcement practices with regard to bribery and corruption. We maintain the highest standards wherever we operate and do not allow bribery or corruption, even when it may be tolerated or condoned.\n\nCompliance Training\nThese expectations are reinforced in mandatory online training courses for all Ford salaried full-time, part-time and agency workers, including an annual Code of Conduct course. These courses are periodically refreshed and reviewed to ensure the content remains relevant and appropriate.\n\nReporting Violations\nOur compliance program facilitates the confidential reporting of known or potential violations of the law or of our policies. Our people can report violations directly to Human Resources or the Compliance, Ethics and Integrity Office as well as the Office of the General Counsel or the General Auditors\u2019 Office. Violations can also be reported using the SpeakUp reporting mechanism, telephone hotlines, websites, or email, some of which allow for anonymous reporting. External stakeholders may report by emailing SpeakUp@ford.com.\n\nAllegations are reviewed by a cross-functional committee, which oversees any investigations and subsequent corrective or disciplinary action.\n\nRead more about our Grievance Mechanisms and Remedy in our Human Rights Report\n\nWith hundreds of companies involved in building Ford vehicles, supplying everything from fasteners to software, our new supplier code of conduct applies not just to the company\u2019s Tier 1 suppliers, but to their partners as well.\nData Protection, Privacy and Security\n\nWe take our responsibilities concerning data protection, privacy, and security seriously. The information that customers provide through connected systems helps us deliver great products, a personalized experience, continued innovation, and the opportunity to deploy new business models.\n\nOur company wide governance infrastructure is driven by a holistic approach that includes policies focused on transparency, responsible data handling and use, and consent, where appropriate.\n\nData Privacy and Cybersecurity\n\nAs we continue to develop and produce vehicles with increased connectivity, the scope and severity of risks presented by cyber threats to vehicle operating and security systems have increased dramatically, requiring constant vigilance to protect against intrusions and potential disruptions. We take cyber threats very seriously and regularly audit our cybersecurity capabilities.\n\nTo support and strengthen our global data privacy initiatives, we have adopted the Automotive Consumer Privacy Protection Principles developed by the Alliance for Automotive Innovation. We are actively engaged with the Automotive Cybersecurity Industry Consortium (ACIC), a collaboration formed by the auto industry, research organizations, and government to strengthen cybersecurity in the automotive sector. The ACIC researches, develops, evaluates, and improves cybersecurity by addressing critical infrastructure needs in automotive systems. We are also a founding member of the Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Auto-ISAC), which gathers, analyzes, and shares information to combat cyber-related threats and weaknesses.\n\nIn 2021, Ford hired Rebecca Pagani as our first Chief Privacy Officer, demonstrating our commitment to protecting customer and company data.\n\nWe also maintain an industry-leading cybersecurity insurance program with many of the world\u2019s largest and most respected insurance companies.\n\nData Insight and Analytics\n\nHarnessing the data provided by connected vehicles and using it to create even better experiences continues to be a key priority as vehicle connectivity becomes more prevalent. Our 1,615-strong Global Data, Insight and Analytics (GDI&A) team uses data science and analytics \u2013 including the power of AI and machine learning (ML) \u2013 as the foundation of our innovations. This effort helps us understand and anticipate consumer behavior and accelerates the development of the mobility, electrification, connectivity, and self-driving solutions that will improve people\u2019s lives.\n\nAlways acting with privacy in mind, we use analytics in research, product development, manufacturing, supply chain, marketing and sales, finance, purchasing, information technology, and human resources functions. Led by GDI&A, we\u2019re also using artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance our vehicles and services, improve our product development and manufacturing processes, and deliver enhancements across the business. We are also in the process of developing an internal and external policy strategy for the use of AI to help us address a range of issues \u2013 including ensuring we keep bias out of our AI applications and improving customer experience in all interactions with Ford.\nGovernment Regulations, Policy and Engagement\n\nGovernments around the world make decisions on a variety of important policy issues that have an impact on Ford\u2019s businesses. As a global company, it is critical that Ford has a voice to help inform the policies affecting our employees, customers, and shareholders. We believe strong engagement with government plays a key role in shaping the regulations and legislation that govern our business.\n\nThat\u2019s why the company participates openly and transparently in the political process to support local, state, national, and international policies that are economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable for our company, our customers, and their communities. This activity includes working with the United States Congress and the White House, as well as governments globally, on issues such as a consistent policy toward electrification in all markets, an EV charging infrastructure, the semiconductor chip shortage, battery recycling policies, an effective carbon tax, and opening up the supply of minerals to achieve our business, environmental, and employment objectives.\n\n- As individual citizens, all employees are encouraged to do their part in fulfilling Ford\u2019s responsibilities as a corporate citizen, including participation in constructive governmental activities on behalf of the company.\n- Ford\u2019s management team is expected to keep informed on governmental matters affecting the company\u2019s interests and, where appropriate, to participate in the formulation and presentation of company positions on relevant public issues. They also are expected to do their part in fulfilling Ford\u2019s responsibilities as a corporate citizen, including participation in constructive governmental activities on behalf of the company.\n- Ford does not make contributions to political candidates or political organizations nor otherwise employ its resources for the purpose of helping to elect candidates to public office, even when permitted by law, nor does it take a position for partisan political purposes, that is, specifically for the purpose of advancing the interest of a political party or candidate for public office. However, with the approval of the Office of the Chief Executive, contributions may be made to support or oppose a state or local ballot proposal if such contributions are permitted by law and if the issue is of significant interest or importance to Ford. Contributions not earmarked for particular candidates or political organizations are distributed at the discretion of the Ford\u2019s Political Contributions Committee.\n\nIn 2021, Ford hired Steven Croley as our first Chief Policy Officer. Croley guides the company as it further leverages its strengths in government relations, sustainability, safety, legal and privacy.\n\nTrade Associations and Memberships Focusing on U.S. Policy Issues\nTo use our resources effectively on key issues, we work with a broad range of coalitions, industry groups, and trade associations where we operate. This helps us exchange ideas and collaborate to develop and promote sensible policies that benefit our company, our industry, and society. These organizations often bring diverse viewpoints to the debate, and sometimes their views are not shared by Ford. At times we have exercised our right to make our own position clear and have taken an alternative path when it has been necessary.\n\nClimate Change\nWe believe there is strength and value in using memberships in our trade associations and coalitions to move these organizations toward positions more aligned with Ford\u2019s views on climate. This helps us develop and promote policies that benefit our customers, company, industry, and society.\n\nWe will continue to make decisions based on what\u2019s best for our customers, our environment, and our business. As a member of these groups, we work to make our position known and collaborate with others.\n\nThe California Settlement Agreement is a recent example of Ford\u2019s leadership on climate change. Ford led the industry in aligning towards a fuel economy/GHG proposal with the California Air Resources Board, creating a 50-state solution that is consistent with our common vision for GHG reduction. As a result of these efforts, Ford has not supported federal litigation against California\u2019s authority to set more stringent rules under the Clean Air Act, instead advocating within the industry for a solution that recognizes the authority of both the federal government and California in shaping future climate policy.\n\nBy participating actively, we can shape policy and drive the industry to change, as we are doing \u2013 for example, to encourage groups to align with our progressive climate change strategy.\n\nFord supports a broad range of trade associations and coalitions to enhance our understanding of, and advocacy for, U.S. policy issues. These include:\n- 5G Automotive Association (5GAA)\n- American Automotive Policy Council (AAPC)\n- Alliance for Automotive Innovation\n- CEO Climate Dialogue (CCD)\n- Climate Leadership Coalition\n- Engine Manufacturers Association\n- Intelligent Transportation Society of America (ITSA)\n- National Association of Manufacturers (NAM)\n- National Safety Council\n- NGV America\n- Partnership for Transportation Innovation Opportunity (PTIO)\n- Self-Driving Car Coalition\n- U.S. Chamber of Commerce\n\nRead more in our 2021 U.S. Political Engagement Report\nAccountable and Inclusive Governance\n\nWe need sound governance structures and policies to manage our business, drive performance, and create value responsibly and ethically. These processes and systems serve as the foundation for delivering on our sustainability strategy and integrating sustainability issues into our business decisions.\n\nWhile maintaining a successful business, we also want our operations and activities to have a positive impact on the world. Our integrated governance systems and processes \u2013 including efforts to keep our business lean and agile by reducing bureaucracy, building skills, and adopting efficient ways of working \u2013 help us build sustainability across our company and capitalize on new opportunities in the future.\n\nOur Board of Directors is guided by our Corporate Governance Principles, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for the Board of Directors, and charters for each board committee.\n\nGovernance Principles and Practices\nSolid principles and practices of corporate governance are essential to maintaining the trust of investors. Ford\u2019s Board of Directors has adopted corporate governance principles, policies, and practices to promote effective functioning of the Board, its committees, and the company as a whole.\n\nCorporate Governance Principles \u2013 Together with the charters of the Audit Committee, the Compensation, Talent and Culture Committee, the Sustainability, Innovation and Policy Committee, the Finance Committee and the Nominating and Governance Committee, our Corporate Governance Principles provide the framework for the governance of Ford Motor Company. Our Board of Directors reviews these principles and other aspects of our governance annually or, more often, as deemed necessary or appropriate. The Board is elected by and responsible to Ford\u2019s shareholders. Ford\u2019s business is conducted by its employees, managers, and officers, under the direction of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and oversight of the Board, to enhance the long-term value of the company for its shareholders. The Board of Directors monitors the performance of the CEO and senior management to assure that the long-term interests of the shareholders are being served.\n\nFor additional information on the unique qualifications and demographic backgrounds of our Board members, refer to the Director Skills and Diversity Matrix and director biographies included in our most recent Proxy Statement.\n\nBoard of Directors composition\n\n| Board committees | Board members |\n|------------------|---------------|\n| Audit Committee  | Kimberly A.

Each director must comply with the letter and spirit of this code.\n\nWhile no code or policy can anticipate every situation that may arise, this one is intended to serve as a source of guiding principles and practices for directors to promote the Board\u2019s effective functioning and to maintain the trust of our stakeholders.\n\nRead more about the Governance & Policies on our corporate website\nAccountable and Inclusive Governance \u2013 continued\n\nChanges to the Board in 2021\n\nNew directors:\n- Alexandra Ford English (effective May 13, 2021)\n- Henry Ford III (effective May 13, 2021)\n- John C.

These practices include:\n- Annual Election of All Directors\n- Majority Vote Standard: Each director must be elected by a majority of votes cast\n- Independent Board: The majority of our directors are independent\n- Lead Independent Director: Ensures management is adequately addressing the matters identified by the Board\n- Independent Board Committees: Each of the Audit, Compensation, Talent and Culture, and Nominating and Governance Committees is made up entirely of independent directors\n- Committee Charters: Each standing committee operates under a written charter that has been approved by the Board and is reviewed annually\n\nDirectors\u2019 Remuneration\nEffective as of January 1, 2017, the Board of Directors agreed that the following compensation will be paid to non-employee directors of the company:\n- Annual Board membership fee: $315,000\n- Annual Lead Independent Director fee: $50,000\n- Annual Audit Committee chair fee: $30,000\n- Annual Compensation, Talent and Culture Committee chair fee: $25,000\n- Annual other Committee chair fees: $20,000\n\nApproximately 68% of the Annual Board membership fee is paid in Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), and certain directors choose to receive all or a portion of their fees, in addition to the mandatory portion, in RSUs.\n\nRead more in the director compensation table in our most recent Proxy Statement\n\nSustainability Governance\n\nBoard of Directors\nSustainability, Innovation and Policy Committee\n\nExecutive Cabinet\nFord Leadership Team & CEO\n\nVP, Chief Sustainability, Environment and Safety Officer\n\nGlobal Sustainability & ESG Meeting\nMonthly Executive Officer Review\n\nStrategic Priorities, Objectives & Performance\nIntegrating Sustainability into all our Operations\n\nSustainability\n\nMobility\nFinance\nFord Land\nResearch & Innovation\nGlobal Data Analytics & Insights\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion\nPeople Matters\nCommunications\nPurchasing\nTreasury\nInvestor Relations\nMarketing\nGeneral Counsel\nEnvironmental Quality\n\nGlobal Manufacturing\nProduct Design & Development\nAutomotive Safety\nHuman Resources\nTeam Edison\nFord Credit\nFord Fund\nAccountable and Inclusive Governance \u2013 continued\n\nSustainability Governance\nWe employ a variety of governance systems and processes to manage different aspects of sustainability across our business, as summarized throughout this report.\n\nThe newly named Sustainability, Innovation and Policy Committee, formerly the Sustainability and Innovation Committee, is responsible for reviewing and advising Ford\u2019s pursuit of innovative policies and technologies that promote product safety, improve environmental and social sustainability, including human rights, working conditions, and responsible sourcing. The committee\u2019s focus reflects Ford\u2019s increased emphasis on policy relating to all aspects of our business to achieve our sustainable goals and innovation pursuits.\n\nThe Compensation Committee was renamed the Compensation, Talent and Culture Committee in 2021, reflecting its expanded responsibilities regarding key people-related business strategies, including leadership succession planning; culture; diversity, equity, and inclusion; and talent development programs.\n\nManagement Processes\nAs outlined below, we have a number of management processes, systems, committees, and groups in place that are designed to help us improve our sustainability performance, act responsibly and ethically, and take responsibility for the impact our activities have on society and the world around us.\n\nBoard\u2019s Role in Risk Management\nThe oversight responsibility of the Board and its committees is supported by Company management and the risk management processes that are currently in place. Ford has extensive and effective risk management processes, relating specifically to compliance, reporting, operating, and strategic risks. These include:\n\n- Compliance Risk encompasses matters such as legal and regulatory compliance (e.g., Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, environmental, OSHA/safety, etc.).\n- Reporting Risk covers Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, disclosure controls and procedures, and accounting compliance.\n- Operating Risk addresses the myriad of matters related to the operation of a complex company such as Ford (e.g., quality, supply chain, sales and service, financing and liquidity, product development and engineering, labor, etc.).\n- Strategic Risk encompasses somewhat broader and longer-term matters, including, but not limited to, technology development, environmental and social sustainability, capital allocation, management development, retention and compensation, competitive developments, and geopolitical developments.\n\nWe believe that key success factors in the risk management at Ford include a strong risk analysis tone set by the Board and senior management, which is shown through their commitment to effective top-down and bottom-up communication (including communication between management and the Board and Committees), and active cross-functional participation among the Business Units and Functional Skill Teams.\n\nWe have institutionalized a regular Forecast, Controls and Risk Review and Special Attention Review process where the senior leadership of the Company reviews the status of the business, the risks, and opportunities presented to the business (in the areas of compliance, reporting, operating, and strategic risks), and develops specific plans to address those risks and opportunities.\n\nThe Enterprise Risk Management process adopted by the Company identifies the top critical enterprise risks identified through a survey process of senior management and the Board of Directors. Once identified, each of the top risks is assigned an executive risk owner.\n\nManagement Processes\n\n| Board Committees | Sustainability, Innovation and Policy Committee |\n|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n|                  | \u2022 Meets at least three times a year             |\n|                  | \u2022 Primary responsibility for assessing the company\u2019s progress on strategic economic, product safety, environmental and social issues, as well as the degree to which sustainability principles have been integrated into the various skill teams |\n|                  | \u2022 Evaluates and advises on innovations and technologies that improve our economic, product safety, environmental and social sustainability, enrich our customers\u2019 experiences, increase shareholder value, and improve people\u2019s lives |\n|                  | \u2022 Reviews the Integrated Sustainability and Financial Report summary as well as any Company initiatives related to sustainability and innovation |\n\nExecutive Management\n\n| Vice President, Chief Sustainability, Environment and Safety Officer |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| \u2022 Primary responsibility for sustainability issues                  |\n| \u2022 Oversees the Sustainability and Vehicle Environmental Matters group, the Environmental Quality Office, the Vehicle Homologation and Compliance group and the Automotive Safety Office |\n| \u2022 Leads a multi-disciplinary executive-level team that oversees actions in response to our sustainability strategies and integration and issues related to our We Are Committed to Human Rights and the Environment Policy |\n| Other executive and group vice presidents across our functional areas also have responsibility for sustainability-related issues.

The Enterprise Risk Management process also engages Business Units and Skill Teams to determine which of the enterprise risks are most relevant to their specific objectives, and identify any additional risks that can be managed at a lower level in the organization. Risks at all levels are shared and aligned for a top-down and bottom-up view and management of risk. The Audit Committee and Board annually review the process to update the list of critical risks and monitor risk movement and emerging trends.\n\nAs noted above, the full Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the oversight of risk management at Ford and oversees operating risk management with reviews at each of its regular Board meetings. The Board of Directors has delegated responsibility for the oversight of specific areas of risk management to certain committees of the Board, with each Board committee reporting to the full Board following each committee meeting. The Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in overseeing compliance and reporting risk. The Sustainability, Innovation and Policy Committee assists the Board of Directors in overseeing environmental and social sustainability risks, while the Compensation, Talent and Culture Committee assists the Board of Directors in overseeing risks related to personnel matters, including those related to sexual harassment and anti-retaliation policies related to whistleblowers. The Board, the Sustainability, Innovation and Policy Committee, the Compensation, Talent and Culture Committee, the Finance Committee, and the Audit Committee all play a role in overseeing operating and strategic risk management.\n\nThe scope and severity of risks presented by cyber threats have increased dramatically, and constant vigilance is required to protect against intrusions. We take cyber threats very seriously and regularly audit our cyber security capabilities. These audits are a useful tool for ensuring that we maintain a robust cyber security program to protect our investors, customers, employees, and intellectual property. The Audit Committee receives updates several times per year from the Chief Information Security Officer regarding technology and cyber security risk and conducts regular reviews of our cyber security practices, with report outs to the Board as appropriate. As part of its risk assessment procedures, the Board reviews relevant cyber security and information technology matters at least twice annually.\n\nWe also maintain an industry-leading cyber security insurance program with many of the world\u2019s largest and most respected insurance companies. Additionally, we are a founding member of the Board of the Automotive Information Sharing and Analysis Center. Our current seat on that board ensures that we preserve relationships that help to protect ourselves against both enterprise and in-vehicle security risks.\n\nRead more about our Board committees in our most recent Proxy Statement\nCharter of the Audit Committee\nCharter of the Compensation, Talent and Culture Committee\nCharter of the Finance Committee\nCharter of the Nominating and Governance Committee\nCharter of the Sustainability, Innovation and Policy Committee\nReporting Scope, Boundaries and Data Assurance\n\nReporting Scope and Boundaries\nConsistent with GRI guidance on boundary setting, the data in this report covers all of Ford Motor Company\u2019s wholly and majority-owned operations globally, unless otherwise noted, and spans 2021 operations and vehicles.
