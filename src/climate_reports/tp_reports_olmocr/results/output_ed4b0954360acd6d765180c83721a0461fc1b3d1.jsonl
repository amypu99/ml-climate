That same mission guides our commitment to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters and will continue to support our company's future.\n\nEvery day, in communities spanning 47 states, we open our doors at more than 19,000 stores with a united sense of purpose: to serve. Since our founding in 1939, Dollar General has pursued opportunities to serve and support our communities, customers, neighbors and each other. From providing convenient access to everyday essentials and offering name brands at great prices, to creating jobs that grow into careers and investing in educational programs that can change lives, we strive every day to positively impact the communities we call home.\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\nThis report provides information about our efforts and initiatives in this space, including select metrics from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards for Consumer Goods\u2014Multiline and Specialty Retailers and identifies where our programs align with and support the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Unless otherwise noted, this document covers the fiscal year ending February 3, 2023.\n\nNOTE ON MATERIALITY\n\nThe issues, statements and data included in this report are being provided because we believe they may be topics of interest for our various stakeholders. Our inclusion of these issues, statements and data is not intended to convey that we believe our efforts in these areas, or the associated metrics, although important to us, meet the definition of materiality used in the context of financial reporting, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or for other regulatory reporting purposes.\nSustainable Development Goals\n\nThe UN\u2019s 17 SDGs set forth a global framework for governments and organizations to build a better world for people and our planet by 2030. Our Serving Others platform supports and aligns most closely with the seven goals listed below. We are continuously exploring further opportunities to align the SDGs with our business strategies.\nA Message from our CEO\n\nAt Dollar General, we are a purpose-driven organization united in our mission of Serving Others.\n\nSince our founding at the end of the Great Depression, the retail landscape and, indeed the world, have changed, but the need and opportunity to serve have remained constant. So, too, has our commitment to Serving Others every day.\n\nFor more than eight decades, the cornerstone of our efforts to serve has been value\u2014both delivering value for our stakeholders and recognizing the value in the world around us. Every day, we strive to be a force for opportunity for our customers, communities, employees, shareholders and planet. To effect that change, it requires a commitment to investing in our diverse teams, reducing our environmental footprint and controlling costs.\n\nWe\u2019ve built our value proposition around the belief that no one should have to go without the essentials in life. Through our stores and distribution network, we are creating employment opportunities and convenient access points to affordable everyday items in communities across the country, including in areas sometimes referred to as food and healthcare deserts.\n\nAdding value is not only fundamental to our operating strategy but also to our philanthropic efforts. We believe that alleviating food insecurity and empowering individuals through literacy and education are foundational to thriving communities. That is why we partner with local nonprofit organizations, schools, libraries and food banks to serve families in need, reduce food waste and create pathways to brighter futures for individuals of all ages through education and literacy.\n\nAt the center of our efforts is the heart of our company, our nearly 172,000 employees.\n\nHaving begun my career at Dollar General as a store manager trainee in 1992, I have experienced firsthand the impact and importance of investing in career pathways, development programs and mentorships. Through our ongoing training and development programs, free college tuition and other educational offerings, we help ensure our employees have the opportunity to pursue their career goals and dreams.\n\nAs we continue to pursue our mission of Serving Others, we know our impact is greater when we work together. Our 2022 Serving Others Report provides more details about how we are living our mission and working to be a force for opportunity. We hope you enjoy learning more about our efforts in the following pages.\n\nJeff Owen\nChief Executive Officer\nCompany Overview\nAbout Us\n\nHeadquartered in Goodlettsville, Tennessee, Dollar General has been delivering value to shoppers for more than 80 years.

Turner and Cal Turner, Sr. open J.L. Turner and Son Wholesale in Scottsville, Kentucky. Each invested $5,000 and became partners in a wholesale, dry-goods business to serve retailers that survived the Great Depression.\n\n1955\nThe first Dollar General retail store opens. Turner\u2019s Department Store in Springfield, Kentucky converted to the first Dollar General store in June 1955. The store\u2019s business model was simple. No item would cost more than $1.

That is why we provide customers with everyday products at great prices in our convenient, easy-to-shop neighborhood general stores.\nServing the Needs of Families\nAt Dollar General, we strive to provide a welcoming, convenient shopping experience.\n\nOur efforts to better meet our customers\u2019 needs are informed by deep consumer insights that help us ensure that we are providing the items they need and want.\n\nWhether customers are looking for a quick in-and-out shop or enjoy browsing the aisles for new products, special gifts or household items, we have carefully curated an assortment of products for every day and every occasion including health and beauty products, home cleaning supplies, housewares, stationery, seasonal items and a wide variety of food options.\n\nAs we work to enhance our customer experience, we are continuously evolving our offerings, ranging from product assortment to digital tools such as our cart calculator, self-checkout and digital coupons that help customers save both time and money.\n\nFood Access\nMore than 13.5 million U.S. households live with food insecurity.\u00b9 By leveraging our expansive store footprint, we have been able to increase access to the components of a nutritious meal, including refrigerated, frozen and shelf-stable pantry items, including staples such as milk and dairy products, bread, eggs, lean proteins, grains and frozen or canned fruits and vegetables.\n\nIn 2022, we also expanded our fresh produce offerings to more than 1,100 stores across the chain. Now over 3,000 Dollar General stores provide communities with convenient access to affordable fresh fruits and vegetables. In 2023, we plan to expand fresh produce offerings to another 2,000 stores\u2014with a goal of offering fresh produce in 10,000 stores over the next few years.\n\nIn addition to our in-store offerings, we also help advance food security in our hometowns through our partnership with Feeding America. In 2022, we donated over $1,000,000 to food security efforts and the equivalent of over 8 million meals to Feeding America affiliates throughout the communities we serve.\n\nFilling in the Gaps\nWhen the closure of a North Little Rock grocery store left surrounding neighborhoods without convenient access to fresh produce, Dollar General took action to help meet our neighbors\u2019 needs by expanding our offerings of fresh fruits and vegetables at 10 stores throughout the affected community.\n\n\u00b9 USDA: Household Food Security in the United States, A report summary from the Economic Research Service September 2022\nDG Wellbeing\n\nIn addition to improving access to nutritious and better-for-you foods, we also seek to bring affordable health and wellness solutions closer to home for our customers. Through our DG Wellbeing healthcare offerings, we provide our customers with an assortment of over-the-counter health and wellness items at lower prices than most drug stores.\n\nOur Dollar General Wellness assortment has been informed by surveying our customers to identify the products they need\u2014among them, over-the-counter medicines, vitamins and supplements, as well as dental care, adult incontinence and feminine hygiene products. In 2022, we expanded our health merchandise assortment with approximately 30% more selling space and more than 300 additional items in 4,000 stores in higher-need communities.\n\nWe have also worked to make the products affordable. Beyond competitive pricing, we launched a partnership with a third-party payment platform to allow customers to use health plan supplemental benefits to purchase various health and wellness-related items in their local Dollar General stores. This program is expected to be available starting in 2023.\n\nIncreasing Access and Opportunity\n\nTo serve the needs of our customers, we bring the everyday products they need and want where they need them most\u2014in an easy-to-shop, close-to-home, neighborhood store. With over 19,000 locations, our stores are within five miles of ~75% of Americans making access to shopping easy. In fiscal year 2022, we opened 1,039 stores, relocated 127 stores, and remodeled 1,795 stores.\n\nWhen we open stores and distribution centers, we bring more than just affordable, quality products to communities. We also create economic growth and opportunities for individuals to grow their careers. In 2022, we created over 10,000 local jobs providing positive economic growth and generating tax revenue for municipalities, all while increasing access to affordable, quality items families use most. As we look at 2023, we look forward to continuing to increase access in new markets across the United States, as well as opening our first store in Mexico.\nDigital Access\n\nWe strive to bring modern technology to our store communities in rural America by working with local carriers to extend Wi-Fi to our customers and enable technology solutions such as self-checkout, cart calculator, digital coupons and more.\n\npopshelf\n\nIn addition to our traditional Dollar General stores, our pOpshelf concept stores that were launched in 2020 continue to provide a fun shopping experience across 14 states. This new concept offers shoppers a treasure hunt experience combining continually refreshed merchandise with seasonal specials and limited-time offers with the majority of items priced at $5 or less. In 2022, we celebrated the opening of our 100th pOpshelf store.\n\nMilitary Support\n\nDollar General proudly supports all those who have served and continue to serve our country.

In 2022, Brand Keys named Dollar General one of America\u2019s most patriotic brands through a survey that identifies brands consumers believe best embody the value of patriotism. Dollar General is also proud to partner with United Through Reading to help ensure children do not have to miss bedtime stories because a parent is away on military service.\n\n- Named one of America\u2019s most patriotic brands by Brand Keys\n- U.S. Veterans Magazine\u2019s Top Veteran-Friendly Companies List for 8th consecutive year.\nProduct & Safety Quality\n\nWe\u2019re committed to providing safe, affordable and quality products to our customers and their families.\n\nTo uphold that commitment, our vendors and manufacturers are expected to ensure their products meet or exceed applicable safety, quality and regulatory standards for product ingredients, components, labeling and packaging. Additionally, we require vendors to adhere to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, meet our workplace conditions and product safety expectations and adhere to global human rights standards. Many of our suppliers have their own sustainability programs, and we seek to understand the components of those programs as we evolve our own programs.\n\nWe are also expanding our sustainable product offerings through the removal of certain chemicals and sustainable sourcing. Examples of such products include:\n\n- Believe Skin care products\n- Dolphin Safe Clover Valley Tuna\n- Vegan, cruelty-free Root to End hair care products\n\nFrom private label to name brands, we provide affordable, quality products for our customers and their families. Below are some highlights from the private label brand recognitions we received in 2022.\n\nPrivate Label Manufacturers Association\n\n2022 Salute to Excellence Awards\n\n- trueliving\u00ae 4x Diamond Dishwashing Liquid\n- Heartland Farms\u2122 Baked Biscuit Dog Treats\n- OhGood!

A product recall may be instituted either as the result of an internal investigation (see below) or based upon direction provided to the company by a government agency or a vendor.\n\nProduct investigations are initiated when the company receives information regarding a potential product safety or quality issue, including through customer complaints. The scope of any such investigation will be determined on a case-by-case basis, taking into account\u2014among other things\u2014the nature of the potential issue and any alleged harm caused by the product. Not every report or investigation of a potential product safety or quality issue will result in a product recall. If it is determined that a product recall is necessary, the Global Compliance team is notified and coordinates the removal of product from inventory.\n\nProduct Testing\n\nAll direct import and certain private label items undergo periodic laboratory testing, the frequency of which depends on\u2014among other things\u2014the risk profile of the product or product category. This testing is performed on randomly selected items by independent, third-party laboratories.\n\nSafety and Regulatory Testing\n\nDollar General partners with global, independent, third-party testing laboratories to conduct various physical, mechanical, electrical and chemical tests, as applicable, on the company\u2019s direct import products, based on Company expectations and all applicable federal, state and local regulatory and safety requirements. Product labels are also evaluated based on applicable regulatory requirements and for appropriate use and safety instructions.\n\nDollar General\u2019s product safety and regulatory compliance program applies to direct imports and certain domestically purchased private label items. We develop product safety and compliance testing protocols in collaboration with some of the largest testing companies in the world, including Intertek, Underwriters Laboratories and Eurofins.\n\nConflict Minerals\n\nWe do not contract to manufacture products covered by the Conflicts Minerals rules set forth in Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act, nor do we import products from the Democratic Republic of the Congo region.\nChemical Policy and Restricted Chemical List\n\nTo further enhance the safety and quality of certain of our private label products, we have implemented a restricted chemical policy and program that go beyond what is required by law.\n\nAs part of this program, we take additional steps to reduce or eliminate from our products a number of intentionally added chemicals, which we refer to as our Restricted Substance List (RSL). We recently updated and expanded our policy to apply not only to all private brand core formulated products in our Home Cleaning, Beauty and Personal Care departments but also to all non-core items and to all private brand formulated cleaning products in our hardware and automotive departments.\n\nWe\u2019ve also expanded our RSL, more than doubling the number of chemicals on the list from eight to 19. By fiscal year end 2023, we plan to remove the following intentionally added chemicals from our formulated private brand items in Home Cleaning, Beauty and Personal Care and from our private brand cleaning products in our Hardware and Automotive departments: 1-Bromopropane, Asbestos, 1,4-dioxane, Cyclic Aliphatic Bromides Cluster of flame retardants (HBCD), Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4), Lead and Lead Compounds, Cadmium and Cadmium Compounds, Bisphenol A (BPA), Diethyl phthalate, Dibutyl phthalate, Tetrachloroethylene (PERC), Formaldehyde, Toluene, Nonylphenol Ethoxylates, Butylparaben, Propylparaben, Trichloroethylene, Triclocarban and Triclosan.\n\nIn 2022, we met our initial goal of eliminating the following intentionally added chemicals from our core formulated private brand Home Cleaning, and Beauty and Personal Care departments: Formaldehyde, Toluene, Nonylphenol Ethoxylates, Butylparaben, Propylparaben, Trichloroethylene, Triclocarban and Triclosan.\n\nIn 2022, we met our goal of removing eight intentionally added chemicals from private brand formulated Home Cleaning and Beauty and Personal Care departments.\n\nIn 2022 we became a signatory to the Chemical Footprint Project.\n\nWe will continue to encourage all suppliers to register product formulations with the UL WERCSmart\u00ae system and to use safer alternatives to the chemicals listed in our RSL. Through this process, we expect to gain additional insight into the chemical composition of these products.\nManaging our Supply Chain\n\nWe believe all individuals should be treated with dignity and respect.\n\nWe expect our vendors to operate in a manner that aligns with this belief and ensure a safe, respectful workplace for all individuals working within our supply chain. During our onboarding process, our sourcing and private brands teams ensure that all direct import and certain private brand vendors are made aware of our requirements. Additionally, these vendors are expected to sign a Master Supplier Agreement, which outlines certain requirements to which they and their factories must adhere. Our Global Compliance team provides oversight of this program.\n\nHuman Rights and Workplace Conditions\n\nWe are committed to advancing global human rights standards through our direct import supply chain. Our human rights and workplace conditions expectations, which are applicable to each direct import vendor and employee and are communicated in a variety of ways, include the following:\n\n- All employees involved in the production of company merchandise must be at least 16 years of age, regardless of applicable law (which may allow younger workers).\n- Suppliers may not use involuntary or forced labor.\n- Wages and benefits must comply with the local and country laws.\n- Suppliers must comply with all applicable legal limits for working hours. Employees may not work more than six consecutive days.\n- Suppliers\u2019 employees must be employed, paid, promoted and terminated based on occupational ability and not based on personal characteristics such as race or sex or beliefs.\n- Suppliers will not tolerate or condone physical, sexual, psychological or verbal harassment or abuse of any supplier employee.\n- Suppliers will demonstrate commitment to the health and safety of employees to prevent accidents and injury occurring in the course of work.\n- If suppliers provide residential housing for employees, they must ensure the housing is healthy and safe.\nHuman Rights and Workplace Conditions\n\nWe have a zero-tolerance policy against child labor, forced or slaved labor and worker discrimination/harassment. We will not conduct business with vendors or facilities that are found to have engaged in these behaviors. Dollar General requires all vendors to have high standards of ethical labor practices which includes work environment expectations. Facilities producing direct import merchandise for Dollar General are audited annually by an independent third-party firm, based upon the International Labor Organization standards. We utilize multiple different third-party audit firms to help ensure consistency and integrity in the process.\n\nEach direct import factory doing business with Dollar General must have a passing assessment score or an approved corrective action plan. Shipping approval will not be issued until this requirement is satisfied. A factory\u2019s failure to cooperate during this evaluation may result in an immediate order cancellation. Factories receiving sufficiently low performance ratings will not be allowed to produce products for Dollar General until corrections have been made and an additional audit is conducted to validate the corrections.\n\nDollar General employees with direct import or relevant supply chain responsibilities are expected to familiarize themselves and comply with the company\u2019s safety and workplace conditions expectations, as well as any risks presented with certain product categories and sourcing countries. Members of Dollar General\u2019s Global Compliance department review vendor and facility performance with Sourcing and Merchandising leadership to ensure understanding of issues that pose unacceptable workplace conditions or potential product regulatory and safety concerns.\n\nVendors are made aware of the company\u2019s expectations in numerous ways, including but not limited to, the vendor onboarding process, the Vendor Guide, the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, supplier and other agreements, and periodic in-person vendor summits and meetings. To view our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and for more information about our Human Rights Risk Assessment practices, please visit the Corporate Governance section of our website.\nOur Employees\n\nSERVING OUR DOLLAR GENERAL FAMILY\n\nOur employees are the heart of our company.

In 2022, we launched additional experience surveys to re-validate the needs of our employees post-pandemic. We use survey feedback to guide efforts to enhance the employee experience and find ways to ensure all employees feel heard, supported and valued.\n\n2022 DG Voice Overall Company Results\n\n| Category                  | Result |\n|---------------------------|--------|\n| Belonging                 | 85%    |\n| Manager Effectiveness     | 84%    |\n| Satisfaction              | 73%    |\n| Recognition               | 73%    |\n| Engagement                | 69%    |\n| Participation             | 67%    |\n\nIn 2022, our teams told us that the top reasons they like working for DG are:\n\n1. Co-workers\n2. Customers\n3. Pay\n4. Leadership\n5. Development Opportunities\nEmployee Health and Safety\n\nDollar General is committed to providing a safe work environment.\n\nOur safety program includes standardized policies and procedures, training, ongoing communication and employee engagement, recognition and accountability combined with monitoring and use of data analytics to drive preventative strategies and help evolve overall safety strategies and initiatives.\n\nSafety Teams\n\nFostering a culture of safety requires the involvement and commitment of every employee. Day-to-day store safety is led by our store managers, and district-wide safety is led by our district managers. Monthly safety meetings, safety information centers and routine visits from field leadership provide avenues both for employees to raise discuss safety concerns and management to recognize employees for their success. Dollar General provides several 24/7, 365-day hotline resources to report work-related safety concerns, hazards, injuries or illnesses.\n\nDistribution Center Safety Teams consist of onsite personnel and safety committees that train new hires and oversee ongoing safety training, near-miss and incident investigations, and safety audits and drive employee engagement through recognition. The distribution teams are also led by a safety steering committee comprised of network-wide representation across the many operations in the supply chain network. The steering committee oversees safety initiatives, network-wide communication, and ongoing monitoring of data analytics and serves as a resource for employees to brainstorm new ideas and processes to minimize risk within facilities.\n\nFleet Safety\n\nFor our Private Fleet teams, ensuring the safety of our drivers, our employees and the communities we serve is of the utmost importance. Our Fleet has local safety supervisors who engage with our drivers, fleet maintenance teams and distribution centers to ensure proper training, safe equipment and safe loads. Our trucks are equipped with safety systems including collision mitigation technology and event-driven cameras. We are constantly evaluating and investing in new technology, improved truck specifications, facilities, training and reporting tools across our Fleet.\nDiversity & Inclusion\n\nOur core values include respecting the dignity and differences of others.\n\nFrom our stores and distribution centers to our transportation teams and corporate offices, we strive to create an environment where every individual feels valued, comfortable bringing their authentic self to work, knows that their difference makes a difference and feels empowered to grow their careers. These cornerstones help build a sense of belonging, which fuels motivation and enables our employees to support our customers and communities.\n\nMy Difference Makes a Difference\n\nOur diversity is a strength we rely on as we serve our customers and communities. We believe in putting people first \u2013 with respect for each person\u2019s dignity and difference front and center. Together, our differences make all the difference in building careers, stores and communities.\n\nIn 2022, we launched an initiative to give our teams the opportunity to share their stories about what makes them unique. Employees courageously shared how their different dimensions of diversity make a difference and how being able to be their authentic selves helped to unlock their potential at work. We will continue to grow this movement in 2023, showcasing more employee stories. You can learn more about how we are celebrating our differences on our landing page at dg.com/mydifference.\n\nHBCU Relationships\n\nTo expand our recruitment efforts and better reflect the communities we serve, we partnered with several historically Black colleges and universities (HBCU) that have disciplines applicable to Dollar General\u2019s business needs. In 2022 we established relationships with the following universities:\n\n- North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University\n- Tennessee State University\n- Florida Agricultural & Mechanical University\n- Alabama State University\n- Gramblin University\n- Alabama Agricultural & Mechanical University\n- Texas Southern University\n- Prairie View A&M University\n- Mississippi Valley State University\nInclusive Learning and Development\n\nWe believe diversity and inclusion starts at the highest level, and we have focused on equipping leaders to lead cultural transformation and model inclusivity at every level. This journey began with our executive team and Board of Directors and has since been rolled out to employees across the organization. In 2022, we focused on building inclusive team environments and self-awareness through content delivered in-person, hybrid and virtually.\n\nPositioning others for success is a fundamental part of our leadership philosophy. To better enable our retail team to serve our customers, we launched an eLearning module in 2022 focusing on inclusive behaviors. We plan to launch a module for our distribution population in early 2023 along with multiple planned workshops featuring leaders and executives in human resources, store operations and supply chain.\n\nWe also created programs that provide formalized avenues for developing underrepresented talent within Dollar General: the Women\u2019s Executive Development Cohort, Bridge 2 Leadership and Develop 2 LEAD. These programs provide opportunities for personal development while participants simultaneously learn more about the company\u2019s strategy, gain exposure to different parts of the business and build cross-functional relationships.\n\nIn 2022, we spent more than 18,000 hours in inclusive leader training.\nEmployee Resource Groups\n\nDollar General\u2019s Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) are employee-led groups designed to foster inclusion and unite individuals across our organization that have shared interests and backgrounds. Each group has two executive sponsors that support and champion the group\u2019s efforts.\n\nIn 2022, Dollar General expanded ERG membership and representation to include distribution center, fleet, field and retail employees resulting in representation and engagement from across our entire enterprise.\n\n**Employee Resource Groups**\n\n- **AAERG**\n  - Mission: Impact and enhance the diversity of Dollar General\u2019s culture through recruiting, retention, development, awareness, networking and community outreach.\n\n- **DGYP**\n  - Mission: Connect young professionals to opportunity through professional development, community and an expanded network.\n\n- **EQUAL**\n  - Mission: Support Dollar General\u2019s mission of Serving Others by providing a forum for LGBTQIA+ employees and their allies, promoting inclusion and tolerance.\n\n- **SERVE**\n  - Mission: Celebrate and support our active-duty military, National Guard & Reserves, veterans and their families through networking, education and community outreach.\n\n- **WPN**\n  - Mission: Cultivate and further an inspirational, inclusive and empowering women\u2019s network at Dollar General to foster and advance members\u2019 personal and professional lives through diversified connections, leadership opportunities and educational experiences.\n\n**Professional Women\u2019s Magazine Best of the Best LGBTQ+ Friendly Companies**\n\n**Recognized by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation\u2019s 2022 Corporate Equality Index for LGBTQI+ workplace inclusion efforts**\nSupplier Diversity\n\nWe strive to remove or mitigate unintended barriers for businesses certified as minority, women, LGBTQ+, veteran, or disability owned, helping to increase the representation of these groups in the communities we serve.\n\nTo further this commitment, in 2022 Dollar General added three new director-level positions to the Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) Center of Excellence. Two of these leaders are focused on developing and executing D&I strategies for our retail and supply chain partners. The third leader is responsible for developing and implementing a strategic supplier D&I program aimed at building and establishing robust diverse supplier networks.\n\nOur Supplier Diversity business initiative is grounded in inclusivity and centers on three key pillars:\n\n- Inclusive Sourcing\n- Inclusive Processes\n- Inclusive Capacity Building\n\nWe categorize a supplier as diverse if they meet the following qualifications:\n\n**51% owned/operated by U.S. citizen who qualifies as:**\n- Minority\n- Woman\n- LGBTQ+\n- Veteran (including disabled veteran)\n- Disability\n\n**A third-party certification:**\n- National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC)\n- Certified Women\u2019s Business Enterprise (WBENC)\n- National LGBT Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC)\n- National Veteran-Owned Business Association (NaVOBA)\n- Disability:IN\nWorkforce Composition\n\nOur workforce data represents approximately 172,000 employees and is based on employee self-identification. Additionally, our EEO-1 consolidated report data can be located on our website.\n\nOFFICER GROUP\nThe following data includes all employees at the Vice President level and above.\n\n- 30% Female\n- 33.3% Racially or Ethnically Diverse\n\nMANAGEMENT\nThe following data includes all employees at the manager level and above, with the exception of Dollar General\u2019s Officer Group and employees based outside of the United States.\n\n- 74.56% Female\n- 25.92% Racially or Ethnically Diverse\n\nNON-MANAGEMENT\nThe following data includes all full-time and part-time non-management employees based in the United States.\n\n- 64.66% Female\n- 38.06% Racially or Ethnically Diverse\n\nTOTAL WORKFORCE:\n\n- 65.96% Female\n- 36.46% Racially or Ethnically Diverse\nOur Communities\n\nSince our founding over 80 years ago, our company has remained committed to creating a positive impact in the communities we call home. This commitment is reflected in our philanthropic investments and community outreach efforts. During fiscal year 2022, Dollar General and its Foundations donated $23.7 million to meet the needs of our neighbors and communities through charitable programs that focus on nourishing the mind, body and planet.\nServing the Needs of our Neighbors\n\nAt the heart of Dollar General\u2019s philanthropic efforts is a desire to leave our communities better than we found them, address community needs and the interconnectedness we share as community members. As we look to create sustainable change and help our neighbors thrive, we focus our giving on uplifting individuals and communities through support of literacy and education initiatives, advancing food security and environmental conservation \u2013 nourishing the mind, body and planet.\n\nMIND\nCreating pathways to opportunity through:\n\u2022 Literacy and Education\n\nBODY\nIncreasing access to critical resources:\n\u2022 Hunger Relief\n\u2022 St. Jude\n\nPLANET\nEngaging in activities that protect the planet:\n\u2022 Sustainability Efforts\n\u2022 Reforestation\n\u2022 Disaster Relief\nNourishing Minds: Literacy and Education\n\nWe believe literacy and learning play a vital role in advancing social mobility, civic engagement and economic empowerment.\n\nThe ability to seek and understand information empowers individuals to advocate for themselves, make informed choices, learn new things about the world around them and build confidence. That\u2019s why we proudly support programs that strengthen literacy within our communities and extend hope for a brighter future.\n\nDollar General Literacy Foundation\n\nWhen Dollar General\u2019s co-founder, J.L. Turner, had to take over his family\u2019s farm at age 11, he left school with only a third-grade education and without the ability to read and write. And yet, from those humble beginnings, J.L. worked hard to learn and achieve. In honor of their father and grandfather, Cal Turner and Cal Turner, Jr. established the Dollar General Literacy Foundation in 1993 to advance literacy and education initiatives that help individuals of all ages pursue their educational goals and achieve their dreams.\n\nIn fiscal year 2022, the Foundation awarded more than $16.6M to nonprofit organizations, schools and libraries serving more than 1.3 million learners.\n\nThe Foundation collaborates with national, regional and grassroots organizations. Our efforts include investing in programs that increase access to quality instruction, remediation and intervention services, teacher professional development, classroom resources and innovation. Funding is available in five programmatic areas: adult, family and youth literacy programs, summer reading initiatives and school library disaster relief.\n\nTech with Purpose\n\nIn 2022, Stephen C, a member of Dollar General\u2019s technology team, helped refurbish and donate over 1,100 computers to public schools for use in classrooms and National Urban League after-school programs across Tennessee and Arkansas.\nUnlocking Potential in Our Communities\n\nServing Others through support for literacy and education programs in our communities has been a priority for Dollar General for nearly 30 years. We remain committed to investing in and collaborating with local literacy providers and national partners to advance teacher and student success.\n\nAs part of our commitment, we commissioned research to gain a deeper understanding of today\u2019s literacy landscape. We spoke to those most affected\u2014students, parents, teachers and adult learners\u2014as well as experts who are working to solve our country\u2019s literacy challenges. Insights gained helped us develop funding opportunities designed to narrow the gap between learners\u2019 needs and the resources that are currently available.\n\nWhen we commissioned this research, we sought to identify the best path (or paths) forward to improve literacy rates in the U.S. We listened to K\u201312 teachers and adult literacy instructors as they shared that their greatest challenge was simply not having enough hours in the day. While we cannot create time, we can help address some of the issues teachers shared including providing critical support so teachers can be equipped and informed in ways that help them continue their efforts to strengthen the quality of educational instruction and aid in student success, specifically focusing on literacy instructional methods, remediation, intervention and blended learning models.\n\nBased on our research findings we identified the following four impact areas:\n\n- Provide increased professional development for K-12 and adult literacy teachers and instructors\n- Meet adult learners where they are by providing flexible programs that offer a variety of instructional delivery models\n- Leverage advancements in remote learning to super-charge investments in technology solutions and training that help adult teachers and learners\n- Engage volunteers in tutoring efforts at schools and nonprofits to help drive change\n\nThese impact areas are not exhaustive of all the work that needs to be done to address low literacy in the U.S., but they inform our strategic investments in student and teacher success within the Foundation\u2019s five programmatic areas of support.\nNourishing Bodies: Addressing Hunger and Children\u2019s Health\n\nOur philanthropic efforts focus on helping individuals and families meet their basic needs, from ensuring our neighbors have access to nutritious foods to helping children with challenging diseases secure access to high-quality healthcare.\n\nSupporting Neighbors through Nutrition\n\nIn fiscal year 2022 we donated over $1 million to Feeding America and its affiliates to help advance food security efforts nationwide and expand program capacity in high-need markets and rural communities. Our partnership with Feeding America also supported food banks in nearly 2,500 markets through food recovery efforts in our local stores and distribution centers during calendar year 2022. More information regarding our circular economy and food waste reduction efforts are detailed in the Environment section of this report.\n\nSupporting Kids though Healthcare\n\nAs part of our nourishing bodies efforts, we are celebrating 17 years of partnership with St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital. Through our annual in-store Thanks and Giving campaign and corporate donations, we have raised more than $32.8 million to support the hospital\u2019s life-saving work.\nNourishing the Planet: Reforestation and Disaster Relief\n\nDollar General strives to be a good neighbor by nurturing the world around us.\n\nThis is embedded in our operational strategy and in our philanthropic efforts. As we look to create a vibrant planet, we understand the important role that trees and plants play in creating clean air, protecting the soil, providing natural habitats and generating shade for people, pets and wildlife.\n\nSupporting Reforestation\n\nThe same natural disasters that destroy the homes of individuals also destroy the habitats of wildlife. When a community\u2019s trees are lost, for example, it loses songbird populations, natural air filtration and cooling shade. That\u2019s why we partner with the Arbor Day Foundation to advance reforestation efforts and create green spaces. In 2022, we planted more than 75,000 trees and distributed free trees in a tornado impact area.\n\nSupporting Disaster Relief\n\nThe historic longleaf pine ecosystem once extended from southeastern Virginia to Florida, west through Louisiana to east Texas. Today, only small patches of these trees remain. As longleaf pine numbers decline, so does the incredible diversity of plant and animal species supported by this ecosystem, including many endemics only to this habitat. In partnership with the Arbor Day Foundation, Dollar General has supported longleaf pine replanting efforts in Alabama, North Carolina and Florida, helping preserve critical habitat for gopher tortoise, red-cockaded woodpecker, and other rare species.\n\nSupporting Critical Habitats\n\nDuring times of natural disaster, we offer support through, among other things, our partnership with the American Red Cross. In 2022, we provided in-kind and monetary donations totaling over $500,000 to help the Red Cross provide essential aid to people in need across the country. Dollar General\u2019s pre-positioned support and giving empowered the Red Cross to rapidly mobilize personnel and supplies to disaster impacted areas like the communities impacted by flooding in Kentucky and Hurricane Ian in Florida.\n\nSupporting Pets and Their People\n\nWhen record-flooding devastated eastern Kentucky in July 2022, thousands of families were displaced by storm damage. Hundreds more experienced homelessness. Cindy and her dog, Brownie, were among them. Finding emergency housing that would allow pets was crucial. \u201cHe\u2019s the only family I\u2019ve got,\u201d Cindy said. \u201cI just wasn\u2019t going to leave him behind.\u201d Our support for the Red Cross helped provide care to Cindy, Brownie and others impacted by the flood. Ultimately, the pair found refuge together at an American Red Cross emergency shelter with a pet-friendly policy.\nNourishing the Mind, Body & Planet\n\nSupporting with Kindness\n\nAt Dollar General, our mission is brought to life every day through our employees\u2019 acts of kindness and compassion. To celebrate these moments of kindness, Dollar General launched the DG Kindness campaign in 2020. This campaign enables us to celebrate employees\u2019 stories by providing a $1,000 donation to a charity in their hometown to amplify their acts of kindness.\n\nIn 2022, we launched DG Kindness Weeks to create opportunities for our field leadership and distribution center teams to bring our mission of Serving Others to life through coordinated volunteer efforts in their local communities. Since the launch, Dollar General employees have volunteered more than 2,000 hours to hometown charities.\n\nDG Kindness\n\nThe 2022 flooding of Central Appalachia damaged hundreds of homes, buildings and schools, leaving a significant impact on families and communities. \u201cWhen I saw the news and the devastation so close to my home in Middle Tennessee, I knew I needed to help,\u201d shared Mike W., a 22-year veteran of DG. Mike volunteered with a mission team headed to Kentucky where they worked tirelessly shoveling mud, gutting houses, removing fallen trees, hauling away debris, hanging drywall, building decks and addressing overall maintenance needs for families\u2019 homes impacted by the flood waters.\n\n\u201cI couldn't think of a better way to spend time away from work. Helping others brings joy to my heart,\u201d shared Mike.\nOur Environment\n\nSERVING AS GOOD STEWARDS\n\nA healthy planet is essential for thriving communities. As we advance our operating strategies, we are committed to exploring ways to advance sustainable and business-friendly practices that reduce our environmental footprint and ensure the communities we serve remain vibrant for future generations.\nServing as Good Stewards\n\nAs a purpose-driven company, we are committed to exploring ways to limit our impact on the communities where we live and work and to being good stewards of our natural resources.\n\nThis includes consideration regarding store and distribution center locations and how we move goods between them. Through the strategic placement of Dollar General distribution centers and stores, we\u2019re able to facilitate shorter drives and more efficient hauls, changes that help us conserve fuel, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and improve operational efficiency. We leverage these same placement strategies to simultaneously create economic empowerment for local workforces, support recycling programs in communities and build food waste reduction partnerships with area food banks.\n\nDollar General has made reducing emissions and energy use a cornerstone of our plan to reduce our environmental footprint. In 2021, we set a short-term GHG emissions reduction target of 15% per square foot by 2026 and a longer-term target of 30% per square foot by 2031, each versus a baseline year of 2020. In 2022, Dollar General pursued and engaged in a range of opportunities to support energy and emissions improvements across our portfolio. While we experienced success in some areas, our overall progress was impacted by the unusually warm weather in the summer and significant winter storms, which resulted in increased energy needs and consumption across our portfolio.\n\n| Carbon Footprint\u00b9 | 2020       | 2021       | 2022       |\n|-------------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Enterprise Square Footage | 146,256,000 | 154,666,867 | 163,562,147 |\n| GHG Emissions Scope 1 (MT CO\u2082e) | 565,598 | 625,813 | 658,617 |\n| GHG Emissions Scope 2 (MT CO\u2082e)(Market Based) | 1,052,622 | 1,175,716 | 1,286,468 |\n| GHG Emissions Scope 1 and 2 Total (MTCO\u2082e)(Market-Based) | 1,618,220 | 1,801,529 | 1,916,849 |\n| Carbon Intensity (MT CO\u2082e /1000 SQ FT) | 11.1 | 11.6 | 11.7 |\n| Energy Consumed Purchased Electricity (kWh) | 2,582,574,879 | 2,788,883,930 | 3,062,439,074 |\n\n\u00b9 All metrics are based on calendar year-end\nEnergy Conservation\n\nTo aid our energy conservation efforts, in 2016 we began transitioning to LED bulbs in our stores which use 70% less energy than their fluorescent counterparts. In addition to their energy efficiency, LED bulbs also last longer which helps reduce landfill waste and maintenance. As of fiscal year-end, we had converted over 99% of our interior store lighting, 79% of all exterior store lighting and 74% of all exterior store signage to LED. These installation efforts netted a 12.7% energy reduction compared to fluorescent lighting.\n\nTo further reduce energy consumption, we have implemented energy management systems in nearly all Dollar General stores, certified to meet ISO 5001 standards. Additionally, all new and replacement HVAC systems include variable frequency drives (VFD), resulting in approximately 7% energy use reduction in stores where they are installed, which at fiscal year-end represented 32% of our chain. In 2022, we added VFDs in more than 1,200 additional stores.\n\nAs we work to improve our energy efficiency and reduce our environmental impact at our distribution centers, the following are some of the building efficiencies we have implemented.\n\n- LED lighting with occupancy sensors\n- Electric-powered material handling machines (e.g., forklifts)\n- Controllable light levels\n- White TPO roof membranes, designed to reflect sunlight to reduce interior temperatures and cooling costs\n- Advanced warehouse cooling systems\n- Energy-efficient dock doors, seals and windows\n- Variable frequency drives (VFD) for climate control equipment and conveyors\n\nAdditionally, we use adiabatic condensers in over 41% of our distribution centers. These condensers offer energy-efficient solutions by using water only as needed based on ambient temperatures and system demand and do not require chemicals to treat the water.\n\nRenewable Energy\n\nTo advance our emission reduction efforts, we increased the number of stores with on-site solar, expanded community solar agreements and entered into a wind energy supply agreement in Texas that powers 982 stores. Additionally, we engaged a third-party consultant to help us build an energy roadmap and strategy designed to meet or exceed our energy reduction goals. The initial analysis started in late 2022 and the formal plan and implementation will start in 2023.\n\nDID YOU KNOW\n\nIn 2022, wind energy powered 982 of our stores in Texas.\nRefrigeration Improvements\n\nAs we expand our food refrigeration, we are continually exploring opportunities to transition to more efficient and environmentally friendly methods. As part of our cooler door expansion, we are actively replacing inefficient and aged coolers and freezers with ENERGY STAR\u00ae rated units for an average 20% increase in energy efficiency.\n\nAdditionally, in 2022, we collaborated with a manufacturer on the design of a refrigerated merchandiser that uses a natural refrigerant and meets our large capacity requirements. We piloted the new design in select stores in 2022 and will be expanding this pilot into more stores in 2023. As we continue to grow our store count, we believe this new design will help reduce the impact of our refrigeration on the environment.\n\nAs we decommission coolers and freezers, we partner with a third-party vendor to ensure the coolers and their components are recycled, reused or repurposed. Additional details regarding these efforts are available in the circular economy section of this report.\n\nAdditionally, Dollar General has partnered with the North American Sustainable Refrigeration Council to explore ways to improve our refrigeration practices.\n\nFuel Efficiency\n\nOur global supply chain uses a variety of transportation systems to deliver goods throughout the Dollar General network. Whether our merchandise moves by land, rail or sea, it follows a strategically mapped routing system, designed to maximize efficiency and thus limit the environmental impact of its journey.\n\nBy sea, our goods move aboard ocean freight carriers, powered by low-sulfur fuel oil (LSFO) in compliance with International Maritime Organization IMO 2020 mandates to reduce air pollution from ships.\n\nBy land, we move our goods between our distribution centers and stores through traditional freight truckloads, their routes optimized for fuel efficiency and to minimize road mileage.\n\nOur fleet fuel efficiency strategy follows guidance from the U.S. EPA\u2019s SmartWay\u00ae program, designed to help companies advance supply chain sustainability by measuring, benchmarking and improving freight transportation efficiency. In 2022, 100% of our outbound fleet carriers and 92% of our inbound fleet carriers earned SmartWay certification. Our entire private fleet, comprising approximately 45% of the total drivers that transport our goods, has met SmartWay specifications, as well.\nWaste and Recycling\n\nWe are always looking for new ways to create efficiencies and reduce waste across our supply chain.\n\nAt the Store Support Center in Tennessee, ongoing recycling efforts facilitate convenient recycling of consumer cardboard, loose paper, plastic bottles, aluminum cans, shrink wrap, light bulbs, batteries, cooking oil, toner cartridges, scrap metal, obsolete fixtures, broken furniture and motors. We also work to recycle and e-cycle outdated computers and network equipment, all according to EPA guidelines.\n\nWe are also able to take consumer recycling into our communities by offering rechargeable battery recycling, bottle and aluminum can takebacks and single-stream recycling in more than 2,700 of our stores across the country. The program captured 10.79 tons of recyclables in calendar year 2022, diverting them from landfills. Our recycling and food waste management efforts have led to 1,052,429 metric tons of GHG emissions avoided, which is the equivalent to 2.4 million barrels of oil saved or enough electricity usage to power 204,776 homes for one year.\n\n**FUN FACT**\n\nOur 2022 cumulative recycling efforts was equal to 1.2 million acres of U.S. Forestland maintained for 1 year according to the EPA\u2019s Waste Reduction Model.\n\n| Recycling (during calendar year 2022) |\n|--------------------------------------|\n| 265,000 tons of cardboard             |\n| 1,305 tons of paper                  |\n| 2,223 tons of plastic                |\n| 4.2 million pallets                  |\n| 1.8 billion gallons of water saved   |\n| 2.17 billion kWh of energy saved     |\n| 2.4 million barrels of oil saved     |\nCardboard Backhauling\n\nDue to the strategic placement of our stores and distribution centers, we are able to create a consolidated, efficient process for recycling one of our most prevalent byproducts - cardboard. The concept is simple: for those goods that arrive at our stores in cardboard boxes, our store associates break down the boxes, then load them onto a truck that is returning to one of our distribution centers. This allows us to eliminate the need for in-store baling machines and additional trucks dedicated to picking up baled cardboard at over 19,000 locations. Once the cardboard has been returned to the nearest distribution center, it is baled for recycling and sold directly to paper mills. This process allows us to have dedicated resources checked for potential contaminants and remove any unrecyclable material which helps us produce cleaner bales. Since we launched the program in 2008, we have recycled more than 2.8 million tons of cardboard\u2014the paper equivalent of more than 48.8 million trees saved from cardboard recycling alone. The GHG savings from this process alone is more than 9 million metric tons of CO\u2082 avoided.\n\nMixed Paper Recycling\n\nUnsold or outdated magazines, newspapers, greeting cards and store paperwork (to the extent that it does not contain personal information) are returned to our distribution centers to be recycled. Since 2010, we have recycled over 35,000 tons of mixed paper.\n\nPlastics\n\nIn partnership with Beyond the Bag, a consortium of retailers, we are exploring ways to reduce single-use plastic bags. Working together, we aim to find the best ways to promote reusable bag use, reduce overall bag use and/or identify alternative cost-effective, scalable alternatives to plastic.\n\nIn addition to the consortium\u2019s efforts, we have ongoing efforts to bale and recycle the plastic wrap used in our distribution centers and stores to wrap and protect goods. Through the end of 2022, plastic film recycling totals reached over 21,211 tons since the program\u2019s inception in 2012.\n\nPallets and Tertiary Packaging\n\nOur distribution centers work to minimize the environmental impact of our pallet program. The pallet pool is a mix of both leased, vendor-owned pallets and our own whitewood pallets. After use, leased pallets return to the appropriate vendor and whitewood pallets remain in our distribution centers for reuse. When whitewood pallets become damaged or otherwise unusable, we recycle them for other end goods.\n\nAn effective strategy to help prevent wasting resources through excessive packaging is to forego the packaging in the first place. That\u2019s our approach to the reduction of tertiary packaging; that is, packaging used for shipping large quantities of goods. By conducting an economic order quantity analysis, we\u2019ve reduced the volume of incoming partial pallets associated with tertiary packaging. This reduction in partial pallet volume means fewer employee touches and enhanced overall efficiency in our distribution centers.\nReducing Food Waste\n\nAs we work to advance a circular economy, we have developed partnerships in several of our store and distribution center communities to reduce food waste and support local food distribution efforts in collaboration with Feeding America affiliates. During 2022, we donated more than 12.3 million pounds of product to local food banks which is equivalent to over 8 million meals.\n\nCIRCULARITY SPOTLIGHT\n\nUnused Dairy\n\nIn 2022, Dollar General diverted more than 17,000 tons of expired dairy waste from landfills. Of this total, more than 14,000 tons were sent to regional producers of animal feed, where they were used as high-quality additives to feed farm animals.\n\nIn addition to the animal feed program, more than 2,600 tons of expired dairy waste was sent to a farm to process through an anaerobic digester. Through this specialized process, a Pennsylvania farm close to our Pottsville, Pennsylvania Distribution Center turns the milk into natural gas, which is then used to generate electricity. The electricity created from the milk donated by our distribution center is not only able to power the approximately 1,200-acre farm, but superfluous power is sold to the local electric company.\n\nContributing to the Circular Economy\n\nFinding beneficial reuse options often makes good business sense as well. In 2022, Dollar General partnered with a third-party asset recovery vendor to resell & repurpose 3,800 tons of used refrigeration equipment at remodeled or relocated facilities. Through this partnership, we refurbish non-working units to bring them to like new condition, then resell all working units. Any units that are not able to be brought back to a working standard are used for parts to maximize the use of the materials and minimize waste.\n\nIn addition to our repurposed refrigeration equipment, we also have a centralized disposal process and protocol for all IT assets which is coordinated by Dollar General\u2019s Device Services team. Once technology assets such as desktops, printers, CPUs, scanners and pin pads, among other devices, are slated for disposal, we take the appropriate steps to decommission the items and find alternatives to disposal. These alternatives include redeployment into our business, reselling to certified contractors, donations to schools or non-profits or recycling by a certified contractor.\n\nORGANIC WASTE PROGRAMS\n\nDollar General has organic waste programs in Vermont, California and Austin, Texas. Food from stores in these markets that cannot be sold or donated is placed into specialized bins and taken to composting facilities. We have managed over 240 tons of organic waste through these efforts which helps reduce methane gas at landfills and sequester carbon in the soil. In 2022 this program helped Dollar General offset the carbon emissions it would take to charge over 18 million smartphones.\u00b2\nNew Store Growth and Store Remodels\n\nPartnering with its developers, Dollar General has implemented a virtually zero-waste construction program, which minimizes the amount of construction scraps and wasted materials that remain after a store is built.\n\nAs we remodel and optimize store formats to better serve our customers, we have conducted design studies of our buildings\u2019 footprints to enable the use of pre-engineered materials and reduce on-site construction modifications. As part of these efforts, we have created a near zero-waste design for our pre-engineered steel buildings where the shell and structure of the buildings are pre-manufactured to exactly fit the building. Any scrap that is generated within this manufacturing process is recycled into raw material. This construction process applies to 78% of our new stores, while 18% are reused conventional lease space, and 4% are low-waste designs for our wood prototype buildings. Through these practices, we have reduced the impact of construction waste on landfills in our communities.\n\nWaste Diversion\n\nWaste reduction and finding beneficial reuses for material is an important part of our business at Dollar General. In 2022, our recycling and reuse programs helped us achieve a landfill diversion rate of almost 62%. We are proud of the work we have done so far to limit our contributions to landfills, and we look forward to reducing our landfill impact even more in the future.\n\n62% landfill diversion rate in 2022\n\nWater\n\nDollar General understands that water is a vital natural resource, and we are committed to improving our water conservation efforts.\n\nListed are our enterprise-wide water consumption rates. As we look to the future, we will continue to explore ways to improve our efficiency and reduce our water usage intensity.\n\n| Year | Water Usage* (gal) |\n|------|--------------------|\n| 2018 | 1,305,165,793      |\n| 2019 | 1,430,860,613      |\n| 2020 | 1,528,991,908      |\n| 2021 | 1,580,470,057      |\n| 2022 | 1,696,360,276      |\n\n* Metrics based on calendar year end\nOur Governance\n\nSERVE WITH INTEGRITY\n\nOur leadership calibrates its decisions through the lens of Serving Others, embedding our purpose into the values and guardrails that govern our practices every day. This purpose-driven leadership sets the tone from the top down and provides the foundation for Dollar General\u2019s continuing work toward a more sustainable business, enhanced long-term shareholder value and a greater positive impact in the communities we serve.\nBoard Leadership\n\nOur Board of Directors represents a diversity of experience, backgrounds, viewpoints, tenure, age, gender and race and is chaired by an independent director.\n\nDirectors are elected annually via majority voting and, other than our current and former CEOs, satisfy our independence criteria and those of the New York Stock Exchange. Fifty percent of our independent directors have joined the Board within the last five years.\n\nThe Board has established three standing committees comprised solely of independent directors: Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility, Audit and Compensation. Our Board and its committees have an important role in our risk oversight process. The entire Board is regularly informed about risks through the committee reporting process, as well as through special reports and updates from management and advisors. This enables the Board and its committees to coordinate the risk oversight role, particularly with respect to risk interrelationships. The Board believes this division of risk management responsibilities effectively addresses the material risks facing Dollar General. Additional information regarding the functions of the committees is provided within applicable Board-adopted written charters available on the \u201cCorporate Governance\u201d section of our website, located at https://investor.dollargeneral.com.\n\nThe Board, each standing committee and each individual non-employee director are evaluated annually using written questionnaires and a process approved by the Nominating, Governance & Corporate Responsibility Committee (NGCR). The Chairman of the Board and the NGCR Committee discuss the results of the individual evaluations, as well as succession considerations with each director. The Board and each committee review and discuss the results of the Board and applicable committee evaluations, all with the goal of enhancing effective Board leadership, effectiveness and oversight. These evaluations and discussions also help inform director re-nomination decisions and succession planning.\n\nSeparate executive sessions of non-management directors and independent directors are available at each quarterly Board meeting, providing an additional mechanism for Board independence and oversight. The Chairman presides over all executive sessions of the non-management and independent directors.\n## Board Composition\n\n| Name                        | Tenure  | Age | Gender |\n|-----------------------------|---------|-----|--------|\n| Warren Bryant               | 13 Years| 77  | M      |\n| Michael Calbert             | 15 Years| 60  | M      |\n| Ana Chadwick                | 7 Months| 51  | F      |\n| Patricia Fili-Krushel        | 10 Years| 69  | F      |\n| Timothy McGuire             | 4 Years | 62  | M      |\n| Jeff Owen                   | 3 Months| 53  | M      |\n| William Rhodes              | 13 Years| 57  | M      |\n| Debra Sandler               | 2 Years | 62  | F      |\n| Ralph Santana               | 4 Years | 55  | M      |\n| Todd Vasos                  | 7 Years | 61  | M      |\n\n### BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\n**As of fiscal year-end**\n\n| Tenure | Gender | Race | Blended Race + Gender | Blended Race + Gender + Country of Origin |\n|--------|--------|------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| 5      | 30%    | 30%  | 40%                    | 50%                                      |\n| 0-5 years |        |      |                        |                                          |\n| 2      |        |      |                        |                                          |\n| 6-10 years |      |      |                        |                                          |\n| 3      |        |      |                        |                                          |\n| 11+ years |      |      |                        |                                          |\n\n**Director Average Age**: 60.8\nESG Oversight\n\nThe Board provides oversight of management\u2019s ESG efforts through three committees, each with its own designated responsibilities.\n\nThe Nominating, Governance & Corporate Responsibility Committee has primary responsibility for oversight of the majority of ESG-related topics. The Compensation Committee provides oversight of human capital management. The Audit Committee oversees enterprise risk management, cybersecurity and data privacy. The annual budget\u2014which includes costs related to our enterprise-wide ESG efforts\u2014undergoes full Board review and approval.\n\nExecutive-level oversight is conducted by the company\u2019s Sustainability Committee, comprised of members of the executive leadership team and the Vice President of Corporate Social Responsibility and Philanthropy. The Committee meets regularly to set strategic direction and ensure programs are aligned with corporate objectives. The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Philanthropy teams lead ESG program management. Reporting to the company\u2019s Executive Vice President and General Counsel, the CSR team helps coordinate and deliver enterprise-wide initiatives, supports the planning and execution of functional workstreams and provides visibility and communications on progress to the executive leadership team. The enterprise working teams lead functional planning and execution and report progress to the CSR team.\n\nGovernance, Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability Risk Oversight\n\nThe Nominating, Governance & Corporate Responsibility Committee has Board-delegated oversight of corporate governance issues, including management\u2019s significant corporate social responsibility and sustainability efforts (to the extent the matter is not overseen by the full Board or other committees). Such matters may include significant issues relating to the environment, human rights, labor, health and safety, supply chain, community and governmental relations, charitable contributions, political contributions (if any) and similar matters. As part of this oversight, the NGCR reviews our sustainability disclosures and practices, including climate-related disclosures, practices, strategy, goals and targets; oversees our ESG-related shareholder outreach program and shareholder proposals; receives regular reports on ESG engagements with and viewpoints provided by shareholders; and reviews detailed information regarding corporate governance trends and practices\u2014all of which informs recommendations to the Board.\n\nHuman Capital Management/Diversity and Inclusion Oversight\n\nThe Compensation Committee has Board-delegated oversight of significant matters pertaining to our human capital management strategy, including diversity and inclusion; recruitment, retention and engagement of employees; our executive compensation program; and the overall compensation philosophy and principles for the general employee population. As part of this oversight, each quarter the Compensation Committee reviews metrics pertaining to recruitment, retention, engagement and diversity and inclusion efforts and results with the Chief People Officer. However, our Board retains direct oversight of certain human capital management areas, including annual discussions of management succession planning with the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief People Officer, review of significant employee-related litigation and legal matters at least quarterly with our General Counsel and discussions of our various human capital matters with the Chief Executive Officer.\nEnterprise Risk Oversight\n\nWe identify and manage our key risks using our enterprise risk management program. This framework evaluates significant internal and external business, financial, legal, reputational, ESG and other risks, identifies mitigation strategies and assesses any residual risk. The program employs interviews with our Board and various levels of management and reviews strategic initiatives, recent or potential legislative or regulatory changes, certain internal metrics and other information. The Audit Committee oversees our enterprise risk management program, discussing with management the process by which risk assessment and risk management is undertaken and our major financial and other risk exposures, including without limitation those relating to information systems, information security, data privacy and business continuity and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. The Audit Committee reviews enterprise risk evaluation results at least annually and high residual risk categories, along with their mitigation strategies, quarterly. Our Board also reviews related material risks as part of its regular review of progress versus the strategic plan. Our General Counsel also periodically provides information to the Board regarding our insurance coverage and programs as well as litigation and other legal risks.\n\nStrategic Planning Risk Oversight\n\nOur company\u2019s strategy is firmly rooted in our long-standing mission of Serving Others, as we consistently strive to improve our performance while retaining our customer-centric focus. The Board actively oversees our corporate strategy and related risks through annual strategic planning meetings and discussions and reports on the status of any risks to our strategic initiatives at quarterly meetings.\nCorporate Governance Practices\n\nSuccession Planning\n\nOur Board of Directors ensures that a formalized process governs long-term management development and succession. Our comprehensive program encompasses not only our CEO and other executive officers but all employees through the front-line supervisory level. The program focuses on key succession elements, including identification of potential successors for positions where internal succession is appropriate, assessment of each potential successor\u2019s level of readiness, diversity considerations and preparation of individual growth and development plans. Our long-term business strategy is also considered with respect to CEO succession planning. Our Board formally reviews our succession plan for officers, as well as other notable talent, at least annually. In addition, we maintain and review with the Board periodically a confidential procedure for the timely and efficient transfer of the CEO\u2019s responsibilities in the event of an emergency or his sudden incapacitation or departure.\n\nStock Ownership Guidelines and Holding Requirements\n\nOur Board of Directors has put in place significant stock ownership guidelines for senior officers and directors that are tied to a multiple of base salary or director fees, as applicable, as well as holding requirements.\n\nHedging and Pledging Prohibitions\n\nWe prohibit executive officers, directors and their controlled persons from: (1) hedging against any decrease in the market value of equity securities awarded by Dollar General and held by them; (2) pledging our securities as collateral; and (3) holding our securities in a margin account. Controlled Persons include the Board member\u2019s, executive officer\u2019s or employee\u2019s respective spouses, immediate family members sharing their home or that are economically dependent on them, entities that they control and trusts in which they serve as a trustee or are a beneficiary.\nShareholder Engagement\n\nTo build and maintain relationships with shareholders and to ensure their perspectives are understood and considered by the Board, we conduct year-round outreach through our senior management, investor relations and legal teams. In 2022, we also continued to engage in focused shareholder engagement efforts regarding ESG matters, inviting shareholders representing over 61% of our outstanding shares to discuss their perspectives on these matters. We ultimately held conversations with shareholders comprising over 52% of shares outstanding. As Chairman of both the Board and the Nominating, Governance & Corporate Responsibility Committee, Mr. Calbert led the engagement with shareholders representing over 24% of shares outstanding.\n\nFeedback from these meetings was shared with our Board members to inform future decisions pertaining to these matters. In addition, the feedback helped to inform our inaugural political spending report, decisions to further align certain of our disclosures to the TCFD framework and to enhance disclosures related to our cybersecurity and data privacy, employee safety and well-being; and explore opportunities to advance a renewable energy strategy.\n\nTopics discussed during ESG-focused shareholder outreach meetings generally centered on our:\n\n- Proposed approach to political spending disclosures\n- CEO transition\n- Disclosures and efforts around environmental and social matters, including our efforts toward achieving our Scopes 1 and 2 GHG reduction goals\n- Board of Director refreshment and composition, including the recent additions of Ms. Chadwick and Mr. Owen\n- Executive compensation program\n\nINVITED SHAREHOLDERS REPRESENTING\nOver 61% of Shares Outstanding\n\nENGAGED SHAREHOLDERS REPRESENTING\nOver 52% of Shares Outstanding\n\nCHAIRMAN-LED SHAREHOLDERS REPRESENTING\nOver 24% of Shares Outstanding\nPolitical Contributions\n\nDollar General does not have a political action committee (PAC) and does not make contributions or expenditures to participate or intervene in any campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office or to influence the general public with respect to the candidate for a specific election.\n\nPre-approval by the Chief Executive Officer is required for any Company contribution or expenditures directly made to influence the general public with respect to a referendum. If any such contributions are made by the Company, such contributions will be publicly disclosed on an annual basis, beginning with the Company\u2019s completed 2022 fiscal year.\n\nAny Company contributions or expenditures (including but not limited to dues or membership fees) of greater than $10,000 directly made to entities organized under Section 527 (political organizations), Section 501(c)(4) (which may include social welfare organizations or special interests groups), or 501(c)(6) (which may include trade associations) of the Internal Revenue Code, which may be used to participate or intervene in any campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office or to influence the general public, or any segment thereof, with respect to an election or referendum, must be approved in advance by the Company\u2019s Vice President of Government Affairs, Executive Vice President and General Counsel, and Chief Executive Officer. Such contributions and expenditures will be publicly reported on an annual basis, beginning with the Company\u2019s completed 2022 fiscal year.\n\nDollar General understands and values the right to vote in political elections at the local, state and federal level. While we are respectful of our employees\u2019 rights to engage in personal political activities, employees must do so in their own names, at their own expense and not imply any endorsement or participation by the Company.\n\nA copy of our political contributions policy is available on our website. https://www.dollargeneral.com/about-us/corporate-social-responsibility.html\n\nDollar General reviewed our relationships with any organizations focused on political or legislative advocacy and did not expend any funds in excess of $10,000 to 501C(3), 501C(6), or 527 organizations that were used to influence candidates for election, elections, or referendum in 2022. The Company paid dues of less than $500,000 in the aggregate to various trade organizations such as the Retail Industry Leaders Association and various state retail associations and chambers of commerce of which it is a member in 2022.\n\nEthical Conduct\n\nOur mission and values are built on a foundation of trust, honesty, fairness and respect.\n\nOur commitment to maintaining a values-driven, integrity-based culture guides our interactions with fellow employees, business partners, shareholders and customers. To ensure this trust is maintained and that we operate with the highest ethical standards, all employees, officers, Board members and vendors are expected to adhere to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. A copy of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics can be found in the Investor Information section of our website.\n\nSpeaking Up\n\nWe encourage employees and vendors to report illegal, unethical or questionable behavior. Additionally, our open-door policy welcomes employees to reach out to share concerns, ask questions or seek guidance. Employees and vendors may also report legal or ethical concerns through our 24/7 hotline\u2014anonymously, if desired\u2014to a live operator. We have a non-retaliation policy for all reports made in good faith. On a quarterly basis, internal audit reports any concerns to the Audit Committee, to the extent required by the Internal Investigations Policy.\n\nWe invite you to read our Corporate Governance Guidelines and other governance documents on the Investor Information, Corporate Governance page of our website.\nCybersecurity & Data Privacy\n\nIt\u2019s important to us that we protect the personal information of our employees, customers and business partners, as well as our own confidential and propriety business information.\n\nWe approach information security in a holistic, defense-in-depth manner and layer security controls to strengthen our protective posture. We work diligently to safeguard our data according to applicable industry regulations and laws, as well as best practices.\n\nCybersecurity\n\nCybersecurity is critical to our business operations. In addition to robust daily operations and consideration as part of enterprise risk management, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors receives updates on cyber risk and associated risk mitigation efforts on a quarterly basis from our Chief Information Officer and Chief Information Security Officer.\n\nBased on industry-recognized frameworks such as ISO/IEC 27001, NIST, PCI DSS and similar others, our information security program is designed to meet the unique information security needs of the Dollar General environment, considering\u2014among other things\u2014an evolving risk climate, as well as emerging threats, technologies and related trends. Robust vulnerability and threat management programs\u2014including but not limited to vulnerability scanning and application and penetration testing\u2014work to identify and react to potentially exploitable vulnerabilities that may exist in the environment. Multiple independent information security program assessments, audits and similar activities are conducted annually by both internal and external resources. After completion of audits and assessments, management develops appropriate action plans to address identified opportunities for improvement.\n\nThe Audit Committee reviews reports and metrics quarterly which pertain to cybersecurity risks and mitigation efforts with our Chief Information Officer and our Chief Information Security Officer. These updates help the Audit Committee understand and evaluate current risks, monitor trends and track our progress against specific metrics and maturity improvement action plans. The Audit Committee also has the responsibility to review with management and our outside auditor unauthorized access to information technology systems that could have an effect on the Company\u2019s financial statements.\n\nThe Audit Committee has undertaken cybersecurity education to assist members in overseeing related risks. Such activities included a cyber threat intelligence update focusing on the global impact of ransomware on the retail sector and trends in retail sector compromises; the state of cybersecurity regulation; an overview of methods to perform cyber risk quantification; an update on the evolving retail landscape\u2019s impact on cyber risk to retail organizations; and an overview of Company-specific cyber-related risks considerations.\nData Privacy\n\nData privacy is an important element of maintaining the trust of our customers, employees, and business partners.\n\nStrategic approaches to protecting customer cardholder information include not storing or handling customers\u2019 unencrypted full credit/debit card information, which reduces customer cardholder data exposure risk. In-store credit/debit transactions utilize point-to-point or end-to-end encryption solutions; online storefronts (e.g., e-commerce and other digital sales channels) utilize secure, tokenized third-party credit payment services.\n\nA few key privacy efforts:\n\n- Personal information is not sold or transferred to unaffiliated third parties\n- Full credit card information processed in our stores and through our digital properties is not stored\n- Customers can unsubscribe to promotional communications at any time\n- Customers can request what personal information Dollar General has stored, as well as request deletion of their information, in compliance with California Consumer Privacy Act and other applicable state data privacy laws\n\nEMPLOYEE TRAINING\n\nSecurity training and awareness programs are integrated into our onboarding and ongoing activities. While organizations providing contingent workers are responsible for general security training and awareness of their personnel, all employee and contingent worker email account holders are included in periodic phishing testing and training activities, which includes post-testing remedial training for those who fail testing exercises.\n## SASB Index\n\n### Activity Metrics\n\n| Metric                          | Code          | 2022     | 2021     | 2020     |\n|---------------------------------|---------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| (1) number of retail locations  | CG-MR-000.A   | 19,104   | 18,130   | 17,177   |\n| (2) number of distribution centers | CG-MR-000.A | 31       | 28       | 26       |\n| (1) total area of retail space  | CG-MR-000.B   | 142,987,061 | 134,466,867 | 127,056,000 |\n| (2) total area of distribution centers | CG-MR-000.B | 23.1 million | 20.1 million | 19.2 million |\n## SASB Index\n\n### Accounting Metrics\n\n| Topic                          | Metric                                                                 | Disclosure                                                                 |\n|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Energy Management in Retail & Distribution** | (1) Total energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity, (3) percentage renewable | See [Environment section](#)                                               |\n|                               | *CG-MR-130a.1*                                                         |                                                                           |\n| **Cybersecurity**              | Description of approach to identifying and addressing data security risks | See [Cybersecurity & Data Privacy section](#)                              |\n|                               | *CG-MR-230a.1*                                                         |                                                                           |\n|                               | 1) Number of data breaches, 2) percentage involving personally identifiable information (PII), 3) number of account holders affected | The Company intends to disclose information about data breaches when and to the extent required by applicable law and regulations. |\n|                               | *CG-MR-230a.2*                                                         |                                                                           |\n| **Labor Practices**            | (1) Average hourly wage and (2) percentage of in-store employees earning minimum wage, by region | Not Disclosed                                                              |\n|                               | *CG-MR-310a.1*                                                         |                                                                           |\n|                               | (1) Voluntary and (2) involuntary turnover rate for in-store employees | Not Disclosed                                                              |\n|                               | *CG-MR-310a.2*                                                         |                                                                           |\n|                               | Total amount of monetary losses as a result of legal proceedings associated with labor law violations | When public disclosure criteria are met, monetary losses as a result of legal proceedings associated with alleged labor law violations are included in the company\u2019s quarterly financial filings (i.e. Forms 10-K or 10-Q) |\n|                               | *CG-MR-310a.3*                                                         |                                                                           |\n| Topic                                      | Metric                                                                 | Disclosure                                                                                                                                 |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Workforce Diversity & Inclusion           | Percentage of gender and racial/ethnic group representation for (1) management and (2) all other employees | See Workforce Composition section.
