Today, driven by innovation and built with passion, the length of the blades produced exceeds 80 meters.\n\nLearn more \u25b6\nDear Fellow Stakeholders,\n\nThroughout our 130-year history, GE has demonstrated a larger purpose of lifting up the quality of life for people around the globe. Our approximately 168,000 employees work with customers, partners, communities, and governments in over 175 countries to deploy and innovate technology to solve the world\u2019s most pressing sustainability challenges across energy, health, and flight. Every day, our people rise to the challenge of building a world that works, in service of a more connected, healthier, and more sustainable future.\n\nIn year three of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is clear that global recovery \u2013 both economic and societal \u2013 remains uneven. Supply chain constraints continue to challenge businesses, government budget shortfalls hinder efforts to provide essential services, and millions of people around the world have faced significant disruption to their education and employment. Throughout 2021, our GE teams continued to assist healthcare providers, partners, communities, and patients around the world to address the ongoing health crisis, and we worked with local organizations in some of the hardest-hit communities to respond to humanitarian challenges.\n\nThe devastating war in Ukraine is no different, and the GE team stands proudly with the people of Ukraine. Our number one priority has been the safety of our people in the region, and we have acted diligently both to relocate those in harm\u2019s way and support our Ukrainian employees working elsewhere in Europe. We have donated $4 million in medical equipment to those affected along with $500,000 for international aid groups to support refugees. I\u2019m especially inspired by the GE employees who have opened their homes to Ukrainian refugees and volunteered their time to help with other refugee efforts. In addition, we have suspended all operations in Russia with the exception of providing essential medical equipment and supporting existing power services to people in the region.\n\nBased on full-time equivalent, active employees as of December 31, 2021.\nThe shape of things to come\n\nWe are taking steps today to further strengthen GE\u2019s ability to lead on some of the defining trends of our time\u2014driving decarbonization through the energy transition, enabling precision health, and creating a smarter and more efficient future of flight. In November 2021, we announced plans to form three independent, investment-grade companies that will be better positioned for long-term growth and improved service to customers, employees, and communities. We plan to spin off Healthcare first in early 2023, combine Renewable Energy, Power, and Digital into one business to launch as an independent public company a year later, thus creating our third company focused on Aviation.\n\nAs we look ahead to forming three industry leaders with sustainability at their core, these strong independent businesses will better leverage our innovation muscles, technology expertise, leadership, and global reach to build a world that works for everyone.\n\nENERGY TRANSITION\n\nAs a company whose help is needed to solve one-third of the world\u2019s electricity, we have a responsibility to lead the industry\u2019s decarbonization efforts while solving the energy \u201ctrilemma\u201d of affordable, reliable, and sustainable electricity, particularly for the more than 750 million people without access. Our energy businesses provide powerful, integrated solutions with some of the most innovative onshore and offshore wind turbines, most efficient gas turbines, as well as advanced technology for the world\u2019s most efficient electrical grids. For example, our powerful Haliade-X offshore wind turbine prototype in Rotterdam began operating at 14 MW. One Haliade-X 14 MW turbine can generate up to 74 GWh of gross annual energy production, saving up to 22,000 metric tons of CO\u2082, which is equivalent to the emissions generated by 11,000 vehicles* in one year. We have over 7 GW of Haliade-X commitments worldwide.\n\nWe believe in the important role of building the breakthrough technologies the world will need in the future, including low- and zero-carbon fuels like hydrogen for new and existing gas plants, carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration (CCUS), offshore wind superconducting generators, and small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). For example, we are working with customers to construct and update power plants in the U.S., Australia, and China to run on blends of hydrogen and natural gas, and to develop front-end engineering design studies for CCUS solutions in the U.S. and U.K., which can significantly reduce CO\u2082 emissions from power generation.\n\nGE\u2019s Haliade-X, the only independently certified 12+ MW offshore wind turbine today.\n\nFUTURE OF FLIGHT\n\nInnovations that improve fuel efficiency are defining the future of flight, and Aviation is helping the industry make meaningful progress toward its goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. GE Aviation is unique in the industry for the scale and ambition it is bringing to confront this problem, as we pursue solutions across Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) as well as hybrid electric and hydrogen-powered flight. Today, all GE and partner working engines are able to operate on approved SAF, which could lower lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent compared to petroleum-based fuels. GE Aviation, together with GE Research, is advancing commercial hybrid electric propulsion systems through key partnerships with ARPA-E and NASA. Additionally, Airbus and CPM International* are collaborating on tests of a modified GE Passport engine fueled by hydrogen. We are also innovating the next generation of aircraft engines. CPM launched the Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) program to demonstrate advanced technologies, with ground and flight tests expected in the middle of this decade. This program could ultimately lead to airplanes that would use 20 percent less fuel and reduce CO\u2082 emissions by 20 percent more than the most efficient jet engines built today.\n\nDriving progress on climate\n\nIn 2020, we set a new goal to achieve carbon neutrality within our own operations (Scope 1 and 2 emissions) by 2030. As described in this report, to achieve this goal, our businesses are making operational investments in energy efficiency, reducing emissions from the grid through smart power sourcing, and using lean practices to eliminate energy waste. For example, our Gas Power team held a \u201cCarbon and Energy Savings Kazan Week\u201d earlier this year across 21 sites focused on reducing energy consumption that identified an average savings of seven percent energy usage per site.\n\nIn 2021, we articulated GE\u2019s ambition to be a net zero company by 2050, including not just GE\u2019s own operations, but also the Scope 3 emissions associated with the use of our sold products. In this report, we provide more details about the path we see to achieving this ambition and connect the dots between our historic progress to reduce emissions, delivering the state of the art technology this decade, and innovating the breakthrough technologies for tomorrow with our net zero ambition for energy and aviation. We know our employees, customers, suppliers, policymakers, and other stakeholders are counting on GE not only to reduce emissions, but to innovate the technology the world needs to achieve its goals. We are optimistic our efforts can drive both sustainability and business success.\n\nOur Board of Directors oversees the execution of GE\u2019s sustainability priorities and initiatives as an integrated part of the Company\u2019s overall strategy and risk management. The Board discussed and helped shape the actions above and oversees the Company\u2019s decarbonization strategy highlighted throughout this report.\n\nFostering a diverse & inclusive workplace\n\nThe only way we are going to achieve our goals at GE is to ensure that we are able to recruit, retain, and promote the best talent. Teams that include diverse backgrounds and perspectives are absolutely critical to driving the lean mindset and innovative approach that we need to shape the energy transition, precision health, and future of flight. This is why we are proud of the progress we have made in the last year to improve GE\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) goals, and we are excited about the opportunities ahead to launch three independent companies that will maintain our dedication.\n\nWe continued to focus our DEI efforts on transparency. This means clearly reporting our employment diversity in new and more detailed ways so that all interested parties can easily understand where we are and hold us accountable as we progress toward where we want to be. This data has been informing the areas where we need to invest greater time and resources. Since 2020, we saw growth at the leadership level for both women globally (+1.2%) and for total U.S. race and ethnic minority (+1.7%). While men and women performing similar work are paid within one percent of each other across each GE business, we are committed to achieving 100 percent pay equity.\n\n* According to wind conditions on a typical German North Sea site.\n\nGE\u2019s RISE Program goals include reducing fuel consumption and CO\u2082 emissions by more than 20% compared to today\u2019s most efficient engines.\n\nGE\u2019s GLOBAL REACH\n\nWe have equipped 90% of the world\u2019s power transmission utilities with our technology\n\nOur equipment serves 1B+ patients per year\n\nEvery 2 seconds a GE or partner* powered aircraft takes off\n\nFinally, we were thrilled this year to appoint Brandi Thomas as our new Chief Diversity Officer (CDO), who is reporting directly to me and building on Mike Barber\u2019s work following his retirement. Brandi\u2019s leadership experience\u2014inside and outside of GE\u2014combined with her history of building diverse teams and deployment of lean make her the right CDO for GE. I look forward to partnering with her to accelerate our progress.\n\nBuilding a world that works\n\nDuring a recent visit to our GE Renewable Energy facility in Pensacola, Florida, I had the chance to meet with employees, hear about their lean journey over the past few years, and witness how deeply we have embedded lean within our culture. Lean in its simplest terms is about focusing on the customer, eliminating waste and prioritizing relentlessly. Our lean mindset is giving us the tools and instincts to make the right decisions and necessary trade-offs.\n\nIn 2021, employees at the Pensacola facility held more than a dozen kaizen exercises seeking to find ways to make production more flexible and resilient. The work has been paying off. Just last year, lean helped the plant significantly reduce the amount of time it takes to build a turbine, decreasing the number of build hours by six percent and shortening the time spent on the production line by 12 percent. Importantly, in this example, lean is helping us deliver on our sustainability strategy while enabling customers to meet their decarbonization goals.\n\nAs we prepare for a new and defining chapter in GE\u2019s history, sustainability is deeply rooted in all of our plans and priorities. I\u2019m incredibly proud of the initiative that our employees have displayed in this area, as well as the shared appreciation they have for doing things the right way. With this collective mindset in place, I know we can continue to expand on our 2021 accomplishments in the years ahead to build a world that works\u2014for everyone.\n\nH. LAWRENCE CULP, JR.\nChairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, GE\nCEO, GE Aviation\nESG at GE: Our focus on continuous improvement\n\nIn Part I of our 2021 Sustainability Report, GE\u2019s business leaders proudly share our efforts to succeed both for solving three of the world\u2019s most pressing sustainability challenges and for business: the energy transition to drive decarbonization, precision health that personalizes diagnoses and treatments, and a future of smarter, more efficient flight. As these pages show, this sense of purpose unites our approximately 168,000 employees every day.\n\nParts II and III focus on the other side of our sustainability mission: how we work to improve our impacts to our people, communities, and planet. These efforts\u2014frequently referred to as Environment, Social and Governance (ESG)\u2014are core both to our operations today and the businesses we plan to create.\n\nOur approach to ESG mirrors how we run GE more broadly. We approach ESG with the same spirit of humility, transparency, and rigor as our businesses, with a focus on what we need to improve performance, address gaps, and enhance programs. The two words that most come to mind are \u201ccontinuous improvement.\u201d This concept, core to lean management at the heart of GE\u2019s transformation, drives us to focus our attention on what we need to do better to succeed in our goals.\n\nIn 2021, this spirit of continuous improvement drove three ESG priorities.\n\nFirst, we prioritized progress toward the commitments and ambitions we announced in recent years. Regarding climate change, our businesses detail their efforts to make operational improvements on our path to carbon neutrality for our Scope 1 and 2 emissions (pages 92-95). Our Aviation and Power businesses also share details regarding the Scope 3 emissions from their sold products. This includes, for the first time, a road map of innovation and technology toward the path to net zero for these critical and complex technologies in the years and decades to come (pages 15 and 53).\n\nSecond, we took a transparent look at where we could do better and took action to close program gaps. This includes a broad internal and external stakeholder survey for GE Company and our businesses (pages 61-63). With this feedback, we pursued efforts to articulate our policies more clearly on product safety and quality (pages 66-70), to develop a holistic strategy around product stewardship (pages 104-106), and to provide more details in this Report surrounding our governance and compliance programs (pages 73-74).\n\nThird, following November\u2019s announcement that we plan to create three independent companies, we worked across GE to ensure that these impactful companies would operate with sustainability at their core on day one. We are fully seizing the opportunity in this ESG era to create new companies focused on critical global needs in energy, healthcare, and aviation, merging the legacy of GE\u2019s technology and culture and the best-in-class expertise of modern sustainability programs.\n\nAlong the way, we sought success not just as GE, but in partnership with our stakeholders. Our policy and lobbying report details our increasingly visible public engagement on furthering the goals of the Paris Agreement (page 98). With the growing focus on sustainable finance, we engaged most of our global banks to strengthen partnerships on deploying both technology and funding toward net zero goals. And we listened to stakeholders who reached out to us\u2014our customers, investors, NGOs, regulators, and others\u2014on their input for success in our mission, reflected in these pages.\n\nOf these stakeholders, our employees are top of mind. A Sustainability Business Council, comprised of each GE business and Corporate function, operationalizes our ESG programs. GE\u2019s Green Team Network, our employee resource group focused on supporting and furthering GE\u2019s sustainability goals, is a constant inspiration for engagement that brings positive impact both globally and locally to over 175 countries.\n\nOn behalf of GE\u2019s employees, we are proud to share our performance and efforts. And in the spirit of continuous improvement, I invite you to reach out to me with your input as we pursue success for these ESG priorities.\n\nROGER MARTELLA\nChief Sustainability Officer\n\nRoger Martella meets with Egypt Foreign Minister and President-designate of the 2022 UN Climate Conference (COP27) Sameh Shoukry in Cairo to discuss planning and support for COP27. With Roger are Rania Rostom and Mai Abdelhalim.\nOur Sustainability priorities\n\nThroughout our 130-year history, GE has held a larger purpose of innovating technology to lift the quality of life for people around the globe\u2014a core driver of sustainability. Sustainability priorities are woven into all that we do, including our business strategy, policies, leadership engagement, operating mechanisms, commitments and, ultimately, our products. From ensuring that more people have access to reliable, sustainable and affordable energy; to making precision health more accessible; to helping people thrive by staying connected to family, friends and economic opportunities, we are committed to making a substantial impact on people and the planet for the better.\n\nAs we continue to develop our plans to form three independent companies with sustainability at their core, our pursuit of the energy transition, precision health and future of flight is unwavering. Our Sustainability priorities built first and foremost on GE\u2019s unique culture of integrity in everything we do. As the world changes, we continuously adapt and improve our programs to best ensure we succeed in these priorities.\n\nIn the spirit of humility, we continuously engage with thought leaders and experts in various fields to learn from them and enhance our programs to best ensure we succeed in these priorities.\n\nThe following pages highlight how our products and innovation work to build a more sustainable world and how our foundational culture of integrity, forward-looking strategy and robust sustainability programs make these priorities come to life.\n\nHow our strategy and sustainability priorities align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals\n\nThe United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent a global agenda to address the most pressing challenges facing our world, including climate action, access to healthcare and reducing inequities throughout the world. We recognize the importance and urgency of this global initiative and how GE plays a critical role in infrastructure, advancing quality of life and furthering global development sustainably. GE has been a signatory to the UN Global Compact since 2008 and we see close alignment between 11 of the 17 SDGs and our strategy and sustainability priorities.\n\nOur product innovations work to advance precision health through integrated, efficient and highly personalized care, with a focus on increasing accessibility across the globe. We serve over 160 countries around the globe with our healthcare products and services and are leading innovation in conventional technology and digital tools, such as artificial intelligence, to make healthcare more accessible to more people globally. We recognize access to care and health data is an important social determinant of health. Products like our Vscan\u2122 Family technologies help doctors deliver expanded care to more people, including in rural regions. And partnerships with startups like Afya Rekod help transform care delivery by giving patients in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa an accessible record of their own health history.\n\nThe health and safety of our workforce and those doing work on our behalf across the globe is as important as any GE top priority, driving GE\u2019s system to safeguard workers and workplaces. Through the GE Foundation, programs like Safe Surgery 2020 continue to provide access to safe, affordable surgical and anesthetic care in underserved communities like Africa and Southeast Asia.\n\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have maintained precautions to ensure the health and safety of our employees and prioritized the manufacturing of medical equipment needed to treat COVID-19 patients globally.\n\nAt GE, we take pride in providing a safe, diverse and respectful workplace that promotes gender equality. We are proud of our long-standing commitment to fair and competitive pay practices, and our goal remains 100% pay equity in each of our businesses. In addition, we continue to offer benefits that support a gender diverse workforce, including flexible work policies, maternity and other family benefits, and more. At the leadership level, which encompasses the top 1.5% of all active employees, we have seen growth for women globally (+1.2%) since 2020.\n\nSimilarly, a key focus of our philanthropic efforts focuses on fostering women in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields and advanced engineering. For example, GE Girls\u2014which celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2021\u2014is designed to encourage girls to explore the world of STEM and STEM-based careers.\n\nLEARN MORE\n77 Human Capital\u2014Investing in our People\n80 Advancing Diversity and Inclusion\n116 Our Commitments\u2014GE Foundation\nGE 2021 Diversity Report\nWe are uniquely positioned to innovate the technology that will decarbonize the energy sector and promote affordable, reliable and accessible electricity around the globe. Our commitments, products, services and global reach are crucial to decarbonizing the world. We pursue this goal in three ways. First, we build diverse technology that works to keep the lights on, healthcare equipment operating and offices open around the world. Our offerings, from renewable power to gas power to the grid, enable our customers to provide energy reliably and affordably. Second, we are focused on our own use of energy by committing to be carbon neutral in our own Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from the use of sold products. Third, we are pursuing our ambition to be a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030.\n\nGE, at the core, is an innovation company with significant investment in research and development that defines our history. This has led us to introducing technology that has raised the quality of life for people around the world. We innovate current and breakthrough technologies to solve the challenges of the energy transition, precision health and future of flight. GE Research recently launched the CAGE (Climate Action) Lab and a new carbon capture breakthrough team to develop and deploy cutting-edge solutions to decarbonize the power sector and even pull carbon directly from the atmosphere itself.\n\nOur programs for redeveloping brownfield, Superfund and other contaminated sites is helping to turn idle properties into new hubs of economic growth and job creation globally.\n\nAs a global company, GE works with local communities to train and employ the local labor force. We believe education is a significant driver of economic inclusion, and we have long supported multiple organizations focused on training and educating a diverse pipeline. In 2021, the GE Foundation launched Next Engineers, a new college- and career-readiness program to increase the diversity of young people in engineering globally. GE\u2019s respectful workplace policies strive for a more diverse workforce and inclusive workplace. GE also supports an Employer Pay Principle to remove inequities and exploitation hitting the most vulnerable worker population through its membership with the Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment.\n\nAccess to affordable and reliable healthcare is also a significant driver of reduced inequalities and economic inclusion. We strive to improve access through the work of GE Healthcare and the GE Foundation\u2019s Developing Health programs, focusing on underserved communities.\n\nAs utilities, power producers, grid operators and policymakers around the world set their own decarbonization goals, our diverse offerings are part of the toolkit needed to achieve their targets. Our expansive business operations provide cities and communities with career and business opportunities that support them in achieving a more sustainable future.\n\nOur environmental programs are designed to promote sustainability\u2014from our robust Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) programs, to our initiatives to clean up and redevelop idle properties\u2014we are investing for the public good in the communities where we operate.\n\nIn response to increasing scarcity of resources, as well as expectations from customers, investors and regulators for producers to take heightened responsibility for the impacts of products across their full lifecycle, we have developed product stewardship and circularity goals to strengthen our efforts going forward. Product stewardship is already a central part of GE\u2019s strategy and culture and ingrained across safety and quality processes, policies and initiatives globally. Our strategy for continuous improvement is enabled via the adoption of lean principles, which play a key role in identifying and eliminating waste. It also includes consistently reviewing and strengthening our policies and practices to improve performance and reduce product related risks across environment and safety. As today\u2019s technologies evolve, we are embracing circularity as a defining methodology for updating our product stewardship strategy, both for our own operations and that of our products, by building on the range of circular offerings and ambitions that already exist across the company.\n\nBUSINESS AND PRIORITY ALIGNMENT\n- Energy Transition (GE Power, GE Renewable Energy, GE Digital)\n- Environmental Stewardship\n\nLEARN MORE\n22 Innovation\u2014Energy Transition\n91 Our Commitments\u2014Climate Change\n91 GE\u2019s Ambition to Be a Net Zero Company\n\nBUSINESS AND PRIORITY ALIGNMENT\n- Energy Transition (GE Power, GE Renewable Energy, GE Digital)\n- Precision Health (GE Healthcare)\n- Human Rights\n- Future of Flight (GE Aviation)\n- Safety\n\nLEARN MORE\n22 Innovation\u2014Energy Transition\n71 The Spirit & The Letter\n86 Safety\n112 Our Commitments\u2014Human Rights\n114 Our Commitments\u2014Ethical Supply Chain\n\nGE 2021 Human Rights Report\n\nBUSINESS AND PRIORITY ALIGNMENT\n- Energy Transition (GE Power, GE Renewable Energy, GE Digital)\n- Precision Health (GE Healthcare)\n- Future of Flight (GE Aviation)\n- Environmental Stewardship\n\nLEARN MORE\n17 Innovation\n54 GE Research: Innovating Toward a More Sustainable Future\n90 Our Commitments\u2014Environment\n\nBUSINESS AND PRIORITY ALIGNMENT\n- Precision Health (GE Healthcare)\n- Lifting Our Communities\n- Human Rights\n\nLEARN MORE\n17 Innovation\n80 Diversity and Inclusion\n112 Our Commitments\u2014Human Rights\n116 GE Foundation\n\nBUSINESS AND PRIORITY ALIGNMENT\n- Product Stewardship\n\nLEARN MORE\n104 Our Commitments\u2014Product Stewardship\nHaving met our 2020 emissions reduction targets ahead of schedule, we set a new goal to achieve carbon neutrality within our own operations (i.e., Scope 1 and 2 emissions) by 2050, including in the Scope 3 emissions associated with the use of our sold products.\n\nOur businesses function to provide energy, transportation and healthcare with lower emissions and less carbon intensity over time.

TCFD, SASB and GRI indices can be found here.\n\nGE\u2019s Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Inventory follows the World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised Edition (the \u201cProtocol\u201d). GE utilizes the Protocol for all definitions, assumptions, and calculations discussed in this document unless explicitly stated otherwise, reporting under the \u201coperational control\u201d approach. To learn more about our Greenhouse Gas Inventory and Energy Inventory process methodology see Appendix I in our 2021 Sustainability Report Appendices.\n\nAs described below on page 57, the GE Board of Directors (Board) exercises oversight and provides direction on GE\u2019s sustainability strategy, and the Governance & Public Affairs Committee in coordination with the Audit Committee oversees external reporting on sustainability matters, including this report. While the contents within this report have not been externally assured, both internal and independent external resources have reviewed the information and data within for quality, completeness and accuracy.\n\nSome of the images in this report were captured before the COVID-19 pandemic and may not include face coverings and social distancing.\n\n**About this report**\n\nThis report covers the environmental, social and governance (ESG) activities of GE, primarily for 2021. In certain places, it also describes the shape of things to come as we plan to become three distinct companies, with sustainability at the core, focused on important growth sectors in energy, healthcare and aviation. This report allows us an opportunity to deepen existing conversations with our stakeholders about our sustainability programs.\nKey metrics: Our performance and priorities\n\nAs an active participant and signatory to the UN Global Compact since 2008, we understand that we play a role in helping achieve a better future for all by creating a more sustainable world. To put this in action, we apply the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights to help frame our program and practices. Our ESG performance in 2021 and priorities for 2022 and beyond align with the identified UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to help address the identified societal challenges.\n\nWe identified focus areas where our performance in 2021 vs. 2020 warranted greater focus and provide further details where indicated.\n\n### Financial Performance ($M)\n\n| TOPIC | BASELINE | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | UN SDG |\n|-------|----------|------|------|------|--------|\n| Total revenues | $90,221 | $75,833 | $74,196 | | |\n| Adjusted revenues | $87,419 | $72,969 | $71,090 | | |\n| Adjusted profit | $8,422 | $2,246 | $4,608 | | |\n| Free cash flows | $2,145 | $635 | $1,889 | | |\n| Total research and development | $4,364 | $3,820 | $3,685 | | |\n\n### Diversity and Inclusion (pages 80-84)\n\n| TOPIC | BASELINE | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | UN SDG |\n|-------|----------|------|------|------|--------|\n| Total Race & Ethnic Minority | 24.1% | 24.2% | | | |\n| Asian | 8.7% | 8.5% | | | |\n| Black/African American | 6.8% | 6.7% | | | |\n| Hispanic/Latino | 6.5% | 6.8% | | | |\n| American Indian/Alaskan Native | 0.3% | 0.3% | | | |\n| Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander | 0.2% | 0.1% | | | |\n| Multiracial | 1.6% | 1.7% | | | |\n| Disability | 3.7% | | | | |\n| Veteran Status | 10.1% | | | | |\n\n### Human Rights: Supplier Responsibility Program (pages 112-114)\n\n| TOPIC | BASELINE | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | UN SDG |\n|-------|----------|------|------|------|--------|\n| Total Global Audits | 1,286 | 1,115 | | | |\n| Total Suppliers Approved | 1,019 | 966 | | | |\n| New Suppliers | 433 | 220 | | | |\n| Existing Suppliers | 553 | 726 | | | |\n| Supplier From Acquisition | 53 | 20 | | | |\n| Total Suppliers Rejected | 71 | 26 | | | |\n| New Suppliers | 62 | 13 | | | |\n| Existing Suppliers | 8 | 13 | | | |\n| Supplier From Acquisition | 1 | 0 | | | |\n| Total Findings | 7,348 | 6,031 | | | |\n\n### Health & Safety\n\n| TOPIC | BASELINE | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | UN SDG |\n|-------|----------|------|------|------|--------|\n| Health & Safety | 29% | 31% | | | |\n| Environment | 31% | 31% | | | |\n| Emergency Preparedness | 21% | 20% | | | |\n| Human Rights & Labor | 16% | 14% | | | |\n| Dormitory Standards | <1% | <1% | | | |\n| Conflict Minerals | 2% | 1% | | | |\n| Security / Other | <1% | <1% | | | |\n\n### Audits per Region:\n\n| TOPIC | BASELINE | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | UN SDG |\n|-------|----------|------|------|------|--------|\n| China | 41% | 38% | | | |\n| India | 28% | 27% | | | |\n| North and South America | 13% | 18% | | | |\n| Europe, Middle East & Africa | 9% | 8% | | | |\n| Rest of Asia | 9% | 10% | | | |\n\n### Environmental Stewardship (pages 33-35, 50-53, 90-95, 107)\n\n| TOPIC | BASELINE | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | UN SDG |\n|-------|----------|------|------|------|--------|\n| Safety (pages 86-89) | | | | | |\n| Injury & Illness Total Recordable Rate | 0.60 | 0.53 | 0.60 | | |\n| Days Away From Work Incident Rate | 0.28 | 0.29 | 0.32 | | |\n| Fatalities -

As they have since 2020, GE employees continued to serve on the front lines to ensure hospitals and medical equipment, electricity and critical infrastructure kept operating.\n\nThroughout 2021, GE leadership prioritized protecting the health and safety of our employees while supporting our communities. The GE Board of Directors and management teams maintained their engagement to keep our workplaces around the world safe, while complying with local governments in their efforts to control the spread of COVID-19.\n\nIn 2021, three key themes governed GE\u2019s strategy for managing COVID-19: promoting and enabling access to vaccines where possible, ensuring our COVID-19 safety protocols remained compliant, and adapting our protocols in response to the latest science and understanding about the virus. These themes shaped our efforts to navigate the unknowns of the pandemic, while ensuring the safety of our employees.\n\nOur enterprise-wide, cross-functional internal COVID-19 Task Force continued to work in 2021 to protect the health and safety of our employees globally while maintaining business continuity. Through both our safety and regulatory compliance efforts, we engaged with our employees, and for those represented by labor unions, with their leadership, as a key part of our worker safety response. These ongoing initiatives \u2014 in addition to those listed below \u2014 are some of the specific ways we supported the health, safety and wellness of our employees in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021:\n\n- We continued to leverage our multi-level GE Site Safety Roadmap introduced in 2020, aligned with global regulatory guidance to ensure compliance and the health and wellness of individuals working at our facilities.\n- We continued to issue frequent communications about safety practices and enhance safety protocols as local regulations changed.\n- We continued to promote our open ombuds reporting channel for worker concerns related to compliance with COVID-19 safety protocols.\n- We continued to engage in educational dialogue with our people through our Chief Human Resources Officer and Chief Medical Officer, covering a variety of topics including vaccinations, face coverings and other COVID-19 related developments.\n\nGE Foundation and GE Volunteers provide relief during COVID-19 outbreak\n\nAs India grappled with the COVID-19 outbreak in 2021, the GE Foundation partnered with United Way Bengaluru and Amreicares. The funding supported the build-out of 60 intensive treatment units at St. John\u2019s Hospital in Bengaluru and funded 100 oxygen concentrators for hospitals in need across Vadodara, Noida, Pune, Hyderabad and Chennai. In addition, since 2020, the GE Volunteers organization provided more than 5,000 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to frontline workers, including primary healthcare workers, hospital staff and police; distributed more than 3,500 hygiene kits for use in primary health care centers across the country; and prepared and distributed food kits to more than 3,500 migrant worker families who were homebound.\n\nGE Scientists developing technology to add COVID-19 virus detector to mobile devices\n\nAs part of a project funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), GE Research\u2019s sensing team is developing miniature sensors that can detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus on an array of different surfaces.\n\n\u201cOne of the first lines of defense against any virus is avoiding exposure, which is easier said than done when you can\u2019t see it,\u201d said Radislav Petrykalo, a principal scientist at GE Research and principal investigator on the NIH project. \u201cThrough our project with the NIH, we are developing a sensor small enough to embed in a mobile device that could detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus.\u201d\n\nThese mini-sensors could also potentially be integrated into other types of surfaces such as fingerprint scanners, computer keyboards and wall-mounted sensors. The team is drawing from years of development and commercial success with other physical, environmental, gas and biosensors for industrial monitoring.\n\nGE Gas Power and Fieldcore teams helping to keep families fed in Atlanta\n\nGE employees are helping to keep families fed in Atlanta, Georgia. The pandemic has no doubt hit some areas harder than others. Brumby Elementary School in suburban Atlanta is home to more than 900 students in kindergarten to fifth grade. Pre-COVID, the school\u2019s food pantry served 50 to 60 families on a weekly basis. Today, it serves many more. Local teams from across GE volunteer weekly and serve groceries to more than 350 families in need. The food is donated by the YMCA and the Atlanta Community Food Bank.\n\n\u201cAs a volunteer, I find it very rewarding to work alongside my colleagues to give back to the community and make a difference in a very meaningful way,\u201d says Steve Hartman, Vice President, Installed Base Decarbonization, GE Gas Power.\nSupporting employees and communities impacted by the war in Ukraine\n\nThe strength and courage of the Ukrainian people are an inspiration to the world. As a GE team, we stand with our employees, customers and all those impacted, and took steps early in the crisis to help by donating $4.5 million in medical equipment and humanitarian support.\n\nGE Healthcare donated $4 million in healthcare equipment. With support from our long-time partner, Assist International, the equipment was delivered to the Ukrainian Ministry of Health, and included handheld ultrasound devices, mobile X-ray units, ventilators and patient monitors. We appreciate the amazing teamwork and collaboration of our GE Healthcare employees to deliver this critical equipment so quickly.\n\nAdditionally, the GE Foundation, an independent charitable organization funded by GE, made a $500,000 donation to two organizations to bring immediate and long-term support to refugees and relief organizations on the ground. This donation included $400,000 to the International Rescue Committee (IRC) to provide immediate humanitarian relief organization that connects airlines and pre-qualified nonprofits to help communities in crisis by rapidly deploying vital supplies. The funds provided aid to an estimated 100,000-250,000 displaced families in Poland, Moldova, Romania and Hungary.\n\nAdditionally, the GE Foundation\u2019s Matching Gifts Program enabled employees to contribute to relief efforts, doubling their support by matching their donations 1-to-1. As of the end of May 2022, these funds increased our impact by an estimated $380,000, including employee donations and matching gifts.\n\nWe are hopeful the donation of medical equipment from GE Healthcare continues to help those most in need of care and we are honored to support the IRC and Airlink as they work to provide relief to Ukrainian civilians who have been forced to flee their homes.\n\nGE employees across Europe support Ukrainian refugees\n\nAs waves of refugees have fled across the Polish border and into the Czech Republic, GE Aviation employees in the two countries have stepped up to provide aid. They are spending hours as teams through GE Volunteers, assembling care packages of necessities like shampoo, hand sanitizer and diapers, as well as thousands of meals of fruit, hot soup sandwiches, and water\u2014and delivering them to railway stations. Others have taken their support a step further and are personally helping by picking up refugees at border crossings and driving them to destinations around the country or putting people up in their own homes.\n\nAt GE Steam Power, our local team in Poland is helping to support the unprecedented situation at the Ukraine borders. GE Volunteers in Poland and Romania are helping refugees with immediate basic needs like food, clothes and toiletries. The team also supported a local charity to help expand its impact working with refugees on the ground.\n\nAt LM Wind Power, a GE Renewable Energy business, employees at the blade manufacturing plant in Poland have been working together to collect essential goods for Ukrainian refugees, and in an amazing show of solidarity, hosted more than 150 refugees in their homes. In addition, the local management team is making special efforts to fill open roles with Ukrainian employees.\n\nIn Hungary, GE\u2019s employee resource groups hosted a donation drive, collecting basic medicines, vitamins, blankets, thermometers, baby supplies, toys and clothes to provide immediate help at the Ukraine border and in Budapest. They also purchased first aid products and vital supplies. The funds provided aid to an estimated 100,000-250,000 qualified nonprofits to help communities in crisis by rapidly deploying humanitarian relief organization that connects airlines and pre-qualified nonprofits to help communities in crisis by rapidly deploying vital supplies. The funds provided aid to an estimated 100,000-250,000 displaced families in Poland, Moldova, Romania and Hungary.\n\nThe support of GE employees to the ongoing humanitarian situation is impressive and demonstrates the incredible generosity of our people. GE employees also made personal donations to local charities, many of which were doubled through the GE Foundation\u2019s Matching Gifts Program. But most importantly, it\u2019s an outpouring of aid that has come straight from the heart.\n\nFor 130 years, people have counted on GE to \u201cfind out what the world needs... and try to invent it,\u201d as our founder Thomas Edison famously said. This still rings true at GE.\n\nFrom the first commercially viable lightbulb to the Haliade-X, the only independently certified 12+ MW offshore wind turbine today, GE has pioneered technologies spurring world-transforming changes and improving the lives of billions.\n\nAs we look ahead to forming three independent companies with sustainability at their core, our commitment to innovation remains our North Star. Our employees serve customers and communities in more than 175 countries and are passionate about solving the world\u2019s most pressing sustainability challenges in energy, health and flight.\n\nThis is the impact of GE\u2014every day our people rise to the challenge of building a world that works, in service of a more connected, healthier and more sustainable future.\nOur focus is on innovating solutions to three of the world\u2019s most pressing challenges\n\nEnergy transition\n\nClimate change is an urgent global priority. At the same time, energy demand is increasing and more than 750 million people are without access to reliable power. As a company whose equipment helps generate one-third of the world\u2019s electricity, we have a responsibility to lead the industry\u2019s decarbonization efforts and meet the rising global demand for affordable, reliable and sustainable energy.\n\nGE is committed to building and delivering state-of-the-art equipment to reduce emissions today while growing access to reliable, sustainable and affordable electricity for everyone. Our energy businesses provide powerful, integrated solutions with the most innovative onshore and offshore wind turbines, most efficient gas turbines, as well as advanced technology to modernize and digitize electrical grids. Beyond delivering technology the world needs today, we are equally focused on the important role of building the breakthrough technologies the world will need in the future, including carbon capture, utilization and sequestration (CCUS), low and zero carbon fuels like hydrogen for new and existing gas plants, and small modular nuclear reactors.\n\nPrecision health\n\nPrecision health is about enabling integrated, efficient, and highly personalized care to address critical challenges that affect patients and healthcare providers. We are merging imaging, diagnostics and genomic data with science to help build an intelligence-based healthcare system. This can enable both greater productivity and greater access to healthcare, especially for half of the world\u2019s population who lack access to care.\n\nFor example, GE Healthcare has equipped the first public sector comprehensive Integrated Molecular Imaging Centre for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in Sub Saharan Africa. More than 600 patients who otherwise would not have had access to PET/CT scans have already been seen at the Centre.\n\nIn addition, GE Healthcare partnered with SOPHIA GENETICS to integrate genomic data and artificial intelligence (AI) into oncology applications and make better use of existing data. The goal is to incorporate AI analysis into the oncology workflow and deliver more personalized insights to improve treatment options for cancer patients. By bringing together clinical medicine with advanced analytics and AI, we are helping to deliver on the promise of precision health and improve efficiency and access for patients, healthcare providers, health systems and researchers around the world.\n\nFuture of flight\n\nGE Aviation is building a world that works for the future of flight with industry-leading technology innovation to reduce GHG emissions. Advancements in aerodynamics, engine architecture, and materials technology for GE and CFM International\u00ae product lines have resulted in today\u2019s aircraft engines consuming 40% less fuel and emitting 40% less CO2 than engines manufactured in the 1970s and 1980s. However, we cannot be satisfied with the pace of progress from the past.\n\nWe are currently developing the next suite of engine technologies\u2014including advanced architectures such as open fan, hybrid-electric and electric propulsion concepts\u2014and advanced thermal management concepts\u2014that offer the potential to achieve at least a 20% additional improvement in fuel efficiency compared to today\u2019s state of the art single-aisle aircraft engines.

LEAP is a registered trademark of CFM.\nIn our 2020 Sustainability Report, I wrote to you about the tremendous need to solve one of the world\u2019s most serious challenges\u2014climate change\u2014and the urgency with which GE and our customers are approaching a decade of action to reduce carbon emissions today, accelerating a path to a lower carbon future, and growing access to reliable, sustainable and affordable energy. This mission remains unchanged.\n\nWe believe the plan announced in November of forming a single company focused on innovating technology to solve the energy transition globally will allow us to support this mission with increased focus and autonomy.\n\nSCOTT STRAZIK\nCEO of GE\u2019s Global Energy Business Portfolio\n\nWe take this global responsibility seriously. The new company we plan to create will be well-positioned as an energy industry leader, as one-third of the world\u2019s current electricity is generated using GE equipment, today and tomorrow, as we work to develop the next generation of breakthrough technologies to drive deeper decarbonization. Our GE team is excited by this new opportunity to serve our energy customers and support their needs and commitments, and I am proud to lead that business as we work to spin off from GE in 2024\u2014a business where sustainability will very much be at the core.\n\nThe challenge and opportunity of the energy transition is clear\u2014the world must simultaneously meet rapid growth in the demand for electricity while quickly reducing emissions of the power generation system. The growth in electricity demand is expected to double through 2050 as we work to enable access for the more than 750 million people without electricity today, at the same time other industries, from cement and steelmaking, will continue to turn to increased electrification as a means to reduce their own emissions profiles. But such a move will only be effective if we decarbonize the system producing the underlying electricity itself in a way that maintains both reliable and affordable access.\n\nAs we have said before, no one technology or solution will be able to meet these mutually achievable goals. We must build and maintain a diverse generation ecosystem\u2014inclusive of renewables, gas, nuclear and grid\u2014to rapidly reduce emissions today while ensuring the critical electricity our world and lives depend on is available without interruption. Through our cross-business Energy Transition Steering Committee, which was established in 2020, and our Center for Decarbonization, which was launched in 2021, we have developed a cohesive strategy to address decarbonization needs using the full breadth of products and capabilities across our portfolio. Our new energy business will bring all these technologies into a single organization, while adding crucial elements including our Digital business to deliver even greater value to our customers and society at large.\n\nThis decade of action must begin with renewables\u2014where GE has a leadership position\u2014to deploy carbon-free generation technology as quickly and affordably as possible. Both onshore and offshore wind generation are essential technologies to reduce the carbon emissions of the power generation system and areas where GE feels confident in our technological leadership. Hydroelectric power, where space and natural resources allow for it, will also be a continued contributor of renewable energy, and we look to explore applications including pumped-storage hydroelectric power which could help deliver baseload renewable energy generation under the right conditions.\n\nAs we work to accelerate the growth of renewables, our gas turbines, the most efficient in the world, will remain essential to decarbonization by enabling the rapid transition of base load generation away from coal-fired technologies. They will also be a key enabler to increasing renewables by ensuring overall system reliability as renewable power generation grows in many markets. Beyond that, we expect gas generation will continue to play a key role as a destination technology in the energy transition through the breakthrough technologies of pre-combustion hydrogen fuel use and post-combustion carbon capture, utilization and storage.\n\nNuclear energy will continue to be a carbon-free power generation source that many countries and customers will rely on, and GE\u2019s small modular reactor technology will be well-positioned to meet their needs for a simpler, safer and more cost-effective reactor. In 2021, we announced our GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy business was selected by Ontario Power Generation and Synthos Green Energy to deploy BWRX-300 small modular reactors as early as 2028 in Canada and the early 2030s in Poland. Designed to promote simple and safe operating rhythms, this innovative zero-carbon technology stands to be a breakthrough contributor to the energy transition.\n\nInvestments for the grid\u2014whether physical or in digital solutions\u2014are imperative to ensure our transmission and distribution systems can weather the entropy of these technologies today and tomorrow. Our Power Conversion, Grid Solutions and Digital businesses will be essential players to ensure our grid is robust and able to deliver reliable energy, while protecting our customers\u2019 assets from the increased risk vectors of cybersecurity threats, extreme weather, and new and evolving business models that threaten their operations. We believe strongly that optimization software will be a significant contributor to, and accelerator of, the energy transition.

As these pages show, GE\u2019s investments toward decarbonization technologies are uniquely diverse. GE is innovating these technologies both for our customers and for the planet as we work to play a leadership role in the power sector, meeting its 2050 net zero goals.\n\nIn 2021, GE announced an ambition to be a net zero company for its sold products by 2050, which is the most impactful and relevant emissions category given the nature of our businesses. Working with external advisors and experts over the course of 2021, we further refined our focus to power turbines and aircraft engines, which account for the majority of GE\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions across all reporting scopes. By focusing on the key levers we have as a company to impact the energy transition, we will more effectively deliver the type of technology innovations and breakthroughs our power customers are relying on to achieve their own net zero ambitions.\n\nIn working to lead the development of technology for the power sector, we are informed by the role of our power business for sustainable development and broader industry trends. Addressing the urgent need to decarbonize the global energy system is at the same time a huge challenge and opportunity. Energy is the Method of safer, longer lives, economic growth and human prosperity. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that the world\u2019s population will grow by approximately 2 billion people by 2050. Yet even today, 750 million people globally do not have access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy.\n\nGE is proud to play a critical role in providing reliable, sustainable, and affordable energy globally, a core United Nations Sustainable Development Goal. As described on the pages above, GE\u2019s equipment powers one third of the world\u2019s electricity, and 90 percent of the world\u2019s power transmission utilities use GE technology. With diversified technology in the renewable power, conventional power, and grid businesses, GE is committed to achieving the goal of decarbonizing the energy system for global growth, access and resiliency to reliable, sustainable, and affordable electricity. These efforts collectively advance progress toward SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy). SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and SDG 13 (climate action).\n\nThe IEA forecasts that global energy consumption will grow by 50% between a 2018 baseline and 2050. Energy generation contributes around 25% of global CO2 emissions and this will need to be drastically reduced in order to hit the global target of net zero emissions by 2050. With this challenge becoming clear, global regulators and industry experts are now starting to paint a picture of what the future energy mix will look like with fossil fuels, and in particular, natural gas still needing to play a role to support the transition, alongside a huge growth in the clean energy and renewable sector as well as decarbonization technologies. In its 2021 Energy Outlook, the IEA calls for \u201caction in four key areas over the next decade that are essential to keep the door to a 1.5 \u00b0C stabilization open: a massive push for clean electrification; a renewed focus on realizing the full potential of energy efficiency; concerted efforts to prevent leaks from fossil fuel operations; and a boost to clean energy innovation.\u201d\n\nAs GE technology helps power one-third of global electricity, we can make a major contribution to the energy transition ahead. Our technologies are contributing to many of the efforts that have the potential to decarbonize energy to data, and they are crucial to reducing the sectors\u2019 carbon intensity that is needed in the short term, as we invest in and build the longer term mix of low carbon energy, clean fuels and renewable electricity needed for the net zero future.\n\n**OUR NET ZERO PRINCIPLES**\n\nAs one of the world\u2019s leading companies in the energy sector, we know that the challenge is complex and we have to be nimble and committed as a company and with our partners to innovate the technology to succeed over the years and decades to come. We have several principles that are guiding our approach to our net zero ambitions:\n\n- **Credibility:** Knowing this path will take decades, we prioritize credibility as most important to our stakeholders to share what we objectively know and don\u2019t know. This also means as we get better and more credible information, we will share that with our stakeholders.\n- **Continuous learning:** Our analysis below is based on how we see things today. We are committed to continuous learning to enable more insights and opportunities to make a difference, and we expect to make progress over time.\n- **Collaboration:** We know no one company can solve these issues alone. With GE\u2019s spirit of humility, we welcome continued collaborations with our customers, investors, regulators, and peers to achieve success toward our goals. We summarize several of these key collaborations on page 31.\n- **Commitment to innovation and technology:** Simply stated, GE\u2019s role in the sector\u2019s path toward net zero is to deliver state of the art technology today to make progress while innovating the breakthrough technologies for tomorrow. Below, we synthesize the previous 11 pages regarding how we see various technologies contributing toward this path.\n\nApplying these principles, we consider three pathways toward the net zero ambition.\n\n**Actions pre-2020**\n\n**Building on substantial contributions from past action.** Our efforts toward decarbonization began well before 2021. GE has long innovated its products to drive efficiencies and reduce CO2 emissions by delivering state of the art products. Our past efforts since 2010 lay a strong foundation for the progress forward.\n\n**2020-2030**\n\n**Driving continued progress this decade.** We are prioritizing the 2020s as a decade of action, with a focus on innovating the technology solutions needed to achieve net zero emissions in 2050. This will take several forms, including advancing technology with the potential to further reduce carbon emissions and carbon intensity in this decade and beyond.\n\n**2030-2050**\n\n**Innovating for the future.** While we are optimistic about the role of GE\u2019s technologies to make progress through 2050, we know they will not be enough to achieve 2050 net zero ambitions. We are investing today to innovate the next generation of breakthrough technologies to achieve the step changes that will be needed for the power sectors.\n1. BUILDING ON SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM PAST ACTION\n\nGE\u2019s power technology has made substantial contributions to global decarbonization efforts for many years. For example, over the past decade, while global coal generation across the industry grew by 6% (2010\u20132021), estimated generation from GE\u2019s installed base declined by 22%. Fuelled by retirements and coal-to-gas switching, estimated generation from GE\u2019s gas installed base grew by 17% over this period. With less than half of the carbon emissions of a comparable-sized coal plant and the operating flexibility to accommodate variable renewable generation, gas played a vital role contributing to the reduction in carbon emissions without sacrificing grid resilience. During this same period, there was a 16% increase in estimated generation from GE\u2019s installed low-carbon power generation technologies (wind, hydro, nuclear).\n\nThe net of these changes resulted in an estimated reduction in carbon intensity of the total GE installed base by 22% over this time period. Over the past decade and a half, coal-to-gas switching has done more to decarbonize the U.S. power sector than any other technology. At the same time, GE has accumulated more than 1.3 million operating hours on its World Record Efficiency H-class gas turbines (with nearly one-third the carbon emissions of a coal plant). Advanced gas path upgrades deployed to GE\u2019s existing F-class fleet over the past three years reduced roughly 2 million tons of CO\u2082 emissions. Gas plants play a vital role balancing variable renewables with dispatchable, flexible power, preserving system resilience. Converting to hydrogen fuel reduces carbon emissions and GE leads the industry in hydrogen-like combustion experience (8 million hours across 100+ units).\n\n2. DRIVING CONTINUED PROGRESS THIS DECADE\n\nAs described above, GE has a two-fold goal for the energy sector: (1) to decarbonize the energy sector globally through a combination of renewable energy, gas power, and grid modernization while (2) growing resilient access to reliable, sustainable, and affordable energy for everyone. This challenge takes on greater significance knowing the power sector will be a key enabler for decarbonizing other economic sectors (e.g., transportation, buildings). GE Power\u2019s 2025 Scope 3 emissions from its power turbines are estimated on the accompanying chart.\n\nIn this decade, GE will focus on reducing Scope 3 emissions in several ways. GE\u2019s coal exit and wind growth are key near-term influencers toward lowered Scope 3 emissions. Over the decade, greater deployment of gas plant pre-combustion decarbonization technologies (hydrogen or renewable natural gas blending) and post-combustion carbon capture technologies (including retrofit of existing plants) could support progress. Our projected timeline for the deployment of these technologies this decade is shown on the accompanying chart and the ways we are supporting these technologies are described above in the Sustainability Report.\n\nGE will continue its investments in onshore and offshore wind to improve capacity factors and to expand operating capacity to support robust demand growth for renewables. The Haldeke X, the world\u2019s largest wind turbine in operation, is designed for growth from its current 14MW/220m rotor to as much as 17MW/250m rotor, resulting in a 7% capacity factor improvement. GE\u2019s newest onshore wind turbine platform, Sienna, was introduced in 2022. Designed specifically for the North America region, the 3.4MW turbine is based on GE\u2019s best-selling 2MW platform, which recently surpassed 350GW of installed base globally. Investments in Grid hardware and software will also enable higher penetrations without sacrificing required resilience and grid stability. GE is continuing investments in the grid of the future to orchestrate variability of renewable resource, address bi-directional flow of electricity from distributed resources, augment traditional forms of system inertia, and enable controllable loads such as EV charging or heat pumps to balance supply and demand. These investments will increase the potential for higher penetrations of renewables on the grid and improve the carbon intensity of the power sector.\n\n3. INNOVATING FOR THE FUTURE\n\nLooking to and beyond 2030, GE is investing in the breakthrough technologies that we believe will be critical to achieve net zero 2050 goals. As described above, GE continues to invest in technology to support the energy transition toward lower greenhouse gas emissions without sacrificing the required grid resilience that consumers demand. Continued growth in renewables will play a major role, while the world will also require decarbonized dispatchable and flexible plants and hybrid/storage solutions to address variability of renewables.\n\nSMALL MODULAR NUCLEAR REACTORS\n\nGE is committed to developing and launching its first small modular reactor technology, the 800MW 300 units with plants to be operational by 2028. See page 29. This technology will be available in small scalable blocks, that use modularity and simplicity of design to take significant cost and cycle time out.\n\nHYDROGEN\n\nGE leads in hydrogen combustion experience and capability today and will continue to expand capability for increasing blends with a goal of a 100% hydrogen-capable (and hence zero-carbon power generation) product portfolio across its catalog by 2030 (see pages 46).\n\nCARBON CAPTURE\n\nWe also see a need for carbon capture technology to be deployed across new and existing gas plants. GE is participating today in multiple feed studies to integrate carbon capture technology into a flexible gas combined cycle plant. There are significant capital costs, operating costs, and physical space reductions under development with the potential to improve carbon capture deployment economics. In parallel, GE will continue active advocacy efforts with policy makers to ensure sensible regulations and enabling incentives are prioritized. GE anticipates to be actively constructing its first integrated carbon capture cycle system by 2025.\n\nAs these pages show, GE believes a diverse suite of technologies and innovation will be key to decarbonizing the energy sector while growing resilience. Our investments include renewable energy in the onshore and offshore wind sectors and grid modernization technology, all of which will contribute to net zero. Our focus is on reducing fossil fuel emissions through coal-to-gas switching and decarbonizing gas turbines pre-combustion with hydrogen and post-combustion with carbon capture.\n\nGE POWER AND RENEWABLE ENERGY: PATH TO NET ZERO BY 2050\n\nGE actively engaged in multiple feed studies for carbon capture projects in Europe and North America with construction to commence by 2025\n\nSmall modular nuclear reactors (pages 29-31)\n\nPost-combustion carbon capture (pages 28, 30)\n\nGE currently has 100% H\u2082-capability across some of its gas turbine offerings and is expanding capability with industry-leading efficient H\u2082 gas turbines to 100% by 2030 to meet customer needs to future-proof investments as hydrogen becomes available.\n\nGE will focus, working with other industry participants, on bringing into service breakthrough technologies by the early 2030s to help achieve absolute emission reductions for the power sector\u2019s path to net zero.\nI\u2019m proud that for more than a century, we at GE Healthcare have been working to deliver products and solutions that build a healthier world.\n\nOur purpose of improving lives in the moments that matter is manifested in our impact on patient and clinician outcomes around the world through innovative technology. We promote a fair and equitable workplace with unyielding integrity. I\u2019m excited about how we\u2019ve advanced standards of excellence through our commitments to extend the lives of our products and reduce energy use in our supply chains and production sites.\n\nBut with the growing threat of climate change, systemic inequality and global health disparities, we recognize that fulfilling our purpose, and following through on our ESG commitments, has never been more essential.\n\nWe know that we can do more. We want to enable earlier, better and more personalized care.\n\nKey to achieving that aim will be improving access to healthcare globally, especially in low-income countries and, in addition to population factors, this is partly exacerbated by lack of preventative strategies and a shortage of medical equipment. In places like Nigeria where breast and cervical cancer are on the rise, we\u2019ve helped equip the Marcella Ruth hospital with advanced technology, including mammography for screening and diagnostics and CT for radiation therapy, enabling patients, often for the first time, to get their care close to home.\n\nTo support a more sustainable future, we look for ways to help health systems improve efficiency and reduce waste. As they battle staffing shortages and an increasing number of patients, they can either build more hospital beds or find ways to better use existing resources to deliver care to more patients. Our AI-powered Command Center technology, used in more than 300 hospitals globally, offers real-time insights into patient workflow, helping staff to streamline discharge planning, surgical scheduling, care coordination and more. Through their Command Center, Tampa General Hospital in Florida was able to reduce patient length of stay by half a day and avoid the need for 64 new hospital beds\u2014this has the equivalent carbon impact of taking about 3,900 cars off the road and saved the hospital $40 million in just over a year after implementation.\n\nFor years, we have focused our efforts on developing medical equipment with best-in-class image quality and advanced software to increase diagnostic confidence. But we are challenging ourselves to be better. We are developing efficiency features and leveraging digital to turn even the largest pieces of medical equipment into devices that make a smaller mark on our planet. Our new MR system, SIGNA\u2122 Hero, is designed to be capable of lowering the use of helium, a scarce and non-renewable resource, by up to 67%. The current version of the magnet is 2 tons lighter than its predecessor. We have also enabled medical staff to easily decrease the power consumption of the MR and reduce scan time by up to 50%, saving both resources and improving the patient experience.\n\nWe are focused on developing innovative technology using sustainable design principles that extend the lifecycle of our products, often leveraging the strength of our field-based services teams to execute on this goal. In 2021, our team in Latin America performed more than 200 upgrades in hospitals and clinics, extending and enhancing the life of CT, MR, ultrasound and other life-saving equipment. This enables medical staff, for example, to obtain higher quality images or speed up exam times to see more patients, without the need for new equipment or expanding their facilities.\n\nNo organization can tackle the breadth of healthcare challenges alone. We are bringing together an ecosystem of partners, leveraging the strengths of clinicians, technology leaders, academics and others to advance healthcare together.\n\nIn oncology, we are collaborating with several private companies and academic institutions. In the U.K., for example, we are working with The University of Cambridge to develop an AI-enhanced digital application that integrates cancer patient data from multiple sources into a single interface. We hope this will ultimately lead to cancer patients receiving faster and more personalized treatment.\n\nAs we plan for a new chapter in our history to become an independent company, we are integrating sustainability more deeply into the core of our culture and business by working to expand access to healthcare, mitigating our climate impact, advancing the circular economy, designing with sustainability in mind, promoting diversity, equity and inclusion, and protecting patient data and cybersecurity.\n\nWith our unique position and scale within the global healthcare ecosystem, we are committed to building a more sustainable world for this and future generations.\n\nOur technologies today\n\n**MAKING CARE SMARTER AND MORE EFFECTIVE**\n\nWe occupy a unique place in the healthcare industry. With 48,000 people in 160 countries, we impact the lives of billions. Our manufacturing and procurement footprint reaches across the world\u2019s healthcare ecosystem. We\u2019re focused on being an innovator delivering precision health. For us, that means better patient outcomes, productivity and seamless workflow integration.\n\nWe know the important role technology plays in our lives. From across the globe, we see how smart devices can help bridge shortage gaps as caregivers are increasingly having to do more with less. The U.S. is seeing major labor challenges, with a turnover of core staff between 15 to 20%. Smart solutions, such as our Command Center technology with operational AI, can help staff make quicker decisions based on predictive data, helping them improve productivity and allowing staff to focus on what really matters\u2014their patients.\n\nOur technology also enables caregivers to bring advanced diagnostics and treatments to remote parts of the world where access to hospitals and medical equipment is limited. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that two-thirds of the world\u2019s population has no access to basic X-ray or ultrasound examinations, and if they are available, quality and safety can be questionable or dangerous. Portable solutions, such as handheld ultrasound, enable caregivers to bring the equipment to where the patient is. For example, staff at a small clinic in Zambia were able to see more than double the number of women as a result of using handheld ultrasound\u2014helping to transform care for expectant women in their country. And if the patient is unable to come to the clinic, staff can easily bring the ultrasound to the patient\u2019s home.\n\nBut the value of portable technology such as handheld ultrasound is not limited to developing countries. No matter the location or care circumstance, handheld ultrasound has proven an invaluable tool for many clinicians as a cost-effective, real-time tool to triage and determine patient care. The device\u2019s portability, ease of use and connectivity make it an indispensable and critical tool for primary care providers and other healthcare professionals around the globe.\n\nIn Southern France, in the remote commune of Les Vans\u2014with a population of 2,600 and approximately 10,000 in the surrounding area\u2014general practitioner Dr. Francis Pellet is able to manage complex cases with the use of handheld ultrasound. And with cloud connection, he can even collaborate virtually with his colleagues in Paris. This proved especially useful during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, from a local pool of 2,000 people with pulmonary inflammatory symptoms, Dr. Pellet\u2019s team tested everyone with ultrasound and identified 12 to 12 patients per day, or about 10%, who needed special follow-up or different monitoring. The handheld ultrasound also provided information that allowed him to diagnose a severe case of cardiac decompensation that required surgery 15 days later, and a surprising, serious case of advanced cardiomyopathy in a 20-year-old male.\n\n**VSCAN AIR \u2014 EXPANDING ACCESS TO CARE**\n\nHandheld ultrasound has become an essential tool, allowing clinicians to quickly collect images and triage patients while also providing the benefits of portability. The tool was designed to be accessible and usable without the need for adaptation or specialized design, across a wide variety of clinical specialties, clinician types, education levels, geographies and clinical settings.\n\nWith 30,000 units impacting the care of more than 50 million patients worldwide, our Vscan Family technologies help doctors deliver expanded care to more people, including in rural regions. Vscan is used globally across a variety of clinical settings. For example, in Germany, Vscan is being used by primary care physicians to improve speed to diagnosis. In the U.S., it is used in helicopters for air transport. In Japan, it is used by homecare workers to aid in the care of aging patients. And in developing countries, it is used to provide care to expectant mothers.\n\n**IMPROVING ACCESS TO HEALTH DATA IN AFRICA**\n\nGE Healthcare and Kenya-based startup, Afya Baked, announced a collaboration that seeks to transform care delivery by giving patients in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa an accessible record of their own health history, including radiological images. This will be made possible by enabling hospitals and diagnostic centers, many in rural settings, to host health records securely on one platform.

Medicine today produces vast amounts of data. We do labs, we take blood, we scan, we scope, we measure, we monitor. The challenge is aggregating and analyzing that data to extract knowledge and insight. Today, for the most part, clinicians are doing this in their heads based on their experience and some rudimentary decision support tools. 97% of that healthcare data is never used, but unlocking it means we can propel faster towards Precision Health.\n\nToday\u2019s innovations constitute the next step forward in healthcare\u2014improving efficiency, making care more precise and lowering the overall cost, which also means increasing access to more people in more parts of the world. We need to work towards a complete modernization of the current infrastructure to make healthcare more intelligence-based, giving us what we need to learn from the data we\u2019re generating. Ultimately, more intelligent healthcare will be more efficient and could potentially help save and improve more lives.\n\nCOVID-19 accelerated the pace of technological change globally. What would previously have taken the industry years to implement is now taking months. But the industry is still recovering from the pandemic. Health systems need better line of sight to all available resources, including staff. And that is only possible through greater access to data and strong collaborations within the industry.\n\n**ANAESTHESIA SOFTWARE \u2013 MANAGING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS**\n\nWe introduced an advanced software that helps automate oxygen and anesthetic agent delivery to patients during general anesthesia. With the software, one study indicates a potential 44% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions due to more efficient use of anesthetic agents.\n\n**STARGUIDE \u2013 OPTIMIZED FOR THERANOSTICS**\n\nHealthcare systems continue to be asked to maximize efficiencies without compromising patient care. In response, we designed StarGuide SPECT/CT to provide clinicians with the data they need to help them make personalized care decisions and treatment recommendations that are at the heart of precision health. The system is optimized for theranostic procedures, which combine the delivery of therapy to patients with diagnosis to monitor disease.\n\n**ENERGY EFFICIENCY**\n\n**SIGNA HERO & AIR RECON DL \u2013 LOW HELIUM MAGNET, ENERGY EFFICIENCY**\n\nSIGNA Hero was designed with improved sustainability in mind. To help healthcare systems conserve limited reserves of helium and save on operational costs in the long run, SIGNA Hero is designed to be capable of lowering helium usage up to 67%. The SIGNA Hero magnet is also 2 tons lighter than its predecessor. The system is also designed to easily decrease power consumption and scan time by up to 50% using AIR Recon DL.

And that is only possible through greater access to data and strong collaborations within the industry.\n\n**BK MEDICAL \u2013 IMPROVING DECISION MAKING DURING SURGERY**\n\nUltrasound is an integral part of many care pathways. We have a strong global presence in ultrasound and have added the fast-growing and relatively new field of real-time surgical visualization to our pre- and post-operative ultrasound capabilities, creating an end-to-end offering from diagnosis through therapy and beyond.\n\n**PCCT - INCREASING CLINICAL PERFORMANCE**\n\nPhoton Counting Computed Tomography (PCCT) has the promise to further expand the clinical capabilities of traditional CT, including the visualization of minute details of organ structures. Karolinska Institutet and MedTechLabs in Sweden are testing the world\u2019s first silicon-based PCCT system. Learn more.\n\nOur breakthrough technologies for the future\n\nWe need to work towards a complete modernization of the current infrastructure to make healthcare more intelligence-based, giving us what we need to learn from the data we\u2019re generating.\n\nOur Edison Digital Health Platform is being designed to enable healthcare systems to have a single platform to host and integrate apps into clinical workflows. With easy access to the workflow, analytics and clinical apps specific to care across the care continuum, clinicians will have actionable insights at their fingertips to help better serve their patients.\n\nIn France, we have launched the AI4R@M project, a consortium that gathers French SMEs, start-ups, research labs and clinical centers to facilitate the development of AI in medical imaging. Our aim is to create the tools that will facilitate large scale data annotation and algorithm design, testing and validation to cut cycle development time for AI start-ups, researchers or radiologists who wish to create AI applications for medical imaging.\n\nUsed correctly, AI can also enhance the personal side of healthcare by freeing up time for clinicians to spend with their patients. It can help them spend less time managing data and more time on the complex decision-making behind a diagnosis. To achieve this, AI needs to be seamless. For example, our AMX Navigate X-ray system has on-device AI solutions that can triage critical conditions such as pneumothorax\u2014a collapsed lung. This makes it easier for radiologists to know when to intervene and which patients to prioritize, as pneumothorax is a life-threatening condition.\n\n**Learn more**\n\nTay, S, et al.

Learn more \u25b6\n\nOUR COLLABORATIONS\nNot one stakeholder can solve healthcare\u2019s increasing and rapid challenges alone, which is why we are bringing together the ecosystem, leveraging the strengths of clinicians, technology partners, academics and others to advance healthcare together.\n\nFor example, to help small businesses in Africa\u2019s health sector strengthen their response to COVID-19 and other pressing healthcare challenges, GE Healthcare and NSIA Banque C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire have partnered with IFIC\u2019s Africa Medical Equipment Facility to support healthcare providers in Cameroon, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Kenya, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania and Uganda access essential medical equipment. The program, which spans the African continent, is an opportunity to increase affordability and access to financing and to high-quality medical equipment and care.\n\nWe are collaborating with several partners to advance cancer care and we hope that these collaborations will enable oncologists and medical experts to deliver earlier diagnoses and more accurate treatments\u2014a crucial component in achieving positive health outcomes with cancer patients.\n\n\u2022 With The University of Cambridge and Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital, we plan to collaborate on the development of an AI-enhanced application that integrates cancer patient data from multiple sources into a single interface. As a result, we hope cancer patients will get faster and more personalized treatment.

At GE Healthcare, climate action is an integral part of our mission to improve outcomes for patients, healthcare providers and researchers around the world, and it is our responsibility to intensify our actions to further reduce our emissions. To further our progress, we\u2019ve committed to the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). In addition to setting ambitious Scope 1 and 2 targets for our own operations (see page 91), we recognize that our carbon footprint includes indirect value chain (Scope 3) emissions. In 2021, we initiated a third-party review of our value chain footprint. This review aims to identify where we can most effectively collaborate with our suppliers, partners, customers, and employees to reduce carbon emissions across the lifecycle of the business. One of our largest value chain impacts centers around the use of our sold products, and a significant area is emissions associated with anesthetic gases utilized in our anesthesia machines in clinical settings. As part of our SBTi commitment, we intend to develop Scope 3 targets that align with limiting global warming to below 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nGE Healthcare helped healthcare professionals in Vietnam as they worked to treat patients with COVID \u2013 delivering more than 800 ventilators, including 265 units by road from its production site 2,500 km away.\n\nINDIA\nWipro GE Healthcare, together with partners HDFC Bank and United Way Delhi, is training 6,900 young people in Goa in healthcare-related skills for various non-technical job roles in the healthcare sector.

Leadership in aviation requires deep technical expertise, coupled with the fortitude and vision to enable breakthroughs required to achieve a step-change in engine efficiency.\n\nIn 2021, the global aviation industry committed to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Achieving that goal will require broad cooperation and significant investment across all sectors of the industry. As the propulsion provider for three of every four commercial departures, we are energized by the opportunity and responsibility to lead the way forward.\n\nThese efforts include a partnership between Airbus and CFM International, our joint company with Safran Aircraft Engines, to conduct flight tests of a hydrogen-powered jet engine; a partnership with NASA and Boeing to develop and fly a megawatt-class hybrid electric propulsion system; and a joint CFM effort to develop and fly an advanced, open fan demonstrator called RISE, short for Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines. The goal of the RISE Program is to achieve at least 20% lower fuel consumption and CO\u2082 emissions compared to today\u2019s most efficient engines.\n\nAt the same time, we have a significant opportunity to improve the efficiency of the engines already in operation. This includes continued work to advance technologies that will enable a much larger supply of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which offers up to 80% less lifecycle carbon emissions than traditional jet fuel. In December, we partnered with United Airlines to power the world\u2019s first flight using SAF, which resulted in 80% less lifecycle carbon emissions than traditional jet fuel. In 2021, the global aviation industry committed to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Achieving that goal will require broad cooperation and significant investment across all sectors of the industry. As the propulsion provider for three of every four commercial departures, we are energized by the opportunity and responsibility to lead the way forward.\n\nHow we operate is just as important as maturing new technologies, and we are fully committed to our goal of being carbon neutral in our operations and facilities worldwide by 2030. To reach this goal, we are moving on multiple fronts, including upgrading buildings to more energy efficient heating and cooling systems, seeking lower carbon energy sources to power our sites and using lean practices to reduce waste\u2014not only in our manufacturing processes but also to reduce unnecessary lighting, electricity, water and other resource usage. Additionally, we are exploring the use of SAF in our engine and component test facilities.\n\nAs these efforts show, meeting our sustainability goals have become an even bigger part of our business strategy over the last year. Our annual business priorities shared with all employees include targets for reaching our goals of carbon neutral operations, engineering, commercial engine programs, government affairs and others. This group meets twice a month to look at managing resources to support these efforts, discuss opportunities for collaboration across the aviation industry and incorporate learnings to better support our customers in their own efforts to reduce flight CO\u2082 emissions.\n\nWe are able to undertake these efforts today because of the underlying strength of our business. We benefit enormously from the decisions on technologies and partnerships made by the generations of proud GE Aviation employees who preceded us, and we are paying that forward with our commitment to decarbonization.\n\nOur technologies today\n\nAt GE Aviation, we never stop innovating. As one of the world\u2019s largest suppliers of aircraft engines, systems and services, GE Aviation continues to lead the industry in developing technologies to reduce CO\u2082 emissions from flight. To that end, GE spent $1.6 billion in research and development in 2021, including emissions-reducing aviation technologies while continuing to put safety first.\n\nThis commitment to innovation and investment over decades has led to the following engines, services and software available now to reduce CO\u2082 emissions from the existing fleet in service:\n\n**ENGINES**\n\nFrom the GE9X, which is the culmination of our decade-long commercial product renewal, to the GE Passport and Catalyst business and general aviation engines, to the T901 and T408 turboshafts for military helicopters, we have the industry\u2019s broadest array of advanced engines.\n\nOur newest engines are designed to offer better fuel efficiency and lower CO\u2082 emissions than their predecessors with advances in engine architecture, aerodynamics and advanced materials. Technologies such as Ceramic Matrix Composites and additive manufacturing have led to lighter parts with higher capabilities. As a result, today\u2019s commercial aircraft engines consume 40% less fuel compared to engines manufactured in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n**A LEGACY OF INNOVATION FOR IMPROVED FUEL EFFICIENCY**\n\n| SINGLE-AISLE AIRCRAFT | TWIN-AISLE AIRCRAFT | LARGE TWIN-AISLE AIRCRAFT | REGIONAL AIRCRAFT | TURBOPROP AIRCRAFT |\n|-----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| **DECREASE**          | **DECREASE**        | **DECREASE**             | **DECREASE**     | **DECREASE**      |\n| in fuel consumption   | in fuel consumption | in fuel consumption      | in fuel consumption | in fuel consumption |\n| from the single-aisle | from the twin-aisle | from the large twin-aisle| from the regional | from competing, legacy |\n| CFM56-7B to LEAP      | CF6-80C2 to GE9X    | CF6-115B to GE9X         | jet CF34-3 to GE\u2019s Passport | turboprop engines |\n| engine                | engine              | engine                   | engine           | available today    |\n| 15%                   | 15%                 | 10%                      | 17%              | 20%               |\n\n**SYSTEMS**\n\nGE Aviation\u2019s Systems business continues to bring additional efficiencies to aircraft performance. These technologies include power generation, conversion and distribution systems focused on electrification, avionics solutions that optimize flight paths, and more efficient and quieter integrated propulsion systems.\n\n**SERVICES**\n\nGE\u2019s 360 Foam Wash is an advanced on-wing cleaning technology with a proprietary detergent to help ensure that engines continue to operate efficiently. In the Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions, GE\u2019s 360 Foam Wash has been found to improve engine performance by reducing build-up of deposits in the engine, lowering engine exhaust temperatures and improving engine compressor efficiency. These improvements led to reduced fuel consumption, lower CO\u2082 emissions and increased engine time on wing. GE\u2019s 360 Foam Wash is approved for use on multiple GE engine programs, including models of GE9X, GE90, CF34 and CF6, as well as Engine Alliance\u2019s GP7200 engines.\n\nToward a more circular economy, we also consider the lifecycle of our engines. Currently, there are more than 21,000 total repairs in our catalogs to restore worn GE and CFM engine parts to serviceable conditions. Additionally, GE and CFM industrialized more than 1,500 repairs in 2021, increasing repair capability. As a result, GE maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities globally repaired approximately 2.5 million engine components in 2021 using these industrialized processes. Additionally, our used serviceable material business purchases used engines and parts, performs necessary inspections and repairs, and facilitates return of serviceable parts into the aviation industry. When metal parts are no longer repairable, they are recycled when possible.\n\n---\n\n* CFM International is a 50-50 joint company between GE and Safran Aircraft Engines\n\n1 2021 GE, customer and partner funded R&D\n2 Engine Alliance is a 50-50 joint company between GE and Pratt & Whitney\nSAF TESTING AND DEMONSTRATION\n\nGE Aviation\u2019s extensive SAF testing and demonstration efforts include the following industry firsts for the use of SAF in at least one engine:\n\n| Year | SAF Demonstrations |\n|------|--------------------|\n| 2008 | Flight Management System (FMS) powered by SAF blends since 2011 |\n| 2011 | Flight Management System (FMS) powered by SAF blends since 2011 |\n| 2016 | Flight Management System (FMS) powered by SAF blends since 2011 |\n| 2018 | Flight Management System (FMS) powered by SAF blends since 2011 |\n| 2021 | Flight Management System (FMS) powered by SAF blends since 2011 |\n\n*Engine Alliance is a 50-50 joint company between GE and Pratt & Whitney.\n*Air Transport Action Group: https://aviationbenefits.org/environmental-efficiency/climate-action/sustainable-aviation-fuel/.\n*CFM International is a 50-50 joint company between GE and Safran Aircraft Engines.\nOur breakthrough technologies for the future\n\nGE Aviation is already at work today to develop breakthrough technologies for the benefit of us all tomorrow, such as advanced new engine architectures like open fan, hybrid electric propulsion and hydrogen fuel combustion.

As these pages show, GE Aviation\u2019s investments toward decarbonization technologies are uniquely diverse. GE is innovating these technologies both for our customers and for the planet as we work to play a leadership role in the aviation sector meeting its 2050 net zero goals.\n\nIn 2021, GE announced an ambition to be a net zero company by 2050, for its own products and for the most impactful and relevant emissions category given the nature of our businesses. Working with external advisors and experts over the course of 2021, we further refined our focus to power trains and aircraft engines, which account for the majority of GE\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions across all reporting scopes. By focusing Aviation efforts on reducing Scope 3 use of sold products emissions, we will more effectively deliver the type of technology breakthroughs our customers are relying on to achieve their own net zero ambitions.\n\nIn working to lead the development of the technology for the aviation sector, we are informed by the role of aviation for sustainable development and broader industry trends. Aviation and the ability to travel are essential to sustainable development and building a world that everyone should have the right to stay connected to family, friends, job opportunities, healthcare, and other essential benefits. In addition, sustainable aviation is essential to support the Paris Agreement and reduce aviation sector emissions to the level needed to reach net zero emissions by 2050; there are clearly some big challenges ahead.\n\nBoth the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and ATAG\u2019s \u201cWays to Zero\u201d report have identified a multi-path approach to reach the target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. IATA suggests that the industry will need to reduce 1.8 gigatons of carbon in 2050 to achieve net zero. Clearly no single solution is capable of delivering this level of CO2 emissions reduction.\n\nAll industry participants \u2014 airlines, airports, aerospace manufacturers, fuel providers, governments, and more \u2014 have a role to play. Aerospace manufacturers are working to provide aviation advancements that deliver aircraft and engines that generate significantly less CO2 emissions with capability to operate with both blended and 100% alternate fuels. Airlines and airports need to work together to drive improvements like electrification of ground handling operations. Fuel providers, both traditional and new entrants, need to invest to develop and bring sustainable fuels to the marketplace at volume. Aviation authorities need to promulgate regulations in a timely fashion that provide clear certification approaches for new and emerging technologies. Governments need to provide the right incentives to drive investment and adoption of new technologies. Initiatives like the Single European Sky initiative to streamline air traffic management. Governments and private industry also have key roles to play in supporting development of new infrastructure needed to support alternative fuels.\n\nAs described above, at GE Aviation, we are working on technologies to improve engine fuel efficiency and support the development of alternative fuels compatible with GE engines with our unparalleled engineering and innovation know-how. We are also advancing the breakthrough innovations and ideas that will help the whole industry move even faster.\n\n**OUR NET ZERO PRINCIPLES**\n\nAs one of the world\u2019s leading companies in the aviation sector, we know that the challenge is complex and we have to be nimble and committed as a company and with our partners to innovate the technology to succeed. We have several principles that are guiding our approach to our net zero ambitions:\n\n- **Credibility:** Knowing this path will take decades, we prioritize credibility first and foremost with our stakeholders to share what we objectively know and don\u2019t know. This also means we get better and more credible information, we will share that with our stakeholders.\n- **Continuous learning:** Our analysis below is based on how we see things today. We are committed to continuous learning to enable more insights and opportunities to make a difference, and we expect to make progress over time.\n- **Collaboration:** We know no one company can solve these issues alone. With GE\u2019s spirit of humility, we welcome continued collaborations with our customers, investors, regulators, and peers to achieve success toward our goals. We summarize several of these key collaborations on page 31.\n- **Commitment to innovation and technology:** Simply stated, GE\u2019s role in the sector\u2019s path toward net zero is to deliver state of the art technology today to make progress while innovating the breakthrough technologies for tomorrow. Below, we synthesize the previous eight pages regarding how we see various technologies contributing toward this pathway.\n\nApplying these principles, we consider three pathways toward the net zero ambition.\n\n1. **BUILDING ON SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM PAST ACTION**\n\nGE Aviation is a leader in the aviation industry\u2019s path to net zero carbon emissions with evolutionary, state of the art technology today and investments in revolutionary, breakthrough technologies for tomorrow. GE\u2019s legacy has been to innovate technology the world needs to improve the efficiency, reliability, and safety of civil aviation to lift up the quality of life for people everywhere.\n\nFrom the GE9X, which is the culmination of our decade-long commercial product renewal, to the GE Passport and Catalyst business and general aviation engines, to the T700 and T408 turboshafts for military helicopters, we have the industry\u2019s broad array of advanced engines offering better fuel efficiency and lower CO2 emissions than their predecessors with advances in engine architecture, materials, and Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMCs) that are lighter than traditional metal alloys, and more heat resistant, allowing engines made with CMCs to operate at higher temperatures with less cooling air. Additive Manufacturing (AM) has led to lighter engine parts with higher capabilities and more complex designs than parts made by conventional manufacturing methods. Including engine technology introduced by GE and CPM International in the last decade for commercial aircraft, engines manufactured today consume 40% less fuel and emit 40% less CO2 compared to engines manufactured in the 1970s.\n\n**NEW UNIT CARBON INTENSITY**\n\nEstimated net carbon intensity of regional, narrow-body and wide-body commercial engines installed on aircraft delivered by GE (g CO2/Revenue Passenger Kilometers (RPK))\n\n| Year | New, net units, relative |\n|------|-------------------------|\n| 2020 | 6.55                     |\n| 2021 | 5.73                     |\n\n2. **DRIVING CONTINUED PROGRESS THIS DECADE**\n\nThe aviation sector is uniquely united toward a net zero future. After GE announced our ambition in 2021 to be a net zero company by 2050, GE Aviation supported a similar 2050 goal set by Air Transport Action Group (ATAG) for net zero carbon emissions from flight. Also in 2021, GE Aviation\u2019s Chief Technology Officer, Dr. John Strickland, was one of the first Chief Technology Officers from across the industry to call for continued focus on sustainability in the aviation sector and to continue advancing state-of-the-art in aircraft and engine design to reduce carbon emissions. GE Aviation has joined the International Aerospace Environmental Group (IAEG) to support development of standards for reporting Scope 3 use of sold products emissions across the aerospace industry. These standards will help GE measure in a way that is consistent with other aviation stakeholders how the carbon intensity of our engines is reduced over time through introduction of new technologies and services that reduce emissions.\n\nIn terms of technology and innovation, implementation of the next level step breakthrough technology will be paced by the evolution of new airframe and engine technology, and the pace will be given the sector\u2019s unique considerations relating to safety, reliability, and the physics of aviation. Over the next decade, GE expects to continue collaboration with others in our industry to drive operational improvements and increased availability and use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) while investing in new engine technologies to drive further reductions in the future.\n\nGE has never been more focused on innovating technology to solve one of the world\u2019s most pressing sustainability challenges: keeping people connected while reducing climate impacts. To that end, GE spent $1.6 billion on aviation research and development in 2021, including emissions-reducing aviation technologies while continuing to put safety first.\n\nGE Aviation is also investing in and supporting technologies that can be quickly adopted to further reduce aviation carbon emissions from the global fleet of engines in service.\n\nTechnologies we see having impact this decade include:\n\n- **SAF** has been shown to provide reduction in overall CO2 lifecycle emissions up to 80% compared to fossil fuels. And SAF made by new approaches that convert renewable energy to liquid fuel has the potential to eliminate lifecycle CO2 emissions. Currently, SAF approved for use is a blend of petroleum-based Jet A or Jet K-1 fuel and a SAF component with a maximum blend limit of 50%. One of GE\u2019s fuel experts chairs an international task force developing standardization industry specifications supporting adoption of 100% drop-in SAF, which does not require blending with conventional jet fuel. Increased availability and use of SAF is critical to reduce emissions in the existing fleet of installed aircraft engines and future fleets. That\u2019s why GE Aviation is advocating for incentives that encourage greater development across the supply chain to make SAF more affordable and available compared to conventional jet fuel. For example, GE Aviation has joined the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), an independent, international non-profit organization helping develop market for SAF and helping ensure SAF feedstock is responsibly sourced.\n\nGE\u2019s proprietary 360\u00b0 FUEL WASH is an advanced on-wing cleaning technology to help ensure that engines continue to operate efficiently. In the Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions, GE\u2019s 360\u00b0 Fuel Wash has been found to significantly improve engine performance by reducing build-up of deposits in the engine, lowering engine exhaust temperatures, and improving engine compressor efficiency. These improvements lead to reduced fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions. GE\u2019s 360\u00b0 Fuel Wash is approved for use on multiple GE engine programs, including models of GE9X, GE90, CF6 and CF34, as well as Engine Alliance\u2019s (EA) CF700 engines.\n\n**GE DIGITAL** has developed a suite of software applications to help aircraft operators reduce CO2 emissions and drive operational efficiencies. For example, GE\u2019s Insight\u00ae offers a flight analytics tool that helps airline pilots improve safety and operational decision-making, including recommendations for fuel savings. Fuel Insight helps airlines identify areas of opportunity to improve their fuel consumption, while Airspace Insight offers flight path design and maintenance to assist aircraft operators in ensuring routes are optimally designed to minimize time, fuel, and emissions.\n\n**GE\u2019s proprietary 360\u00b0 FUEL WASH is an advanced on-wing cleaning technology to help ensure that engines continue to operate efficiently.**\n3. INNOVATING FOR THE FUTURE\n\nGE Aviation is investing now in the technology needed to reduce both indirect and absolute emissions toward net zero by 2050. Knowing that there is no one-size-fits-all solution, GE is investing in a diverse portfolio of future technologies across the aviation sector, and intends to advance technologies in the near, mid, and longer term. This is some of the world\u2019s most complex technology, and we are focused today on the innovation that\u2019s going to be needed for the future.\n\nFor the technologies below, we are focused on three general phases for their development. Today, we are working in our labs and research centers on the advancement of the concepts and theories. In the middle of this decade, we aspire to start flight testing these technologies. We look to the middle of the 2030s as the likely time for introducing these technologies commercially.\n\nOPEN FAN\n\nThe open fan design is one of the advanced engine architectures CFM is exploring through the CFM RISE (Revolutionary Innovation for introducing these technologies commercially. The open fan design is one of the advanced engine architectures research centers on the advancement of the concepts and theories for their development. Today, we are working in our labs and research centers on the advancement of the concepts and theories. In the middle of this decade, we aspire to start flight testing these technologies. We look to the middle of the 2030s as the likely time for introducing these technologies commercially.\n\nAVIATION INDUSTRY VIEW OF ENERGY OPTIONS THAT COULD CONTRIBUTE TO CO2 REDUCTION\n\nConsistent with our collaboration principle above, GE knows that it will take partnership to succeed for net zero for the aviation sector. GE serves on the Board of the Air Transport Action Group (ATAG), which produced a Waypoint 2050 report addressing scenarios for the aviation sector toward net zero. GE\u2019s innovation and technology\u2014SAF, hybrid electric, and hydrogen\u2014described on these pages is core to the technical opportunities ATAG and the industry are identifying.\n\n| IMPACTS | ACTIONS | 2020-2030 | 2030-2050 | 2050-2070 |\n|---------|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| 40% reduction in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions compared to engines manufactured in 1970s and 1980s | Building on substantial contributions from past action | Driving continued progress this decade. | Innovating for the future. |\n\nGE AVIATION: 2050 SCOPE 3 NET ZERO AMBITION FOR SOLD PRODUCTS\n\n| CONTRIBUTING FACTORS | ACTIONS | 2020-2030 | 2030-2050 | 2050-2070 |\n|----------------------|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| More fuel-efficient commercial engine products certified GE Passport, GE9X, CFM LEAP, GE9X | Building on substantial contributions from past action | Driving continued progress this decade. | Innovating for the future. |\n| Lighter-weight advanced composite materials vs. metal parts replaced | Support 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel approval and adoption | Advocacy and industry partnering for wider SAF availability and adoption | Power to Liquid SAF |\n| More heat-resistant Ceramic Matrix Composites vs. metal alloys | Increased deployment of GE Digital, Aviation Software including FlightPulse\u00ae, Fuel Insight, and Airspace Insight | Increased use of additively-manufactured and Ceramic Matrix Composite engine parts | Compact engine core |\n| Lighter-weight, optimized part designs from additive manufacturing vs. conventional manufacturing | All GE and joint venture engines can operate on approved Sustainable Aviation Fuel | Flight Management System for optimized airport descent | Three-stream engine architecture |\n\nSOURCE: ATAG Waypoint 2050 https://aviationbenefits.org/environmental-efficiency/climate-action/waypoint-2050/\nGE Research is our innovation engine where the path to a more sustainable planet is being created today.

We have a highly contemporized research model that is externally facing and market-tested. Through GE\u2019s businesses and customers, we understand firsthand the needs of our industries and have direct channels to market with new solutions. We also continue to grow our network of external partnerships with industries and have direct channels to market with new solutions.\n\nWe\u2019re working with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to develop new vaccine production technology to more rapidly respond to future viral threats. And we\u2019re making significant progress with a new non-invasive therapy using ultrasound that could one day reverse or prevent the onset of diabetes.\n\nFor the future of flight, we\u2019re integrating our deep expertise in electrical systems and propulsion technologies to support GE Aviation\u2019s efforts to advance hybrid electric propulsion, hydrogen combustion, and promote the adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).\n\nNEW CAGE (CLIMATE ACTION@GE) LAB LAUNCHED TO REVOLUTIONIZE CARBON CAPTURE\n\nGE Research recently launched the CAGE Lab and a new carbon capture breakthrough team to develop and deploy cutting-edge solutions to decarbonize the power sector and even pull carbon directly from the atmosphere itself. The carbon capture breakthrough team is driving a unique approach in direct air capture (DAC), which is bringing together GE\u2019s special expertise in thermal management, 3D design and innovative materials to remove carbon from the air. The goal is nothing short of enabling an economical, large-scale solution for helping customers and companies achieve their decarbonization and climate goals.\n\nPOWERING UP THE WORLD\u2019S FIRST LARGE FLEXIBLE TRANSFORMER\n\nIn partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy, our business partner, Prolec GE, and utility partner, Cooperative Energy, have teamed up to develop and install the world\u2019s first large flexible transformer at the utility\u2019s substation in Columbia, Mississippi. The flexible transformer represents the next generation of hardware required to manage a rapidly changing grid. It will support higher penetrations of renewable power coming online, improve its resiliency through better fault management, frequency and voltage regulation, and ease the supply chain for utilities by serving as a universal spare for a wide range of transformers operating at different voltage levels. This technology is poised to replace an aging U.S. transformer fleet, with more than 70% older than 25 years and around 10% already exceeding the average life expectancy of 40 years.\n\nDEVELOPING FUNDAMENTAL BUILDING BLOCKS OF HYBRID ELECTRIC FLIGHT\n\nGE Research\u2019s hybrid electric aviation team has been developing the fundamental components of hybrid electric flight for nearly two decades. In addition to supporting GE Aviation\u2019s $260 million hybrid electric flight demonstrator project with NASA, the team is partnering with the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy (ARPA-E) on three projects to develop the power train, power generation system and cabling, to enable a carbon neutral hybrid electric propulsion system that is suitable for supporting a 150-200 seat narrow body commercial airplane.\nHow GE operates to succeed in our mission\n\nAt GE, we focus not just on what we do, but how we do it. We are guided by an active and engaged Board of Directors, with leadership that sets the example of a culture of integrity that is core to everything we do.\n\nAs we continue work developing our plans to form three independent, industry leaders with sustainability at their core, we continue to develop and deliver products and services for important growth sectors in energy, healthcare and aviation, which are critical to building a world that works.\n\nA key element of our sustainability strategy is to implement lean management principles across the enterprise to drive continuous improvement for purposeful outcomes. And we continue to invest in our people, one of our most valuable assets.\n\nBoard oversight\n\nThe Board of Directors (Board) sets the tone from the top for GE\u2019s culture. GE\u2019s Board has oversight responsibility for management\u2019s establishment and execution of corporate strategy. The Board also provides independent risk oversight, with a focus on the most significant risks facing the Company. The Board\u2019s Governance and Public Affairs Committee (Governance Committee) strives to maintain an independent Board with broad and diverse experience and judgment that is committed to representing the long-term interests of our stakeholders.\n\nWhen selecting and recruiting director candidates, the Governance Committee considers a wide range of factors, including:\n\n- Ensuring an experienced, qualified Board with high personal integrity and character, and expertise in areas relevant to GE.\n- Enhancing the Board\u2019s diversity of backgrounds, specifically attributes such as race, ethnicity, gender, cultural background and professional experience.\n- Complying with regulatory requirements and the Board\u2019s independence guidelines.\n\nAs we look to our plan to form three industry-leading companies, the Governance committee will seek director candidates whose experiences support each company\u2019s future strategy and industry focus, with the goal of creating dedicated boards of directors with deep domain expertise.\n\nThe Board recognizes that the long-term interests of the Company require responsibly addressing the concerns of stakeholders beyond just shareholders, including employees, recruits, customers, suppliers, communities, government officials and the public at large.\n\nThe Board oversees the execution of GE\u2019s sustainability priorities and initiatives as an integrated part of the Company\u2019s overall strategy and risk management. Matters related to sustainability often span multiple functional categories and areas of oversight, and therefore involve discussion at the full Board level as well as individual committees.\n\nIn that regard, relevant focus areas for the Board in 2021 included:\n\n- Safety. Health and safety of employees and communities, including GE\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n- Energy Transition. Strategy for the energy transition.\n- Climate change. GE\u2019s ambition and goals related to greenhouse gas emission reductions from customers\u2019 use of sold products.\n- Enterprise Risk Management. Primary risks and opportunities across GE\u2019s businesses related to climate change and other sustainability matters.\n\nThe Governance Committee also plays an important role in GE\u2019s sustainability oversight, and has primary oversight of GE\u2019s policies and strategies related to climate change management, political spending and lobbying, human rights; environment, health and safety; and external reporting on sustainability matters. For example, the Governance Committee receives a standing update on safety incidents throughout GE at each meeting. The Audit Committee also has a role in sustainability matters to the extent these topics relate to financial reporting and regulatory requirements, including reporting on these matters in SEC filings and data quality related to this reporting.\n\nBoard oversight of public policy and lobbying\n\nThe Governance Committee, composed solely of independent directors, oversees the Company\u2019s political spending and lobbying activities, including external reporting on such activities. This includes political and campaign contributions as well as any contributions to trade associations and other tax-exempt and similar organizations that may engage in political activity. The Governance Committee is responsible for the following:\n\n- Policy oversight. A yearly review of GE\u2019s political spending policies and lobbying practices.\n- Budget oversight. Approval of GE\u2019s annual budget for political activities.\n- Reporting. Reviewing semi-annual updates on political spending, both through Company expenditures and through the employee-managed political action committee (GE PAC).\n\nGE currently discloses the names of all trade associations receiving more than $50,000 from the Company, including the portion of the Company\u2019s payment used for lobbying or political expenditures, as well as any contributions to 501(c)(4)s, beginning with contributions made in 2018. GE\u2019s political spending has declined in recent years, and in 2021 GE Company did not contribute any corporate funds to political campaigns, committees or candidates for public office. In this year\u2019s Sustainability Report, we are also providing a description of how GE\u2019s climate lobbying activities align with the goals of the Paris Agreement, see pages 98-103.\nBoard focus on climate change\n\nThe energy transition and climate change have been significant areas of focus at the Board level. At its meetings throughout 2021, the Board regularly reviewed climate change-related risks and opportunities across GE\u2019s business. The Board is actively engaged with GE leadership on related topics such as the competitive landscape for our businesses amidst climate-related shifts in technology, product and service demand; analysis of potential pathways for decarbonization; customer, shareholder and other stakeholder expectations; the Company\u2019s decarbonization strategy; and reducing the environmental impact of GE\u2019s own operations and customers\u2019 use of our sold products. For example, the Board discussed and helped shape decisions such as setting a goal for GE to become carbon neutral by 2030 in our own operations, our ambition to be net zero in 2050 including emissions from sold products and the exit from the new-build coal business. This focus is also reflected in the Board\u2019s Governance Principles and committee charters, which the Board recently revised to more expressly highlight its role in the oversight of sustainability and climate change-related matters.\n\nLong Ridge Energy Terminal and GE commissioned and demonstrated the first advanced class hydrogen-burning power plant worldwide using GE\u2019s HA Gas Turbine.\n\nHOW GE ENGAGES WITH ITS STAKEHOLDERS\n\nEMPLOYEES\n- Regular Company- or business-wide emails and videos from senior leadership, including a monthly video blog insideESG@GE for GE employees\n- Leadership town halls, discussions and educational webinars, including opportunities for questions and answers\n- Open reporting and ombuds system\n- Engagement and culture survey\n- Performance management system \u201cPeople, Performance and Growth\u201d\n\nINVESTORS\n- Strong commitment to transparency\u2014communicate strategic, operational and financial results and progress on priorities\n- Quarterly earnings conference calls open to investors and available on our website\n- Annual investor days\n- Participation in sell-side conference presentations\n- Annual meeting of shareholders\n- Investor relations newsletters and website\n- Regular meetings with large institutional investors and other shareholders, including governance engagement\n\nCUSTOMERS\n- Meetings with senior executives at the business and corporate level\n- Engagement strategy driven by business leadership depending on industry\n\nREGULATORS/GOVERNMENT AGENCIES\n- Pursuit of \u201chonest broker\u201d relationships with government stakeholders to promote collaborative, win-win outcomes on sustainability and environmental issues\n- Strong partnership on domestic and global stage in pursuit of climate change and sustainability goals and policies\n- Commitment to regulatory compliance and strong performance\n- Engagement to support decision makers in sustainability goals, including climate change and decarbonization\n- For details on GE activities and partnerships in support of government goals and climate change policies, see pages [86-103]\n\nCOMMUNITIES\n- GE locations empowered to support charitable organizations based on the needs of the local community\n- GE Volunteers, giving back to the communities where GE people live and work\n- GE Foundation, committed to transforming our communities and shaping the diverse workforce of tomorrow by leveraging the power of GE\n- Outreach and meaningful participation with local communities and stakeholders on decisions with broader impact\n\nSUPPLIERS\n- Commitment to an ethical supply chain program and Supplier Integrity Guide for suppliers\n- Communication and training to all suppliers on compliance and integrity expectations\n- Onboarding engagement assessment and manufacturing site review\n- For direct material suppliers in higher risk countries under the Supplier Responsibility Governance program, more extensive engagement at onboarding, including site audit and continued communication and assessment during their time as a GE supplier\n- Access to GE\u2019s open reporting and ombuds system\n\nFor more information, see GE\u2019s 2022 Proxy Statement here.\nIntegrated approach to strategy, risk and sustainability\n\nOur Company strategy focuses on what is needed to build a sustainable world that works.\n\nEnergy transition, precision health, future of flight\u2014these are critical challenges facing our world, and GE has a meaningful role to play in providing global solutions for each. Over the last several years, as we considered opportunities and risks across our businesses and industries, we have sharpened and standardized our focus on the external dynamics\u2014including markets, customers, competitors, and changes in the regulatory environment\u2014that form the context of our strategic decisions. And in the spirit of Kaizen\u2014continuous improvement\u2014our standardized strategy and risk processes force us to regularly revisit our assumptions and processes so we can adapt as the external environment changes and learn from our mistakes.\n\nIn a world where we will never have perfect information or complete control, our strengthened programs and processes are designed so that the Company makes decisions in a structured, objective manner, and with an appropriate view for the long term.\n\nSustainability is integrated with strategy development and risk management across the Company. GE\u2019s sustainability lens is used to focus on operations and priorities within each business, and cross-functional committees and teams at the leadership level align strategic priorities and culture.\n\nGE\u2019s enterprise risk management framework\n\nOur enterprise risk management framework informs the process for long-term strategy reviews that each business undertakes annually. Operationally, this framework also informs our delegations of authority and commercial underwriting, which take into account a range of risks such as strategic alignment, supply chain, inflation, cybersecurity, and country and counterparty risk. Our businesses all assess their top risks against a consistent framework each quarter. The process requires the business to:\n\n- define and identify enterprise risks;\n- prioritize the top risks and opportunities; and\n- assess existing action plans to mitigate risk.\n\nThe process also requires the business to identify owners at each stage of the process, instilling business ownership throughout the risk assessment process. At the Corporate level, the Corporate Risk Working Group\u2014a small group of key functional leaders, as well as the Chief Risk Officer\u2014meets quarterly to assess enterprise-wide risks as well. The Audit Committee oversees GE\u2019s enterprise risk management framework and receives a quarterly enterprise risk report from the Chief Risk Officer. GE business leaders also periodically review their risk management programs and top risks with the Audit Committee, and it is the business CEOs\u2014rather than a compliance or legal professional\u2014who lead discussions with the Audit Committee to provide strong business accountability for risk management. In addition, each business CEO meets regularly with the Board to review their strategies and operations. Our Governance Principles and committee charters define the risk areas for which each committee has ongoing oversight responsibility, while the Board, as a whole, focuses on the most significant risks facing the Company.\n\nWe periodically review a range of actual and projected metrics in assessing these types of risks and opportunities, including new unit equipment sales, power generation by asset type, levelized cost of energy, levelized cost of storage, fuel prices (including natural gas and hydrogen), pricing for mandatory and voluntary carbon offsets or credits, and internal and external modeling. Our consideration of top climate-related risks and opportunities also feeds into our annual long-term strategy review process, during which our businesses evaluate a handful of key questions related to their long-term strategies.\n\nIn our strategy development, we seek to build on GE\u2019s strengths in both innovating technologies and solutions to continue driving the global energy transition and creating resilience in our businesses\u2019 strategies to adapt to potential transition risks from the range of potential pathways for decarbonization and other factors that could significantly affect GE\u2019s approach in the decades ahead.\n\nWe seek to continuously improve our processes to identify, assess and respond to these types of climate-related opportunities and risks, as this remains central to the strategy for our businesses.\n\nOperationalizing and improving GE\u2019s sustainability efforts through the Sustainability Council\n\nIn 2021, GE made a further organizational commitment to elevate its broader sustainability strategy with the appointment of GE\u2019s first Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO). This position coordinates efforts by our business leaders, engineers and strategic thinkers to ensure we improve our impacts to our communities, people and planet in measurable and meaningful ways. The CSO also supports efforts for GE\u2019s technology and innovation to address the pressing global challenges addressed in this report.\n\nIn 2021, GE\u2019s Chief Sustainability Officer convened a business-wide Sustainability Council staffed by each GE business and corporate function. The Sustainability Council meets weekly and focuses internally and externally on these overarching goals:\n\n- ensuring progress toward delivering on GE\u2019s sustainability commitments;\n- improving and installing operational programs to address gaps in GE\u2019s sustainability programs; and\n- building strong and independent ESG programs and operations for each business prior to their separation from GE so that sustainability is core to the new businesses on day one.\n\nThe Sustainability Council partners with a diverse range of external stakeholders to deliver on our commitments, improve our programs and prepare for the separation. These efforts and progress are reflected in this report.\n\nCore to the Sustainability Council\u2019s work was engaging in an ESG issues assessment with our internal and external stakeholders for GE Company and each business, described below. This provides an overarching blueprint on how our priorities align with our stakeholders.\n\nRegarding delivering on our commitments, each business provided a quarterly update on progress toward greenhouse gas Scope 1 and 2 reduction goals (pages 92-93) and ongoing progress on innovating the technology toward Scope 3 goals (pages 33-35 and 50-53). In terms of gaps, we assessed that we could do a stronger job communicating our programs that drive product safety and quality (pages 66-69), as well as strengthen sustainability considerations in the stewardship of product design (pages 104-106). We will continue to improve operations and programs in these areas as described below to position the businesses for leadership on these topics at core on day one of their independent operations.\n\nBeyond the Sustainability Council, sustainability at GE is the ultimate team effort, with GE\u2019s employees united in realizing the success of our mission. The CSO helps GE accelerate outcomes by promoting closer collaboration between GE\u2019s leaders and governments, policy makers, NGOs, our investors, communities and peers. The CSO also coordinates efforts to operationalize GE\u2019s sustainability efforts by approaching sustainability with the same high expectations of rigor and accountability that we use to run our businesses, using lean principles and, as described in more detail in this report, continuously improving toward our goals.\n\nESG issues assessment for GE and each business\n\nCore to the efforts to ensure GE succeeds in its sustainability programs consistent with stakeholder expectations, in 2021 GE engaged in a broad internal and external stakeholder assessment for GE Company and the Aviation, Healthcare, Power and Renewable Energy businesses. The results of these assessments are helping to guide ESG and sustainability priorities and strategies with the benefit of input from our employees, customers, investors, NGOs and other stakeholders. We share the process and output below.\n\nGE conducted an assessment to develop a list of priority topics deemed relevant for sustainability strategy for each business unit, followed by interviews with internal and external stakeholders to validate and prioritize topics. Based on the insights gained, an ESG issues matrix was developed and the final list of high priority topics was reviewed against GE\u2019s latest reporting to identify potential gaps and provide recommendations for future reporting.\n\n**ESG issues assessment overview**\n\n1. **Develop initial list of key topics**\n   - Consolidate topics, external reporting frameworks, ESG rating agencies and peers\n\n2. **Stakeholder validation**\n   - Conduct interviews with internal and external stakeholders to identify the most impactful topics to GE\u2019s business units\n\n3. **Provide recommendations**\n   - Develop an ESG issues matrix and assess GE\u2019s existing reporting against the validated priority issues\nAcross four business units, GE used a combination of internal and external research to develop a list of initial topics deemed most impactful on its ESG strategy. This included, but was not limited to, the assessment of over 20 peer reports and analysis of key topics from frameworks and standards for eight different industries. Interviews with nearly 80 relevant internal and external stakeholders were used to refine and validate the initial topics.\n\n**RENEWABLE ENERGY & POWER**\n\nOperating in the same market and ecosystem, there is an unsurprising overlap between the most impactful ESG issues identified by the stakeholders of GE\u2019s Power and Renewable Energy businesses. Climate change remains a core issue to address across the Energy portfolio, and the businesses have a strong position to build from, both operationally and through product and strategy as they join forces as part of one leading energy company to tackle the world\u2019s biggest challenge. The ESG issues assessment also confirmed that the existing strong emphasis on governance and ethics, and protecting and supporting employees\u2019 safety and well-being, are fundamental for the path forward. Those strong cultural pillars will be even more important as we continue to bring leading energy transition technology forward. Our stakeholders care deeply about how we do that and highlight in their feedback that our emphasis on product design and lifecycle management as well as product quality and safety, are critical to prioritize across the Renewable Energy and Power businesses. With the evolution of a combined energy business portfolio, we look forward to the opportunity to take a more holistic approach to further strengthen programs in those areas, completely aligning with our ambition to advance our leading role in the energy transition.\n\n**HEALTHCARE**\n\nIn 2021, GE Healthcare conducted an assessment to identify the top impacts, risks and opportunities for our business across a wide landscape of ESG topic areas. The output of this assessment was leveraged to identify five focus areas: working to expand access to healthcare, mitigating our climate impact and improving resiliency; advancing the circular economy and environmental design; promoting diversity, equity and inclusion; and protecting patient data and cybersecurity. As preparations continue to become a public company, ESG is being integrated more deeply into the core of the culture and business by building upon these five focus areas, as well as the longstanding commitments to innovation, product quality and integrity.\n\n**AVIATION**\n\nClimate change, governance and ethics, and product quality and safety were the top issues identified by both internal and external stakeholders. This strong alignment is not a surprise given the nature of our business and the critical contribution of each to safe and more sustainable flight. Our commitment to each of these areas can be seen through our current activities. As an example, our commitment to climate change is clearly demonstrated in our commercial portfolio renewal (see page 43), efforts supporting sustainable aviation fuel (see page 44) and our focus on innovative breakthrough technologies (see page 48). This assessment also confirmed that our efforts focused on employee safety and well-being, data security, product design and lifecycle management (see page 104), talent management and engagement, and inclusion and diversity (see page 80) are indeed core to our continued success. We have made much progress in each of these areas, and remain committed to continuing to strengthen and expand our efforts to accelerate the pace of change in our business.\n\n**CORPORATE**\n\nThe GE Corporate assessment reinforces that GE\u2019s success on its climate change goals\u2014instilling a culture of ethics and compliance, and its safety focus\u2014are top priorities internally and externally where we must lead for success. As described above, we are taking stronger steps to communicate our commitment to product safety and quality, and to advance our programs on product stewardship. We share our stakeholders\u2019 interests in securing the highest standards on human rights, and a strong priority of diversity and inclusion, and separate reports detail our efforts and initiatives.\nLean is the way we run our businesses. It helps drive better execution and cultural change, all while enabling sustainable, long-term profitable growth. It is known as a set of principles that emphasizes customer focus, elimination of waste, high-quality growth, continuous improvement and ruthless prioritization of work. Lean is enabling our businesses to play more offense, deliver for our customers and lead in three key areas\u2014the energy transition, precision health and future of flight.\n\nLean principles also drive the execution of our sustainability strategy and help us address problems, examine processes, implement standard work and continuously improve the way we work.\n\nThe best way to see the power of lean in action is to go to the genba or \u201cwhere the work is done.\u201d This allows one to experience firsthand the process and to identify problems, then work to address those issues.\n\nThis is what the GE senior leadership team did in October 2021. The Company held a five-day immersive GE Kaizen Week at several GE locations around the globe with more than 1,600 employees going to genba and problem solving to improve on SQDC. During the week, several of the teams addressed chemical hazard, minimized suspended load hazards, working at heights hazards, organized workstations and improved ergonomics. True to the philosophy of continuous improvements, Kaizen events did not stop once the week ended. In fact, they are happening regularly across GE sites around the world.\n\nFor example, every time the team at GE Aviation\u2019s On Wing Support facility, near the city of Gimpo, South Korea, needs to hoist a LEAP engine into place for maintenance, they are required to attach a 187-pound, U-shaped hook to the engine. The team held a kaizen that resulted in a solution; while not high-tech, a wooden box serves as a base to keep the hooks in place and eliminates the need to move the almost 200-pound hook. This design delivers an annual savings in excess of $20,000 while also improving the overall safety of the process for GE workers.\n\nThis is just one example of how our teams are leveraging lean. They reflect how we\u2019re running GE better and how we\u2019re driving operational progress and lasting cultural change. There is more work to be done and lean is helping us get there.\n\nHow lean helps GE field crews fix power plant\n\nGE field crews completed more than 600 major outage jobs in more than 60 countries in 2021, each one lasting roughly two to six weeks. This is no easy task, given the size, weight and complexity of our gas turbines. When a power plant is scheduled to go offline, service crews at GE\u2019s FieldCore division typically gather, print and organize into binders thousands of pages specific to the technology they were summoned to service. Those documents then go to dozens of mechanics, millwrights and field engineers who fan out across the power plant. One copy typically sits in the job trailer, a temporary office that could be parked a quarter mile from the turbine deck where the work was taking place.\n\nThe process is vintage, cumbersome and inefficient, and FieldCore workers knew there had to be a better way. They used lean management to find it. The GE unit brought together cross-functional teams that included mechanics and engineers from around the world. They worked together in dozens of kaizen sessions to design a digital solution that would standardize procedures and make best practices scalable and reproducible at any site anywhere in the world, from Connecticut and China to Alberta and Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe result is Live Outage, a digital software system that makes everything field crews need accessible from portable devices in their hands, replacing the old-school binders and eliminating wasted time.\n\nThe system tracks project progress in real time with status bars for each of the hundreds of tasks that needs to be completed and automatically generates a daily project report. Live Outage also includes instruction checklists for each job type, as well as more than 3,000 photos and videos showing what parts look like and how to perform specific tasks.\n\nThis system has already been used at approximately 15 power plants around the U.S. He\u2019s also quick to stress that the team isn\u2019t finished with lean. FieldCore continues to collect user feedback so they keep improving Live Outage and further reduce waste and improve performance.\n\nGE\u2019s wind turbine plant in Florida is using continuous improvement to serve customers better\n\nWorkers at GE Renewable Energy\u2019s plant in Pensacola, Florida, make some of the most popular onshore wind turbines on the planet. GE\u2019s 2 MW onshore wind turbines. They are also among the first at GE to embrace lean using it to strengthen safety at the site, eliminate defects and improve on-time delivery. It has also become an integral part of their work. In 2021 alone, workers at the plant held more than a dozen kaizen exercises where they were seeking to find ways to make production more flexible and resilient. For example, during one of the kaizens, the team focused on improving \u201ctakt time\u201d\u2014the amount of time workers need to complete a task at an assembly station. Understanding the takt time, and pairing that with standard work, has provided the team with an understanding of the necessary steps, the number of workers and the number of parts needed to complete an assembly operation within a given period. This work helped the plant reduce the number of build-hours it takes to produce a turbine by 340 minutes and also shortened the time a turbine spends on the production line by 100 minutes, a 6% and 12% improvement, respectively. This improvement is helping the Renewable Energy team move the product along so it can be delivered to our customers to use to power homes around the world.\n\n\u201cEvery improvement leads to another. That\u2019s the lean way.\u201d\n\nEDUARDO OLIVIER\nSenior Process Improvement Manager, GE Renewable Energy\n\nOur Environment, Health and Safety teams work in close partnership with GE\u2019s lean leaders to improve safety, quality, delivery and cost (SQDC), in that order. This includes using lean to improve worker safety, eliminate hazardous waste, implement leader standard work, limit emissions, reduce our carbon footprint and deliver essential, life-enhancing products quickly and efficiently.\n\n\u201cLean is not about manufacturing. It\u2019s about everything we do at GE and using the tools in a way that gives us the opportunity to drive real change and real improvement that serves everybody.\u201d\n\n- LARRY CULP\nChairman and CEO, GE\nCEO, GE Aviation\n\nLEAN PRINCIPLES APPLIED TO SUSTAINABILITY\nOur strategy for continuous improvement and eliminating waste\n\nLEAN IS DRIVING IMPROVED TURNAROUND TIMES SUPPORTING OUR CUSTOMERS\n\nEmployees at GE Healthcare\u2019s Pharmaceutical Diagnostics unit in Cork, Ireland, are using Lean to expand manufacturing capacity by reducing turnarounds. During the GE Kaizen Week, October 2021, one of the teams focused on a filling line which places the product \u2014 contrast media solution that help doctors better image patients \u2014 into individual vials. Kaizen sessions discovered that the line was seeing around 45 hours of lost production time every week. They found the waste was a direct result of not having standard work, which was slowing down turnaround times. Together they created, tested, and implemented new standard work, including workflow and prep sequences. These new processes and standards have allowed them to control and plan turnarounds better and help save 15 hours per week. This expands production capacity by more than 2 million additional bottles of contrast media per year, supporting growing demand and enabling GE Healthcare to reach more patients.\nLean is foundational to how we work at GE. Safety, Quality, Delivery, Cost (SQDC)\u2014in that order\u2014help us deliver for our customers and build a world that works. These are not simply four metrics that we are regularly reporting on, but instead are our desired set of shared instincts. At no point will an improvement in quality, delivery or cost be done at the expense of safety. All of the GE businesses are committed to creating safe and effective products that meet the needs of our customers and are doing this through continuously working to improve product quality.\n\nDuring GE\u2019s 2022 Investor Day earlier this year, we shared how lean is helping to transform the Company. One of the factory tours was at GE Aviation in Greenville, South Carolina, a site that began its lean journey in 2019, where the team performs complex machining operations and detailed inspections on high pressure turbine blades. Focusing on reducing the site\u2019s blade delivery lead time, the team used 3P (Production Preparation Process) to improve the plant layout and create standard lines, which has improved part flow.\n\nBy optimizing the layout of the plant, the team was able to reduce lead time by 13 days and is working to continue to improve and reduce by an additional 12 days. Through their work, overall inventory has also been reduced. Lean is making an impact and is changing the way we work for the better.\n\nAcross all GE businesses, we are integrating SQDC in the design, manufacturing, testing, servicing and monitoring of all our products around the world. As we look ahead to forming three independent industry leaders with sustainability at their core, read how lean is making an impact and is changing the way each of our businesses work for the better.\n\n**Product safety and quality**\n\n**Aviation: Product safety & quality**\n\n**COMMITMENT TO SAFETY**\n\nGE Aviation has a strong product safety focus, including a voluntary Safety Management System (SMS) aligned with the UN\u2019s International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) SMS framework. GE\u2019s SMS was assessed and accepted by the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in December 2017 \u2013 the first such acceptance granted by the FAA for a Design & Manufacturing Company. Our SMS is founded on four key tenets:\n\n- **Policy** \u2013 embedding top down commitment to safety in policies and review rhythms\n- **Promotion** \u2013 creating a positive safety culture in the workforce through training, education, and awareness\n- **Risk management** \u2013 executing independent risk assessments per approved FAA process\n- **Assurance** \u2013 validating effectiveness of risk-control strategies in design, manufacturing, quality, and product performance\n\nInternally, we have an open reporting system that provides multiple paths to raise safety concerns backed by a Safety Program Management Team (SPMT) structure that ensures each and every potential safety concern is fully reviewed. Every product has a dedicated SPMT tasked with adjudicating potential safety concerns spanning all aspects of our products, including manufacturing, field performance, and maintenance and repair.\n\nOur safety commitment is further strengthened through our organizational structure that ensures the independence of the engineering organization. Product oriented engineering teams are separated from the engine product teams. Additionally, the Chief Engineer\u2019s Office serves as both a technical resource and an independent technical audit function.\n\nExternally, GE Aviation is recognized as a safety thought leader through partnering with regulators, other manufacturers, and key industry associations to develop strategies for enhancing overall propulsion safety and risk management approaches.\n\n**PRODUCT QUALITY**\n\nGE Aviation operates based on the guiding principle of Safety First / Quality Always. This principle is embedded in all of our operational rhythms and manufacturing systems. All new aircraft engine component parts are manufactured under a quality system approved by the FAA and certified to meet the most current aviation industry standards in AS9100D.\n\nUnderlying both the civil aviation regulatory approval and industry accreditation is the proactive Quality Framework, a unique strategic approach to driving a quality culture at GE Aviation designed to:\n\n- Create a zero-defect culture by setting processes right on Day 1 and managing change using an Advanced Product Quality Planning (APQP) toolkit.\n- Measure and mitigate risk using Predictive Quality Analytics (PQA) by focusing on leading indicators to impact Voice of the Customer.\n- Grow our people through a Quality Excellence Program (QEP) by a relentless focus on continuing education.\n\n**AVIATION\u2019S QUALITY EXCELLENCE PROGRAM**\n\nAs part of our quality focus, Aviation launched a Quality Excellence Program (QEP) to build domain expertise that is unique to the aviation industry through a combination of training, application and certification, and Controlled Title Holder (CTH) experts.\n\n- **LEVEL I \u2013 TRAINING** - Customized training including Root Cause & Corrective Actions (RCCA), Process Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (PFMEA), Advanced Product Quality Planning (APQP), and Six Sigma.\n- **LEVEL II \u2013 APPLICATION & CERTIFICATION** - Participants move from learners to leaders as they assume leadership roles in projects building on their training and perform product audits. Following completion of Level I training and a portfolio of Level II projects, candidates are eligible for QEP certification after a rigorous review process.\n- **CONTROLLED TITLE HOLDER (CTH) EXPERTS** - Subject matter expert candidates are nominated through our Technical Talent Review process for specific quality domain expertise areas such as manufacturing, regulatory compliance and quality systems. These individuals, following specialized mentoring and demonstrated broad project leadership, comprise our Quality CTH network and lead training, coaching, and consulting across the organization.\nHealthcare: Patient safety and customer satisfaction\n\nAbove all else, GE Healthcare is committed to creating safe and effective products that meet the needs of our customers and their patients and help health care providers solve the clinical, operational and economic challenges they face every day while improving patient outcomes.\n\nOur products and services are developed using a world-class quality system that addresses the needs of our customers in over 175 countries and is led by a team of experienced quality and regulatory professionals located in all major markets. Who we are and what we do are driven by an unyielding commitment to safety, integrity, compliance and quality.\n\nWe also maintain a Global Quality Policy applicable to every employee, establish and ensure management responsibility for operationally measuring ourselves against this policy, and have an appropriate organizational structure that ensures we have inputs, checks and balances for key decision making.\n\nMoreover, our quality system incorporates all applicable international quality and regulatory standards and requirements, including ISO 13485, US FDA 21 CFR parts 820 and 211, NMRA Decree 739, EU Medical Device Regulation, Eudralex Volume 4 GMP and all appropriate individual market regulatory requirements applicable to our products in the markets where we do business. We also participate in national and international trade associations and drive adoption of industry best practices within our organization.\n\nRenewable Energy & Power: Product safety & quality\n\nSafety and quality are paramount in the design, manufacturing, testing, servicing, and monitoring of our energy products around the world.\n\nRENEWABLE ENERGY SAFETY CULTURE\n\nOur Product Safety Quality Management System Procedure explains the process for internally reporting, resolving, closing and documenting product safety concerns and product safety issues. It provides the overall product safety framework for GE\u2019s energy portfolio and aims to eliminate unreasonable safety risks. The procedure aligns to GE\u2019s Corporate Environment, Health and Safety policy and is underpinned by internal standards and industry frameworks such as ISO, ANSI, IEC, IEEE and in some cases, U.S. Military standards. In addition, we follow internationally accepted principles of hazard assessment principles and tools, risk assessment and risk mitigation techniques. An example of how the quality management and safety policies work in practice is the requirement for reviewing Human Factors and EHS for all new designs of products and services. Engineers partner with their counterparts in EHS, field services, and manufacturing to consider the EHS impacts as well as aspects of serviceability and maintainability of the equipment throughout the product lifecycle. These additional considerations include factors that could potentially influence human performance in the field and impact for instance the design of equipment with regard to ergonomics and work station layout, work procedures, training, and communication or coordination of work activities.\n\nThe safety of our products, and the people who install and maintain them, is a top priority at GE Renewable Energy. All our employees and contractors are empowered to stop work when something appears to be unsafe. The businesses are on a journey to build a world class safety culture and work in different ways at all levels to ensure employees have the ability and skills to proactively identify future safety risks and develop plans to continue to better integrate safety into our daily work.\n\nRENEWABLE ENERGY COMMITMENT TO QUALITY\n\nGE Renewable Energy is also committed to delivering quality products on time with zero defects. In 2021, GE\u2019s Onshore and Offshore Wind businesses launched their Root Cause Analysis Quality Suite, a simplified, standardized and digital approach towards Root Cause Analysis allowing us to record and manage the process to correct, identify and remove recurring issues. Another area of focus was Supplier Quality. Our goal is to reduce GE and supplier defects by 60% across the next three years. We are launching a new Supplier Quality Management Board and a training webinar to improve quality across Renewable Energy.\n\ntesting capabilities include a wind tunnel equipped with advanced sensors measuring the aerodynamic properties on blade sections used to optimize the performance of the blade. Every new blade type is put through rigorous static and dynamic tests. In static test, the blade is subjected to extreme loads to validate their ability to withstand these loads. In dynamic test, the blade is put through an accelerated lifetime test, where the blade is exposed to changing loads for an average of 5 million oscillations to simulate the life span of the blade.\n\nCLINTON TEST FACILITY\n\nThe Clinton Test Facility in South Carolina is dedicated to mechanical testing of turbine rotor and hub system and subsystem components. This facility is unique as it has the capability to test the increasingly large wind components at full scale, accommodating very high loads. The main product of the testing facility is data for our customers to ensure design validation and product certification, both of which highlight product safety.\nPOWER PRODUCT SAFETY\n\nGas Power has established Product Safety procedures that apply to all GE Gas Power business entities, products, and services to eliminate unreasonable safety risks. General requirements include ensuring prompt actions addressing product safety issues, a Product Safety Review Board (PSRB) to oversee the effectiveness of the Product Safety process, organizations responsible for product design/engineering and plate engineering to establish a Product Safety Program Team (SPMT). Organizations complete a product safety review for Gas Power designed products to identify inherent hazards of the system, hazard control measures, and risk for harm to occur. These reviews are documented in the SAFER database, facilitated by a Product Safety Engineer, and reviewed by a Chief Consulting Engineer or designated controlled title holder. To detect product safety concerns for post shipment and installed base equipment, organizations with product service responsibilities establish a process for communicating with Product Safety Engineering any product safety concerns related to Gas Power products and services. The SPMT determines if the concern is a valid Product Safety Issue. For any safety event the issue is recorded in the SAFER database, actions necessary to resolve the issue are determined, and the issue is tracked to resolution.\n\nSAFETY RESPONSE: AFT DIFFUSER SHIPPED WITHOUT LIFTING LUGS\n\nAn AFT Diffuser was delivered to a Gas Power site, and upon opening the shipping crate, the employees discovered the lifting lugs were missing. A Root Cause investigation found the drawing and BOM were appropriately marked, but the drawing notes were left off of the qualification documents. Site employees followed the established Product Safety procedures and were able to take both immediate and long term actions to safely address the situation. To correct the immediate concern, the Diffuser without lugs was lifted with lifting straps. To correct the long term concern, an update was made to the qualification drawing, the CAV definition was updated to indicate \u201cA CAV form is a record of actual product characteristic values verified against applicable drawing, drawing notes and specification requirements. The characteristic features may be in the form of dimensions, form, function, note compliance, NDE result.\u201d\n\nPOWER QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nGE Gas Power Quality Management System (QMS) meets all ISO 9001 Standard requirements and is designed to deliver products and services that meet our customers\u2019 expectations. The following four pillars form the basis of our Quality Policy as described below:\n\n- **Zero Defect Culture**: We protect our customers through a culture that accepts no defects, creates no defects, passes no defects.\n- **Management of Change**: We deliver with focus, using standard work and lean for quality. We comply with all applicable requirements and regulations.\n- **Supply Base Quality**: We partner with our suppliers and empower our employees to innovate, solve problems rapidly with rigor, and perform quality stop work when needed to protect our customers.\n- **New Product Introduction**: We deliver products and services right the first time, every time. We continuously improve our processes and systems leveraging past lessons and implementing sustainably.\n\nBy keeping laser focus on the customer, meeting our QMS requirements, and the four pillars as our True North, while leveraging our lean approach to driving transformational improvements, we will significantly decrease our quality escapes, defects, and customer events, not only improving customer experience but also reducing CoPQ (scrap, rework, warranty costs) enabling quality as a competitive advantage driving profitable growth.\n\nOne of the four pillars of our Gas Power Quality Policy is focused on improving Supply Base Quality, which in turn will improve our overall quality performance and, ultimately, customer experience. Our goal is to reduce supplier escapes (nonconforming parts) to GE by more than 25% in 2022, and we are working with our suppliers to drive step function improvements across their operations. A recent success story is a partnership with a critical U.S.-based supplier of highly technical processes. By embracing continuous improvement and adapting their processes to deliver better quality for GE, they improved their internal yield and lowered their escapes to GE by 95%. One specific example of improvement is the remediation of AFT Tip Cooling Hole Back Wall Stripes (BWS) on Stage 1 Blades. A BWS can create thin walls and concentrated stress that can lead to cracking. This supplier worked closely with GE\u2019s engineering and quality teams to identify root causes of defects leading to improved design and manufacturing processes. This helped minimize customer escapes and scrap despite casting variations.\n\nCULTURE\n\nLeading with integrity and The Spirit & The Letter\n\nIntegrity is critical in everything we do. This is reflected in our three Leadership Behaviors\u2014act with humility, lead with transparency and deliver with focus\u2014always with unwavering integrity. These behaviors, along with our employee code of conduct, The Spirit & The Letter, set the foundation for our compliance program, where we expect our leaders and all our employees to personally drive a culture of integrity everywhere we do business.\n\nLeadership behaviors\n\nGE\u2019s Leadership Behaviors form the foundation of our culture. For us at GE, these are more than just words; they are changing the way we work and signify a meaningful shift in our culture. These Leadership Behaviors are instrumental in driving engagement throughout our businesses, particularly related to lean.\n\n**ACT WITH HUMILITY**\n\nHumility helps us recognize what we do not know. Ask questions, then listen carefully.\n\n- We embrace a culture of respect which values inclusive teams and diverse perspectives.\n- We actively listen to internal and external sources.\n- We learn from our shortcomings as much as we celebrate our wins.\n\n\u201cRespect isn\u2019t about titles; it is about treating everyone well and working together as a team. When we listen to each other, we can learn from each other\u2019s experiences and expertise. Humility is about acknowledging lessons learned; it isn\u2019t a sign of weakness. We are all human.\u201d\n\n**LEAD WITH TRANSPARENCY**\n\nTransparency makes us call it like we see it, highlighting the good and the bad in equal measure.\n\n- We embrace candor, saying what we think, not what people want to hear.\n- We share information so we can solve problems.\n- We contribute to each other\u2019s development in a constructive way.\n\n\u201cTransparency and integrity go hand-in-hand, mutually supportive in creating a shared space of doing the right thing, all the time, whether actively seen or acknowledged, without fear or favor.\u201d\n\n**DELIVER WITH FOCUS**\n\nFocus helps us prioritize what we will and will not do.\n\n- We put safety first.\n- We prioritize our work, maximizing our impact.\n- We measure performance through the lens of our customers.\n- We are committed to continuous improvement always in search of a better way.\n\n\u201cWithin our complex, multi-channel go-to-market business, 100% compliant commercial transactions are simply part of the customer-centered equation and a fundamental enabler to executing on opportunities of all size and shape.\u201d\n\n**TOM HOFERER**\n\nGeneral Manager-Unison Industries GE Aviation\n\nCulture survey\n\nIn the first quarter of 2022, we conducted our second annual enterprise-wide culture survey to gauge our progress on our Leadership Behaviors, as well as areas such as integrity, safety and lean. While there was expected variability in the results among our businesses related to certain topics, a Company-wide view of trends confirmed GE\u2019s strong foundation in compliance efforts. The survey also reflected that we still have work to do on diversity and inclusion, though our leadership commitment to both is evident and has contributed to an improvement in these results compared to last year. This year again, safety questions scored high, yet we are focused on driving further action so that our front-line feels as strongly about our safety efforts as the overall Company, including management (see pages 86-89). Employees identified progress on personal and career growth, while candor and transparency remain as areas of opportunity. We believe listening and gaining these insights drive improvement, in both our business and our culture.\nThe Spirit & The Letter\n\nOur integrity anchor is our robust employee code of conduct, The Spirit & The Letter (S&L). As the name suggests, this code of conduct is intended to hold our employees to a higher standard above and beyond simply following the letter of the law. We expect our employees and our Board of Directors to comply with the spirit of these policies and our Company values. Available for download in 21 languages, the S&L sets core employee and manager integrity expectations and summarizes our key Company-wide compliance policies. At GE, salaried employees are expected to affirm their commitment to abide by the S&L by completing the Spirit & Letter Acknowledgement at the time of hiring and then again every year subject to local labor law restrictions. In 2021, 98% of eligible employees completed the Spirit & Letter Acknowledgement. GE also requires its third parties (including distributors, suppliers, agents and partners) to comply with relevant aspects of the S&L and, as necessary, will educate those third parties about applicable policy requirements.\n\nThe S&L and its accompanying policies address the full spectrum of integrity and compliance issues across GE\u2019s global value chain. In 2021, GE published its latest version of the S&L. In response to an evolving workforce, we designed the latest S&L to be easy for different learners and workers to digest on any device. Accordingly, we made the S&L available both for downloading as well as for interactive, mobile-friendly browsing. The interactive version is directly accessible to employees through our GE Integrity Mobile App and includes embedded links to key policies, resources and videos for compliance help on-the-go.\n\nWithin the S&L framework, there are 19 core policies to help employees perform their jobs and navigate key regulatory areas under compliance. As these policies are intended for our entire employee population, we most recently updated all policies in 2021 to be simpler, principle-based and easier to understand and follow. Our policies adopt a practical layout for efficient navigation. The information is organized as follows:\n\n- **What to Know** - states GE\u2019s commitments in the specific policy area and provides helpful context on why the policy matters.\n- **How to Comply** - covers the specific role and responsibilities employees need to follow to be compliant with GE\u2019s expectations.\n- **Get Help** - lists valuable, relevant resources for additional guidance on the policy topic and information on how to raise concerns.\n\nKey terms in the policies are captured in a dedicated definitions section, and all policies contain information on where to go for additional assistance.\n\nThese policies are augmented by 22 Enterprise Standards, which set forth the core programmatic expectations for the businesses in all of our significant compliance risk areas. Each Enterprise Standard defines the specific risks that businesses must document and address, outlines auditable controls, and requires, among other things, that the businesses have appropriate mechanisms in place to monitor those controls. These Enterprise Standards were developed and launched in 2020 and, together with our policies, will be periodically refreshed as necessary and appropriate, including to incorporate lessons learned and findings from investigations and internal audits.\n\nThe Spirit & The Letter Core Policies\n\n- Acceptable Use\n- Anti-Money Laundering\n- Conflicts of Interest\n- Cybersecurity\n- EHS\n- Fair Competition\n- Human Rights\n- Improper Payments Prevention\n- Insider Trading and Stack Tipping\n- Intellectual Property\n- International Trade Compliance\n- Open Reporting\n- Privacy\n- Quality\n- Reporting and Recordkeeping\n- Respectful Workplace\n- Security\n- Supplier Relationships\n- Working with Governments\n\nOur commitment to integrity and open reporting serves as the foundation for GE to deliver on its other commitments and to help build a world that works.\n\nREAD THE SPIRIT & THE LETTER \u27a4\nREAD OUR EHS POLICY \u27a4\nREAD OUR OPEN REPORTING POLICY \u27a4\nREAD OUR RESPECTFUL WORKPLACE POLICY \u27a4\n\nCompliance training & communications\n\nEach GE business uses a focused training and communications plan to educate employees about the risks that are associated with their work. With a broad, global workforce across multiple business segments, plus changing workforce demographics and modes of communication, the GE program requires constant reinvention and customization by each GE business to stay relevant. Salaried new hires across all GE businesses receive a streamlined basic compliance training course. Additional training on key risk areas is provided to targeted employee groups based on risk. Each GE business also reinforces these learnings through a variety of communications, including leadership messages, newsletters, integrity campaigns, videos, infographics and embedded messaging within various digital tools. We invest in refreshed content on an ongoing basis, and business training and communication plans are adjusted annually based on the output of our enterprise compliance risk assessment.\n\nVoice of integrity: open reporting\n\nOpen reporting is a cornerstone of GE\u2019s commitment to integrity. Every employee is responsible for integrity, and GE expects its leaders to foster an environment in which employees are encouraged to raise integrity concerns without fear of retaliation. Employees serve as the best line of defense for the early detection of potential issues, and open reporting activity is one of the best indicators of a culture of integrity and employee engagement on compliance priorities.\n\nGE manages employee concern reporting through its Global Open Reporting & Ombuds Program. Under the program, employees are required to submit concerns regarding potential violations of law, regulation or GE policy through one of the available open reporting channels, including managers, Human Resources, Legal, Compliance, Internal Audit, Ombuds and anonymously through webform. The program serves as a safe forum for whistleblowers\u2014GE understands that it can be difficult for some employees to come forward with their concerns and the anonymous reporting channel is a critical pillar of the open reporting program. Each business has at least one full-time ombudsperson and, in addition, a network of part-time employees across the globe to whom concerns can be raised. In 2021, 2,355 concerns were raised, 2,275 of which were closed, with the remaining cases pending ongoing investigations and further review.\n\nGE fully examines every integrity concern raised and takes necessary remedial actions where appropriate. During the investigation process, GE:\n\n- Forms an independent and objective investigation team;\n- Obtains the facts through interviews and/or reviews of documents;\n- Reaches conclusions, whenever possible, from the facts the team is able to obtain;\n- Recommends corrective action, if necessary; and\n- Provides the person who raised the original concern (if that person is known) with feedback on the outcome, while maintaining the confidentiality and privacy of all involved (to the extent possible).\n\nCertain cases are treated with special care depending on the individuals or content involved. Concerns related to senior executives or Company officers must be escalated, as must be any complaint that could materially impact financial reporting or controls, or that relate to federal securities law matters. Finally, the Significant Cases Committee (SCC) is responsible for performing monthly reviews of high-risk open reporting investigations across the Company. The members of the SCC include the Chief Audit Executive and Vice Presidents of Compliance and Global Investigations. The SCC reviews the significant case criteria annually to ensure both internal and external risks are considered.\n\nALWAYS WITH UNYIELDING INTEGRITY\n\nGE\u2019s Ethics & Compliance program focuses on prevention, detection and response. It begins with GE leadership\u2019s personal engagement on integrity. GE leaders across the businesses personally drive a culture of integrity everywhere GE operates by leading by example, incentivizing compliance and promoting open reporting. This culture is supported by a robust Ethics & Compliance program. To ensure the program is evolving as new risks emerge, GE relies on a team of legal and functional experts to help us stay ahead of significant compliance risks and a changing regulatory landscape.\n\nGE\u2019s Ethics & Compliance program\nGE measures the strength of its open reporting program using a number of metrics, which are reviewed at least monthly throughout the year. The program tracks the average number of days that it takes to close each investigation raised through open reporting, targeting resolution within 60 days of being reported. Businesses are required to escalate to the SCC any cases open for longer than 90 days that come through open reporting channels. The program also measures cases per 1,000 employees, which enables year-over-year comparisons within and across businesses, and enables us to control for any headcount changes. In addition, we track confirmation and anonymity rates, which are important to understand the health of our program.\n\nRetaliation for raising a concern or for participating in an integrity investigation is strictly prohibited, and violations are dealt with seriously and swiftly, up to and including termination.\n\nCompliance risk mitigation\n\nGE\u2019s Ethics & Compliance team runs an annual assessment that focuses on evaluating the inherent risks and the strength of our internal controls across all of our businesses. The assessment process asks each business to benchmark its own compliance programs against the 19 Spirit & Letter policies, which the Ethics & Compliance team includes in an overall assessment as to how GE performs in each key policy area. Insights from this process are used in many aspects of the compliance program including by identifying additional training needs, control improvements, and other areas that may need remediation efforts. The compliance risk assessment also feeds into the GE Enterprise Risk Management process, as appropriate.\n\nCompliance governance\n\nGE has a rigorous compliance governance process, both at a corporate and business level. Each business holds a quarterly review board meeting, which is attended by the most senior business leaders, including the CEO, during which their risk assessment, mitigation efforts, and other compliance issues are discussed. Additionally, each business meets with Company\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer twice per year to discuss its risk assessment, any program weaknesses or enhancements, and any compliance trends; and reports its most significant enterprise risks and compliance issues to the Company\u2019s Audit Committee on an annual basis.\n\nAt a corporate level, the Chief Compliance Officer holds two to three meetings per year with the Company\u2019s most senior officers to discuss significant program updates, open reporting trends, significant investigations, and business updates on key risk areas. In addition, the Chief Compliance Officer and Vice President of Investigations report on the same issues to the Audit Committee periodically.\n\nPrivacy and cybersecurity\n\nGE is committed to protecting information about our employees, our customers, our suppliers and our company, as well as the technology resources GE provides to its employees and contractors. We have adopted a \u201cdefense in depth\u201d approach, in which multiple layers of security controls are placed throughout our systems, and a security by design approach, to build security into our products, both of which enable GE to proactively protect against and respond to a dynamic cyber threat landscape. As such, GE has implemented detailed cybersecurity and information protection policies.\n\nGE\u2019S CYBERSECURITY FRAMEWORK\n\nAt GE, ensuring the security of our information, systems, products, and network is, and always will be, a top priority. GE has adopted the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework and International Organization for Standardization 27001 Framework as the basis for our cybersecurity controls framework. Each cyber function (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover) is managed by defined governance, risk assessment, control implementation, control effectiveness monitoring and metrics.\n\nGE has implemented a layered defense approach to security, which combines multiple mitigating security controls to protect our resources and information and improve our cyber resiliency. Our central cybersecurity framework reaches our shared services operations and the businesses to optimize our protection based on industry specific requirements.\n\nWe devote substantial resources to maintaining an information technology infrastructure that implements physical, administrative, and technical controls designed to protect information stored on GE\u2019s networks, including customer information, personal information, intellectual property and proprietary information. Information that could result in a significant harm to GE if lost, or intentionally or accidentally misused, is subject to enhanced security controls. GE\u2019s most sensitive information is identified and included within the scope of GE\u2019s crown jewel program through an annual review and analysis of GE\u2019s critical business information and programs.\n\nIn addition, we have committed resources and implemented processes to more effectively prevent, detect, and respond to cyber threats. GE\u2019s central cyber crisis management team exercises, tests and continually improves our cyber crisis management plan through rigorous tabletops and simulations at the enterprise and business levels. Working with GE legal, communications, privacy, and compliance teams, the central cyber crisis management team also addresses any security concerns or incidents that could present an enterprise risk to GE, which includes third party supplier incidents. These measures reflect GE\u2019s long-term commitment to protecting our employees, serving our customers and preserving shareholder value. Despite these measures, GE may not be able to successful prevent or defend against all cyber-related attacks.\n\nGE\u2019s approach to product cybersecurity includes lifecycle management, vulnerability management, customer notifications, incident response, issuing security bulletins and advisories, and a dedicated channel for receiving and responding to vulnerability reports. We have also developed secure development lifecycle design practices to secure our software designs and connected products.\n\nPROTECTING GE\u2019S DIGITAL ECOSYSTEM\n\nThe increasing degree of interconnectivity among companies and their affiliates, partners, suppliers and customers underscores the need for companies to evaluate cybersecurity threats not only to their own internal networks, but also to the larger ecosystem in which they operate. We understand that protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information on GE\u2019s network necessarily extends to business partners who are afforded access to such information. GE contractually requires its suppliers to appropriately secure and maintain their information technology systems and protect GE\u2019s information on their systems. GE performs security assessments on certain suppliers based on a risk assessment and rating process performed by GE\u2019s cyber team. Higher risk suppliers are subject to more frequent reassessments and onsite assessments.\nGE understands our employees serve an important role in helping to safeguard GE\u2019s information and systems. At the enterprise level, we provide comprehensive security awareness training to help our employees understand their information protection and cyber security responsibilities at GE, identify phishing and other cyber threats, exercise vigilance and secure methods when sharing sensitive information with third parties, and practice good cyber hygiene in their personal lives and when using social media. GE businesses provide additional training tailored to their customer requirements, regulatory obligations and industry risks.\n\nWe recognize that technology and the nature of its threats and risks are changing, and GE will continue to evolve to meet those changes. GE believes collaboration is important for effective cybersecurity solutions\u2014bringing together the best minds and the best ideas. Global interconnectedness means that no one company or country operates alone. We continuously seek to engage with our regulators, customers, suppliers, employees and industry colleagues to improve cybersecurity collaboratively. In addition, we engage in public-private partnerships, such as information sharing and analysis centers, to share actionable cyber threat indicators. These activities have resulted in improved capabilities that are quicker and more effective in responding to dynamic threats.\n\n**CYBERSECURITY GOVERNANCE AND LEADERSHIP AT GE**\n\nGE\u2019s Global Chief Information Security Officer (CSIO) is responsible for developing an information security program that enables business leaders to make risk decisions while protecting the business from security threats and risks. This program is designed to protect GE\u2019s products and information resources, and the information contained therein, including employee, customer, and supplier information stored in GE\u2019s systems. The Global CSIO works collaboratively with business unit CSIOs to analyze cybersecurity and resiliency risks to GE; consider industry trends; implement controls, as appropriate, to mitigate these risks; and enable business leaders to make risk-based decisions. As part of its oversight role, the Audit Committee of GE\u2019s Board of Directors reviews GE\u2019s practices and programs related to cybersecurity periodically throughout the year. The Audit Committee is updated regularly on GE\u2019s cyber threats and risk management strategy. GE\u2019s Global CSIO meets on a recurring basis with our CEO and other senior leadership to review and discuss GE\u2019s cybersecurity program, including emerging cyber risks, threats, and industry trends. The business CSIOs conduct business level reviews and discuss cyber related issues at regular meetings. In addition, GE periodically engages third-party cybersecurity companies to assess GE\u2019s cybersecurity program for maturity, effectiveness, and consistency with prevailing industry standards and GE\u2019s regulatory requirements as well as test GE\u2019s security posture.\n\n**GE\u2019S PRIVACY PROGRAM**\n\nGE employs privacy practices based upon its Privacy Enterprise Standard, which is designed to support its compliance with GE\u2019s Privacy Commitment and applicable laws. The GE privacy program includes the appointment of a Global Chief Privacy Officer and a network of privacy leaders, education and awareness programs, incident response protocols, audit routines, and a Privacy by Design approach to process and system development that incorporates privacy impact assessments. The program also includes technical and organizational information security measures designed to protect personal information. Supplier engagements provide for the processing of personal information in a manner consistent with the Commitment and applicable law.\n\n**GE\u2019S PRIVACY COMMITMENT**\n\nGE respects the privacy rights of individuals and is committed to handling personal information responsibly, in accordance with applicable law, and GE\u2019s Commitment to the Protection of Personal Information.\n\n**GE\u2019S PRIVACY COMMITMENT AND APEC CERTIFICATION**\n\nGE\u2019s Commitment to the Protection of Personal Information (Commitment) outlines standards applicable to its processing of personal information. The Commitment requires GE to adhere to the following principles:\n\n- Process personal information fairly and lawfully.\n- Limit the processing of personal information to that which is adequate, relevant and not excessive.\n- Take reasonable steps to ensure personal information is accurate, and only retained for as long as necessary for the purposes for which it is collected.\n- Make privacy practices clear to individuals.\n- Provide for the exercise of individual rights in relation to personal information processed by GE.\n\nThe Privacy Commitment establishes the basis for cross-border transfers within GE, including where operations adhere to relevant parts of the Commitment as processors of personal information. GE also maintains APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules (CBPR) and Privacy Recognition for Processors (PRP) certifications as granted by accountability agent TRUSTe.\n\n**PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**\n\nIn 2021, we launched our new performance management system\u2014\u201cPeople, Performance, and Growth\u201d\u2014which is designed to help employees understand their performance against their priorities, as well as their demonstration of GE\u2019s Leadership Behaviors. This performance management system is driving greater responsibility for performance at an individual level. Outcomes are directly linked to incentive compensation. Our executive teams conduct regular assessments, including through business reviews, talent, potential and performance, particularly in the context of critical roles, succession and business goals. We also provide our employees with additional resources for training and strive to create a supportive work environment to help them manage professional and personal priorities.\n\n**GE\u2019S U.S. FAMILY BENEFITS, INCLUDING FERTILITY, PARENTAL LEAVE AND CHILD CARE**\n\nGE provides a variety of benefits to employees and their families, including several options of medical, dental, vision, life and disability insurance, and retirement savings. Specific to family planning and benefits, we also offer personalized guidance and resources through counselors and online services to help manage challenges, money, and stress. These counselors are also able to help employees navigate adoption, pregnancy and preparing for parenthood, childcare, parenting, coping with disability, aging, and preparing for retirement. Both full time and part time employees are offered an Adoption Assistance Program that provides reimbursement for eligible adoption expenses.\n\nOur parental leave is comprised of up to eight weeks of disability for the delivery, plus additional paid leave of up to 10 weeks for maternity, paternity or adoption. Full-time salaried employees also receive permissive leave, which allows them to take time off when needed with no predefined limits. To support parents, we offer a number of other benefits, including:\n\n- **GE Babies**: On-demand maternity RNs provide personalized advice, tools and resources to guide moms through pregnancy planning to post-partum, infant care, and preparing for pre-natal care.\n- **Moms on the Move**: GE moms who are nursing and traveling for business within the U.S. ship milk back to their babies for free. Moms can request milk storage and shipping kits to be sent to their location for use with their pump. Milk is delivered back home, and costs are covered by GE.\n\n**HUMAN CAPITAL**\n\n**Investing in our people**\n\nDeveloped to improve field execution, Live Outage is a set of digital tools that replaces a more antiquated, paper-based approach and speeds up the outage process for our customers.\nFLEXIBLE WORK ARRANGEMENTS\nGE encourages flexible working arrangements that enable employees to individualize their schedules to maximize productivity. Among the options GE offers are flex time, part-time opportunities, job sharing, reduced hours, telecommuting and remote work.\n\nGLOBAL WELL-BEING\nWhile our employees are busy building a world that works, GE understands their personal wellbeing is essential to that success. HealthAhead has been GE\u2019s global wellbeing program for more than 15 years. Its mission is to support a culture that inspires and encourages GE employees and their families to optimize their health and wellbeing and live a well-balanced life. We are constantly evolving and innovating to meet that mission on a global scale. We carefully measure engagement and use metrics to inform strategies for future campaigns and activities. We partner with GE business globally to deliver high value, sustainable resources and programs under the philosophy of \u201cPlan global, act local\u201d to inspire engagement and reflect local cultures. HealthAhead is moving the needle with our communications and reaching employees with much-needed, supportive messaging.\n\nAll employees have access to well-being benefits such as Employee Assistance Programs (EAP), digital tools and mobile apps such as meQuilibrium (resilience and stress management) and Grokker (video-based, holistic well-being and challenge tool). We are currently operational in 107 countries and have a network of more than 300 wellness champions that help us bring the program to life for our diverse workforce, whether they work at manufacturing sites, in an office building or are remote.\n\nThe global pandemic has placed an unprecedented level of stress and anxiety among GE employees as they deal with their personal needs and needs of their families as they perform their jobs. Due to these challenges, we provided a variety of COVID-19 support and resources including an internal website, monthly update emails from our CHRO, onsite vaccination clinics in certain locations, expanded caregiving resources, webinars and campaigns to help address change, stress, remote work and safety.\n\nIn addition, in 2021 we:\n\u2022 Launched new branding and structure with a focus on holistic health introducing four pillars\u2014physical, social, emotional\u2014and adding financial well-being as a new pillar.\n\u2022 Presented two global emotional well-being campaigns (It\u2019s OK not to feel OK) with leader support and emotional wellbeing stories from GE employees around the world.\n\u2022 Hosted more than 30 live webinars for employees throughout the year, covering a range of wellbeing topics.\n\u2022 Logged more than 2 million well-being minutes during our \u201cRise to the Challenge\u201d campaign in May.\n\nRESPECTFUL WORKPLACE\nProviding a safe, fair and respectful work environment is embedded in our culture, operations, and policies and procedures. Aligned with our Human Rights Statement of Principles, GE prohibits discrimination or harassment against anyone based on race, color, religion, national or ethnic origin, ancestry, sex, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, genetic information, age, disability, military and veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law. GE respects workers\u2019 rights to freedom of association, privacy, collective bargaining, immigration, working time, wages and hours, as well as prohibiting forced, compulsory and child labor and employment discrimination in our operations and business partnerships.\n\nOur Respectful Workplace Policy in The Spirit and The Letter details every employee\u2019s responsibility and commitment in treating employees, applicants, customers, suppliers, contractors and anyone we interact with or providing services to GE, with fairness and respect. The Respectful Workplace Enterprise Standard outlines guidance to ensure compliance and prohibition of discrimination, harassment or bullying against any employee or applicant based on any characteristic protected by law. Any employee with compliance concerns can raise that concern through the open reporting and Ombuds Program.\n\nDEVELOPING OUR PEOPLE\nGE is committed to the sustainable development of our people. A GE employee\u2019s learning journey is personalized and begins upon joining the organization. In 2021, we complemented on the job learning with targeted leadership development experiences to equip our leaders to shape our culture while leading as lean practitioners.\n\nOn-the-job learning is supported by content available on our learning technologies:\n\u2022 GE Learning provides access to on-demand resources and registered more than 11 million online course completions from across regulatory required, GE required and elective courses of interest spanning desktop application, soft skills, technical and product topics. On average, over 90,000 employees engage with our learning management platform monthly.\n\u2022 BrilliantYOU houses our Lean Collection of custom assets (tools, templates, videos, etc.) designed to orient our employees to the Leadership Behaviors and lean capabilities required to drive our cultural transformation. In 2021, 48,547 hours of Lean Lessons were consumed by leaders across all levels and 81,643 distinct employees engaged with BrilliantYOU resources. The Lean Collection is comprised of 339 custom created lean assets.\n\nLearning through others is enabled in peer-to-peer exchanges, coaching interactions and in communities of practice. Employees work in proximity of others with different perspectives, knowledge levels and development aspirations. This creates a learning environment that is collaborative, creative and informal.\n\nLEADERSHIP IN ACTION 2021\n\u2022 Equips senior leaders to lead GE\u2019s cultural transformation through a focus on Leadership Behaviors and lean principles/tools with overarching themes of respect for people and continuous improvement.\n\u2022 Uses peer-to-peer engagement, interactions with customers and teams, 1:1 coaching, and on-the-job activation.\n\nLEARNING LEAN\nLearning is core to any organization that is focused on continuous improvement. As part of his personal development plan around lean, GE Aviation Chief Information Officer David Burns is a regular user of GE\u2019s learning resources on BrilliantYOU. These lessons are helping him learn about lean concepts while also spurring thoughts on how to apply those learnings to his role on a day-to-day basis and enable GE\u2019s transformation. David has been \u201cwearing the white hat\u201d in the morning to engage with the Lean Lessons on BrilliantYOU over a cup of coffee and take notes to continually refresh myself on the insights in the curriculum.\u201d\n\n15 MINUTES A DAY OF BRILLIANTYOU\nGE Gas Power Principal Engineer of Product Safety Larry Danner is a frequent user of GE\u2019s learning opportunities on BrilliantYOU. In 2021, Larry made a point to set aside 15 minutes at the beginning of every day to look at a new piece of content, whether it is lean or safety. Larry finds that \u201cBrilliantYOU helps focus on the things that matter to our business, which can then be translated into focusing my personal efforts in a beneficial way for the company.\u201d\n\nFormal leadership development offerings have been designed to strategically elevate our executive talent\u2019s readiness to deliver results while driving efficiencies, eliminating waste and generating value for our customers. These experiences are structured to challenge leaders as they explore complex concepts and the rigorous application of the topics being learned. This curriculum includes:\n\nFRONTLINE LEADERSHIP PROGRAM 2021\n\u2022 Teaches leaders to implement a system to deliver customer value through proper support and leadership to those who are on the front line and closest to the process.\n\u2022 Guides participants to identify wastes and deploy visual management needed to drive improvements.\n\u2022 Internally facilitated by GE experts knowledgeable in the topic being taught and supplemented with a leadership behavior simulation.\n\nBUSINESS LEADERSHIP PROGRAM 2021\n\u2022 Prepares leaders to run a business in a lean organization. Participants invest time in live, virtual instruction, simulations, coaching and hands-on practical assignments deployed in the flow of work to ensure their readiness in driving a transformation over time.\n\u2022 Components include internal leader dialogues, industry thought leaders, executive coaches and external faculty.\n\u2022 Topics include customers and markets, finance, strategy and innovation, change management, and talent and culture.\nAdvancing diversity and inclusion\n\nAt GE, we know inclusion and diversity make us more competitive and help create value for our customers, investors, and employees. We believe fostering an inclusive culture empowers everyone to do their best work because they feel accepted, respected, and that they belong.\n\nI am eager to continue building on the foundation laid by our former Chief Diversity Officer (CDO) Mike Barber and the business CDOs and leadership teams. I see my role as ensuring our teams more closely reflect the diversity of the communities where we work, instilling a global mindset, and supporting a workplace culture where individual differences are embraced and where the best ideas win, regardless of who they come from.\n\nI am starting as CDO as we begin our journey to become three stronger, more-focused companies in aviation, healthcare, and energy. We will ensure inclusion and diversity are appropriately considered and prioritized as we move forward. I am excited about the opportunity this presents each business to deeply re-examine the aspects of its culture and processes that can be redesigned to better support inclusion and diversity. In partnership with the business leadership teams, we will identify and implement sustainable changes to support progress now and for years to come.\n\nWe are nearly two years into our reinvigorated strategy to generate long-term, sustainable progress on diversity and inclusion at GE. Our investment in identifying root causes and solutions for challenges and barriers to recruiting, retaining and promoting diverse talent has never been more critical.\n\nOur inclusion and diversity priorities are focused on driving transparency, accountability, and community, with an understanding that meaningful change is data driven.\n\nYou can read about our progress in our 2021 Diversity Annual Report.\n\nWorkforce diversity\n\nIn 2021, we added new dimensions of employment diversity to better focus our efforts and be held accountable for their impact\u2014voluntary self-identification data for U.S. veteran status and disability (U.S.). The data shared is representative of GE\u2019s workforce on December 31, 2021. We will continuously look to improve the depth and breadth of our diversity data. Following the updates to the voluntary self-identification categories and selections for employees in the U.S., in the future this might include other voluntary self-identification data like sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nSince 2020, we have seen growth at the leadership level for both women globally (+1.2%) and for total U.S. race and ethnic minority (+1.7%). More than 10% of our U.S. employees are military veterans and 3.7% self-identify as having a disability.1\n\n68% of our employees are based outside the United States and our workforce represents nationalities from 169 countries, territories and regions.\n\nGE IS A TRULY GLOBAL COMPANY:\n\n| Board of Directors | 2 of 4 Board leadership positions are held by women. Our policy is to build a Board that represents a range of backgrounds. |\n|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Female             | 38%                                                                                                               |\n| Ethnically diverse | 15%                                                                                                               |\n| Born outside U.S.  | 38%                                                                                                               |\n\n1 The data for U.S. Veteran and U.S. Disability reflect responses from employees who voluntarily updated these self-identification fields as of December 31, 2021.\n2 The U.S. Department of Labor defines a disability as having a physical or mental impairment or medical condition that substantially limits a major life activity, or if you have a history or record of such an impairment or medical condition.\n3 Data from our EEO-1 Component 1 Report (EEO-1 Report) is available here. The EEO-1 Report mandates the use of specific job categories, which differ from how our workforce is structured. While we are making data from our EEO-1 Report available, we believe the diversity representation data as presented in our Diversity Annual Report and our website is the most meaningful measure of our diversity progress.\n4 Reflects Board composition as of May 4, 2022.\n\n1 Data representative of GE\u2019s workforce as of December 31, 2021, extracted in January 2022. System exports show percentages out to several decimal points. Due to this precision, totals may not sum across due to rounding.\n2 Year-over-year changes shown may not reflect previously reported numbers due to restructuring changes in the business unit in 2021. Corporate is inclusive of Digital, Capital, International Markets, and Global Research.\n3 Leadership encompasses the top 1.5% of all active employees.\n4 Professional accounts for all active non-production employees, excluding leadership.\n5 2021 first year reported.\n### Recruitment and retention\n\nIn 2021, we completed several initiatives to help us recruit and retain a more diverse workforce. For example:\n\n- A cross-business team created a standard guide for managers on how to better ensure a more inclusive and equitable experience for each employee.\n- GE Gas Power used data and one-on-one discussions to develop a plan to improve retention of underrepresented minority employees in the U.S.\n- GE Healthcare analyzed data and leveraged lean tools to establish a number of improvements, including setting up ratios for internal succession plans, increasing the candidate referral incentive for GE Employee Resource Group (ERG) members, establishing additional partnerships with external recruiting partners to source talent at all levels, and ensuring that interview panels themselves are made up of a diverse group of employees. GE Healthcare has committed to increasing underrepresented minorities in executive leadership roles and hopes to reach 13% by the end of 2021 based on its current data and the overall market availability of talent, according to the U.S. Census and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n### Commitment to pay equity\n\nWe are proud of our long-standing commitment to fair and competitive pay practices. On average, men and women performing similar work are paid within 1% of each other in each GE business. Going forward, our goal remains 100% pay equity in each of our businesses.\n\n### PAY EQUITY BASED ON 2021 SALARY DATA\n\nOur pay equity results include gender and U.S. underrepresented minorities. For example, in our Renewable Energy business, women performing similar work make on average 99% of what men make. Furthermore, U.S. underrepresented minority employees performing similar work make on average 102% of what non-underrepresented minority employees make in our Renewable Energy business.\n\n### Going forward\n\nIn 2022, we are developing plans for the creation of three independent companies focused on flight, healthcare, and energy. Diverse teams and perspectives will help accelerate the innovation needed to create a future of smarter and more efficient flight, develop precision healthcare that personalizes diagnoses and treatments, and lead the energy transition to drive decarbonization. We will ensure inclusion and diversity are appropriately considered and prioritized as each business deeply re-examines the aspects of its culture and processes that can be redesigned to better support inclusion and diversity.\n\n### STEM FOR THE NEXT 50\u00b0 INNOVATION CAMP\n\nIn celebration of the United Arab Emirates (UAE)\u2019s 50th Jubilee, GE partnered with INJAZ Al-Arab to host its \u201cSTEM for the Next 50\u00b0\u201d Innovation Camp in Dubai. More than 200 female students between the ages of 15 and 17 participated in a week-long program preparing them for STEM careers that will drive innovation across sectors in the UAE. During the camp, students from five schools engaged with industry experts, including more than 50 GE volunteers and guest speakers. As part of the program, students were divided into teams and tasked with submitting a solution to an energy transition challenge. The winning teams participated in a hands-on learning experience with GE leaders at a GE office in Dubai on March 8, 2022, International Women\u2019s Day.\n\n---\n\n**U.S. DATA**\n\n| Race/Ethnicity | Leadership | Professional | All Employees |\n|----------------|------------|--------------|---------------|\n| **2020**       |            |              |               |\n| **2021**       |            |              |               |\n| **2022**       |            |              |               |\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- Year-over-year changes shown may not reflect previously reported numbers due to restructuring changes in the business unit in 2021.

In line with our sustainability efforts toward continuous improvement for purposeful outcomes, we have prioritized the following commitments:\n\n- Protect the safety of our people and those who do work on our behalf.\n- Be responsible stewards of the environment.\n- Maintain a strong EHS and environmental compliance program.\n- Make progress toward our climate change emission goals and ambitions for Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.\n- Reinforce our commitment to product quality and safety.\n- Pursue environmental stewardship and circular economy in the design of our products.\n- Invest in returning contaminated properties to protective reuse for communities with a priority on environmental justice communities.\n\nOur commitments start on the shop floor and grow to encompass commitments that reach into our communities and across the planet. With every decision, we seek to lead with integrity in all that we do.\n\n30 Years of employee resource groups\n\nIn 2021, GE\u2019s Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) marked 30 years of adding value to our colleagues and businesses by helping to engage and develop the diverse talent needed to build a world that works. These communities are built on common backgrounds and experiences that welcome all employees to learn, connect, advocate and foster a sense of belonging. 2021 was a milestone year for GE\u2019s oldest ERG, the African American/Affinity Forum (AAF). Born out of activism and Black excellence, the AAF celebrated 30 years by paying homage to its past and reinvigorating its commitment to drive transformative growth. The AAF is a supporter of local communities, partnering with many organizations that promote Black/African American excellence and minorities in STEM. Since 1995, the AAF has generated funding for scholarships for college students, easing the financial burden for many students.\n\nClimate Action Challenge\n\nIn recognition of Earth Day, GE\u2019s Green Team Network launched the Climate Action Challenge. The challenge is a 90-day guided event where employees are getting involved with hands-on projects that benefit the planet and support GE\u2019s efforts to become more sustainable. Teams around the globe are working to turn passionate ideas into tangible outcomes through weekly assignments, networking sessions and training opportunities.\n\nSupporting Durgapur\u2019s sustainable and inclusive development\n\nSince 2018, employees at GE\u2019s Steam Power facility in Durgapur, West Bengal, India, have been working with the non-profit Swami Vivekananda Van Prachar Samity to upgrade living conditions within the local community. With funding from GE\u2019s Durgapur facility, the team has overseen the building of paved roads, ponds for fish farming, solar grids for streetlights and submersible pumps for clean water, sanitation and hygiene. Past projects also include assistance to families suffering from leprosy, basic education for tribal children, and the construction of a fourth community center of education where more than 200 women receive ongoing skills training in toy making, tailoring, farm productivity and medicine.\n\nCelebrating LGBTQAI+ Pride Month\n\nIn June 2022, GE\u2019s iconic sign in Schenectady, New York, was lit up in rainbow colors in honor of Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, asexual, and intersex LGBTQAI+ pride month. The sign was originally installed in 1926 on the roof of Building 37. The Monogram portion is 36 feet in diameter and the sign is 168 feet long, with each letter standing at 10 feet high. Approximately 112 25W LED light bulbs were used to illuminate each color. GE\u2019s Pride Alliance is welcoming of employees who identify as part of the LGBTQAI+ community and their allies. The group raises awareness around LGBTQAI+ issues and provides support and advocacy for creating inclusive work environments.\n\nGE NAMED COMPANY OF THE YEAR BY THE SOCIETY OF HISPANIC PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS\n\nThe Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) is the largest association in the U.S. for Hispanics in STEM fields. In 2021, GE was honored to be named SHPE\u2019s Company of the Year. The 27-year relationship between GE and SHPE pre-dates the formation of the Hispanic Forum (HF), an ERG within GE aimed at increasing Hispanic and Latinx representation and fostering opportunities for career growth. GE is a member of SHPE\u2019s Industry Partnership Council (IPC), which comprises top national companies that are committed to diversity and inclusion. In this capacity, GE has supported SHPE\u2019s year-round programs, shared industry perspectives and helped members prepare for professional careers. GE employees also speak on SHPE panels, partake in local events and help recruit SHPE members. In 2021, the GE Foundation announced it would fund $10,000 STEM scholarships for 22 students through SHPE. These will be awarded over the next two years, further cementing GE\u2019s commitment to creating a diverse talent pipeline to propel a more inspirational and inclusive workplace.\n\nSupporting Durgapur\u2019s sustainable and inclusive development\n\nSince 2018, employees at GE\u2019s Steam Power facility in Durgapur, West Bengal, India, have been working with the non-profit Swami Vivekananda Van Prachar Samity to upgrade living conditions within the local community.

Looking after the safety of our people and those who work on our behalf\u2014so that they can fulfill GE\u2019s mission of building a world that works\u2014is a top priority for the company.\n\nOver time, we have seen an overall downward trend in our Injury & Illness rates, which compare favorably to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, we are not satisfied: because even one injury is too many.\n\nRegrettably, in 2021, four individuals lost their lives doing work for GE. While our number of fatal events has decreased since 2020, each fatality is a tragedy that touches the lives of families, friends and co-workers. There\u2019s more we need to do to ensure that those who work for us or do work on our behalf make it home safely each day.\n\nGE leadership has taken significant steps to drive improvement across three areas: resource prioritization, leadership focus and company-wide attention on the importance of safety.\n\nIn 2021, GE launched the GE Safety Council to catalyze injury prevention efforts and support the further embedding of safety as a core attribute in each of our businesses. The Council complements our rigorous EHS program and includes EHS leaders from each of our businesses and from Corporate.\n\nLeading the Council is Francisco Benavides, who joined GE in late 2021 as GE\u2019s Chief Safety Officer. With three decades of experience across a range of industries including aerospace, mining and utilities, Francisco\u2019s mission as Chief Safety Officer is to further the company\u2019s safety goals and improve overall performance.\n\nAt each of our businesses, there is CEO-level accountability for safety. Further reflecting GE\u2019s prioritization of improving health and safety in the workplace, a modifier for safety performance was added to our annual bonus program, in addition to financial metrics.\n\nAs the company embarks on its planned transition to three, independent global public companies, our teams remain focused on driving continuous improvement to ensure that safety comes first in all that we do within each business and across the enterprise.\n\nLEVERAGING LEAN TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nOur business teams have been leveraging lean as a critical tool to help prevent events and drive safety as a core operational attribute.\n\nIn 2021, the Gas Power team defined their Safety Hoshin breakthrough\u2014a lean tool\u2014as achieving zero serious incidents. The team utilizes standard work to evaluate every Potentially Severe Event (PSE) as a serious incident. This starts with the frontline team openly reporting PSEs, escalating to leadership, completing investigations within 15 days and driving learnings and actions across the business.\n\nA strong partnership between EHS and lean in Healthcare has been instrumental in identifying synergies, embedding standard work and driving process improvements across the business. While in Aviation, each kaizen event is expected to complete investigations within 15 days and driving learnings and actions across the business.\n\nDue to the changing nature of GE\u2019s enterprise, figures are periodically updated to reflect changes in scope and as additional information becomes available. For instance, acquired businesses may not have aligned data for the same time periods.\n\nManaging safety risks wherever we work\n\nOur safety expectations extend beyond our own operations to all places where we work\u2014customer sites, field services, and at our project installation and construction locations\u2014and to all those who work on our behalf.\n\nAlthough our safety expectations do not change, managing risks across various operations sites is inherently different.\n\nThe four fatal events we regretfully experienced in 2021 were contractor fatalities. As we have evaluated our performance over the past few years, we have identified contractor safety as a key focus area for improvement.\n\nWe have implemented a set of standards for contractor prequalification, as well as a system to manage the process globally. We review training and competency expectations, programmatic elements for high-risk operations such as working at heights, electrical work and executing lifts, as well as performance metrics.\n\nUsing these standards, we can assess capabilities and help drive safe execution in alignment with our expectations. When we find defects in programs or competency, we may partner with the contractor to provide risk mitigation plans or basic competency in certain areas.\n\nWe have also reinvented our incident investigation process. Ensuring we are recording and learning from both employee and contractor events, as well as putting mitigation plans in place to prevent them from recurring, is part of our overall commitment to a safe working environment for all.\n\nGE\u2019s Life Saving Principles (LSPs) illustrate critical steps to stay safe in certain hazardous situations. These steps are never to be circumvented. All employees and contractors are empowered to stop work if they have any concerns about the task they are performing. These LSP documents, represented visually and in more than 20 languages, are widely available, posted at our operations and are used to orient our contractors and partners, specifically at our project sites, to GE\u2019s most fundamental expectations.\n\nAlthough we believe GE\u2019s safety program is a commercial differentiator, we don\u2019t believe safety is proprietary. The benefit is greatest when we share our learnings and elements of our program to prevent injuries or events for all.\n\nWe will continue working tirelessly to improve the safety performance of our contractors, partner with safe companies and further refine our selection and contractor management processes to make them more proactive and effective.\n\nSAMPLE OF GE\u2019S LIFE SAVING PRINCIPLES POSTERS, AVAILABLE IN SEVERAL LANGUAGES\n\nSAFETY\n\n| 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|------|------|------|\n| Injury & Illness Total Recordable Rate | 0.60 | 0.55 | 0.60 |\n| Days Away from Work Incident Rate | 0.28 | 0.29 | 0.32 |\n| Fatalities - Employees (Count) | 3 | 3 | 0 |\n| Fatalities - Contractor Workers (Count) | 2 | 4 | 4 |\n\n1 Increase from 2020 to 2021 largely attributable to ongoing impacts of the global pandemic, as well as internal reorganization activities. 2020 data updated to include COVID cases recorded after publishing the 2020 Sustainability Report.\n\n2 Number of injury and illness cases globally per risk population YTD, based on 100 employees working 200,000 hours annually, as measured against OSHA recordability criteria.\n\n3 Days OSHA recordable for days away from work cases or restricted cases are excluded.

Reflecting on the assembly of LEAP\u2019s compressor module, a team of technicians at the plant focused on the repetitive work of installing 48 thumbnail-size nuts on a component that requires a blind installation. Leveraging lean principles and tools, a new tightening tool was designed.\n\nThe technicians decided to add a small mirror to the wrench, allowing them to see into the module. The new, longer extension also allowed them to keep their arms and shoulders in a more neutral position. In addition to being more ergonomic, the new tool has reduced the time it takes to complete the task.\n\nA similar story unfolded at a GE Healthcare site in Beijing, where technicians improved the final stretch of the manufacturing process for C-arms, semi-circular imaging systems used during surgery. An ongoing ergonomic hurdle was the installation of wheel covers on the machines, often requiring technicians to lie on the floor to complete the task.\n\nA team of local operators and supervisors held a kaizen event, at which they proposed designing a jig that could improve the work. Within a few weeks, they had come up with a new design: a device that consisted of a 3D-printed mounting base sporting two screwdrivers that were pre-aligned with the thread holes. Through testing, the team found the new setup helped to shave around 15 minutes off the job, no lying down required. But there was still room for improvement and one team member made a suggestion\u2014bringing in a lifting platform from another area in the plant. This would allow them to install the wheel covers at waist height.\n\nWith the elimination of squatting, they had reduced the task\u2019s REBA score, an ergonomic assessment tool that evaluates the risks to the body associated with certain jobs, by 86%.\n\nBoth the Aviation team and the Healthcare team were named finalists in the Ergo Cup, a prestigious competition run by the Applied Ergonomics Society and the Ergonomics Center of North Carolina. In March 2022, it was announced the Aviation team was named an Ergo Cup winner in the workplace solutions category.\n\nHOW WE WORK FOR SAFETY AND THE ENVIRONMENT: OUR EHS PROGRAM\n\nAt GE, we are committed to EHS excellence to protect people, our communities and the environment. We manage our environmental performance and compliance by holding ourselves to the same high standards globally, often in places where the expectations we set and enforce exceed local regulations.\n\nGE\u2019s EHS program is built on a spirit of transparency, data and continuous improvement. Our EHS principles include:\n\n- Complying with EHS laws and GE standards.\n- Managing and reducing risk.\n- Reducing our environmental footprint.\n- Monitoring and evaluating performance.\n- Driving operational accountability.\n\nWe maintain a Global EHS Policy and an EHS Enterprise Standard, which set expectations for the GE businesses with responsibility for day-to-day environmental risk mitigation, compliance assurance and EHS culture. Layered on this foundation are the Core Requirement and Technical Standard documents that cover specific safety risk areas such as work at height, confined space, electrical safety and environmental risk areas, including air emissions; spill and release management, prevention and response; and waste and water management.\n\nOur employees complete more than one million EHS courses annually covering regulatory and non-regulatory topics and translated into appropriate languages. The courses are designed and maintained centrally by a team that ensures accuracy, accessibility, and compliance with EHS regulations and GE\u2019s standards. The assignments are done locally by EHS professionals who are able to develop targeted, roles-based training for relevant employees.\n\nWe assess the EHS impacts of our businesses globally using an enterprise-wide system of record for the majority of our EHS data, allowing for robust analysis and trending to be done in order to learn and improve. We track industry standard key performance indicators (KPIs), such as injuries, illnesses, significant environmental events, training completion, and regulatory findings and closures. Framework 2.0, a key element of our EHS management system, measures individual operations against a series of self-assessment questions on environment, health and safety topics. In the environmental defenses element of our framework, organizations are evaluated on air emission sources, air pollution control equipment, water sources and discharges, wastewater treatment equipment and operating conditions, and hazardous and industrial waste collection, management and shipping practices.\n\nThe implementation of these expectations is carried out by a robust network of professionals supporting our sites, services and projects across the globe. Compliance is monitored by these teams of EHS professionals and through a robust reporting and metrics structure.\n\nGE drives an open-reporting culture across compliance and controllership functions, including EHS, in order for issues to be elevated and addressed. Our EHS data is published internally at least quarterly and is available real-time through a system of dashboards maintained at the company and business levels. This proactive use of KPIs and data underscores GE\u2019s commitment to transparency and continuous improvement. EHS performance is reviewed by senior leaders across the company, by our CEO in strategy sessions and by the Board of Directors through the Governance committee. This layering of review ensures visibility and accountability, cornerstones of our EHS program. Audits are conducted at a frequency that reflects the inherent risk and performance of the operation. We also report our performance on key metrics such as spills and releases, air exceedances, and wastewater exceedances to our public stakeholders on our ESG website no less than annually. Our commitment to continuous improvement and risk reduction drives us to analyze EHS events in order to identify corrective actions and prevent recurrence.\n\n1 CFM International is a 50-50 joint company between GE and Safran Aircraft Engines\nEnvironment\n\nOur environmental program\n\nAs with safety, our environmental compliance assurance program includes multiple levels of assessment, including self-inspections, environmental program reviews and audits, and permit reviews, which are conducted jointly by operations and EHS professionals. Operations are expected to review all environmental permits annually and confirm compliance with all permit conditions. In addition to ongoing management of change, each operation is also expected to confirm permit coverage, applicability decisions and exemption criteria, if applicable, at least every three years. In addition to the self-assessments and inspections, governance audits are conducted at a frequency determined by the risk and performance of each operation. Environmental inspections or investigations by regulatory agencies are reported as \u201cevents\u201d and any findings are tracked to closure. Key environmental metrics are reported and tracked at the site, business and company level for the purpose of monitoring performance and ensuring compliance.\n\nReporting and escalation are required in the event of exceedances of permit limits or other emission/discharge standards; failure to obtain, modify or renew existing permits; or discovery of a GE operation, process or source that should be, but is not, covered by a permit. Environmental key performance indicators (KPIs) include framework scores, regulatory finding closure rate, regulatory training completion, severe environmental events, notices of non-compliance, penalties paid, and spills and releases.\n\nDue to the changing nature of GE\u2019s enterprise, figures are periodically updated to reflect changes in scope and as additional information becomes available. For instance, acquired businesses may not have aligned data for the same time periods.\n\n| ENVIRONMENT | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|-------------|------|------|------|\n| ISO 14001 sites | 107 | 97 | 111 |\n| Global Penalties Paid (in $ thousands) | 25 | 25 | 63 |\n| Spills & Releases (Count) | 31 | 24 | 27 |\n| Air Exceedances (Count) | 1 | 10 | 1 |\n| Wastewater Exceedances (Count) | 17 | 11 | 35 |\n\n1 Increase from 2020 to 2021 largely attributable to ongoing impacts of the global pandemic, and re-opening operation growth.\n2 Increase from 2020 to 2021 largely attributable to single physical parameter in stormwater runoff from construction project.\n\nClimate change\n\nClimate change is an urgent global priority. As a company that helps generate one-third of the world\u2019s electricity, we are committed to decarbonizing the energy sector while increasing access to more reliable, sustainable and affordable electricity, including for the 750 million people who lack access.\n\nGE\u2019s climate change performance\n\nHaving met our 2020 emissions reduction targets ahead of schedule, in 2019 we set a new goal to achieve carbon neutrality within our own operations (i.e., Scope 1 and 2 emissions) by 2030. To achieve this goal, our businesses are making operational investments in energy efficiency, reducing emissions from the grid through smart power sourcing and using lean practices to eliminate energy waste. See examples that follow. While we are focused on driving absolute reductions to achieve carbon neutrality, where necessary, we will balance remaining emissions with carbon offsets. GE internally tracks progress to established targets versus a 2019 baseline.\n\nIn 2021, we set an ambition to be net zero by 2050, for the Scope 3 emissions associated with the use of our sold products. We are collaborating closely with our customers, suppliers, policymakers and other companies to turn net zero engineering challenges into business opportunities. For GE Aviation, and GE Power and Renewable Energy, their efforts toward the Scope 3 ambition for their sold products are described in detail on pages 50-53 and 55-55, respectively. GE Healthcare\u2019s efforts are described on page 41.\n\nTo learn more about our Greenhouse Gas Inventory and Energy Inventory process methodology see Appendix I in our 2021 Sustainability Report Appendices.\n\nGE\u2019S CLIMATE CHANGE COMMITMENTS\n\n\u2022 Carbon neutrality for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2030\n\u2022 Ambition to be a net zero company by 2050 for the Scope 3 emissions from use of sold products\n\nIn February 2022, GE was proud to join the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Better Climate Challenge, committing to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% within 10 years. As a partner in DOE\u2019s Challenge, GE is one of more than 80 organizations across the U.S. driving real-world action toward a low-carbon future.

Through internal efforts of the global teams across the business, GE Aviation facilities and operations have reduced their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by more than 20% since 2019.\n\nRENEWABLE ENERGY AGREEMENT FOR FACILITIES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM\n\nIn April 2021, GE Aviation obtained a new energy agreement that included the purchasing of 100% renewable energy supplied to all its facilities located in the United Kingdom. The renewable energy sources included in this contract are wind, biomass, solar power, gas converted from landfills and biodegradable materials. The successful execution of this contract in Q2 2021 avoided approximately 18,000 tons of Scope 2 CO2 indirect emissions at the facilities described above when compared to 2019 levels. The program meets the requirements of the greenhouse gas protocol set by the World Resources Institute for measuring and managing Scope 2 emissions.\n\nENERGY EFFICIENT INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT IN LYNN, MASSACHUSETTS\n\nLynn\u2019s power plant was first built in the 1940s and has been simultaneously supplying electrical and thermal energy through a process called co-generation. The power plant\u2019s four boilers and three steam turbine generator sets were de-commissioned at the end of March 2020. A new central heating plant opened in a refurbished building with new, natural gas boilers, providing steam for heating, manufacturing processes and test operations. By right-sizing the power generation facility for current site needs, it\u2019s more efficient and uses less natural gas and electricity. Since 2020, the Lynn site has decreased its site-wide GHG emissions by 52% by not only investing in the new steam plant system, but also by installing onsite solar panel arrays and partnering with the local utility to take advantage of energy efficiency rebate projects.\n\nUSING LEAN TO REDUCE COSTS AND ENERGY\n\nIn 2021, select GE Aviation locations participated in developing Green value stream maps at their respective sites. Green value stream mapping assessments are targeted kaizen events that assess the current state of a process of operation and seeks to identify green \u201cwaste\u201d opportunities. These opportunities are focused on energy consumption, water usage, waste generation, material waste, transportation and biodiversity. Our Pune, India, team was able to identify over 106 opportunities to reduce its environmental impact by reducing waste in their auto cleaning, Ipsen furnace and flat belt grinding operations. Since the event was held in October 2021, the site has implemented several of the opportunities identified, including optimizing the loading pattern and batch sizes in the Ipsen furnace, saving 20% energy usage on the equipment.\n\nHEALTHCARE\n\nGE Healthcare has an ESG governance structure that develops and leads its business sustainability strategy. One team within that structure is a carbon working group, led by the Chief Supply Chain Officer and focused on delivering on our commitment to an absolute reduction of Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions by at least 50% by 2030, versus a 2019 baseline.\n\nOur carbon reduction strategy includes reducing greenhouse gas releases from our facilities, shifting to renewable energy sources and transitioning to an electric or hybrid fleet. As part of our drive to eliminate energy waste, we carried out eight-week energy reduction workshops for 42 of our larger sites and sites reported on their carbon reduction roadmaps as part of an annual governance review. In 2021, we also developed a roadmap to reduce emissions from our fleet of over 10,000 vehicles and started the process of transitioning vehicles in Europe to electric and hybrid options. We\u2019re also exploring mobility and other efficiency options to further reduce the environmental footprint of our fleet.\n\nAs part of our strategy to transition to renewable energy, in 2021 we transitioned several sites, including our four U.K. sites, five U.S. sites and sites in Bengaluru, India, and Zipf, Austria.\n\nSUPPORTING CARBON REDUCTION PROJECTS AT OUR SITES\n\nGE Healthcare set up an internal instant-access fund to support the highest impact carbon-reduction projects approved by leadership. In 2021, this mechanism financed projects that we anticipate will reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by over 11,000 metric tons, which is equivalent to charging more than 1.4 billion smartphones.10 Funded projects included a chiller optimization project at our Madison, Wisconsin, site in the U.S., which resulted in a greenhouse gas reduction of 1,181 metric tons; an HVAC upgrade project in Cleveland, Ohio, which resulted in a greenhouse gas reduction of 200 metric tons; and installation of a rooftop solar (PV) unit, which resulted in a greenhouse gas reduction of 50 metric tons per year. In 2022, the team installed a heat pump that would replace their gas heat with electric heat, generating it in an energy-efficient manner. The current setup has the potential to reduce greenhouse gases from the heating system by 50 percent.\n\nGOING SOLAR\n\nStaff at our site in Zipf, Austria, have been going on what they call \u201ctreasure hunts,\u201d looking for changes they can make around the facility. The modifications started small: switching off lights when they\u2019re not in use, using less paper, installing waterless urinals, and setting up smart meters to monitor electricity consumption. More recently, their efforts grew. The team installed a rooftop solar (PV) unit, which resulted in a greenhouse gas reduction of 50 metric tons per year. In 2022, the team installed a heat pump that would replace their gas heat with electric heat, generating it in an energy-efficient manner. The current setup has the potential to reduce greenhouse gases from the heating system by 50 percent.\n\nLearn more \u25b6\n\n10 According to U.S. EPA\u2019s Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator.\nGE\u2019s Renewable Energy businesses have leveraged business engagement over the past couple of years and implemented dozens of impactful emission reduction projects in pursuit of its Scope 1 and 2 emission reductions goals. Supported by a central team and with energy managers in its most energy-intensive operations, the Renewables businesses have deployed and maintained two key green lean workstreams. The first focuses on reducing emissions and optimizing energy use in its global manufacturing facilities worldwide, for example, through the installation of newer, more efficient equipment or by changing processes to emit less or require less energy overall. Very frequently, the upfront investment in these projects is paid back in less than two years. The second core workstream is the green electricity drive that pushes and pushes the adoption of green tariffs, the pursuit of onsite solar opportunities, signing of Power Purchase Agreements from new renewable energy assets, and purchasing Energy Attribute Certificates where no other options are available. Local site engagement is very high, and the business benefits from valuable experience and enthusiasm for sustainability across its facilities worldwide.\n\nRENEWABLE ENERGY\n\nThe continuous effort to bring onsite solar generation to as many GE sites as possible brought a new solar installation to our offices in Barcelona, Spain in 2021. Supplementing the local supply, the panels generate approximately 10% of the local energy consumption. 2021 was also the first full year of generation from the new onsite solar installations at the Grid Solutions manufacturing sites in Hapur and Pallavaram, India. The relatively small installations cover 8% and 5% of the sites\u2019 total consumption respectively. Our third Indian Grid Solutions site in Paddapai also implemented an onsite solar project that went online in November 2021, covering 25% of the plant demand with electricity bills through the associated Power Purchase Agreement. India has been one of the most successful regions for cost-effective decarbonization, and the renewable energy teams continue to pursue larger scale projects in the states with significant operations.\n\nRENEWABLE ELECTRICITY PURCHASE PLAYS\n\nIn 2021, GE\u2019s renewable energy businesses completed over 30 energy efficiency and decarbonization projects at 15 sites across three continents. One of the most impactful projects for the year was an SF6 reduction effort by the Grid Solutions team in Clearwater, Florida. SF6, is an extremely potent greenhouse gas according to the Kyoto protocol, with 22,800 times the comparative global warming potential of CO2 and a lifetime of 3,200 years in the atmosphere. While preparing a capital-intensive upgrade of equipment onsite, the team took the opportunity to look at the handling of SF6 onsite with fresh eyes and challenge themselves to redesign the process with a focus on reducing SF6 use altogether. Their efforts paid off with an impressive SF6 reduction equivalent to more than 10k tCO2e compared to the previous year. In another part of the business, the Hydro team in Taubate, Brazil focused on improving energy efficiency of onsite with a project to install LED lighting in all buildings, putting them on track for an annual emissions reduction of approximately 251 tCO2e annually.\n\nENERGY EFFICIENCY AND DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTIONS\n\nIn 2021, GE\u2019s renewable energy businesses completed over 30 energy efficiency and decarbonization projects at 15 sites across three continents.

To strengthen the ability to drive sustainable progress across the value chain, the business partnered with EcoVadis, a leading global company in business sustainability ratings and performance. EcoVadis facilitates individual sustainability performance assessments of the largest suppliers, starting in the Onshore Wind business with the aim of gradually rolling out the program to the other businesses in the portfolio. Looking at the supply chain through a sustainability lens is expected to surface both challenges to address and opportunities to leverage, building resilience and supporting business development. Transparency and baselining are critical components to a robust continuous improvement program and the business sees the supply chain sustainability effort as a critical piece of the evolving supplier partnership strategy.\n\nPOWER\n\nIn support of GE\u2019s carbon neutral commitment described on previous pages, Gas Power has set a target to reduce its operational (Scope 1 & 2) absolute carbon emissions by at least 50% by 2030, based on a 2019 baseline year. Approximately two-thirds of Gas Power\u2019s operational emissions are Scope 2, arising from purchased electricity used in manufacturing. The remaining third is mainly related to natural gas used in the testing of gas turbines, gas for heating, and liquid fuel use.\n\nHOW SOFTWARE IS ACCELERATING SUSTAINABILITY AT GAS POWER\n\nAs part of our efforts to eliminate energy waste and associated emissions and to streamline our environmental reporting, Gas Power is launching an automated energy management (E-meter) system at 13 of our largest sites across 10 countries. The GE-developed digital solution, \u201cDistributed Energy Solution Platform\u201d, enables our facilities to monitor energy use and carbon emissions in real time using Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) capabilities. GE engineers are planning to install data measuring points in 2022 and collect data from electricity, gas, water and industrial sensors to build up the detailed energy consumption profile. The submeters will be pushing consumption data into the cloud every minute. Thanks to the exhaustivity of the data processed by the platform, the GE team will get the immediate and accurate fleet view of the energy efficiency from, for example, the heavy machinery in main workshops, to allow quick performance comparison between similar equipment and allow immediate remediation actions. It has potential to translate into millions in savings and mega tons of GHG emissions reductions.\n\nELIMINATING WASTE: ENERGY AND CARBON KAIZEN\n\nOur Carbon and Energy Savings Kaizen Week was carried out early 2022 with some impressive results. By taking a lean approach to cutting energy consumption, more than 50 teams across 21 sites focused on energy outputs from lighting, HVAC, compressed air, welding, large equipment, transport and recycling, as well as the culture of energy savings. At the end of the Kaizen Week, we achieved an average saving of 7% energy usage per site, with combined savings of 35 million kWh of energy, which equals $3 million in energy costs saved per year. To put it in perspective, over the course of a week, our teams found energy savings equivalent to 25,000 metric tons of CO2, which can power nearly 3,000 U.S. homes and charge more than 3 billion smartphones.*\n\n* According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\n\nIn 2021 our focus has been on reducing our overall energy demand. Energy champions at 13 of our largest sites completed an intensive series of training and treasure hunt workshops, resulting in the identification of over 40 energy reduction projects that could reduce our total operational emissions. More than half of these projects are under implementation, including investment in our E-Meter system that will enable sites to track and manage their energy and carbon performance in real time. The workshop series has been further extended in 2022 through our Carbon and Energy Savings Kaizen Week, which involved 21 site-specific energy assessments.\n\nSCOPE 3 AMBITIONS\n\n- GE Aviation\u2019s actions toward its 2050 Scope 3 net zero ambition, see pages 50-53\n- GE Power & Renewable Energy\u2019s actions toward its 2050 Scope 3 net zero ambition, see pages 33-35\n- GE Healthcare\u2019s approach to Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, see page 43\n\nMike Benson and Nick Willard participated in Kaizen Week at GE Gas Power\u2019s manufacturing facility in Schenectady, NY, USA.\nPolicy engagement and thought leadership on climate action\n\nAs described in this report, GE\u2019s focus on sustainability is to innovate technology to lift up the quality of life for people everywhere. While our focus is on technology and innovation, we know that strong policy, engagement and partnership are critical to success of these shared goals.\n\nCLIMATE POLICY ENGAGEMENT\n\nGE\u2019s efforts on climate change and the energy transition start with GE\u2019s strong support for the Paris Climate Agreement commitments and other ambitious targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GE\u2019s climate change goals). Below we describe GE\u2019s direct and indirect policy engagement and lobbying on climate change, which we believe are in alignment with the Paris Climate Agreement goals. We have been proud to play a visible role in advancing policy and action for climate change, energy transition and sustainability solutions. 2021 was a landmark year for climate change commitments and we see 2022 as a critical year for stronger emphasis on action and partnership.\n\nTo this end, we know that it will take much more than any one company, government or entity to succeed with these climate goals. We are working with peers from a variety of sectors including sustainable finance to implement a 2022 roadmap to translate global commitments into action.\n\nThroughout 2021, we engaged in the public domain to advance thought leadership on how to achieve climate goals for the energy sector through strong policy, technology and investments. For example, GE sponsored a series of events with Axios and Washington Post Live focused on collaboration between the private and public sectors to succeed in the energy transition and decarbonization efforts. These events featured speakers from businesses, government and NGOs to highlight how collaboration is required to address climate change and reduce carbon emissions globally. Learn more.\n\nOur heightened engagement has continued throughout 2022 to help formulate and support policies that advance a just transition and sustainability goals globally. We will continue to offer constructive input to the leaders charged with translating ambitious climate targets into laws, regulations and policies. We know details matter at this stage and we will bring our deep technical experience to educate and join governments and others in the pathways to these climate goals.\n\nINVESTING IN AMERICAN ENERGY\n\nGE supports clean energy tax credits to ensure success in decarbonization efforts and continued U.S. leadership in energy manufacturing and jobs\u2014both today and in the future. In addition to the wind production tax credit (PTC) and 45Q tax credit for carbon sequestration, a comprehensive package of clean energy tax credits would support diverse generation sources, such as wind, solar and nuclear, while creating new incentives for storage (including pumped hydro storage, hydrogen, transmission, as well as manufacturing credits). GE launched a public advocacy campaign to urge Congress and the Biden Administration to enact these policies as soon as possible to provide the U.S. energy industry with certainty and support.

Watch here.\n\nPARIS-ALIGNED LOBBYING REPORT\nConsistent with the policy advocacy previously discussed, GE focuses its climate lobbying efforts on being a constructive voice in advancing policies that further a successful energy transition\u2014the decarbonization of energy while growing access to reliable, sustainable and affordable energy. Our lobbying activities are in furtherance of GE\u2019s climate change goals, including the science and goals expressed in the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and we support policies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable development. For example, GE has worked closely with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to establish the first-ever CO2 emissions standards for aircraft. GE has been on the record in support of the International Market team, and representatives in relevant businesses\u2014allowing for even greater synergies and alignment of our lobbying activities with our climate strategy. As described elsewhere, the CSO also works closely with environmental NGOs, think tanks, industry coalitions, trade associations and other stakeholders to advance these policies.\n\nIn addition to robust board oversight, GE has significant management-level oversight over environmental and political activities. Our climate change and energy transition programs and policies are overseen by GE\u2019s Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO). The CSO has day-to-day responsibility for climate change and sustainability matters and works closely with the Head of Government Affairs and Policy, GE\u2019s International Market team, and representatives in relevant businesses\u2014allowing for even greater synergies and alignment of our lobbying activities with our climate strategy. As described elsewhere, the CSO also works closely with environmental NGOs, think tanks, industry coalitions, trade associations and other stakeholders to advance these policies.\n\nSolving the world\u2019s greatest challenge with the industry\u2019s leading portfolio of technologies\nPhoto Credit: Rich Crowder\n\nADVOCACY THROUGH ORGANIZATIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS\nWe support associations that are leading on climate change solutions, policies and technologies, including nonprofit organizations and trade associations. We partner formally and informally with numerous associations and NGOs around the world that share the mission of addressing climate change, decarbonizing industrial sectors and promoting sustainable development. For example:\n\n- GE is one of the founding strategic partners of the non-profit Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES), an original member of its Business Environmental Leadership Council, and a member of its Board of Directors. GE participates in C2ES research and supports C2ES\u2019 mission to \u201cadvance strong policy and action to reduce GHGs, promote clean energy and strengthen resilience to climate impacts.\u201d\n- GE is an active member of the American Clean Power Association (ACP) and sits on its Board of Directors. ACP is the leading federation of renewable energy companies expediting the advancement of clean energy in the United States.\n- GE is a member of the Carbon Capture Coalition, a nonpartisan collaboration of more than 80 businesses and organizations building federal policy support to enable economically, commercial-scale deployment of carbon capture technologies.\n\nExamples of collaboration with diverse public and private stakeholders in 2021 and 2022 are summarized on pages 31, 40 and 49.\n\nTRADE ASSOCIATIONS\nAs one of the largest and most diverse companies in the world, GE belongs to many associations in which we work with our industry partners. These associations engage in advocacy at the state and federal levels in key jurisdictions around the world on a range of policy topics including energy and climate. Consistent with our direct lobbying, we believe our work with trade associations is in furtherance of, and consistent with, GE\u2019s climate change goals, including the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\nAs a general proposition, we are seeing our trade associations increasingly move in constructive directions toward rallying their members toward climate change and energy transition solutions. For example, we are pleased that, to the best of our knowledge, none of our trade associations with key roles on climate (as discussed below) argued against EPA\u2019s regulatory authority to address climate change before the Supreme Court in West Virginia v. EPA, and that certain GE associations filed briefs in support of EPA.\n\nGE\u2019s policy team works with our trade associations on a regular basis to influence constructive action toward these goals. Annually, we meet with our major U.S. trade associations to review our policy priorities, including stressing the importance of each to align with the Paris Climate Agreement goals and be a force for positive action toward decarbonization and sustainable development goals.\n\nThis is not to say that all trade associations are moving at the same pace, that we expect them to necessarily agree on all policy positions set forth, or that GE agrees fully on all views and positions. There is room for a reasonable divergence of views on various policies and approaches while still constructively advancing efforts toward decarbonization. GE\u2019s role in these circumstances is to be a force of positive direction and to express the views of a multinational industrial company in promoting constructive engagement by the trade associations on these issues. To be clear, GE does not and will not use trade associations as a cloak for climate change policies inconsistent with our own positions detailed above.\n\nWhere we see trade associations potentially advocate for a position different than ours with regard to climate policy, including if a position were misaligned with the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, in the first instance we reach out to the trade association to assert influence toward alignment. Our goal is to communicate in real time and express our positions toward positive change. On these occasions, we have typically found fair reception of our input by the relevant trade associations. We believe this is the better approach to withdrawing membership when disagreements arise as our continued membership in the trade association usually positions us to influence the trade association\u2019s policy positions in ways that better align with our objectives, or because we believe that our continued work with the trade association will help advance other important policy objectives aligned with our interests. At the same time, we would reserve the option of terminating our membership and/or withdrawing financial support if the misalignment with a particular position the trade association supports outweighs the overall benefits to GE of being a member.\n\nGE\u2019S POSITION ON CLIMATE DISCLOSURE REGULATIONS\nGE is monitoring emerging climate and ESG disclosure regulations in the United States, the European Union, and other jurisdictions. GE supports efforts to improve disclosure in these areas that focus on material information, help align existing reporting frameworks, and recognize the evolving maturity of this type of information and reporting across companies broadly. GE aspires to be a constructive and positive voice toward disclosure that is effective and meaningful for our stakeholders while promoting consistency in various reporting regimes.\n\nGE has also expressed these views to several of our trade associations engaged in these rules.\nAs part of this ongoing engagement, GE during the past year undertook an effort to centrally compile a global inventory of trade associations and other relevant organizations that GE was a member of in 2021 and that engaged in policy advocacy related to climate change. For each of those, we conducted an analysis of how much work GE does with the organization and the organization\u2019s level of policy engagement in this space.\n\nFrom this broader list, we identified several trade associations with key roles on climate where we conducted a deeper analysis of each trade association\u2019s specific positions on climate change, and how well those positions aligned with GE\u2019s own policy positions and with the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. We chose these trade associations, listed below, as the most relevant to consider for a more detailed climate position analysis based on factors such as the association\u2019s level of activity or influence on climate-related topics, the relevance of the association\u2019s work to particular GE businesses or markets, and our interest in the association that would be of greatest interest to stakeholders regarding potential Paris Climate agreement alignment or misalignment. The table below provides a summary of the alignment analysis, based on reviews of available policies and positions published by the trade associations.\n\n**THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION (AIA)** is a leading voice in the aircraft, space, and defense industries. The organization advocates for effective federal investments; accelerated deployment of innovative technologies; policies that enhance the aviation industries global competitiveness; and recruitment and retention efforts that support a capable and diverse 21st century workforce.\n\nAIA is committed to playing its part in reducing the climate, noise and air quality impacts of the aviation industry. Last year, AIA announced a net zero-by-2050 target for the U.S. aviation sector\u2019s carbon emissions. Additionally, AIA aims to play a role in decarbonizing aviation by:\n\n1. Expanding investments in leading-edge technology like advanced and zero-emission propulsion.\n2. Advocating for policies that facilitate the increased use of sustainable aviation fuels across the globe.\n3. Partnering with the government to enable and accelerate advancements in technology.\n4. Collaborating with the government to develop the proper regulatory framework to enable commercialization of new technologies.\n5. Partnering with other stakeholders to realize efficiency improvements through the modernization of our airspace.\n6. Advancing climate action under the ICAO, which relies on a global approach to address aircraft emissions.\n7. Working with international partners toward our common goal by sharing information and resources and coordinating with governments around the world.\n\n**THE GAS TURBINE ASSOCIATION (GTA)** is an association comprised of large and small gas turbine manufacturers, associated equipment manufacturers, and leading research universities.

GTA is currently taking a broader look at hydrogen and carbon capture funding opportunities that allow further decarbonization of gas turbine technology.\n\n**EUTURBINES** is a gas and steam turbine industry association aimed at integrating all European manufacturers of the sector, covering all relevant applications. The organization promotes the role of turbine-based power generation in a sustainable, decarbonized European and global energy mix.\n\nEUTurbines supports a sustainable transition of the energy system aiming at decarbonizing the energy sector and has expressed its support of the European Green Deal. EUTurbines advocates for solutions such as renewable-based turbines to help achieve a well-functioning energy system in a future climate-neutral economy, and believes that all economics sectors need to swiftly adapt and drastically reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, starting the energy sector.\n\n**THE CANADIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE** represents over 200,000 businesses with a mission to drive change, partner broadly, and be the undisputed champion and catalyst for the future of business success in Canada.\n\nThe Canadian Chamber of Commerce supports the need for Canada to adopt an efficient and cost-effective approach to climate change. The organization has stated the 2050 net zero target is a necessity.\n\n**AGREEMENT AND GE\u2019S CLIMATE POSITIONS**\n\nGE continues to invest in research and development of hydrogen and similar low-BTU fuel operations and continues to invest in research and development into hydrogen pathways towards zero CO2 emissions. GE was involved in the development of EUTurbines\u2019 H2-readiness definition, which provides a common understanding of hydrogen readiness for new gas power plants.\n\nGE\u2019s efforts to innovate toward a net zero 2050 ambition for aviation are further described on page 50.\n\n**THE GAS TURBINE ASSOCIATION (GTA)** is an association comprised of large and small gas turbine manufacturers, associated equipment manufacturers, and leading research universities. GTA\u2019s primary focus has been on technology programs designed to increase turbine efficiency. GTA advocates for public policies and regulations that support and promote the expanded use of gas turbine technology in all relevant sectors of the economy.\n\nGTA supports developing and implementing a strategy for ensuring reasonable and responsible environmental practices for gas turbines, as well as environmental policy recommendations for communication to regulators and legislators. GTA conducts dialogue regarding the development of a regulatory climate that encourages the use of clean efficient gas turbine applications in new and retrofit installations.\n\nGTA\u2019s advocacy focus is on federal research and development funding to drive carbon emissions out of gas turbines. GTA is currently taking a broader look at hydrogen and carbon capture funding opportunities that allow further decarbonization of gas turbine technology.\n\nGE believes when it comes to gas power, coal-to-gas switching can represent a fast and effective approach for emissions reduction in many regions around the world. In addition, switching turbines from natural gas to hydrogen, and introducing hydrogen capture technology can lead to low or near zero carbon emissions. GE Gas Power is currently the Committee Chair of GTA\u2019s Environmental Affairs Committee, a position we use to encourage GTA to advocate for policies that make continued progress on carbon capture and hydrogen, which will decarbonize gas turbines in the future.\n\nGE\u2019s efforts to innovate toward a net zero 2050 ambition for power are further described on page 33.\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce is the world\u2019s largest business organization representing all sizes of businesses to advocate, partner, and network on a range of topics. The U.S. Chamber advocates for policies that help businesses create jobs and grow the United States economy.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber engages on climate change policy approaches that acknowledge the cost of inaction and the competitiveness of the U.S. economy and advocates for durable solutions that leverage innovation. The U.S. Chamber has stated it supports the Biden Administration\u2019s decision to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber\u2019s climate policy principles are:\n- Support a market-based approach to accelerate greenhouse gas emissions reductions across the U.S. economy\n- Leverage the power of business\n- Maintain U.S. leadership in climate science\n- Embrace technology and innovation\n- Aggressively pursue greater energy efficiency\n- Promote climate resilient infrastructure\n- Support trade in U.S. technologies and products\n- Encourage international cooperation\n- Inaction is not an action\n\nWe believe the U.S. Chamber has progressed on its climate change position. This includes putting forth a comprehensive climate position that includes supporting U.S. participation in the Paris Climate Agreement as well as calling on policymakers to act on climate. Additionally, the Chamber has launched a Task Force open to its membership to inform the organization\u2019s climate policy.\n\nIn 2019, GE joined the U.S. Chamber\u2019s Task Force on Climate Action. This group was focused on helping the U.S. Chamber understand the impact of existing and future policies on businesses and how to proactively address climate change.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber has made progress in recognizing the Paris Climate Agreement and being a convener of companies and governments in pursuit of solutions to climate change at global venues such as COP27, where the Chamber is facilitating engagement between American companies and the Egyptian government. GE routinely engages with the U.S. Chamber policy experts to underscore the importance of supporting the transition to renewable energy, the need for policy support for decarbonizing gas power generation and aviation through carbon capture and alternative fuels, and how clean energy tax incentives will help build a stronger U.S. supply chain.\n\nIn addition to the trade associations discussed above, the following trade associations and other relevant organizations were considered as part of our global inventory of groups engaged in policy advocacy related to climate change. As noted above, we conducted analysis for each of these organizations related to their climate positions and GE\u2019s level of engagement with them.\n\n**ORGANIZATION**\n\n- Airlines for Europe (A4E)\n- Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira da Infraestrutura e Ind\u00fastrias de Base (ABIBD)\n- Aerospace Environmental Group (AEG)\n- Aerospace Industries Association (AIA)\n- American Clean Power\n- Associated Chamber of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM)\n- Australian Energy Council\n- Australian Industry Group\n- Business Council of Canada\n- Business Europe\n- Business Roundtable\n- Business Unity South Africa (BUSA)\n- California Energy Storage Alliance\n- Canadian Chamber of Commerce\n- Canadian Council for Sustainable Aviation Fuel\n- Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters\n- Canadian Nuclear Association (CAN)\n- Carbon Capture Coalition\n- Carbon Utilization Research Council\n- Consejo Coordinador Empresarial (CCE) - Mexico\n- Consejo Ejecutivo de Empresas Globales (CEEG) - Mexico\n- Clean Energy Council - Australia\n- Clean Hydrogen Future Coalition\n- CNI (National Industry Confederation) - Brazil\n- Comex - Peru\n- Comit\u00e9 de prospective de la CRE (Prospective Committee of the Energy Regulation Commission) - France\n- Confederation of Indian Industry (CII)\n- Consumer Energy Alliance\n- Council of American Enterprises (CEAI) - Colombia\n- Energy Solutions\n- Energy Storage Association\n- ETP (European Turbine Association)\n- EuElectric\n- European Association for Storage of Energy (EASE)\n- European Suppliers of Waste to Energy Technology (ESWET)\n- EUWind\n- Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI)\n- The Federation of Industries of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo (FIESP)\n- Gas Turbine Association\n- General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA)\n- Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC)\n- Greater New Orleans, Inc\n- Gridwise Alliance\n- Hydrogen Europe\n- Institute for Business Development of Argentina (IDEA)\n- Keidanren (Japan Business Federation)\n- National Association of Manufacturers (NAM)\n- National Foreign Trade Council\n- Nuclear Energy Institute\n- Ohio Business Roundtable\n- Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) - Pakistan\n- Roundtable for Europe\u2019s Energy Future\n- Russian Union of Industries and Entrepreneurs\n- SER (Syndicate for Renewable Energies)\n- Singapore Business Federation\n- T&G Europe\n- Thai Wind Energy Association\n- The National Hydropower Association\n- Turkish Wind Energy Association\n- U.S. Global Leadership Campaign\n- United States Council for International Business\n- U.S. Chamber of Commerce\n- Waterpower Canada\n- WindEurope\nProduct stewardship\n\nIn response to increasing scarcity of resources and the expectations from customers, investors and regulators for producers to take heightened responsibility for the impacts of products across their full lifecycle, we have developed product stewardship and circularity goals to strengthen our efforts going forward.\n\nProduct stewardship is already a central part of GE\u2019s strategy and culture and ingrained across safety and quality processes, policies and initiatives globally. Our strategy includes continuous improvement via lean principles, which are key to identifying and eliminating waste (see pages 64-65) and employing a sharp focus on product safety (see pages 66-70) across our sites. This includes consistently reviewing and strengthening our policies and practices to improve performance and reduce product-related risks across environment and safety. As today\u2019s technologies evolve, GE is rethinking its approach to product stewardship and embracing the circular economy, for both our own operations and our products. By building on existing circularity programs and product stewardship ambitions to deliver sustainable and responsible products, we continue to rise to the challenge of building a world that works.\n\nGE\u2019S PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP STRATEGY\n\nGoing forward, GE\u2019s businesses will pursue the safety, environment, and external engagement goals identified on these pages in furtherance of a holistic product stewardship strategy.\n\nSAFETY\n\nGoal: Build on our existing safety culture to manage and mitigate product safety risks, meet or exceed compliance and contribute to evolving more ambitious industry standards.\n\nWe consistently aim to raise the standards and performance across our businesses and in the industries in which we operate. Our commitment to safety at all levels, including the safety of our products, will continue to be a top priority at GE. Product safety is a core pillar of product stewardship, from production through use and eventual disposal, reclamation or decommissioning at end of life. It is our ambition to extend current initiatives in how we approach and set product safety standards throughout the life cycle of our products.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nCIRCULAR ECONOMY\n\nGoal: Increase the circularity of our products through reclamation, refurbishment and recycling initiatives, and evaluate the design of our products to incorporate circular thinking.\n\nWe think about product stewardship and circularity standards with a holistic end-to-end view of products, considering their full life cycle and the implications of the deployed energy, materials and water on the environment and product safety. We will align these standards with our decarbonization goals. Product design will play a pivotal role in supporting the transition away from our traditional linear models. Our ambition is to increasingly design our products based on the circularity principles of reducing material, enabling reuse and securing recyclability at end of life.\n\nWATER\n\nGoal: Establish a defined strategy to minimize the water footprint of our products and build on our approach towards water conservation throughout our operations.\n\nWater is a critical resource in the production of our products. We strive to reduce water usage across our direct operations to protect the world\u2019s water reserve. In 2020, we met our goal of reducing water use by 20% compared to our 2011 level, and we know we can do more. As we strengthen our current efforts, we will seek to evaluate direct water consumption to identify opportunities to implement circular principles that minimize the water footprint of our products and report against progress. Read more\n\nMATERIALS\n\nGoal: Develop a deeper understanding of the environmental impacts of our products through mapping material flows, volumes and composition to inform strategy and actions.\n\nWe intend to minimize the environmental footprint of our products, whether it is through redirecting waste materials and packaging destined for landfill or increasing control of hazardous or harmful substances to eliminate adverse environmental impacts.\n\nPARTNERSHIPS\n\nGoals: Leverage our market position to build partnerships within and across industries to deliver innovative solutions.\n\nOver the many years since our inception, we have become well accustomed to playing a critical role in collaborating and convening strategic partnerships to solve some of the systemic and most pressing challenges facing our industries. We intend to pilot circularity initiatives with our customers and partners to test what is feasible.\n\nCOMMUNICATION\n\nGoals: Continue to strengthen our communication and demonstrate clear progress towards meeting our goals.\n\nBy sharing our improvements and learnings in product stewardship and circular economy, we aim to activate conversations and contribute to industry-wide progress towards the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly with regards to SDG12 for responsible consumption and production.\n\nWHAT DO PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP AND CIRCULAR ECONOMY ENTAIL FOR GE?\n\nProduct stewardship represents the responsibility borne by GE for the environmental and safety impacts of our products across their lifecycle. Product stewardship focuses on managing the energy, water and materials that are deployed in the production, use and disposal of a product, along with managing product safety, at all stages of the product life cycle.\n\nIn relation to product stewardship, circular economy is the enabling methodology to manage resources efficiently in a regenerative and restorative way across the product life cycle by viewing waste streams as inputs, reducing dependency on virgin materials by recapturing lost materials and resources, and redirecting them back into the economy.\nThe following are some examples of how we incorporate product stewardship and circularity into our products and those of our customers.\n\n**EXAMPLES OF PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP AT GE**\n\n**Learn more**\n\nmuch of the residual material as possible is recycled.

Today, Skjern Paper is owned by Buur Invest A/S and manufactures 75,000 tons of paper and board products each year from 100% recycled fiber. Through the implementation of GE Digital\u2019s Proficy Clmense software solution, the team has been able to decrease scrap and chemical usage while increasing production capability. In addition to the environmental benefits, Skjern has been able to lower costs as well. Skjern\u2019s environmental and societal commitments extend to the circular economy and membership in the UN Global Compact and its Nordic network.

Currently, there are more than 21,000 total repairs in our catalog to restore worn GE and CFM engine parts to serviceable conditions. Additionally, GE and CFM industrialized more than 1,500 repairs in 2021, increasing repair capability. As a result, GE maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities globally repaired approximately 2.5 million engine components in 2021 using these industrialized processes. Additionally, our used serviceable materials business purchases used engines and parts, performs necessary inspections and repairs, and facilitates return of serviceable parts into the aviation industry. When metal parts are no longer repairable, they are recycled when possible.\n\n**RECLAIMING WASTE AND SCRAP MATERIALS TO IMPROVE END OF LIFE SOLUTIONS**\n\nGE Power works with ELG Utica and its main investment casting supplier to reuse scrap parts with high-temperature alloys. The scrap generated in the manufacturing shops, repair shops, external machining suppliers\u2019 shop and customers sites for end of life engine parts are collected and segregated. The materials are then cleaned and processed for reuse. The circular recycling solution allows GE Power to reduce the portion of virgin materials it uses by capturing value from the manufacturing reverts. In 2021, over 700,000 pounds of were collected for reuse.\n\n**RECYCLING IODINE - KEEPING CONTRAST MEDIA IN THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY**\n\nContrast media is a substance injected into the body to enhance medical imaging. Iodine is commonly used in contrast media for both CT and X-ray imaging. GE Healthcare has been recycling iodine-based contrast media for European healthcare facilities since 2006, but it\u2019s begun to expand its geographic reach and now offers this recycling program in 11 European countries, and last year expanded it into Canada and the United States. In the U.S., over 40% of computed tomography (CT) procedures utilize contrast media.\n\n**WATER**\n\nIn 2020 GE met its goals to reduce freshwater use by 20% compared to 2011. GE has continued this trend in 2021. Water usage captured includes potable, process and sanitary water, as well as once-through cooling water from freshwater sources.\n\nTo track GE\u2019s water usage, GE facilities use a robust, global database to manage our reporting, including quantities of water withdrawn from each of the following source categories:\n\n- Public/commercial\n- Fresh surface water\n- Rainwater\n- Brackish surface water or seawater\n- On-site groundwater well\n\nBeijing has been subject to water scarcity in recent decades. At present, 73% of municipal water in Beijing comes from the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, which involves drawing water from southern rivers and supplying it to the dry north. The cost of municipal water in Beijing is also higher than many other cities. In 2021, GE Healthcare\u2019s manufacturing site in Beijing investigated water reduction opportunities in its production process. One of the production steps when manufacturing surgery tubes is to verify the air tightness by a leakage test. This involves submerging the surgery tube in a water tank. After several attempts, the team successfully replaced the previous leakage test with a dry differential pressure test, reducing fresh water usage by about 21.7 tons per year. This project also helped reduce noise in the factory and improve production efficiency.\n\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/94/1/012132\n\nChina\u2019s South-to-North Water Diversion Project: An ecological masterpiece | china.org.cn\nEnvironmental justice\n\nGE implements its commitment to environmental justice in several ways.\n\nFirst, we are committed to ensuring all communities where we operate realize the strongest environmental protection from our activities. Thus, we work to achieve environmental protection standards for all communities to the same extent regardless of the scope of applicable local regulations, if any.\n\nSecond, we strongly believe access to affordable, reliable and sustainable electricity is critical to reducing poverty and hunger and promoting access to education and healthcare for all people. As described on page 22, we are passionate about succeeding in the energy transition in a way that brings reliable electricity to everyone in a sustainable way. This technology plays a key role in helping governments reach their Paris Agreement goals, while also promoting the UN SDGs, which we believe are the blueprint to achieving a better and more sustainable future for all. (See pages 7-10).\n\nThird, we support policies to clean up and redevelop idle contaminated properties into new hubs of economic growth and job creation. As described below, we are implementing an initiative to invest in remediating brownfields\u2014contaminated vacant properties that could serve better purposes once cleaned up\u2014particularly for public benefit in impacted and underserved communities.\n\nBrownfields\n\nAs with any long-standing industrial company, GE owns many former manufacturing properties that are no longer core GE assets. These properties can be found anywhere from thriving manufacturing hubs to small towns and rural areas. GE has committed to stewarding these unused properties responsibly back to productive reuse in a way that stimulates economic growth and community development, avoids blight and redirects GE\u2019s financial assets back to GE\u2019s operations. For certain parcels with lengthy operating histories, this commitment can prove costly and time-consuming due to obsolete infrastructure and environmental impacts.\n\nBeginning in 2012, GE founded its Brownfields Program to focus on repurposing the company\u2019s former industrial assets. The team categorizes its sites for action into two groups\u2014those properties with minimal impact that can be repurposed quickly, and those properties with highest priority EJ properties. GE will work hand-in-hand with local governments, private groups, property experts and technical resources to define reuse plans that buttress community goals and catalyze sustainable economic development. Strategies under consideration include improved neighborhood drainage and flood relief; green energy/ electric car infrastructure; industrial repurposing; and community solar installations.\n\nOutside the U.S., GE is also screening its underutilized properties to target cleanup and redevelopment investments in disadvantaged communities. Several potential properties were identified for action in 2021. We are now identifying community collaborators to work with GE to target cleanup and infrastructure investments that will help achieve local goals.\n\nGE\u2019S ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE INITIATIVE AND FOCUS ON BROWNFIELDS\n\nBeginning in 2019, GE enhanced its Brownfields Program to prioritize cleanup and redevelopment of idle contaminated properties in environmental justice (EJ) communities. The White House and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have defined EJ neighborhoods as those with disadvantaged populations that are most heavily impacted by historic industrial activity and least able to bear this burden. In many EJ communities, financial investment falters and commercial opportunities lag despite property cleanup. This leaves neighborhoods with vacant buildings or empty parcels that create blight and reduce further investment.\n\nGE is committed to remediating and repurposing its contaminated vacant properties in EJ communities to help establish new hubs of economic growth that create jobs and to assist EJ communities to remove barriers that hamper realization of community benefits. Using EJScreen (developed by the U.S. EPA) and the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (released by the Council on Environmental Quality), GE reviewed its full inventory of more than 100 owned, underused properties in the U.S. to identify the 53 parcels that are located in EJ communities. Focusing on these parcels, we have worked to define those barriers that discourage reinvestment and meaningful reuse, seeking community partners to help define local needs.\n\nLocal EJ community leaders have shared one of their most pressing needs is financial investment to remove obsolete buildings and infrastructure. In response, GE has committed more than $40 million to demolish its obsolete structures in EJ neighborhoods. Demolition is complete in Goldsboro, Kansas City, and St. Louis, Missouri, and is underway in Memphis, Tennessee. Remaining projects will continue through 2023.\n\nEJ community leaders also identified site remediation and real estate repurposing as primary community needs. GE has undertaken environmental investigation and cleanup at more than 45 of its highest priority EJ properties. GE will work hand-in-hand with local governments, private groups, property experts and technical resources to define reuse plans that buttress community goals and catalyze sustainable economic development. Strategies under consideration include improved neighborhood drainage and flood relief; green energy/ electric car infrastructure; industrial repurposing; and community solar installations.\n\nClean interior in North Bergen, New Jersey.\n\nMercury line removal and restoration in Lexington, Kentucky.\n\nNORTH BERGEN, NEW JERSEY\n\nDisadvantaged community (EJScreen)\n\nGE acquired the 7-acre GE NY Service Center in 1956 to operate as the consolidated regional electrical equipment support facility for GE and its customers. Through this location serviced electric motors, steam and gas turbine components, railroad components, switch gear and motor generators. Operations resulted in the unintended release of polychlorinated biphenyls and solvents, both of which impacted the building. Beginning in 2018, with the approval of federal and state regulators, GE cleaned and refurbished the building and remediated soil to prepare the site for future commercial or industrial reuse. GE sold the property in 2021 to a local company that distributed industrial cleaning and disinfection supplies regionally to support COVID-19 workplace safety.\n\nALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO\n\nDisadvantaged community (EJScreen)\n\nFor more than 40 years, beginning in 1967, GE Aviation fabricated military and commercial aircraft engine components at Former Air Force Plant 85, a 24-acre parcel in Albuquerque, New Mexico. After local officials detected solvent contamination in a city drinking water well, Plant 85 and another industrial facility were identified as potential sources. In 1983, USEPA added the site to Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) as the South Valley Superfund Site. In cooperation with regulators, GE demolished buildings, treated site soils and remediated groundwater impacts. In September 2019, the U.S. EPA determined that \u201call appropriate response actions, have been completed,\u201d and deleted Plant 85 from the NPL. GE sold the North Plant area in 2021 to a local construction firm to manage building materials and is planning to sell the South Plant area in 2022.\n\nLEXINGTON, KENTUCKY\n\nBeginning in 1946, GE constructed and operated the 200,000 square-foot Lexington Lamp Plant on 17 acres in Lexington, Kentucky. The plant manufactured sealed beam automotive and specialty headlamps along with incandescent bulbs. After the plant ceased operating in August 2017, GE decommissioned equipment, thoroughly cleaned the building and voluntarily investigated site soil and groundwater conditions. GE identified elemental mercury within vacuum lines, industrial sewers and cooling water return lines as a significant concern for building reuse. From November 2018 through March 2019, GE removed overhead process lines and below-ground industrial sewer and cooling water lines. Soils surrounding lines were also removed if mercury was detected. These extensive cleaning efforts allowed GE to restore the building for appropriate reuse. In 2021, GE sold the facility to a regional business to expand its growing commercial property management operations.\nCleaning up legacy sites\n\nWe are committed to managing sites that are, or may be, impacted with legacy contamination arising from current or former manufacturing operations with the utmost care, ensuring the health and safety of our workers, the communities in which these sites are located and the environment. Further, we manage our remedial actions at these sites in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, as well as applicable federal financial reporting and reserve requirements. In most cases, we work in collaboration with the appropriate federal, state or global environmental regulatory authorities charged with management of these sites; and also work with other key stakeholders (e.g., local municipalities, the public, etc.) to encourage dialogue and communications that can be factored into our remedial decision making.\n\nWe employ a matrixed resource approach to remedial site management, utilizing a wing-to-wing team of in-house and external environmental professionals and other subject matter experts (i.e., technical, legal, finance and communications personnel) to manage the full life cycle of a remedial project, from investigation to remediation, to potential maintenance and monitoring obligations. We draw upon the experience and expertise of this team of experts to develop strategies that utilize state-of-the-art technologies and best management practices necessary to remediate and, in some cases, redevelop these sites and return them back to the local communities for productive reuse. From a program management perspective, we utilize lean principles to drive long-term solutions for the environment and company, in addition to helping identify process and programmatic issues requiring improvement, and helping to drive more accountability across the team.\n\nGE recognizes contaminated sites can be concerning and controversial issues for surrounding communities. GE works to develop solutions in consensus with key regulators and the public to the fullest extent possible. For a certain subset of GE-owned legacy contaminated sites (i.e., Brownfields), GE is also focused on cleaning up those sites to facilitate redevelopment and repurposing in the communities where those sites are located. Once a remedy is decided, GE aims to exceed expectations on timing of implementation and efficacy of the outcome. Some of our most significant projects that were designed and implemented in close collaboration with government agencies and other stakeholders are reflected below.\n\nHOUSATONIC RIVER: REMEDY DESIGN UNDERWAY\n\nTwenty years ago, GE committed to work with the U.S. EPA, Massachusetts and Connecticut, and local communities to clean the first 2 miles of the Housatonic River, as well as to develop a process that would govern remedy selection for the Rest of River. In 2020, we reached an agreement with the EPA and local communities that makes good on our longstanding commitment to a comprehensive cleanup of the Housatonic River that protects the environment.\n\nIn addition to the more than $500 million of environmental projects that we\u2019ve completed in the Pittsfield area over the years, GE has recently pivoted towards the next phase of river cleanup following the 2020 agreement. GE is currently working to design the \u201cRest of River\u201d remedy by submitting various site-wide work plans as well as reach-specific sediment, riverbank, and floodplain soils sampling plans.\n\nIn 2022, EPA\u2019s administrative court, the Environmental Appeals Board, upheld the 2020 agreement and the final permit became effective in March 2022. GE is committed to moving forward with the work required to address the environmental condition of the river and the surrounding areas.

EDWARD MARKEY, D-MASSACHUSETTS\n\nHudson River\n\nEnvironmental conditions in the Upper Hudson River in New York State continue to improve since GE\u2019s completion of a historic dredging project in 2016. PCB levels in water have dropped at every monitoring station. PCB levels in sediment have dropped as much as 96% and in samples representing all fish species by as much as 59%. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has said it expects these improvements will continue. In 2021, GE removed the former manufacturing buildings at its Fort Edward, N.Y., property, as it did previously at its nearby Hudson Falls, N.Y., property, and is working with New York State on additional remediation there. GE and EPA are also assessing Upper Hudson shorelines to determine whether, where and what form of remediation may be appropriate.\n\nLearn more \u25b6\n\n\u201cHudson River PCB Superfund dredging project has been a success...

Following remediation, the site, which began operating in 1947, will allow beneficial redevelopment. Early facility operations generated a waste stream composed of broken glass and lighting components, some containing mercury, which was placed in selected areas of the site to fill low spots. A comprehensive environmental investigation confirmed widespread shallow soil contamination consistent with the historic production of lighting products on the property.\n\nFollowing approval of the Remedial Action Plan by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), National Capital Region, the demolition of all structures and the removal of contaminated materials at the Site began. Non-contaminated demolition debris is crushed for reuse on site, which reduces off-site transport and minimizes the effect of the remediation on traffic in this densely populated area as much as possible. Wherever possible, metal building materials were segregated for recycling. Materials containing mercury and other contaminants were excavated and bagged under controlled conditions (dust and vapor suppression). Prior to disposal, contaminated material had been treated at a licensed waste management facility to immobilize contaminants. Excavation of contaminated materials began in February 2021 and is anticipated to be completed in July 2022.\n\n\u201cMAKATI, PHILIPPINES\u201d\n\nGE is remediating its former incandescent and fluorescent lighting products manufacturing site in Makati, Philippines.

We released our GE Human Rights Report in 2022 to provide greater transparency into how we run our human rights program, from our suite of governance documents to our due diligence program. This report details our program with respect to our own workers, those of our suppliers and the communities affected by GE operations and business relationships. Read our GE Human Rights Report here.\n\nIn 2006, GE was among the first American companies to issue a Human Rights Statement of Principles reflecting our commitment, among other things, to respect fundamental labor rights including the prohibition of forced and child labor in GE operations and those of our suppliers. It is the cornerstone of our global program, grounding our commitment to human rights in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact. Driven by those standards, we strive to respect the fundamental dignity of everyone we might affect directly through our operations, products and services, and indirectly through our business relationships across the globe. Our ideals flow from the International Bill of Human Rights, the International Labor Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. We seek to treat everyone affected by our business and value chain\u2014including employees (see Respectful Workplace), workers, customers and communities\u2014with fairness and dignity.\n\n\u201cAt GE, we\u2019re also focused on improving our impact on our people, communities and planet.

These policies are embedded throughout GE\u2019s business operations through enterprise standards and policy documents and implementation.\n\nGE has implemented operational requirements for businesses known as the Human Rights Enterprise Standard, which helps businesses identify and understand the salient human rights risks across the company and how they are expected to respond to those risks. The Enterprise Standard sets out minimum requirements that businesses must adhere to regarding risk assessment and identification, due diligence of third parties and escalation and remediation of any concerns related to human rights. It provides practical guidance and best practices for business implementation to mitigate human rights risk within our operations.\n\nThe Human Rights Working Group, led by our Global Human Rights Counsel, meets regularly to discuss the implementation of the standard and the evolving landscape of human rights issues and risks in the communities we serve. To read more about our governance process, please see our GE Human Rights Report.\n\nSALIENT RISKS\n\nA recent company-wide global human rights assessment conducted by a leading human rights advisory firm identified four priority issue areas for salience and impact: climate and energy; product stewardship; worker welfare; and community welfare.\n\nBoth worker welfare and community welfare capture the rights of stakeholders upstream and downstream throughout the value chain; they each also capture the potential to shape the world for good through the lens of the UN SDGs.\n\nThe analysis of worker and community welfare across our value chain resulted in seven salient rights:\n\n1. Modern Slavery\n2. Child Labor\n3. Freedom of Association\n4. Just Working Conditions\n5. Right to Health Environment\n6. Right to Security of the Person\n7. Indigenous Rights\n\nWe detail our salient risks in our GE Human Rights Report.\n\nSTAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENTS\n\nGE engages with external stakeholders to identify human rights risks throughout our value chain and collaborates with peers, experts and civil society groups to seek practical solutions. As a founding member of the Global Business Initiative on Human Rights, GE works with multinational corporations through a cross-industry peer learning platform to embed respect for human rights into business operations, drive improvements with peer learning, bring focus to emerging challenges and identify solutions.\n\nBased on our engagement with the Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment (LGRR), GE adopted and implemented the Employer Pays Principle with respect to any recruitment fees and prohibits the types of actions associated with the most common forms of modern slavery, including the withholding of immigration documents and misleading recruitment tactics. As one of its initiatives, LGRR works with GE and member companies to create demand for responsible recruitment by raising awareness about the benefits of ethical practices and developing tools to help companies implement the Employer Pays Principle.\n\nSince 2008, GE has been an active participant in the United Nations Global Compact aligning with the Ten Principles of the UNGC around human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. Over the years, GE partnered with the UNGC on initiatives such as the Human Rights Dilemmas for Multinational Corporations in Emerging Markets and most recently participated in its Young Sustainable Development Goals Innovators Program.\n\nOur human rights program depends on the practical understanding of our people and business partners. Taking a multi-faceted approach helps to address the human rights challenges GE faces in the various markets we serve and operate in. We provide employees with learning modules on human rights and forced labor; company-wide policies and programs; the causes and global footprint of forced labor; and, most importantly, how they can serve a role in identifying and reporting possible signs of human rights issues when they are at GE operations, supplier facilities or customer sites. GE strives to continuously improve our procedures to identify, prevent, mitigate and remedy our salient human rights impacts. To learn more about our program, see our GE Human Rights Report.\nEthical supply chain and responsible mineral sourcing\n\nGE is committed to upholding integrity and high standards of business conduct in our dealings with suppliers. Since 2002, GE has implemented an extensive supplier responsibility governance (SRG) program to build and strengthen an ethical, sustainable and transparent global supply chain and establish clear social and environmental responsibility requirements for suppliers.\n\nAll suppliers must contractually commit to the GE Integrity Guide for Suppliers, Contractors and Consultants, which requires suppliers to strictly comply with laws, provide a safe and healthy work environment and meet GE\u2019s standards of ethical conduct relating to human rights, the fair treatment of workers, environmental protection and resource conservation. GE explicitly prohibits suppliers from using child, prison, forced or indentured labor and subjecting workers to any form of compulsion, coercion or human trafficking. We further require that our first-tier suppliers cascade the requirements of the GE Integrity Guide to their sub-tier suppliers. Under this multi-faceted ethical supply chain program, suppliers are prioritized for detailed pre-engagement and periodic follow-up, onsite assessments based on country risks (including human trafficking risk), supplier past performance and other factors, such as media reports or supplier employee complaints.\n\nThe SRG program uses a systematic approach for assessing risks in our supply chain, monitoring and improving supplier performance.\n\nOur approach includes:\n\n- A country risk assessment, updated every two years, incorporating manufacturing risk along with human rights risk assessments lifted from third party data and risk indices.\n- Clear risk assessment criteria to prioritize suppliers for audits depending upon factors such as their location, if they are producing parts that will be incorporated into GE products and/or if they use labor brokers to recruit migrant workers.\n- A rigorous auditing program using trained and certified SRG auditors, to assess conformance with our requirements prior to onboarding.\n- Monitoring the continued compliance and improvement of existing suppliers using thorough on-site audits at a typical frequency of one to five years based upon the supplier\u2019s risk profile.\n- Recorded, tracked and monitored, all SRG audit findings must be in our proprietary reporting tool. The supplier must rectify issues in a timely manner. We track all issues to closure, with verification of the elimination or appropriate mitigation of such risks. GE will suspend all purchase orders under the contract, should the supplier not mitigate or eliminate issues as required by the corrective action plan.\n- Continual evaluation of new methods to assess and manage risk in our supply chain and effectively address the evolving challenges and risks. For example, following the pandemic restrictions in 2020 and 2021, GE allowed the option of desktop remote audits for suppliers so our auditing program could continue. Applying the same scope and questionnaire used in the on-site audits, our remote audits relied on digital tools to allow suppliers to provide supporting documentation and to verify the closure of audit findings. GE continues exploring options to improve our virtual auditing capabilities performed internally and externally.\n\nAUDITING GE\u2019S GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN\n\nOur goal is to work with suppliers to bring them into compliance and drive sustainable improvements in their operations and practices. However, in the event of a serious violation of law, human rights or GE\u2019s code of conduct, GE will act to immediately cease the business relationship.\n\nThe SRG program drives GE\u2019s ability to continuously assess, monitor and drive improvement in its supply chain. More importantly, through our regular communication and engagement with our suppliers, we can build their capability to improve their compliance, environment, health and safety practices and respectful workplace practices and reduce human rights and modern slavery risks.\n\nRESPONSIBLE MINERAL SOURCING\n\nAligned with GE\u2019s SRG program, GE strives to assure our supply chains are ethical and sustainable when obtaining products containing tin, tantalum, tungsten, gold (known collectively as \u201c3TG\u201d), cobalt and mica, which are common constituents of many of our products from aircraft engines to wind turbines. GE is committed to working to eliminate from our products all \u201cconflict minerals\u201d that potentially finance armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), its adjoining countries or other conflict-affected and high-risk areas (CAHRAs). GE\u2019s Responsible Mineral Sourcing Principles outline GE\u2019s commitment to respecting human rights through responsible sourcing practices when it comes to sourcing products containing these minerals.\n\nGE prohibits use of forced or child labor in its operations and supply chain and proactively addresses these concerns through its Ethical Supply Chain Program. We recognize conflict is just one of the risks related to mineral sourcing where critical issues such as poverty, environmental degradation, child labor and general inequality must be addressed as well.\n\nEach year, we undertake reasonable due diligence to determine if any of our products containing 3TG originated in the DRC or other CAHRAs. We then file a report with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on the use of 3TG in our products and the outcome of our 3TG sourcing due diligence. For additional information, see our most recent Conflict Minerals Report here.\n\nIn the U.S., GE has 21 collective bargaining agreements throughout its businesses that represent over 5,700 employees. GE has a long history of industrial peace and comity with its unions, in part because freedom of association is a core value. Consequently, GE has enjoyed respectful and successful negotiations with its labor unions for many years. Here are some of the labor unions representing U.S. employees: the International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers\u2014Communications Workers of America; the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers; the United Auto Workers; the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers; the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers; and the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing, Pipefitting and Sprinkler Fitting Industry of the United States and Canada.\n\nGE\u2019s relationship with employee-representative organizations outside the U.S. takes many forms, especially in the EU. We estimate our employees are represented by approximately 200 representative organizations, including our China headquarters in Shanghai. In Latin America, nearly 12,000 of our employees are represented by unions.\n\nFor transnational matters, in 2018 we put in place a new GE European Works Council (EWC) structure; it comprises a Central Committee focused primarily on enterprise-wide issues, together with four business-specific committees in respect of our GE Renewable Energy, Power, Healthcare, and Aviation divisions. Those committees enable the exchange of information and inputs between senior leaders of the company and European employees\u2019 representatives. Together, GE EWC now covers approximately 99% of our European workforce, providing a voice to more than 53,000 employees.\n\nIn China, 21 of our 43 GE legal entities have unions representing nearly 13,000 employees, all affiliated with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, including our China headquarters in Shanghai. In Latin America, nearly 12,000 of our employees are represented by unions.\n\nFreedom of association\n\nGE Renewable Energy, hydro facility in Grenoble, France.\nNext Engineers: Increasing the diversity of young people in engineering\n\n\u201cAs I see engineers who look like me, I know I do belong. I want to be that inspiration for others.\u201d\n\nThese encouraging words are from Kyla W., a high school student in Greenville, South Carolina, and a member of the GE\u2019s Next Engineers Engineering Academy, a three-year transformative learning experience to help students learn to think and act like engineers.\n\nAt GE, we\u2019re tackling some of the world\u2019s biggest challenges. I have a front-row seat to watching GE engineers wrap their minds and hands around what it means to create towering offshore wind turbines, ultrasounds that fit in the palm of your hand and jet engines that are more fuel-efficient. Engineers are critical to building a world that works and to do it, we\u2019ll need a diversity of voices and perspectives.\n\nThat\u2019s why the GE Foundation was excited to launch Next Engineers a global college- and career-readiness program in four cities where GE employees live and work: Cincinnati, Ohio, and Greenville, South Carolina, in the U.S., along with Johannesburg, South Africa and Stafford, U.K. Next Engineers is committed to increasing the number of diverse innovators and leaders who will make what\u2019s next for the world even better.\n\nIn the first six months alone, we\u2019ve made quick progress. We\u2019ve held 34 Engineering Discovery events, engaging more than 2,800 students to build awareness about what engineers do. These sessions are led by GE employees to inspire young people and expand their understanding of what engineering is all about. We launched the Engineering Academy with up to 50 students in each city to equip them with the skills they need to build an engineering identity and career. We are thrilled that nearly 60 percent of applications came from students from diverse backgrounds. And we\u2019re gearing up to host our first Engineering Camps to help immerse students in the engineering process through a week-long experience.\n\nNext Engineers is showing students in these four communities that there\u2019s an engineer in everyone and I can\u2019t wait to meet the builders, dreamers and innovators who will join us along the way.\n\nFrom our hometown of Boston to cities around the globe, the GE Foundation is achieving its mission of transforming our communities and shaping the diverse workforce of tomorrow. I am grateful to our partners and our employees for making lasting changes in locations worldwide.\n\nLINDA BOFF\nPresident, The GE Foundation and Vice President, GE\n\nDEVELOPING ENGINEERING AND OTHER TECHNICAL SKILLS\n\nNext Engineers is a global college- and career-readiness program to increase the diversity of young people in engineering. The program provides students ages 13 to 18 with first-hand experiences in engineering concepts and careers, and ultimately awards partial scholarships to pursue higher education in engineering. In 2021, the GE Foundation launched Next Engineers in four cities: Cincinnati, Ohio, and Greenville, South Carolina, in the U.S., along with Johannesburg, South Africa and Stafford, U.K.\n\nNext Engineers offers three inspiring programs to engage students on their paths to engineering studies:\n\n\u2022 Engineering Discovery for students ages 13 to 14 and their guardians with the goal of increasing awareness through multiple one-hour exploratory experiences and hands-on activities connecting students to real engineers. Sessions are delivered by volunteers in the classroom or in the community to inspire youth early and highlight the broad array of engineering careers.\n\n\u2022 Engineering Camp for students ages 14 to 15 with the goal of developing engineering identities through a week-long immersive camp experience over school break where students interact with experienced engineering faculty and staff, complete design challenges solving real-world problems, and interact directly with professional engineers and business leaders.\n\n\u2022 Engineering Academy for students ages 15 to 18 with the goal of guiding and encouraging students to pursue engineering degrees. Engineering Academy is a three-year college readiness program for upper secondary students that helps them learn to think and act like engineers and prepare them to select and succeed at an engineering major at the university level. Students accepted to higher education engineering programs will also receive a scholarship from the GE Foundation.\n\nGiven GE\u2019s plan to form three industry-leading, global public companies in the next few years, the GE Foundation will only deploy Next Engineers in these four communities. We are proud of the impact the program is having and remain committed to inspiring the next generation of engineers and innovators, wherever their careers take them. We look forward to seeing the strategic direction each of the three companies will develop and launch, including their own philanthropic and community engagement program.\n\nPROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS\n\n2,800+ students engaged in Engineering Discovery events\n\n198 Engineering Academy students in year one\n\n60% Engineering Academy applications from diverse backgrounds\n\nOPPORTUNITIES TO EXPLORE AND DISCOVER\n\nEngineering Discovery builds awareness about what engineers do through a variety of short, exploratory sessions led by GE engineers.

From mobile STEM labs to coding bootcamps and STEM Internships and scholarships, GE Foundation connected more than 6,100 Boston Public School students to STEM career paths for a technology-driven workforce. Programs continuing in 2021 and beyond include:\n\n- **Science Education**: Funding was aligned to support high-quality science education by expanding access to standards-aligned curricula across the district and building educator capacity by deploying a coaching model dedicated to science instruction. In 2021, the program provided access to digital learning platforms for 54,000 students. More than 250 educators were trained on expanding science curricula in 15 elementary schools serving more than 5,000 students.\n\n- **COVID-19**: Funding was aligned to support academic learning loss due to closures of schools to in-person learning during the 2020\u20132021 academic year. The initiative will offer grant funding to schools to provide targeted interventions and acceleration academies during out-of-school time to help close academic learning gaps caused by the pandemic. To date, the acceleration academies have been held in 66 schools with over 8,000 students attending.\n\nSTEM EDUCATION IN BOSTON\n\nIn 2021, these organizations awarded 20 scholarships to students studying engineering, ranging from $5,000 to $40,000. In late 2021, GE Foundation included two more organizations\u2014the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) and Society of Woman Engineers (SWE)\u2014that will be providing 42 students $10,000 scholarships over the next two years. The GE Foundation is also supporting an innovative development program with the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC) called CyberReadyMBE\u2122. The cyber program will help prepare minority business enterprises (MBEs) for contract opportunities with the U.S. government and with corporations across the U.S. The cyber program aims to improve MBEs\u2019 capabilities in a growing industry by helping companies get designated as cyber ready, provide them with cyber readiness pathways and connect designated MBEs to contract opportunities. The program launched with a Chicago pilot in late 2021 with 23 MBEs. The program invited the MBEs to attend the National Cyber Summit sessions on cyber awareness and readiness and conducted cyber and a workforce gap assessment. The MBEs who are cyber ready will be designated by National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC), boosting their ability to operate, be competitive and win contracts.\n\nADVANCED MANUFACTURING IN MASSACHUSETTS\n\nWhile advanced manufacturing is one of the largest economic and employment sectors in Massachusetts\u2019 economy, there remains a skills gap across the state with the number of open jobs exceeding the availability of skilled workers. In November 2019, the GE Foundation announced a $2.5 million grant to launch the Advanced Manufacturing Training Expansion Program (AMTEP) in Lynn and Massachusetts\u2019 North Shore. In October 2021, GE Foundation announced a $4.4 million grant to extend funding through 2025. The multi-year program complements the Massachusetts Baker-Polito administration\u2019s Workforce Skills Cabinet and will triple the region\u2019s training footprint, reaching more than 900 high school students and adult learners and building a more diverse, sustainable, \u201cready-to-work\u201d pipeline in Lynn and across Massachusetts\u2019 North Shore. The GE Foundation also contributed $1 million to support the expansion of the state-of-the-art Advanced Manufacturing Center at Lynn Vocational Technical Institute (LVTI), which was bolstered by a match from the Baker-Polito administration. To date, AMTEP has reached 205 participants for the adult programming and is supporting 130 youth in machining pathways at LVTI, Essex North Shore Agricultural & Technical School and Gloucester High School.\n\nWORKFORCE DIVERSITY AND ECONOMIC INCLUSION\n\nEducation is a significant driver of economic inclusion. With a long history of education and workforce diversity programs, the GE Foundation made a $2 million commitment in October 2020 with initial support to five organizations focused on training and education:\n\n- National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), Jackie Robinson Foundation (JRF), Advancing Minorities\u2019 Interest in Engineering (AMIE) and National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering (NACME) were initially funded by the GE Foundation to provide scholarships, leadership development and mentoring programs to help diverse high school students pursue higher education in STEM fields. In 2021, these organizations awarded 20 scholarships to students studying engineering, ranging from $5,000 to $40,000.\n\n- In late 2021, GE Foundation included two more organizations\u2014the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) and Society of Woman Engineers (SWE)\u2014that will be providing 42 students $10,000 scholarships over the next two years. The GE Foundation is also supporting an innovative development program with the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC) called CyberReadyMBE\u2122. The cyber program will help prepare minority business enterprises (MBEs) for contract opportunities with the U.S. government and with corporations across the U.S. The cyber program aims to improve MBEs\u2019 capabilities in a growing industry by helping companies get designated as cyber ready, provide them with cyber readiness pathways and connect designated MBEs to contract opportunities. The program launched with a Chicago pilot in late 2021 with 23 MBEs. The program invited the MBEs to attend the National Cyber Summit sessions on cyber awareness and readiness and conducted cyber and a workforce gap assessment. The MBEs who are cyber ready will be designated by National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC), boosting their ability to operate, be competitive and win contracts.\n\n- **ENABLING HIGHER EDUCATION**: GE Foundation established the GE STAR Awards program in 1984 to provide competitive scholarships to children of eligible GE employees around the world. Since then, almost 15,000 awards have been given worldwide, totaling more than $20 million. The winners are chosen based on their academic record, extracurricular activities and community service, and personal experiences and goals as described in personal essays.\n\n- \u201cSmall acts when multiplied by millions of people, can transform the world,\u2019 this quote is my inspiration for all things in life. To make a change for the better you have to start small, no matter how big your goal might be. In the future, I hope to help underdeveloped countries with their healthcare system. The pandemic has shed light on the need for a change to occur in many countries\u2019 healthcare systems. To achieve my goal, I\u2019m starting small by volunteering for our local hospital, setting up blood drives at my school, committing for the pre-med track at the University of Pittsburgh and keeping myself informed on the issues at hand regarding healthcare system.\u201d\n\n- **CHAD**: AMTEP Graduate\n\n- **ADVANCED MANUFACTURING GRADUATION**: 25 adult learners graduated from the Advanced Manufacturing Training Expansion Program at Essex North Shore Agricultural & Technical School.\n\n- **LYNN VOCATIONAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE**: The GE Foundation contributed $1 million to support the expansion of the state-of-the-art Advanced Manufacturing Center in Lynn, Massachusetts, which was bolstered by a match from the Baker-Polito administration (photo credit: Joshua Qualls/Governor\u2019s Press Office).\n\n- **STUDENT HIGHLIGHTS**: During COVID-19, AMTEP pivoted between remote learning and hybrid models to continue enrollment, program completion and transition to employment for AMTEP candidates. Throughout the pandemic, the program hosted virtual job fairs with local employers and, to date, more than 80% of program graduates have secured employment in advanced manufacturing positions.\nDeveloping health\n\nThe GE Foundation\u2019s signature programs, Developing Health Globally\u2122 (DHG) and Developing Health U.S. (DH), have a long history of increasing access to quality healthcare in underserved communities around the world. These programs have been funded and managed by the GE Foundation in collaboration with national ministries of health, public and private health facilities, non-governmental organizations and academia.\n\n\u2022 An extensive network of local trainers and mentors, including 67 anesthesia trainers in Ethiopia alone and a global network of resources through Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes);\n\u2022 The deployment of the Safe Surgery Organizational Readiness Tool (SSORT) enable facilities to assess their readiness to deploy the changes required for implementation of safety and quality improvements; and\n\u2022 Development of a detailed program to enable nations to create and implement their own National Surgical, Obstetric and Anesthesia Plans (NSOAP) to change policy, build surgical workforce capacity, test and implement new innovations and contribute evidence to further improvements in surgical access and quality.

Project ECHO is an innovative model that builds the capacity of and relays primary care providers to treat more patients with chronic, complex conditions, exponentially expanding access to care. Through a $14 million, multi-year commitment made in 2015, the GE Foundation, as one of the largest funders of Project ECHO, has supported global replication and scale of this model. By leveraging technology, primary care providers are linked with multi-disciplinary teams of specialists who share their expertise. As the primary care providers expand their knowledge and skills, they can begin to treat more patients. With The GE Foundation\u2019s support, Project ECHO has grown to over 4,500 programs operating in 190 countries. ECHO also saw continued expansion in Africa with 70 training centers in 21 African countries.\n\nCHANGING THE FACE OF MEDICINE\n\nLaunched in 2002, the National Medical Fellowships Primary Care Leadership Program (PCLP) is an innovative service-learning program. PCLP provides health professional students from diverse backgrounds with an opportunity to learn first-hand about the challenges and rewards of primary care practice at community health centers (CHC) across the United States. PCLP was conceived as an opportunity to create a rich and immersive experience that would expose scholars to both clinical and non-clinical aspects of primary healthcare delivery. PCLP\u2019s mission is to develop a pipeline of future primary care professionals from diverse backgrounds who are committed to serving underrepresented communities and to building capacity at partner CHCs. Since inception, the program has supported 634 scholars, 92% are racially and ethnically diverse, and 84% are choosing to focus their careers in primary care.\n\nATTACKING THE OPIOID CRISIS\n\nIn 2016, the GE Foundation announced a $15 million, multi-year commitment to community health in Boston and greater Massachusetts to expand care in behavioral health and addiction medicine with a focus on the opioid crisis. The health initiatives in Massachusetts focus on expanding access to evidence-based treatment through primary care provider capacity building and resiliency and on driving awareness and advocacy to combat the stigma associated with the disease of substance use disorder. Ongoing programming includes:\n\n\u2022 Community Care in Reach\u00ae: With support from the GE Foundation, the Kraft Center for Community Health, Massachusetts General Hospital and Boston Health Care for the Homeless, this pilot mobile health van has supported almost 19,000 encounters with at-risk and homeless individuals in downtown Boston and surrounding neighborhoods. Recognizing the program\u2019s success, the state of Massachusetts awarded additional funding to replicate the model in up to six communities in Massachusetts.\n\u2022 Project HERE: In partnership with the Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healy, Project HERE provides free resources to educators across Massachusetts to teach substance use prevention to middle school students (sixth to eighth grade) in order to empower students to make healthy decisions and promote social-emotional learning. Project HERE was designed to address an unmet need for prevention education and has three main components: an online toolkit, which centralizes existing trusted resources; Project HERE Games, an innovative educational game; and a grant program, which funds evidence-based curricula.\n\nIn 2021, Project HERE continued to adapt its resources and provide training and technical assistance to support teachers in a remote learning environment. In the spring of 2021, the Attorney General\u2019s Office and the GE Foundation announced an additional funding commitment and launched new features to Project Here Games, focused on making it more accessible and inclusive. To date, Project Here has over 360 Massachusetts middle schools registered with the program and has provided trainings to hundreds of educators. The online toolkit has over 700 users, Project Here Games has over 17,000 users and the grant program has provided funding to over 100 schools.\n\nDisaster and humanitarian relief\n\nGE\u2019s Disaster and Humanitarian Relief program responds to major global disasters and humanitarian crises, drawing on GE\u2019s people, technology and other resources to reduce suffering and hasten recovery. In 2021, the GE Foundation\u2019s philanthropic contribution to disaster relief totaled $2 million, which continued to support our ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as fund support for disaster and humanitarian crises around the world. GE Foundation made a grant to the German Red Cross for relief, specifically providing access to water, food and shelter, as well as sewage disposal, due to the devastating floods in July 2021. In August, Haiti suffered another powerful and catastrophic earthquake. The GE Foundation supported the relief work by partnering with Health Equity International, the largest healthcare provider in the region which owns and operates St. Boniface Hospital, to support the deployment of mobile clinics into the hardest hit communities to provide essential primary care and follow-up services. From August through December, the GE Foundation also worked with the International Rescue Committee and Team Rubicon to support Afghan refugees coming to resettle in the U.S. These partnerships provided immediate health and daily needs support, as well as legal support for resettlement. In December 2021, we partnered with CARE to provide $500 cash cards to the victims of the devastating tornadoes in communities in and around Madisonville, Kentucky.\n\nINCREASING ACCESS TO SAFE SURGERY\n\nSince 2015, the GE Foundation has led a multi-sector effort to improve surgical capacity and training with its Safe Surgery 2020 initiative. Access to safe, affordable surgical and anesthetic care is a pressing issue in global health. There are currently 5 billion people across the world who lack access to the safe surgical care they need. The $25 million commitment has supported a five-year initiative that focuses on increasing access to safe surgery in Cambodia.\n\nSAFE SURGERY IN CAMBODIA\n\nClose to 900 Cambodian surgical experts, clinicians and nurses have improved their surgical, anesthesia, caesarian procedure skills and more, thanks to training provided by the Safe Surgery 2020 program that drew to a close in 2021 (photo credit: Assist International.

Learn more \u25b6\nFollowing devastating flooding and mudslides in Petr\u00f3polis, Brazil, earlier this year, the GE Foundation partnered with A\u00e7\u00e3o da Cidadania (Citizenship Action), a Brazilian non-profit organization, to support emergency relief and reconstruction efforts. The funding provided an estimated 40 tons of emergency food and hygiene kits for approximately 2,500 residents, as well as supply 500 families with refrigerators and ovens during the rebuilding process.\n\nAdditionally, the GE Foundation\u2019s Matching Gifts Program enabled employees to contribute to crisis relief efforts in their local communities, doubling their impact by matching their donations. GE remains committed to preparing for and responding to future natural disasters and humanitarian crises, maximizing the impact of our financial, technological and human resources.\n\n\u201cTwenty years ago, I was living in my first Colorado apartment when our country first went into this war. Twenty years later, I\u2019m part of a crew helping move an Afghan family into their first Colorado apartment. Talk about coming full circle.\u201d\n\nJORDAN DANIEL\nTeam Rubicon volunteer\n\nGE Foundation matching gifts program\n\nThe GE Foundation created the concept of a corporate matching gift program in 1954. The program supports employees in their personal philanthropy/charitable giving by providing a 1:1 match. Today, the GE Foundation Matching Gifts Program continues to serve as an important element of the Foundation\u2019s portfolio, with gifts matched totaling over $1.5 billion since inception.\n\nIMPACTING THE UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS\n\nInspired by the OYW summit, a group of GE delegates recognized that employees in the corporate world had difficulty in finding avenues to make a sustained impact. Out of this need, the grassroots organization Generation Impact was created and the team serves as matchmakers, connecting skilled and passionate individuals with projects from non-profits, NGOs and social enterprises impacting the United Nations Sustainable Goals for Development (UN SDGs). Generation Impact has mobilized 200 employees globally across all GE businesses to volunteer their skills in information technology, finance, supply chain and engineering to aid organizations such as Assist International, Partners in Health, Catie\u2019s Closet, ChildFund and WholeForest. Between 2020-2021, the organization has connected 77 volunteers to 25 projects which impacted 14 out of the 17 UN SDGs.\n\nGE Girls celebrates 10 years\n\nGE Girls is a program sponsored by GE designed to encourage girls to explore the world of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) and STEM-based careers. The traditional GE Girls program is co-hosted by a GE business and a local university and includes a week-long, hands-on, STEM-based learning experience designed around a dynamic curriculum including physics, additive technology, construction, math, computer science, electronics and chemistry, in addition to learnings specific to the respective local GE business. Ten years ago, we created GE Girls to capture the hearts and minds of talented young women early in their life journeys with the possibilities of STEM. From its inaugural program in 2011 at MIT to more than 21 locations, GE Girls has encouraged thousands of girls across the U.S. and around the world to dream big for their future careers.\n\nGirlsGetSET\n\nIn 2021, GE\u2019s GirlsGetSET (GGS) program in the U.K. celebrated its 10th birthday. GirlsGetSET began with a simple aim to give more girls the chance to develop a passion for STEM. Ten years later, we are proud that more than 8,500 girls have taken part, with seven going on to work for GE. This milestone was marked in June with a series of events for girls, teachers and GE employees, hosted in conjunction with the Engineering Development Trust (EDT). Content ranged from GGS alumnae sharing their career journeys to discussions about unconscious bias and how to address it.\n\nTEN YEARS OF GE GIRLS\n\nGE Girls is a program sponsored by GE designed to encourage girls to explore the world of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) and STEM-based careers.

For disclosure purposes, in addition to the UN SDGs, we have considered three key sustainability reporting frameworks as we developed this report:\n\n1. the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework,\n2. industry-specific standards from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), and\n3. the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards (Core).\n\nTCFD, SASB and GRI indices can be found here.\n\nWe are informed by these standards and frameworks, as well as our engagement with key stakeholders as we determine sustainability priorities and goals. Of course, building a more sustainable world requires us to revisit and reassess our goals frequently, and we intend to continue mapping our progress against these frameworks to further develop our sustainability strategy.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-04-27", "created": "2025-04-27", "metadata": {"Source-File": "climate_reports/tp_reports/general_electric_2021.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.1.59", "pdf-total-pages": 66, "total-input-tokens": 204496, "total-output-tokens": 88976, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 5203, 2], [5203, 7262, 3], [7262, 16712, 4], [16712, 21142, 5], [21142, 25865, 6], [25865, 31420, 7], [31420, 36611, 8], [36611, 41799, 9], [41799, 46854, 10], [46854, 52120, 11], [52120, 55792, 12], [55792, 60139, 13], [60139, 70300, 14], [70300, 76828, 15], [76828, 83277, 16], [83277, 88766, 17], [88766, 95697, 18], [95697, 106605, 19], [106605, 113937, 20], [113937, 123398, 21], [123398, 131654, 22], [131654, 139528, 23], [139528, 147635, 24], [147635, 148530, 25], [148530, 163329, 26], [163329, 169650, 27], [169650, 181369, 28], [181369, 185140, 29], [185140, 188998, 30], [188998, 194387, 31], [194387, 198477, 32], [198477, 207435, 33], [207435, 211703, 34], [211703, 219409, 35], [219409, 225390, 36], [225390, 230659, 37], [230659, 239135, 38], [239135, 247616, 39], [247616, 254639, 40], [254639, 262374, 41], [262374, 270850, 42], [270850, 275941, 43], [275941, 280370, 44], [280370, 288632, 45], [288632, 295695, 46], [295695, 301953, 47], [301953, 307941, 48], [307941, 314602, 49], [314602, 323791, 50], [323791, 331768, 51], [331768, 340104, 52], [340104, 347532, 53], [347532, 352675, 54], [352675, 358460, 55], [358460, 366716, 56], [366716, 375104, 57], [375104, 383168, 58], [383168, 390023, 59], [390023, 397774, 60], [397774, 403594, 61], [403594, 411740, 62], [411740, 420253, 63], [420253, 425701, 64], [425701, 426633, 65], [426633, 426633, 66]]}}
