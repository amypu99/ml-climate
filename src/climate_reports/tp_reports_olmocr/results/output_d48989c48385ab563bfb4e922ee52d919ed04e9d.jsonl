We talk about it as ESG today, but we\u2019ve lived these principles since the beginning through our culture and values. While our business has changed since 1979, our values remain the same.\n\nWe know that when we invest in running a responsible, sustainable company, we make our business stronger, more agile, and more resilient. That encourages good business practices and enables us to consistently deliver industry-leading results.\n\nIn alignment with our values, we organize our approach to ESG in three key pillars \u2013 Focus on Our People, Operate Sustainably, and Strengthen Our Communities.\n\nAs a company of doers, we\u2019re focused on making progress. We\u2019re pleased to announce several new goals and the progress we\u2019ve made on behalf of our associates, our communities, and our world.\n\nFocus on Our People\nTo provide the best customer experience in home improvement, we\u2019re focused on creating the best associate experience in retail. To that end, we\u2019ve invested billions of dollars in wage and benefit enhancements over the past several years, including approximately $1 billion in annualized wage investment we announced at the beginning of this fiscal year.\n\nAnd while we will continue to invest in competitive wages and benefits, we also focus on the tools, training, and development opportunities that make working at The Home Depot rewarding. By 2028, we will provide 10 million hours of training to frontline associates and 2.5 million hours of leadership training. And over the next five years, we\u2019ll create 75,000 career advancement opportunities for our frontline associates.\n\nOperate Sustainably\nAs the world\u2019s largest home improvement retailer, we recognize our unique position to leverage our scale to enact positive change throughout our business operations and supplier relationships. We\u2019re proud to announce our new emission reduction targets, which were developed in accordance with the rigorous science-backed standards of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and have been submitted to the SBTi for approval. Submitting our targets to SBTi, a globally recognized organization, provides accountability and helps demonstrate our commitment to reducing our emissions in line with the latest climate science. We aim to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 42% by the end of 2030 and reduce Scope 3 \u201cUse of Sold Products\u201d emissions by 25% by the end of 2030, both from a 2020 base year.\n\n\u201cWe talk about it as ESG today, but we\u2019ve lived these principles since the beginning through our culture and values.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Ted Decker, Chair, President & CEO\nThe Home Depot\u2019s most significant environmental impact comes from the products we sell, and our biggest opportunity to create change is providing customers with product selections that reduce their carbon impact. We recently announced that by the end of 2028, 85% of U.S. and Canadian sales of push mowers and handheld outdoor lawn equipment will be powered by rechargeable battery technology. This transition from gas to battery power will reduce over 2 million metric tons of greenhouse gases annually from residential lawn equipment exhaust. We also pledge to help customers save $600 million in energy costs and reduce water usage by 100 billion gallons over the next three years (by year-end 2026). That is equivalent to the water used in 62.5 Million showers.\n\n**Strengthen Our Communities**\n\nWe strengthen our communities by giving back, both financially and through our associates\u2019 time and efforts.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen the dramatic effects of natural disasters on our communities. We\u2019re dedicated to helping people rebuild and recover quickly from these devastating events. In 2022, The Home Depot Foundation committed more than $7 million to disaster response and relief.\n\nThe Home Depot Foundation and Team Depot also continued to support our communities. In 2022, the Foundation surpassed its commitment to train 20,000 skilled tradespeople, six years ahead of schedule. Following this accomplishment, the Foundation invested an additional $3.7 million to address the skilled trades gap.\n\nSupporting veteran communities remains core to The Home Depot Foundation\u2019s efforts. By the end of 2022, the Foundation had invested over $450 million in veteran causes, with Team Depot donating more than 1.4 million hours of sweat equity to veteran service projects since 2011.\n\nMore details on our goals are available on page 10.\n\nI want to thank our associates and supplier partners for the progress we\u2019ve made and continue to make as a company. Thank you for the many ways you help us do our part and live our values.\n\n\u201cWe know that when we invest in running a responsible, sustainable company, we make our business stronger, more agile, and more resilient.\u201d\n\nTED DECKER\nChair, President & CEO\nOVERVIEW\n\nWe have three key pillars of focus for our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) strategy: Focus on Our People, Operate Sustainably, and Strengthen Our Communities. We believe our efforts in these areas give us a competitive advantage and create long-term value for our associates, customers, communities and other stakeholders.\nABOUT HOME DEPOT\n\nWe\u2019re proud to be the world\u2019s largest home improvement retailer.

Unless otherwise specified, \u201cGoal Date\u201d refers to the end of the fiscal year noted.\n2. Our new Scope 1 and 2 emission reduction goal submitted for SBTi approval supersedes our previous Scope 1 and 2 emission reduction targets announced in 2018.\n3. This goal excludes bulk distribution centers (BDCs).\n4. Applies to top strategic suppliers by U.S. and Canada core direct spend.\n5. Applies to private brand patio and home decor products sold in U.S. and Canada stores.\n6. Applies to private brand products sold in U.S. and Canada stores and online.\n7. The language of this goal is being clarified from our previous goal announced in 2020 to indicate the intent of producing or procuring 335 MW of energy capacity. Achievement of this goal was validated in 2023.\nHow Our Goals Align with the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals\n\nThe U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call for action to end extreme poverty, fight inequality and injustice, and protect our planet. The plan, outlined in 2015, focuses on 17 areas in which nations, governments, businesses and citizens can work to achieve measurable results by 2030. The Home Depot shares many of the same goals, which are articulated in our Core Values. Eleven SDGs align with our sphere of influence.\n\n**Good Health and Well-Being**\n- We offer a range of healthy-life benefits at no cost to associates. (Page 40)\n- We prioritize our associates\u2019 and customers\u2019 health and safety through training, preventative programs, equipment enhancements and communication. (Page 33)\n\n**Gender Equality**\n- Our Women\u2019s Link associate resource group promotes professional development for female associates across our organization. (Page 37)\n- We partner with the Women\u2019s Business Enterprise National Council to promote gender diversity among our suppliers. (Page 83)\n- In 2022, associates who identified as female earned approximately 102% compared to what male associates earned on an adjusted basis. (Page 26)\n\n**Clean Water and Sanitation**\n- In U.S. stores, we offer products such as bathroom vanity faucets and toilets that bear the U.S. EPA\u2019s WaterSense label. (Page 66)\n- We estimate that our customers saved over 33 billion gallons of water in 2022 by properly using our water-saving products. (Page 66)\n\n**Affordable and Clean Energy**\n- We recently joined RE100 and U.S. EPA\u2019s Green Power Partnership. (Page 52)\n- At the end of fiscal year 2022, we were operating rooftop solar farms atop 86 U.S. stores and six distribution centers. We also leverage fuel cell-generated power at 217 stores and supply chain facilities (Page 52)\n- Through our expanded wind and solar farm partnerships, we expect to purchase enough electricity to power the equivalent of more than 900 Home Depot stores. (Page 52)\n\n**Decent Work and Economic Growth**\n- We employ over 470,000 associates internationally, and our supply chain has an economic impact on millions of workers globally. (Page 6)\n- We recently invested approximately $1 billion on an annualized basis in our frontline, hourly associates (Page 36)\n- More than 90% of our U.S. store leaders started as hourly associates.

In alignment with these values, we have been an ESG-focused Company since we were founded. We have developed and formalized our approach to ESG and have enhanced our transparency and reporting.\nOversight of ESG\n\nTo facilitate the coordination of our ESG efforts across our business, we have two management-level cross-functional committees.

Going forward, our Board will continue to assess its oversight structure and make adjustments as appropriate.

We believe our over 470,000 associates are our greatest asset, and they differentiate us in the marketplace.\n\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion 27\nAssociate Safety 33\nAssociate Engagement 35\nLearning & Development 38\nBenefits 40\nThe Homer Fund 45\nFOCUS ON OUR PEOPLE\n\nThe Home Depot is a people-centered business where our customers benefit from positive interactions with our associates. Led by our Core Value of Taking Care of Our People, we aim to create a welcoming and safe work culture where our associates can openly contribute their ideas and build long-term careers. Our associates are vital to building a strong internal culture centered on delivering the excellent customer experience that differentiates us.\n\nThe three key pillars guiding our approach to achieving a strong customer experience are people, purpose and culture.\n\nPEOPLE\nWe provide an environment where people are inspired to come to work every day to serve our customers. Whether it\u2019s an associate on the floor of one of our stores or an associate who helps make sure online transactions run smoothly, each person is critical to creating a customer experience that attracts people to shop with us.\n\nPURPOSE\nOur purpose is a relentless focus on our customers, so we can grow our business. As a business, the only way we can continue to create new opportunities for our associates is to grow the Company.\n\nCULTURE\nWe work to create an environment where people can be their best selves and know they have opportunities to grow. This type of culture allows associates to develop their careers and create a great life for themselves and their families.\n\n\u201cWe know that our associates are a key differentiator, and they are essential in helping us sustain the customer experience we strive for. In order to provide the best customer experience in home improvement, we must focus on cultivating the best associate experience in retail.\u201d\n\nANN-MARIE CAMPBELL,\nEVP, U.S. Stores & International Operations\n\nAfter starting with The Home Depot 38 years ago as an hourly cashier in South Florida, Ann-Marie still comes to work with a focus and drive to inspire the next generation of Home Depot associates in her role as Executive Vice President of U.S. Stores and International Operations. While her story is exceptional, many of our associates have grown with our Company and built lasting careers by starting in frontline positions.\nDIVERSITY, EQUITY & INCLUSION\n\nWe strive to ensure the composition of our associates and suppliers includes and equitably represents our customers and the communities we serve.\n\nOur Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) program seeks continual improvement through strategic action, review of practices and reporting of our initiatives. These actions support our business objectives by promoting associate satisfaction and retention, community partnerships, and innovation across our value chain. Guided by our Core Value of Respect for All People, we also seek to foster equitable pay and promotion opportunities within our Company.\n\nDEI Values\n\nWe are committed to promoting DEI within our organization and among the communities we are proud to serve. We know that Doing the Right Thing each and every day for our associates, customers, suppliers, service providers and the communities we serve is critical to our ongoing success. We believe this commitment has been a competitive advantage and key to our long-term success, which is why we continue to build a culture of understanding, acceptance and appreciation.\n\nWe believe that all people should be treated with dignity and respect. Our Core Values and focus on DEI shape the expectations outlined in our Business Code of Conduct. We define diversity, equity and inclusion as:\n\n- **Diversity**: Composition of people, such as their similarities and differences (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation)\n- **Equity**: Norms, practices and policies in place that ensure just and fair opportunities and outcomes, allowing individuals to reach their full potential\n- **Inclusion**: How we embrace and enable our associates to feel safe, respected, engaged, motivated and valued for who they are and their contributions\n\nKey Areas of Focus\n\nAs the largest home improvement retailer in the world, we leverage our conviction, capabilities and tools to make a difference for all our stakeholders. We know this work is an ongoing journey in an ever-changing environment, which is why we continue to prioritize listening and learning from our associates and community partners, provide equal opportunities for all associates and business partners, and hold ourselves accountable to look for new ways to make progress.\n\nWe focus on three key areas to create meaningful change through thoughtful actions that align with all eight of our Core Values.\n\nASSOCIATE ENGAGEMENT\n\n1. Increase diverse representation throughout our organization\n2. Create an environment where every associate feels included and valued for who they are\n3. Ensure equal opportunity in recruitment, hiring, training, development and advancement\n\nCOMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS\n\n1. Work with organizations that strive to close the wealth gap\n2. Partner with organizations that advance education for all\n\nSUPPLIER DIVERSITY\n\n1. Increase our penetration and spend with diverse suppliers\n2. Develop diverse suppliers by providing mentorship and shared resources\nDEI Highlights\n\nOur dedicated DEI team supports departments across our organization to promote our DEI strategy. Over the years they have found ways to engage more of our associates around important DEI topics. Additionally, they have developed new programs to expand our impact among our communities:\n\n- Increased associate engagement by expanding our associate resource groups (ARGs) beyond our Store Support Center (corporate facility). We leverage our associate engagement platform, Viva Engage (formerly Yammer), to provide ARG access to all our U.S. and Canadian associates and reach more associates with C.A.R.E. talks, a series of diversity discussions that Champion Awareness, Respect and Equity for all associates.\n- Launched a Tier II supplier diversity program to help us measure and encourage our Tier I suppliers to spend more with diverse businesses.\n- Expanded the scope of diverse supplier spend goal to include both Tier I and Tier II suppliers.\n- Expanded our existing Retool Your School program to further strengthen our commitment to historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). This expansion includes more programming and a broader reach.\n\nIn addition, we are working to enlarge our network of external partner organizations to enhance the career development of our female, minority, LGBTQ+ and veteran associates.\n\nLearn more about how we work with our community partners across the nation and how spending with diverse suppliers benefits our Company and our communities on pages 79-84.\n\nOur People: Pay Equity\n\nThe Home Depot\u2019s commitment to Doing the Right Thing and Taking Care of Our People extends to our pay practices. To ensure that we are paying our associates fairly, our long-standing practice has been to conduct an annual analysis of our pay and compensation practices for our U.S. associates, who comprise approximately 89% of our workforce, in consultation with expert third-party firms following industry-leading standards.\n\nOur review of our U.S. associates\u2019 total W-2 compensation for calendar year 2022 includes base pay, cash bonuses and stock, and adjusts for relevant factors such as tenure, position, location and hours worked. Our findings showed that associates who identified as female earned approximately 102% of what male associates earned, and associates who identified as members of a racial or ethnic minority earned approximately 99% of what non-minority associates earned.\n\nNot adjusting for those factors, our analysis showed that the median annualized W-2 pay for U.S. associates who identified as female was 99% of the median for men, and the median pay for racial/ethnic minority associates in the U.S. was 96% of the median for non-minority associates. The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which is tasked with providing oversight of our human capital management strategy and our diversity and inclusion efforts, receives regular updates on these findings. We will continue to strive to ensure equal pay across our organization.\n\nHome Depot\u2019s U.S. pay equity results\n\n|                        | WOMEN RELATIVE TO MEN | RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY ASSOCIATES RELATIVE TO NON-MINORITY ASSOCIATES |\n|------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Unadjusted Pay Equity  | 99%                   | 96%                                                                    |\n| Adjusted Pay Equity    | 102%                  | 99%                                                                    |\n\nWe do not tolerate discrimination or harassment against any existing or potential associate regardless of race, color, sex (gender), sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion, national origin, disability, protected veteran or other uniformed service status or any other characteristic.\n\nCHECK IT OUT\n\nWilbert Slowman reflects on his journey from part-time cashier to store manager and how his Navajo Heritage and strong family ties continue to inspire him.\nDOING THE RIGHT THING\n\nDerek Bottoms, a 20+ year associate of The Home Depot and current Chief Diversity Officer and Vice President of Associate Relations, describes how the Company supports its associates, communities and suppliers by advancing DEI initiatives.\n\nWHAT DOES DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION LOOK LIKE AT THE HOME DEPOT?\n\nMore than 40 years ago, The Home Depot was built on eight Core Values, including Doing the Right Thing, Respect for All People and Taking Care of Our People. These Core Values, combined with a focus on DEI, extend to all our associates, customers, suppliers and the communities where we operate. This focus has helped us build the best team in retail, which continues to give us a competitive advantage and has been key to our long-term success.\n\nAnd while I hold the role of Chief Diversity Officer within the Company, our mission to build a culture of understanding, acceptance and appreciation cannot be done by any one person or a single team. Real change only happens if we have the commitment of every associate. This is why we have worked over the years to broaden our DEI outreach both inside and outside the four walls of our business.\n\nMost recently, our efforts have included a focus on expanding our associate resource groups (ARGs) from only our Store Support Center (SSC) associates or corporate associates, to all associates across our stores and supply chain facilities through various associate engagement platforms. We also committed to increase the amount we spend with diverse suppliers and quadrupled our commitment to historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) through an expanded range of community projects and career resources for students through our Retool Your School program, which includes an externship component.\n\nWHY DOES THE HOME DEPOT FOCUS ON DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION?\n\nWe know that diversity across our associates can bring a range of perspectives, experiences and skills to the Company, which can help foster creativity, innovation and better decision-making, ultimately leading to a better associate experience and better outcomes for our customers and the business.\n\nIn addition, based on my experiences with the Company, I know firsthand the importance of mentorship and ensuring everyone has access to the same opportunities. Creating a supportive environment for all associates, no matter their race, gender, age, ethnicity or any other unique identifier, can lead to increased employee engagement, satisfaction and long-term career opportunities, just as I\u2019ve experienced.\n\nWe are also committed to cultivating a supplier base that creates long-lasting growth and mutual business success, while reflecting the diversity of our customers and communities. We believe having a diverse supplier base strengthens our business and communities.\n\nHOW DID THE HOME DEPOT CONTINUE TO PROGRESS ITS DEI MISSION IN 2022?\n\nIt\u2019s an honor to work with so many great associates who embody our vision to build a more diverse, equitable and inclusive organization. Through their hard work, we continued to prioritize our commitment to create an environment where every associate feels included and valued. Some of the highlights from 2022 that I\u2019m most proud of include:\n\n- Expansion of ARGs across the enterprise\n- Launching the DEI icon on our \u201chdPhones\u201d to drive associate engagement and create awareness of our DEI and associate resource group Viva Engage (our associate engagement platform formerly known as Yammer) communities for our store associates\n- Refreshing our DEI learning curriculum, including updates to our required annual training plans as well as content to drive DEI awareness and support ongoing learning and development\n- Increased associate engagement by +300% in our DEI Viva Engage community ranking our DEI community in the top 20 of over 1,100 U.S. Viva Engage communities\n- Induction into the Billion Dollar Roundtable for Supplier Diversity following the full establishment of our Tier II Program\n\n\u201cOur mission to build a culture of understanding, acceptance and appreciation cannot be done by any one person or a single team. Real change only happens if we have the commitment of every associate.\u201d\n\nDEREK BOTTOMS\nChief Diversity Officer and Vice President of Associate Relations\nBuilding a Diverse Workforce\n\nOur diverse workforce strengthens our competitive advantages and reflects the customers and communities we serve. A comparison against U.S. Department of Labor data shows that our U.S. workforce is more ethnically diverse than the nation\u2019s working population. In 2022, we also expanded the number and percentage of women and minorities at the manager level and above. These charts reflect the demographics of The Home Depot\u2019s U.S. workforce from 2020 through 2022. Certain percentages may not sum to 100% due to rounding or some associates choosing not to self-identify by race/ethnicity or gender.\n\nU.S. Working Population\n\n| Year | Underrepresented Minority Groups | White |\n|------|----------------------------------|-------|\n| 2022 | 38%                              | 62%   |\n| 2021 | 37%                              | 63%   |\n| 2020 | 36%                              | 64%   |\n\nTHD U.S. Workforce\n\n| Year | Underrepresented Minority Groups | White |\n|------|----------------------------------|-------|\n| 2022 | 48%                              | 50%   |\n| 2021 | 48%                              | 50%   |\n| 2020 | 47%                              | 52%   |\n\nFemale 47% Male 53%\n\nSource: Latest available data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics; 2022 data is estimated\n\nTHD U.S. Workforce by Race/Ethnicity\n\n1) Includes data for HD Supply Holdings Inc.\n\n2) Gray bars indicate percentage undisclosed\nU.S. Managers and Above\\(^1,2,3\\)\n(excludes officer level)\n\n| Year | Underrepresented Minority Groups | White |\n|------|----------------------------------|-------|\n| 2022 | 39%                              | 60%   |\n| 2021 | 38%                              | 62%   |\n| 2020 | 35%                              | 64%   |\n| 2022 | Female 35%                       | Male 65% |\n| 2021 | Female 34%                       | Male 65% |\n| 2020 | Female 32%                       | Male 68% |\n\nTotal Number of U.S. Managers and Above:\n2022: 25,700  | 2021: 24,600  | 2020: 19,100\n\nU.S. Officers\\(^2,3\\)\n\n| Year | Underrepresented Minority Groups | White |\n|------|----------------------------------|-------|\n| 2022 | 26%                              | 73%   |\n| 2021 | 28%                              | 72%   |\n| 2020 | 26%                              | 74%   |\n| 2022 | Female 29%                       | Male 69% |\n| 2021 | Female 30%                       | Male 70% |\n| 2020 | Female 29%                       | Male 71% |\n\nTotal Number of U.S. Officers:\n2022: 137  | 2021: 126  | 2020: 127\n\n1) Includes manager-level positions and above at stores, distribution centers and other field locations, as well as at our Store Support Center; excludes officers.\n2) Includes data for HD Supply Holdings Inc.\n3) Gray bars indicate percentage undisclosed\nBoard of Directors*\n\n| Year | Underrepresented Minority Groups | White | Total Number of Directors |\n|------|----------------------------------|-------|---------------------------|\n| 2022 | 31%                              | 69%   | 13                        |\n| 2021 | 27%                              | 73%   | 11                        |\n| 2020 | 25%                              | 75%   | 12                        |\n\n* For additional information on our board composition, visit the Corporate Governance section of our website.\nASSOCIATE SAFETY\n\nOur people are our most important assets. By focusing on workplace safety training and risk reduction, we help keep our associates and customers injury-free.\n\nThe Home Depot is committed to providing a safe environment for our associates who work in our stores and across our global supply chain network, while also creating a safe shopping experience for our customers who visit our stores. We accomplish this by creating a strong culture of safety from day one, which includes the expectation that our associates follow all Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards and Company safety procedures.\n\nKey to driving our culture of safety is our commitment to our Company\u2019s Core Values, specifically Taking Care of Our People. Our strong safety culture starts from the top with engaged leaders, who then empower associates to create an environment that promotes and encourages an atmosphere where all associates prioritize the safety of everyone.\n\nOur commitment to safety goes to the highest level of our organization: our Board of Directors. At each quarterly Board meeting, our directors receive an update on our safety initiatives and metrics. Beyond Taking Care of Our People, we are also mindful of the financial, operational and reputational impacts from safety incidents. Active Board oversight helps ensure we remain accountable and transparent.\nAwareness\n\nFocusing on the store associate experience is a key factor behind the success of our safety communications platform. In 2022, our platform received over 3.5 million completed quizzes focused on quarterly campaigns that delivered timely and relevant content to our associates to help keep them safe every day. The required training, InFocus content and leadership engagement provided to associates focuses on our most common or more serious safety incidents such as overexertion, slips, trips and falls, among others. Our robust platform continues to be one of the most used channels of communication, reaching our associates monthly.\n\nThis year, we enhanced our InFocus All-Star program to align All-Star safety milestones with our Company-wide Homer Awards given to associates for their exceptional customer service and living our Core Values. Our supervisors grant bronze, silver, gold and platinum awards as part of our enhanced All-Star program, which recognizes associates that achieve safety excellence in the workplace. This program provides additional benefits such as monetary rewards, leaderboard tracking and surveys to provide insights on safety conditions in their locations. Our goal with this program is to increase safety awareness by focusing on continuous improvement and ingraining safety into everyday conversations to help foster open discussions. We welcomed over 90,000 new All-Stars this year to further drive our Safety Takes EveryONE awareness campaign that we launched in 2021.\n\nIn 2022, as a result of our awareness campaign, we proudly recognized 266 stores that achieved Club 365 status, which demonstrates a store\u2019s outstanding milestone of reaching 365 days on a rolling 12-month basis without an OSHA recordable incident. These stores received a store celebration, apron patches and an award plaque in recognition of this meaningful achievement.\n\nEngagement\n\nEngagement is a fundamental piece of our safety strategy. We know our highest-risk associates are our new hires, so we begin every new hire orientation with safety.\n\nIn 2022, our goal was to keep associates engaged not only through traditional learning but also through a multitude of additional methods. Our Safety Takes EveryONE experience encourages associates to engage with key areas of the store, reinforcing safety topics along the way and engaging in friendly competition with other stores across the country.\n\nAssociates are encouraged to look out for each other, prioritize safety first and speak up if unsafe acts are occurring - \u201cSee Something, Say Something\u201d is a principle embedded in our culture, and demonstrated by leaders who lead by example.\n\nTechnologies\n\nOur Store Support Center and field teams work side-by-side to achieve engineering solutions that lower risks and enhance equipment safety for our associates.\n\nThis year, we implemented several new tools that improve safety for our associates, including:\n\n- Portable loading docks to better assist with large and heavy product loading for customers\n- Powered pallet jacks to move heavy pallets without the physical stress required to operate a manual pallet jack\n- Safety lights for sit-down forklifts that better identify our Zone of Safety when lift equipment is in use.\n- Interlocking seatbelts that must now be engaged for the forklift to operate\n\nWhether with awareness, tools or technologies, our focus is on continuous improvement to lower injury rates and keep our associates and customers safe every day.\n\nLower than the average rates for our industry:\n\n| RECORDABLE INCIDENT RATE (per 200,000 hours)* | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|---------------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Work-related injury that typically warrants medical care beyond store-provided first aid | 4.03 | 4.25 | 4.08 |\n\n| LOST TIME INCIDENT RATE (per 200,000 hours)* | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|---------------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| More significant injury that results in time away from work | 1.07 | 1.23 | 1.16 |\n\n* Recordable and lost time incidents rates for U.S. store associates\n\nThe Home Depot\u2019s incident rates were lower than the averages for our industry, according to the latest annual data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nASSOCIATE ENGAGEMENT\n\nAssociate engagement, the emotional connection associates have to our Company and our goals, is vital to The Home Depot\u2019s culture and success.\n\nVoice of the Associate Survey\n\nOur highly engaged associates care about their work and the performance of The Home Depot. We are passionate about maintaining an engaging and inclusive workplace, and we do so by proactively engaging with our associates, while also listening and responding to their feedback.\n\nIn 2022, we again conducted our Voice of the Associate (VOA) survey which includes all our associates and provides an in-depth look at our associate\u2019s engagement and satisfaction with their job, their leaders, and The Home Depot.\n\nAt The Home Depot, we don\u2019t conduct surveys just to listen, but also to take action. Our survey provides the opportunity for leaders to review their teams\u2019 feedback and respond to associate concerns. Many leaders discuss findings directly or use VOA committees \u2013 typically comprised of a diverse group of associates from a location or team \u2013 to gain a deeper understanding of survey feedback and ensure action plans are effective.\n\nWe also collect additional associate insights at different life cycle stages through onboarding and exit surveys. This feedback helps us to continuously improve as an enterprise.\n\nWe believe that associate engagement is vital to our culture and to our success. While we are proud to have many emotionally engaged associates, this is an ongoing process, and we are committed to continually identifying associate concerns and opportunities to make The Home Depot a great place to work.\n\nEngagement Platform\n\nIn 2022, our voluntary associate engagement platform \u2013 Viva Engage \u2013 helped associates to build community with one another at a local level and at large.\n\nWhether through on-site desktops or on-the-go mobile devices, more than 450,000 associates across the U.S. and Canada have access to Viva Engage. As our associates continue to drive engagement, now with more than 800 active communities in the network, the digital hub links associates across North America. It serves as a central hub to recognize associates for living our values, promote Company news, cultivate connections between front-line and corporate associates and fuel the orange-blooded spirit that\u2019s part of what drives our culture.\n\nDID YOU KNOW\n\nIn 2022, Home Depot\u2019s Viva Engage network held three of the top 10 most thriving communities out of approximately 3,200 around the world, according to SWOOP Analytics.\nCompensation Enhancements and Success Sharing\n\nThe most important investment we can make is in our people. This is why we announced that we would be investing an additional approximately $1 billion in annualized compensation for frontline, hourly associates starting in the first quarter of 2023. This investment, which now means our starting rate is at least $15 an hour, will position us favorably in the market, allowing us not only to attract the most qualified talent, but also to retain the exceptional associate base that is already in place.\n\nOur philosophy of Taking Care of Our People and motivating them to deliver a superior customer experience also shapes our profit-sharing program for our non-management associates. Success Sharing provides semi-annual cash awards for performance against our sales goals.\n\nThe program has granted awards totaling nearly $2.0 billion to associates over the last four years. The performance of our associates in 2022 enabled 100% of stores to qualify for Success Sharing in both the first and second half of the year. This resulted in Success Sharing bonus payments to our non-management associates of approximately $409 million for fiscal 2022. In addition, we increased our merit budgets for our associates in 2022 to between 3.0% and 4.0%, and we continued our practice of making matching contributions under the FutureBuilder 401(k) Plan.\n\nTechnology Tools\n\nWe also know that competitive wages and benefits are just one piece of the associate experience. This is why we\u2019ve also invested over the years in providing our associates with more helpful tools, training and development opportunities as we strive to create the best associate experience in retail.\n\nWe invest in our associates\u2019 development and we continually aim to make the associate experience simpler and more effective. Initiatives like OrderUp, which simplified our order management process from dozens to one simpler and more intuitive system, or the recent rollout of our new hdPhone, which increases accessibility to real-time support, are just a couple of the investments aimed at improving the associate experience.\nAssociate Resource Groups\n\nOur associate resource groups (ARGs) promote our culture of inclusion and support diversity and help drive associate engagement.\n\nOur associate resource groups are led by associates and sponsored by executive leaders. They drive associate engagement and promote inclusion across our Company through fostering professional development, raising cultural awareness, celebrating diversity, and offering community outreach opportunities. They are a powerful resource for our associates to connect on important issues and serve as a valuable link to support our DEI initiatives.\n\nWe have seven U.S. ARGs, each of which supports the Company\u2019s business objectives and policies, particularly those related to developing our associates, creating diversity awareness and engaging diverse community partners.\n\nIn 2022, our ARGs continued to further support the career development of associates who voluntarily lead these groups. We also remained focused on growing membership across our ARGs since expanding Company-wide access to all associates, including in stores and distribution centers. We hosted approximately 40 virtual ARG events in 2022 to celebrate diversity, raise cultural awareness and foster professional development. Going forward, we will continue to expand the outreach efforts of our ARGs.\n\nC.A.R.E. TALKS\n\nWe launched Caring Conversations in 2020 in response to the unrest in our communities. The virtual events for all associates included panel discussions where senior Company leaders shared candid stories about race and ethnicity, and experts from outside our Company educated associates about civil rights, laws, voting and more. Caring Conversations have evolved into C.A.R.E. Talks, a series of diversity discussions that Champion Awareness, Respect and Equity for all associates. These discussions include external speaker series, panel discussions and small group listening sessions, and we occasionally partnered with our ARGs on elevating keynote speakers in this format.\n\nIN 2022, C.A.R.E. TALKS INCLUDED A VARIETY OF SPEAKERS:\n\n- Dr. Jennifer Ho, director for the Center for Humanities & the Arts and professor in the department of ethnic studies at the University of Colorado Boulder and author of \u201cConsumption and Identity in Asian American Coming-of-Age Novels\u201d and \u201cRacial Ambiguity in Asian American Culture,\u201d spoke about Asian American history, society and her experiences.\n- Colonel Greg Gadson, a 25-year career Army officer, New York Giants Honorary Captain, and \u201cBattleship\u201d Actor spoke about refusing to be defined by his combat injuries, shared the lessons he learned and applied them to his life, career and family.\n- Jay Brown, Senior Vice President of Programs, Research & Training, and Shawnie Hawkins, Deputy Director of the Workplace Equality Program, spoke about the current state of affairs for the LGBTQ+ community and intersectional ally-ship in the workplace.\nLEARNING & DEVELOPMENT\n\nOur learning and development programs aim to expand skills and capabilities so that associates can master their current roles and prepare for future ones.\n\nOur associates are essential in helping us sustain the customer experience we strive to offer. To provide the best customer experience, we must invest in cultivating the best associate experience.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we announced several changes to better support our associates\u2019 learning and development, which in turn, increases their engagement.\n\nWe started the year with a new store leadership structure where we created new management positions in our stores focused on the customer experience, increasing the number of managers on the floor at any given time. This new structure frees up time for other store leaders to devote to associate training and development.

Supporting them is the right thing to do for our communities and our Company.\n\n\u201cHome Depot is a great place to work for veterans because of our values, inverted pyramid and our culture. Home Depot\u2019s eight Core Values are very similar to the values we experience as veterans.\u201d\n\n- Debbie McKinley, Vice President of Human Resources \u2013 U.S. Stores and International Operations\n\nHome Depot is committed to honoring those who actively serve and veterans of the United States military. Our focus on the military community and their families includes the tens of thousands of veterans and military spouses in our workforce. Through our recently expanded Military Relations Team, we have created new ways to make The Home Depot an employer of choice for military members, veterans and their families.\n\nDebbie McKinley, Vice President of Human Resources \u2013 U.S. Stores and International Operations, embodies the values that make the Home Depot an employer of choice for veterans transitioning out of active duty. Her desire to serve and the leadership skills she developed during her career in the military have helped her excel across numerous roles of increasing responsibility at the Home Depot.\n\nAs the daughter of a U.S. Navy veteran, Debbie grew up in western Virginia and attended the United States Naval Academy after graduating high school. She was commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps in May of 1994.\n\nDebbie then served on active duty with Marine Corps aviation squadrons, working with supply and maintenance teams to repair aircraft. She was later deployed to the Mediterranean, Northern Africa and the Middle East as part of Marine detachments aboard U.S. Navy Ships, and she served as the MALS-26 Aviation Supply Officer in Charge and an Aide de Camp for a Marine Major General.\n\nShe later transitioned to the Reserves, serving in several roles including a senior leadership instructor and an Airshow Command Center Officer-In-Charge, and attending the Marine Corps Command and Staff College in Quantico, Virginia. While serving in the Reserves, Debbie also continued to grow her career at The Home Depot, holding positions of increasing responsibility and achieving the role of Director of Talent Management before retiring from the Reserves in 2014.\n\nDebbie began her career at the Home Depot as an operator in the stores 20 years ago. During her career at The Home Depot, she has been an assistant store manager, store manager, district manager, a Regional Learning Manager, the Director of Talent Management, the Senior Director of HR (SDHR) for the Western Division and SDHR for U.S. Operations.\n\nShe currently serves as the Vice President of HR for U.S. Stores and International Operations. Debbie prides herself on understanding the business and creating strong teams that can support The Home Depot\u2019s frontline associates and leaders.\n\nIn addition, Debbie continues to find ways to give back to the military community. Most recently, she served on the Board of Directors for the Veterans Empowerment Organization in Atlanta, a non-profit that helps homeless veterans in Atlanta in need of stable housing, from 2017 to 2021.\n\nDEBBIE MCKINLEY\nVice President of Human Resources \u2013 U.S. Stores and International Operations\nMade-to-Fit Benefits\n\nThe Home Depot offers specialized benefits for veterans, military service members and military spouses who are Home Depot associates:\n\n- Military leave of absence for reservists, National Guard and active-duty associates, including differential pay when activated or deployed\n- Fellowships for transitioning service members\n- Military family international leave of absence for up to five years\n- Military Spouse Transfer program, guaranteeing a job offer at one of our approximately 2,000 store and supply chain locations when moving on orders\n- Remote eligible jobs that can be relocated with military moves\n- Support resources, such as counselors, financial advisers, healthcare advice and childcare assistance\n\nMilitary Fellowship Program:\n\nIn 2022, the Military Relations Team expanded its fellowship program, which connects transitioning service members with mentors, provides skills training, facilitates networking across different disciplines of the business and encourages potential employment, by launching the Supply Chain Management Program. Building on the success of its existing corporate fellowship program with the Department of Defense, this new addition created career opportunities in Home Depot distribution centers across the entire U.S. In its inaugural year, 29 service members participated across 13 states. They are among the more than 150 military fellows who have taken part in our program.\n\n2022 also saw the pilot of the Store Management Military Fellowship Program. Going forward, this initiative will build pathways for transitioning veterans who leverage their extensive leadership and management experience into successful careers as members of our store leadership teams.\n\nDID YOU KNOW\n\nThe Home Depot\u2019s recently enhanced military discount benefit provides 10% off eligible purchases (up to $400). Now, it\u2019s available both in-store and online, and we extend it to all active U.S. military members and veterans, plus their spouses and Gold Star spouses every day, affirming the Company\u2019s commitment to serving the U.S. military community nationwide.

We partner with suppliers focused on social and environmental responsibility, and we help our customers reduce their environmental impact by offering products and packaging created with sustainability in mind.\nOur Core Value of Doing the Right Thing extends to reducing the impact that our operations and products have on the environment. Although the climate challenges that exist today are global, we recognize the responsibility and opportunity our business has to conserve resources and lower emissions.\n\nWe know that focusing on the areas where we can have the greatest impact is the most meaningful way for us to create long-lasting, sustainable improvements. This is why we focus our sustainability strategy around five environmental pillars: Carbon Emissions, Sustainable Forestry, Circularity, Water Conservation and Responsible Chemistry.\n\nThe investments that we make across our five environmental pillars focus on strengthening our business, being responsive to the concerns of our stakeholders and improving the lives of our customers and those who live in the communities where we operate. We offer products that give customers choices to lower their environmental impact without compromising on quality. By promoting customer awareness through our Eco Actions program, we encourage our customers to support sustainability through their own purchases and practices.\n\nAs we describe in greater detail in the following sections, we have made significant progress to reduce our environmental impact but acknowledge that there is still more that needs to be done. We have set several new environmental goals across our products and operations to continue making progress on our sustainability journey.\nQ&A: Continuing Our Sustainability Journey\n\nRon Jarvis, a nearly 30-year associate of The Home Depot and current Chief Sustainability Officer, discusses The Home Depot's efforts around addressing the environmental issues most relevant to our business, our associates and our customers.\n\nWHAT PROGRESS DID THE HOME DEPOT MAKE IN 2022?\n\nIn 2022, like many businesses across the globe, we continued to navigate a number of challenges, including ongoing supply chain disruption and continued inflationary pressures.\n\nDespite these challenges, our business has continued to make progress against our existing sustainability strategy, while also setting new, more ambitious objectives. Our ability to continue driving meaningful environmental change in the face of new and ongoing challenges is due to our longstanding commitment to sustainability and our philosophy of embedding sustainability into our overall business.\n\nThe challenges we face continue to reinforce our belief that our sustainability efforts are critical to ensuring the resilience of our business.\n\nWhile recognizing sustainability is a journey, I\u2019m also proud of a number of environmental milestones that we achieved across our business in 2022:\n\n- Reduced our absolute combined Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by approximately 92,000 MT, a 5.6% decrease from the prior year\n- Achieved our goals to eliminate certain intentionally added chemicals from our residential cleaning products\n- Helped our customers save over 33 billion gallons of water and 3.8 billion kilowatt hours of electricity through their purchase and use of WaterSense and ENERGY STAR\u00ae products, respectively\n- Diverted over 320,000 MT, or approximately 30%, of our nonhazardous waste away from landfills\n\nWHY DOES THE HOME DEPOT INCORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY INTO ITS BUSINESS?\n\nWe view sustainability as core to our business and who we are, not something we do separately. One of our eight Core Values is Doing the Right Thing, which extends to doing the right thing for our environment.\n\nThe synergies between our commitment to reducing our Company\u2019s environmental impact and our business strategy can be seen through the growth of battery-powered technology across our outdoor power equipment category. We have been a leader in cordless technology offerings over the years and have helped introduce our customers to the value proposition that these products bring, including being safer and easier to use with less environmental impact, while retaining the power and run time of traditional gas equipment.\n\nOur commitment to reducing our environmental impact and making the necessary investments to meet our customers\u2019 needs is why we are providing larger offerings of battery-powered outdoor equipment, which will help eliminate gas spills, direct carbon emissions and noise. Our short-term goal is to have 85% of our U.S. and Canadian in-store and online sales in push mowers and handheld outdoor lawn equipment be powered by rechargeable battery technology by the end of 2028.\n\nIn partnership with our best-in-class suppliers, this new commitment will help us continue to introduce innovative products to the marketplace that not only help our customers complete their projects but make neighborhoods cleaner and quieter.\nRunning a business where sustainability is part of the overall strategy has also allowed us to find new ways to increase efficiency in our operations. Over the years we\u2019ve made investments like transitioning our U.S. stores to LED interior lighting, which has contributed to a significant reduction in the electricity usage of our stores, while also cutting down our utility costs.\n\nWe are now aiming to convert 90% of our forklifts to hydrogen power in our major U.S. distribution centers by the end of 2029. In addition to emitting zero CO2 or toxic gases, hydrogen-powered forklifts provide other benefits, including faster refueling time compared to propane or lead-acid battery powered alternatives. Plus, hydrogen-powered forklift refueling stations take up less space within our distribution centers. The time and space we are able to save by making this transition will, in turn, increase the efficiency of our buildings.\n\nWHAT DOES THE HOME DEPOT SEE AS ITS BIGGEST OPPORTUNITY TO REDUCE ITS ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT?\n\nWe understand our biggest opportunity to create a positive impact on the environment comes from the products that we sell. Beyond the significant steps we are taking to reduce the impact of our operations, we also are heavily focused on working with our suppliers to develop more sustainable products and packaging.\n\nAcross our product assortment, there are multiple environmental touchpoints coming from many industries. We have organized these touchpoints into our five environmental pillars: carbon emissions, sustainable forestry, circularity, water conservation and responsible chemistry.\n\nWe have evolved our sustainable product programs over the years to encourage more innovation and education in this space. Launched in 2007 as Eco Options and rebranded in 2021 as Eco Actions, The Home Depot offers a program to give our environmentally innovative suppliers a platform to articulate and illustrate the positive environmental changes they are making in their manufacturing process, distribution or product use. It also provides an educational platform for our customers to learn how they can reduce their own environmental footprint.\n\nAs The Home Depot continues its ESG journey, we remain guided by our Company\u2019s Core Values and commitment to operate sustainably.\n\nRON JARVIS\nChief Sustainability Officer\n\nDID YOU KNOW\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that gas-powered lawn mowers use 800 million gallons of gasoline \u2014 and spill an additional 17 million gallons of gasoline annually, equivalent to the fuel consumed by >33,000 passenger vehicles driven for one year.\nCARBON EMISSIONS REDUCTION\n\nBy conserving energy resources, we reduce business costs and our Company\u2019s impact on the environment.\n\nThe Home Depot prioritizes carbon emissions reduction as one of its main environmental pillars, recognizing our role in decreasing the global risks associated with climate change. In line with the Paris Agreement, we support the worldwide commitment to limit the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels using greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets.\n\nWe have a strong record of reducing our carbon emissions and energy costs by improving our energy efficiency. We have invested in alternative electricity sources to lead to lower emissions and in retrofits to our lighting, HVAC systems and white roofing to make our 2,300+ store locations more energy efficient. We have also adopted strategies to minimize our supply chain and transportation emissions through distribution optimization. Now, we aim to increase these efforts with emissions reduction goals aligned with science-based targets. And for more than a decade, we have helped our customers save energy through the products we sell.\n\n2022 Reported Emissions\n\nBy driving efficiencies and investing in renewable energy, we reduced our absolute combined Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by approximately 92,000 metric tons in 2022.\n\nThe Home Depot uses the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, which is considered the most widely adopted standard for calculating metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions. We continually review and refine our emissions measurements to reflect changes to our business and improvements in data collection and reporting. We have been tracking and reporting our emissions data for nearly a decade, and we continue to learn and adapt to changing industry standards. We also partner with third-party experts in this space to help ensure we are in-line with industry standards.\n\nWe participate in the CDP\u00ae reporting process. CDP, formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project, is an independent, international, nonprofit organization that provides a global system for companies and cities to measure, disclose, manage and share environmental information.\n\nOur latest score of B from CDP shows our continued commitment to climate change mitigation, risk reduction, adaptation and transparency. We are proud of the steps we\u2019ve taken to help mitigate our impact on the climate over the years but acknowledge there\u2019s still more opportunity in front of us. We remain committed to continuously finding ways to reduce our impact on the environment through our operations and products we sell.\n\nIn 2022, we decreased our Scope 1 and 2 carbon intensity. Our investments in efficiency helped us achieve a 9% reduction in the carbon emitted for each dollar of revenue we earned, compared to 2021.\n\nWe work with our suppliers to offer our customers products that have less of an impact on the environment. Scope 3 emissions include sources not within an organization\u2019s direct control and are divided into several categories. As the world\u2019s largest retailer of home improvement products, it\u2019s no surprise that the largest percentage of our total indirect emissions comes from the use of products that we sell (category 11). For that reason, we have chosen to focus our emissions reduction target for Scope 3 on this category, \u201cUse of Products Sold,\u201d addressing carbon emissions where we have the biggest opportunity for impact.\n\n2022 Results\n\n| Scope 1 | Direct emissions from combustible sources and refrigerants totaled approximately 597,500 metric tons. |\n|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Scope 2 | Indirect emissions from purchased electricity totaled approximately 959,800 metric tons. |\n| Scope 3 | We estimate that emissions from our relevant supply chain categories were approximately 3,696,500 metric tons. |\nEmissions Reduction Goals\n\nWe measure our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and identify strategic opportunities to minimize costs and achieve carbon emissions reduction throughout our facility operations, supply chain and product footprint.\n\nThe Home Depot has established goals to aid our long-term planning towards reducing emissions in ways that align with scientifically accepted emissions reduction pathways for preventing the worst impacts of climate change.\n\nWe recently updated our emissions goals, which we submitted to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in 2023 for approval:\n\n- The Home Depot commits to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 42% by fiscal year end 2030 from a fiscal 2020 base year.\n- The Home Depot commits to reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions from the use of sold products 25% by fiscal year end 2030 from our fiscal 2020 base year.\n\nSBTi supports best practices in target setting based on carbon emissions reduction pathways recommended by the world\u2019s leading climate scientists. SBTi brings together multiple authorities on climate change as a collaboration between CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute and the World Wide Fund for Nature.\n\nScope 1 and 2 emissions: We source renewable energy from both onsite rooftop solar systems located atop our stores and offsite purchased renewable energy. As we work towards reducing our operational footprint, we also plan to invest in low-carbon emissions opportunities through initiatives such as:\n\n- Produce/procure 100% renewable electricity equivalent to the electricity needs for all Home Depot facilities worldwide by the end of 2030, including an interim goal of producing/procuring 335 megawatts of renewable or alternative energy capacity by 2025, which we accomplished years early.\n- 90% of forklifts in our major U.S. distribution centers will be hydrogen-powered by the end of fiscal year 2029.\n\nScope 3 \u201cUse of Sold Products\u201d emissions: We expect the electrical grid to become less carbon-intensive in the future with more renewable energy resources coming online. As we work with our suppliers to improve the energy efficiency of their products, as well as prioritizing sales of high-efficiency, electrified products, we will enable our current mix and future assortments of electrical plug-in and carbon-emitting products to have lower emissions outputs. We have created two key targets for making these improvements:\n\n- Help customers save $600 million in energy costs by 2026, with a start year of 2023, through proper use of energy-saving products we sell.\n- 85% of U.S. and Canadian sales in push mowers and handheld outdoor lawn equipment (combined) in-store and online (combined) will be in rechargeable battery technology by year-end 2028.\nRenewable and Efficient Energy\n\nTo execute against our carbon reduction strategy, we focus on several initiatives including: sourcing clean/renewable electricity, promoting a cleaner grid and increasing the efficiency of our stores and supply chain network.\n\nRenewable Energy\n\nKey to reducing our carbon footprint is our investment in alternative energy solutions. Given the dynamics of the renewable energy market, we have built a diversified energy portfolio, which includes off-site wind and solar electricity procurement, rooftop solar projects, fuel cells and on-site batteries to power stores during peak demand spikes.\n\nThe Home Depot joined RE100, a global initiative of business leaders who pledge to produce or procure 100% renewable electricity. In our pledge, we committed to produce or procure enough electricity to meet the electricity needs of all The Home Depot facilities with renewable energy by the end of 2030. This builds upon our recently achieved goal to produce or procure 335 megawatts (MW) of renewable or alternative energy capacity by 2025.\n\nIn 2022, three additional projects came online: Noble Solar, Samson III Solar and a wind farm project in Nebraska. We expect to purchase about 535 million kWhs of renewable energy from these three projects on an annual basis. Once fully operational, and in combination with our previous projects, we expect a total of six renewable energy projects to provide enough electricity to power the equivalent of over 900 Home Depot stores.\n\nWe are also proud to have recently joined the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) Green Power Partnership (GPP), an EPA-led program that aims to advance the American market for renewable electricity, while also helping to protect the environment. Our annual power usage from wind and solar resources placed us 8th among the top 30 retailers in this program as of January 2023.\n\nThe Home Depot continues to leverage the space atop our stores. As of the end of 2022, we expanded our rooftop solar installations to 86 stores and six distribution centers. We continue to increase our emphasis on rooftop solar by:\n\n- Increasing the amount of roof space allocated to solar panels at our stores\n- Exploring possibilities for adding solar panels atop more distribution facilities\n\nEnergy Efficiency in Our Stores\n\nFor more than a decade, we have been making investments to increase the efficiency of our stores. Despite the expansion of our store footprint, our investments, which include LED interior lighting, high efficiency HVAC systems and operating procedures among others, have helped us mitigate the electricity demands needed to run our operations. These and other investments helped us reduce our U.S. store electricity use by approximately 3.8% year-over-year, and 52% since 2010.\n\nWe continue to pilot new efficiency projects like exterior LED retrofits across 36 of our Canadian stores, while also operating electricity-generating fuel cells in more than 200 stores.\nEnergy Efficiency in Our Supply Chain\n\nIn addition to our stores, we are also making investments to create efficiencies within our distribution centers and other buildings, including automating and mechanizing many of our facilities and leveraging hydrogen-powered forklift technology. The transition to hydrogen-powered forklifts has helped us reduce electricity consumption over the years, which is why we have committed to have 90% of forklifts be hydrogen-powered in our major U.S. distribution facilities by the end of fiscal 2029. Hydrogen-powered forklifts provide a number of benefits over traditional propane-powered or battery-powered forklifts, including zero direct GHG emissions and the ability to rapidly refuel.\n\nIn 2022, we installed hydrogen fuel cells at 15 supply chain facilities, giving us a total of 30 locations with emissions-free fuel for forklifts. We estimate these fuel cells helped us reduce electricity consumption by about 38.5 million kilowatt hours in 2022.\n\nProgress On Power\n\nOn average, fuel cells produce 90% of electricity needs at 217 facilities, helping reduce emissions.\n\nAt 55 U.S. stores, on-site batteries store power during off-peak times for use when demand spikes.\n\n800+ U.S. stores participate in demand mitigation to optimize our electricity costs during peak demand and help local utilities better manage grid capacity.\n\nDID YOU KNOW\n\nOur U.S. stores with LEDs consume about 30% less electricity than similar stores with conventional lighting.\nOptimized Supply Chain\n\nBy making our supply chain more efficient, we reduce business costs and the impact our product distribution has on the environment.\n\nWe continue to invest in expanding our supply chain network, with the goal of achieving the fastest, most efficient and most reliable delivery capabilities in home improvement. Our continued focus on building these best-in-class competitive advantages in our supply chain enables us to drive down costs and meet our customers\u2019 needs, while also reducing our transportation-related emissions.\n\nThe unique capabilities of our supply chain enable us to meet the changing needs of both our Professional and DIY customers. Our range of distribution center platforms allow us to keep our stores stocked, deliver a flatbed truck of building material to a job site, and ship packages to our customers\u2019 doorsteps. The efficiencies that these platforms create helped us reduce miles driven and our supply chain emissions year-over-year.\n\nThe investments that we have made in our supply chain, in combination with the investments in renewable energy and driving efficiency in our stores, have helped us reduce our carbon intensity (page 50).\n\n**DRIVING SUPPLY CHAIN EFFICIENCIES**\n\n1. Grew our network of warehouses and distribution centers to **over 400** - increasing speed and efficiency.\n2. Moved more than **6 billion cubic feet** of product through our supply chain.\n3. Reduced supply chain miles driven compared to the prior year.\n\n**Ways We\u2019re Driving Supply Chain Improvements**\n\n- By partnering with suppliers to forgo pallets, we can stack products to the top of trailers, **resulting in a reduction in the number of truckloads** needed to transport some goods.\n- We do a technology-assisted assessment of scheduled pickups and deliveries, then recommend optimized routes to **reduce miles traveled, fuel consumed and trucks on the road**.\n- We sell available space on our trucks and buy space from other companies, ensuring fewer underloaded trailers hit the road. **That space sharing saves about 1.4 million driven miles a year.**\n- Optimization technology guides how we pack trucks or ocean-bound containers. We **maximize the product load, reducing the number of truckloads and containers** \u2014 and overall emissions.\n\n\u201c**The investments we are making in our supply chain are focused on creating a more efficient network. Continued efforts to optimize routes, maximize product on a truck, and warehouse automation help us deliver on our goal of creating the fastest and most efficient supply chain in home improvement. The efficiencies that we are creating within our supply chain provide a better customer experience and help us reduce our transportation-related emissions.**\u201d\n\n**SARAH GALICA**\nVice President of Transportation\n15+ years with The Home Depot\nEnergy-Saving Products\n\nCustomers who use our energy-saving products reduce their power bills and their impact on the planet.\n\nThe Home Depot encourages suppliers to make the products we sell more energy-efficient, and our partnership with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s ENERGY STAR\u00ae program supports those efforts, too. Our collaboration with suppliers to improve the sustainability of their products has long been in place, and we have a new goal to help customers save $600 million in energy costs by 2026, with a start year of 2023.\n\nIn 2022, we helped our U.S. customers save $1.2 billion on utility bills through the purchase of energy-efficient products. ENERGY STAR-labeled products were part of this progress. In 2022, we offered approximately 26,000 energy-saving products in stores and online, including approximately 15,000 ENERGY STAR products. We sold more than 177 million units of ENERGY STAR products.\n\nWe estimate our customers\u2019 purchases and proper use of ENERGY STAR products in 2022 helped reduce annual electricity use by 3.8 billion kilowatt hours, saving $554 million on energy costs and lowering carbon emissions by 2.6 million metric tons.\n\nGOING GREEN, SAVING GREEN\n\nIf all clothes dryers sold in the U.S. were ENERGY STAR certified, Americans could collectively save more than $1.5 billion each year in utility costs and prevent greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to those from more than 2 million vehicles.\n\nENERGY STAR certified heat pump water heaters can save a household of four approximately $550 per year on electric bills compared to a standard electric water heater.\n\n1 2022 Energy- and-water saving product figures include HD Supply, prior year figures were specific to Home Depot U.S.\n2 Energystar.gov\nSUSTAINABLE FORESTRY\n\nWe aim to ensure the transparent, responsible use of global forest resources in our products.\n\nWe understand that responsible forest management preserves and protects the benefits forests provide, especially in endangered forested regions. Our sustainable forestry efforts focus on ensuring that wood supplies are managed responsibly and wisely today so that timber and healthy forests remain available for future generations. To support these efforts, we aim to eliminate the purchase of wood and wood products from endangered regions such as the Amazon or Congo Basin areas, Papua New Guinea or the Solomon Islands, unless FSC-certified. We take pride in promoting sustainable forestry practices among our suppliers and supporting our customers\u2019 access to sustainably sourced wood products.\n\nKey forest benefits:\n\n- Over 1.6 billion people rely on forests for their livelihoods.\u00b9\n- Roughly 31% of the world\u2019s land surface is covered by forests.\u00b2\n- Forests are home to an estimated 80% of terrestrial biodiversity.\u00b9\n- Tropical forests make up 30% of the world\u2019s forests, but contain 50% of the world\u2019s carbon stored in trees.\u00b3\n\nWood Purchasing Policy\n\nThe Home Depot has prioritized responsible wood sourcing since 1994, when we first offered certified-sustainable wood shelving to our customers. We recognize the importance of protecting the world\u2019s woodlands for their many ecosystem services: biodiversity, carbon sequestration, filtering our fresh water and providing a renewable source of building material. This is why we work with suppliers that share our commitment to forest management and sustainable forestry. In 1999, we first adopted our Wood Purchasing Policy to help protect endangered forests and support efforts to preserve timber resources for future generations. We regularly review and update our policy, working with our suppliers to raise their awareness of sustainable forestry practices and encouraging their implementation of those practices.\n\nWe have used our influence to improve the protection of forests at the highest risk. We sell less than 2% of the roundwood cut worldwide, but we believe our activities have improved the industry\u2019s forestry practices. Our sources of wood products are from North America (approximately 80%), South America (approximately 10%), Asia (approximately 5%) and from Africa, Eurasia, Europe and Oceania (approximately 5%).\n\nOur Forestry Impact\n\nUnderstanding our forestry impact is important to ensuring we maintain sustainable forestry practices. Periodically, we partner with our suppliers to assess our impact on the world\u2019s forests, and we are doing so again this year. In July 2023, we provided even greater transparency to our stakeholders by submitting a response to the CDP Forests Survey. Further, this year we are continuing to conduct a sustainable forestry assessment of The Home Depot\u2019s efforts to ensure its commitment to sustainable forestry. That assessment is informed by:\n\n- A review of our wood sourcing policies, programs, and due diligence practices;\n- Engagement with internal and external stakeholders; and\n- Industry benchmarking regarding efforts to mitigate deforestation.\n\nWe anticipate issuing a public report on this assessment in the second half of fiscal 2023.\n\n\u00b9 https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-brief/forests-and-climate-change\n\u00b2 https://www.fao.org/forests/en\n\u00b3 https://research.wri.org/gfr/biodiversity-ecological-services-indicators/forest-carbon-stocks\nResponsible Sourcing\n\nOur supply chain decisions are heavily influenced by regional forestry issues around the world, so we proactively assess forest coverage in the regions where our suppliers are located. The U.N.\u2019s 2020 State of the World\u2019s Forests report reveals that more than half the world\u2019s forest coverage spans parts of five countries: the United States (8%), Canada (9%), Brazil (12%), China (5%) and Russia (20%).\n\nThe majority of our wood comes from North America, and we work with some of the most experienced and sophisticated forestry companies in the region, who participate in sustainable forestry certifications and membership organizations such as:\n\n- Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)\n- Sustainable Forest Initiative (SFI)\n- Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC)\n- American Tree Farm\n\nCertification helps forestry companies ensure that their trees are sustainably managed, which in turn ensures that our sustainable sourcing expectations are met.\n\nThe Home Depot suppliers like Mendocino Redwood Company (MRC) and Humboldt Redwood Company (HRC) are sustainability leaders, implementing forest restoration projects and responsible private forest management practices with forest lands certified by the FSC for superior management practices.\n\nEngaging Across Jurisdictions\n\nOur wood sourcing supply chain spans many jurisdictions with varying levels of forest protection regulations. We believe our work with suppliers to meet commitments listed in our Wood Purchasing Policy has helped promote the expansion of forested areas in North America and the sustainable management of forests. In our effort to share best practices with suppliers and engage our stakeholders, we have enhanced our commitments over time and successfully made positive impacts to minimize risks to the world\u2019s forests through our policies.\n\nThe Home Depot\u2019s Wood Purchasing Policy outlines our commitment to:\n\n- Give preference to the purchase of wood and wood products that are certified and/or originate from well-managed forests\n- Eliminate the purchase of wood and wood products from forest regions identified as endangered.\n- Practice and promote the efficient and responsible use of wood and wood products\n- Promote and support the development and use of alternative environmental products\n- Not to accept wood products from the Amazon or Congo Basin areas, Papua New Guinea or the Solomon Islands, unless such products are FSC-certified\n- Require that our vendors and their suppliers of wood and wood products maintain compliance with laws and regulations pertaining to their operations and the products they manufacture\n\nLearn more about how we support Sustainable Forestry on our Eco Actions Website. We share how we work with suppliers to ensure best practices in forest management and other initiatives to protect the world\u2019s forests.\nCIRCULARITY\n\nThe Home Depot strives to help the home improvement and building industry change the way it thinks about materials. In the past, products were designed for a single use, after which they would go into the waste stream. Today, we encourage our suppliers to innovate to extend the life of products by supporting continued use and higher resource efficiency through reuse, recycling and even composting biodegradable materials.\n\nSince we introduced Circularity as one of our sustainability pillars in 2019, our focus has been to prevent products and packaging from becoming waste throughout the product lifecycle.\n\nWe strive to offer products with a positive environmental impact, and we encourage suppliers to innovate in how they produce and package products for reuse and longevity.\n\nThese efforts are behind the motivation of our new goal to reduce or convert 200 million pounds of virgin plastic used in products to recycled or alternative material by the end of 2028.\n\nWe also look for opportunities within our own operations to reduce, reuse and recycle. The objective is to extend our planet\u2019s natural resources and protect land and water from the impact of material disposal.\n\nAlong with our suppliers and vendors, we are developing our thinking and capabilities to:\n\n- Design with the environment in mind\n- Eliminate excess material\n- Eliminate materials that are not readily reusable or recyclable\n- Minimize mixed materials to enable simpler disassembly and recycling\n- Prioritize materials that are biodegradable or readily recyclable\n- Utilize recycled content, when possible, without compromising product efficacy\n- Maximize the reuse of material\n- Promote minimization of environmental impact in manufacturing and consumer use\n\nCHECK IT OUT\n\nThe Home Depot\u2019s Eco Action\u2019s website provides customers informational resources to help reduce waste and find ways to give products a second life - everything from composting to battery recycling to harvesting leaves for mulch.\nProduct Circularity\n\nIn a circular economy, nothing is wasted. Materials that would be typically thrown away can be reimagined or reinvented into something useful. Everyday items like plastic pots can enjoy a second life as hanging baskets, while plastic wrap can be transformed into deck boards, and EPS foam can be revived as insulation. The benefits of product circularity touch on every part of a product\u2019s lifespan. Recycled materials in product design lower the amount of natural resources used in manufacturing. Durable, reusable products lower the amount of waste sent to landfills. In addition, product circularity appeals to customers who want to do their part to help the planet.\n\nBetween our market delivery operations and reverse logistic centers, we now recycle not only metal, hard plastics and shrink wrap, but we are now recycling styrofoam packaging and the CFCs from reclaimed appliances.\n\nEnacting our Values:\n\n- **Doing the Right Thing**\n  reducing waste\n\n- **Entrepreneurial Spirit**\n  selling useful products for customers\n\n- **Creating Shareholder Value**\n  creating new revenue streams\n\nDiscover our recycling suite: We\u2019re generating value from these hard-to-recycle materials\n\n- **METALS**\n- **HARD PLASTICS**\n- **SHRINK WRAP**\n- **STYROFOAM PACKAGING**\n- **CFCs* FROM RECLAIMED APPLIANCES**\n\nWhat is expanded polystyrene (EPS)? An effective packaging material with a drawback: it takes more than a century to biodegrade.\n\n1. First, the EPS foam is removed from the packaging\n\n2. Next it\u2019s compressed into blocks using a special machine\n\n3. Finally, it\u2019s sold to companies that use it for insulation and other purposes\n\n*Chlorofluorocarbons\nSustainable Packaging\n\nOur packaging innovations reduce waste, increase shipping efficiency and decrease product damage. That\u2019s good for the planet and our business.\n\nThe Home Depot\u2019s packaging team works with our private-label product suppliers to apply science to creating better packaging. Our goal is to reduce package footprints and use more sustainable materials to secure and protect the private-label products we sell. From 2017 through 2022, our packaging innovations allowed us to redesign more than 1,000 packages to reduce size and materials.\n\nUsing Less EPS & PVC\n\nIn 2022, our packaging team continued to find substitutes for expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) film in our private-label products. EPS foam is good at protecting products from damage, but it contains beads of chemicals and oil that are often difficult to recycle and can take more than a century to biodegrade. We continue to look across our private-label products to find even the smallest amounts of EPS and replace it with easier-to-recycle materials like molded pulp and paper.\n\nPVC film is a thin, rigid synthetic plastic polymer that\u2019s molded around products to secure and protect them. But, like EPS, it is tough to recycle and takes a long time to break down naturally, so we\u2019re working hard to use less of it.\n\nIn 2020, we committed to eliminating EPS foam and PVC film from our private-label packages by 2023, prompting us to dig even deeper for results.\n\nAs we approach the final year of our existing packaging reduction goal, our packaging team undertook several large projects across our private-brands catalog to drive incredible results against our goal to eliminate EPS foam and PVC from our private-brands packaging. The results of their work in 2022 demonstrates our commitment to reduce the impact our products have on the environment.\n\nAs we close in on the completion of this goal, we are excited to extend our commitment to circularity with the announcement of our new packaging goal:\n\n- All of our private-brand fiber packaging for new SKUs in our U.S. and Canada stores will be compostable, recyclable or recycled content beginning in fiscal 2027\n\nThis new goal helps support our environmental pillar of Circularity, which is aimed at protecting our planet\u2019s natural resources by protecting land and water from the impact of material disposal.\n\n2022 BY THE NUMBERS\n\n>7.3 million cubic feet of EPS foam was removed from our private-label packaging \u2014 equal to >4,700 Boeing 737s\n\n>81 million square feet of PVC film was eliminated \u2014 enough to cover Central Park twice\n\n~940 thousand pounds of damaged product avoided landfills due to private-branded packaging projects aimed at creating packaging to better protect products\n\n>40 million packaging units were rightsized from projects covering 350+ private-brand SKUs.\nTOOL CHEST\n\nIn our ongoing efforts to find more sustainable packaging options for our private-brand products, our engineering teams were able to redesign the packaging for our private-brand tool chests - solving unique challenges around this category because tool chests are large, heavy and sensitive to denting and scratching. This packaging redesign helped remove EPS foam from the packaging and reduce the amount of damaged product.\n\nThe new design improved the protection of the product and decreased damage to save 669,000 pounds of damaged product from going into landfills.\n\nRedesigned packaging for 40+ SKUs and 280,000+ units to remove EPS.\n\nNew packaging eliminated over 1.2 million cubic feet of EPS from our supply chain.\nRecycle, Repair, Reuse\n\nAt The Home Depot, we practice Circularity in our own store and distribution operations. We look for ways to divert the materials we use from the waste stream when we recycle supplies, repair equipment or reuse tools through our rental program.\n\nWays The Home Depot Supports Circularity\n\n**RECYCLE** by separating and collecting raw materials from our own waste streams and working with our suppliers to turn them into new products.\n\n**REPAIR** items in our stores to extend the life of products and avoid the energy emissions from manufacturing replacements.\n\n**REUSE** materials so less waste goes into landfills.\n\nProgress in 2022\n\n**Recycle:**\n\n| Pounds of Plastic (LDPE): | Tons of Cardboard (OCC): | Pounds of EPS Foam: | Tons of Metal: |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|---------------|\n| 2022                     | 17.5 million             | 272,200           | 163,700       |\n| 2021                     | 18.3 million             | 272,900           | 138,700       |\n| 2020                     | 16.9 million             | 261,500           | 82,000        |\n\n| Lead-Acid Battery Cores: | Pounds of CFL Bulbs: | Pounds of Rechargeable Batteries: | Pounds of Obsolete Technology Assets: |\n|--------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| 2022                     | 180,700             | 460,200                       | 1.3 million                         |\n| 2021                     | 204,300             | 514,200                       | 1.2 million                         |\n| 2020                     | 184,600             | 562,700                       | 1.2 million                         |\n\n2023 THE HOME DEPOT ESG REPORT\n### Repair:\n\n#### Tools Repaired by The Home Depot\n\n| Year | Repairs |\n|------|---------|\n| 2022 | 200,600 |\n| 2021 | 233,900 |\n| 2020 | 169,000 |\n\n#### Tool Repairs Referred to Third-party Service Providers\n\n| Year | Repairs |\n|------|---------|\n| 2022 | 12,100  |\n| 2021 | 10,700  |\n| 2020 | 12,500  |\n\n### Reuse:\n\n#### Tons of Returns Salvaged\n\n| Year | Salvaged |\n|------|----------|\n| 2022 | 126,600  |\n| 2021 | 114,900  |\n| 2020 | 120,800  |\n\n#### Pounds of Returns Donated\n\n| Year | Donated |\n|------|---------|\n| 2022 | 0.5 million |\n| 2021 | 2.2 million |\n| 2020 | 0.4 million |\n\n### Sustainable Shredding\n\nIn the U.S., we provided approximately 5.3 million pounds of shredded paper for recycling in 2022.

We partner with vendors to keep improving how we and our customers reduce, reuse and recycle.\n\nHAZARDOUS MATERIALS DISPOSAL & HANDLING\n\nWe seek sustainable methods of disposal, and in 2022, our Company sent 30% of the hazardous waste from operations and customer returns to be recycled or used for energy recovery off-site. We properly disposed of the remaining waste.\n\nASSOCIATE TRAINING & RESOURCES\n\nAssociates receive annual training on recognizing hazardous materials. Associates responsible for managing storage and cleanup of hazardous materials complete additional in-depth environmental compliance training.\n\nInformation about and guidance for the cleanup, classification, labeling and storage of hazardous waste is available to associates through our hdPhones and our associate intranet site.\n\nPREVENTATIVE ACTIONS\n\nWe take specific steps to avoid spills and contamination across the store with particular focus on these areas:\n\nGarden center\u2014Proper handling of fertilizer and pesticides bags, including checking for and properly repairing damaged bags.\n\nReceiving and central storage\u2014Appropriate procedures for handling, accumulating, storing, labeling and inventorying hazardous waste and separating potentially incompatible materials.\n\nInspections of key areas\u2014Routine inspections of garden areas, parking lots and store entrances to identify potential problems; scheduled sweeps of fertilizer aisles and parking lots help protect against hazardous materials being washed into the environment.\n\nRESPONSIVE ACTIONS\n\nIf a spill does occur, we have the following resources in place to properly address it:\n\nSpill kits and containers\u2014Located throughout each store for prompt and effective cleanup and disposal of hazardous materials such as paint, solvents, aerosols, oil, fuel, pesticides and fertilizers.\n\nEmergency response\u2014A third-party consultant provides an emergency response team available 24/7 to assist with hazardous materials cleanup and, if necessary, provide remediation services.\nWATER CONSERVATION\n\nOur freshwater resources are an essential ingredient of life that we must protect from water scarcity and drought. This is why The Home Depot commits to conserving water as one of our five environmental pillars. We work to reduce water consumption in our store operations and help guide our customers to water-conserving products with product selection and labeling.\n\nStore Operations\n\nAs water scarcity continues to impact many of our communities, we remain committed to taking steps to reduce our water consumption and helping our customers to do the same.\n\nWhile our business relies on healthy watersheds in the regions where we operate, we know the greatest impact we can have is through the products we sell, like washing machines, toilets, dishwashers and faucets, which help reduce our customers\u2019 water usage.\n\nWe aim to make this resource more abundant and readily available to the communities we serve.\n\nWater Use Drops with Smart Irrigation\n\nA pilot program launched in 2019 showed us the potential of using smart irrigation systems to save water at our stores. Since rolling out the pilot in 2019, we have grown this program to over 500 U.S. stores. On average, there is a 29% reduction in water used to irrigate landscaping, compared to stores with traditional timer-based irrigation systems.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: In-ground sensors, real-time weather data and other data sources guide when sprinklers come on and how long they operate. This approach helps water a store\u2019s landscaped areas according to plants\u2019 needs, rather than the clock.\n\nWater Accumulation Tanks\n\nIn select stores, we use water catchment systems to store water in tanks used for irrigation in our garden centers. By recycling water rather than tapping it from the ground, we can reduce our strain on local water resources.\n\nWater Resilient Landscaping\n\nFor our zoned planting areas, we incorporate local species that do not require excess watering or maintenance, as they are adapted to the local ecosystem.\n\nDual-Flush Toilets\n\nWe have equipped store restrooms with dual-flush toilets that offer a low-water flush option. These models can reduce the water used per flush by half when the option with a lighter water flow is selected. Customers and associates can help conserve water resources by choosing the higher flow option only when necessary.\nWater-Saving Products\n\nThe Home Depot helps protect water resources nationwide by selling products designed to conserve.\n\nIn alignment with the U.N. Sustainable Development Goal to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, we work with suppliers to encourage the production of water-conserving products, which we, in turn, offer to our customers. We believe our greatest opportunity to effect environmental change for the better is by selling products that help drive efficient use of resources in the communities we serve.\n\nWe leverage our position as the largest home improvement retailer in the world to push for change through the products we decide to carry. An example of this is our strategic decision several years ago to only carry WaterSense toilets in our stores. Together with our suppliers, we work to make it easier for our customers to reduce their water consumption.\n\nIn 2022, we continued to help our customers conserve water in their homes and businesses. Across our stores and online, we offered approximately 7,500 water-saving products, including nearly 6,200 products bearing the U.S. EPA\u2019s WaterSense label, and we sold more than 22 million units of those WaterSense products.\n\nWe estimate our customers\u2019 purchases of WaterSense products in 2022 helped reduce annual water consumption by over 33 billion gallons, which would collectively mean savings of more than $686 million on water bills.\n\nThe EPA estimates that household leaks can add up to nearly 1 trillion gallons of water lost every year. Fixing these leaks conserves water and can also reduce utility bills by about 10%. We provide project guides on our Eco Actions website to help educate customers on fixing or replacing leaky faucets.\n\nIn 2022, our Company was recognized for the 6th time as a WaterSense Partner of the Year since 2011, receiving the Sustained Excellence awards in three of those years.\n\nCHECK IT OUT\n\nLearn how The Home Depot partners with the Georgia Aquarium, one of the largest aquariums in the world, to promote awareness around the benefits of WaterSense products.\n\nGoing Green, Saving Green\n\nThe average family in the U.S. could save 2,700 gallons of water per year by installing WaterSense-labeled showerheads.\n\nReplacing old, inefficient bathroom faucets and aerators with WaterSense labeled models can save the average family nearly 11,000 gallons of water over the faucets\u2019 lifetime.\n\nBy replacing old, inefficient toilets with WaterSense labeled models, the average family could save more than $140 per year in water costs.\n\nSource: EPA.GOV\nRESPONSIBLE CHEMISTRY\n\nWe address chemicals of concern in our products and provide transparency into our approach in our regularly updated Chemical Strategy.\n\nWe acknowledge the responsibility we have for the environmental impact of our organization and that our biggest impact is the products we sell. In partnership with stakeholders throughout the supply chain, we are committed to offering products that are safer for the environment and our customers.\n\nWith our encouragement, our suppliers have been investing in developing environmentally innovative products. We support the work of the Green Chemistry & Commerce Council (GC3) through annual membership and participation in the Retail Leadership Council of the GC3, and we participated in developing the GC3\u2019s Joint Statement on using Green Chemistry and Safer Alternatives to Advance Sustainable Products.\n\nWe and many of our suppliers partner with respected third-party certification and environmental organizations that guide the home improvement industry toward safer chemical ingredient use. The Home Depot is committed to continuing the drive toward minimizing the environmental impact of the products we sell.\n\nOur Commitment\n\n- The Home Depot is committed to increasing our assortment of products that maintain third-party certifications of their chemical ingredients and that meet high environmental standards.\n- The Home Depot works with many suppliers in an effort to improve the chemistry of products in categories with the greatest potential impact on indoor air quality.\n- We encourage our suppliers to continually review key categories to track progress on environmental innovations in alternative chemistry.\n\nFlooring\n\nCarpet\n\nThe Home Depot\u2019s carpet suppliers have been at the forefront of the industry-wide removal of chemicals of concern and the exploration of safer alternatives. All indoor wall-to-wall carpet sold in store or online through The Home Depot U.S. and Canada has a third-party verification of transparency through DECLARE\u00ae Label or Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs), or certification of material health through Cradle to Cradle\u2122 Products Innovation Institute or CRI Green Label Plus\u00ae.\n\nThe following chemicals of concern are excluded from indoor wall-to-wall carpet in our U.S. and Canada stores:\n\n- Triclosan\n- Organotins\n- Ortho-phthalates\n- Vinyl chloride\n- Nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs)\n- Coal fly ash\n- Formaldehyde\n- Added heavy metals\n- Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)\n\nVinyl\n\nThe Home Depot vinyl flooring suppliers are setting the pace for change in this category with efforts to continually improve the chemical profile of their products. As of January 2016, no ortho-phthalates are permitted as added plasticizers in vinyl flooring sold in The Home Depot stores in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nLaminate Flooring\n\nLaminate flooring in The Home Depot stores is verified by either GREENGUARD Gold or FloorScore\u00ae certification to contain 0.0073 ppm or less of formaldehyde, which is stricter than the California Resources Board (CARB) Phase 2 standard of 0.05 ppm.\nResidential Household Cleaning Chemicals\n\nThe Home Depot continues to work with suppliers to improve products that impact indoor air quality. In 2022, we completed our goal to eliminate the following added chemicals of concern from residential cleaning products sold in-store and online:\n\n- Propyl-paraben\n- Butyl-paraben\n- Diethyl phthalates\n- Dibutyl phthalates\n- Formaldehyde (Added)\n- Nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs)\n- Triclosan\n- Toluene\n- Trichloroethylene (TCE)\n\nIn addition, our Eco Actions program identifies environmentally preferred products, including cleaners that have obtained certifications from independent third-party testers such as EPA\u2019s Safer Choice and Cradle to Cradle.\n\nInsulation\n\nOur fiberglass insulation suppliers have persistently challenged themselves to remove certain chemicals of concern from their products over the last decade. As a result, 100% of our fiberglass insulation products in the U.S. and Canada are GREENGUARD Gold certified and do not contain the following chemicals of concern:\n\n- Brominated flame retardants\n- Halogenated flame retardants\n- Antimony trioxide\n- Formaldehyde\n- Added heavy metals\n\nGardening\n\nOrganic gardening has grown from niche to mainstream, and The Home Depot has expanded its organic gardening products to offer multiple brands of soils, fertilizers, and weed and pest control products to meet our customers\u2019 desire to avoid using synthetic pesticides and fertilizers. In 2016, we launched local, organic vegetables and herbs. We expanded the program in 2017 to half our U.S. stores and have committed to continue to expand our organics assortment.\n\nWe also committed at the end of 2018 to no longer treat plants in our garden centers with neonicotinoids, except where mandated by state law.\nPainting Products\n\nPaints\n\nOur paint suppliers have taken efforts over the last ten years to evolve their paints and offer products that help maintain air quality. The following chemicals of concern are excluded from our interior and exterior latex water-based wall paints in our U.S. and Canada stores:\n\n- Triclosan\n- Isocyanates\n- Formaldehyde\n- Lead/heavy metals\n- Alkylphenol ethoxylates and Nonylphenol ethoxylates (APEOs and NPEs)\n\nCertifications: In our U.S. stores, many of our most popular brands carry interior paints that are GREENGUARD\u00ae Gold certified, including:\n\n- Behr\u00ae Interior Dynasty, Marquee, Ultra and Premium Plus\n- Behr\u00ae Cabinet Door & Trim (Alkyd)\n- Behr\u00ae PRO i100 and i300\n- Behr\u00ae Copper Force\n- Behr\u00ae PRO Specialty Products, including Pre-Catalyzed Epoxy, Direct-to-Metal, Masonry/Stucco and Dryfall\n- Glidden\u00ae Premium\u2122, Diamond\u2122 and Essential\u2122\n\nPaint-tinting Colorants: In 2012, we transitioned our paint-tinting colorants in our U.S. and Canada stores from a solvent-based formulation to a water-based, low-VOC and ethylene-glycol-free formulation.\n\nVolatile Organic Compounds: All of our interior and exterior latex water-based wall paints in our U.S. and Canada stores are zero or low VOC.\n\nPaint Removers\n\nRemoving paints and varnishes safely and efficiently is an important step in many home improvement painting and staining projects. Methylene chloride has historically been the most effective product option in this category. The Home Depot is committed to working with suppliers and the EPA to identify alternatives with comparable efficacy.\n\nThe Home Depot phased out methylene chloride and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) from paint removal products at the end of 2018.\n\nOur current U.S. and Canada zero- and low-VOC paints are outlined here:\n\n**VOC VALUE <5g/L = zero VOC**\n- BEHRPro i300 Interior\n- BEHR Premium Plus Ceiling Paint\n- BEHR Premium Plus Exterior\n- BEHR Premium Plus Interior\n- Glidden Diamond Interior\n- Glidden Premium Interior\n- PPG Speedhide Pro EV Zero\n\n**VOC VALUE <50g/L = low VOC**\n- BEHR MARQUEE Ceiling Paint\n- BEHR MARQUEE Exterior\n- BEHR MARQUEE Interior\n- BEHR Dynasty\n\nNote: Colorants added to base paints may increase VOC level, depending on color choice.\nPROMOTING CUSTOMER ECO ACTIONS\n\nWe believe our greatest environmental impact comes from the products we sell, and our biggest opportunity to create change is by helping introduce customers to more sustainable products.\n\nWe help our customers learn about our products so they can select and use products in ways that are safer, more efficient and have less impact on the environment. Our customers have an important role to play in contributing a positive impact across all of the environmental sustainability pillars we prioritize: carbon emissions reduction, sustainable forestry, circularity, water conservation and responsible chemistry.\n\nEco Actions\n\nWe look for opportunities to help educate our customers on ways they can reduce their environmental impact through the projects they take on. Building on the progress we made with our Eco Options program, which we launched in 2007 and focused on helping customers identify products that have less of an environmental impact, we rebranded this program in 2021 under our new Eco Actions program. Our Eco Actions program now provides our customers with the resources they need to take individual action on environmental issues.\n\nOur Eco Actions website provides customers with new content, insights and ideas from innovative partners to inspire sustainable action. On the website, we have a page for each of our environmental pillars to educate customers about the issues we prioritize. Our Eco Action\u2019s growing library of sustainable DIY content includes:\n\n- Installing resource-efficient equipment and appliances\n- Winterization techniques for homes to save energy\n- Organic and water-saving lawn care strategies\n- Recycling resources for common household items\n\n\u201cEco Actions are the everyday activities that we can all take to lessen our impact on the environment and make more sustainable decisions for our households and our communities.\u201d\n\nCANDACE RODRIGUEZ\nSenior Director of Sustainability\nSmart Home Upgrades\n\nAs our customers build, operate and renovate homes, their product choices can significantly reduce residential carbon emissions. We help our customers make energy-saving home upgrades that can bring savings on energy costs while making a positive environmental impact.\n\nWe have a goal focused on helping customers save on energy costs through a variety of product-related activities.\n\nENERGY STAR Products\n\nThanks to our partnership with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s ENERGY STAR\u00ae program, we sell ENERGY STAR-labeled products. These labels identify products that are more energy-efficient than standard products of their class. This way, customers can quickly compare the energy efficiency of different home lighting, appliances and equipment.\n\nHome Winterization\n\nThe U.S. EPA estimates air sealing and insulation improvements can save homeowners approximately 11% on their home heating and cooling costs. We have added information on winterization strategies to our Eco Actions website to help our customers learn ways to prevent air leaks throughout their homes in attics, garage doors, windows, air ducts and other parts of the home typically built with low insulation.\n\nSmart Home Strategies\n\nCustomers can learn how to choose and install smart thermostats, tankless water heaters, solar-powered garden lighting and other techniques to minimize excess energy use. We recommend these technologies and clearly identify the benefits or energy savings potential on our Eco Actions website. For instance, tankless water heaters are up to 30% more energy-efficient than traditional natural gas water heaters.\n\nBattery-Operated Equipment\n\nAs more of the national energy grid converts to renewable energy sources, our customers can reduce their carbon emissions footprint at home by choosing electric-powered equipment. We give advice on our Eco Actions website about how to care for and maintain battery-powered handheld tools charged by lithium-ion batteries. We also share the additional benefits of these tools, such as their cordless, low-volume design.\n\nTo expand our range of available rechargeable battery technology, we recently set a goal to have more than 85% of U.S. and Canada\u2019s in-store and online sales of outdoor power equipment run on rechargeable battery technology by the end of 2028.\n\nSolar-Power Installation\n\nIn 2022, a record 700,000 homeowners installed solar panels in the U.S., according to the Solar Energy Industry Association. We aim to support the continued growth of the residential solar market by making home solar panels more accessible to our customers, which enables them to produce their own renewable energy for use throughout the home.\n\nIn 2022, The Home Depot partnered with Sunrun and Sunnova to offer solar panel and home battery storage sales and installation services from our stores. A total of 7,000 U.S. customers purchased solar systems at The Home Depot in 2022.\n\nThe solar energy systems from our suppliers can send excess power from customers\u2019 homes back to the electric grid. That enables an entire community to benefit from solar power.\n\nDID YOU KNOW\n\nFully electric power equipment such as mowers, blowers and string trimmers are cleaner, quieter and easier to use compared to traditional gas-powered equipment.\nBattery-powered mowers avoid harmful emissions and help prevent ~17 million gallons of gas being spilled annually.\n\nWaterSense faucets can help customers save approximately 700 gallons per year.\n\nThe U.S. EPA estimates that homeowners can save ~11% on total energy costs by sealing and insulating their homes.\n\nOver the lifetime of the product, clothes washers that have earned the ENERGY STAR certification can save ~$550.\nFrom Forestry to Gardening\n\nAs we discuss on page 56, sustainable forestry is an important component to our continued supply of wood products and building supplies. Our commitment to biodiversity also extends to many of the gardening products that we offer.\n\nWe promote our vision of sustainable landscapes at a smaller scale by encouraging our customers to adopt responsible gardening products and methods. Our partnerships with local growers enable us to offer healthy, environmentally beneficial plants and support businesses in the communities we serve.\n\nThe Home Depot partners with our growers and suppliers in advance of each growing season to offer trees, blooms and edible plants that support local environments and pollinators. Our gardening product offerings are informed by our understanding that backyards, balconies and patios are well-being retreats for our customers and mini-ecosystems that have an impact on their surroundings.\n\nGrowing Organic\n\nWe offer more than 30+ varieties of organic, non-GMO vegetable and herb plants grown according to methods approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Organic Program. Only products that have been certified as meeting the USDA\u2019s organic production and handling standards may carry the USDA Organic seal.\n\nNative Plants\n\nOur growers work closely with U.S. states\u2019 departments of agriculture to identify invasive plants that may threaten local native plants.\n\nSupporting Local Growers\n\nWe are proud to partner with more than 135 plant growers who balance the impact of their production with local environmental issues and growing conditions in their regions.\n\nSIMPLE STEPS TO ORGANIC GARDENING\n\nSTEP 1\n\nBUILD A FOUNDATION\n\nOrganic soils and low-impact supplements support healthy ecosystems. Kellogg Garden Organics All Natural Garden Soil for Flowers and Vegetables revitalizes your native soil, organically.\n\nSTEP 2\n\nCHOOSE ECO-FRIENDLY PLANTS\n\nOrganic plants help promote ecological balance and biodiversity. Bonnie Plants Organics are USDA-certified organic and give you a head start on your harvest.\n\nSTEP 3\n\nNUTURE WITH NATURE\n\nNatural fertilizers use organic ingredients to promote growth. True Organic Bone Meal with nitrogen and phosphorus helps produce larger organic fruits and vegetables.\n\nSTEP 4\n\nSELECT SUSTAINABLE MAINTENANCE\n\nInsecticides and weed retardants for organic gardening keep garden spaces green. Garden Safe Houseplant/Garden contains botanical insecticides that defend against pests, indoors and outdoors.\n\nCHECK IT OUT\n\nSee our assortment of organic soils, seeds, plants and more at HomeDepot.com.

That\u2019s why we support a number of eco-friendly opportunities that help customers implement circular economy principles in their daily lives. Learn more about Circularity here.\n\nTool Rental\n\nThe Home Depot has been renting tools to customers since 1995. In 2022, we had more than 8 million tool rental transactions. Our tool rental program, popular for both our DIY and Professional customers, supports a circular economy by extending the life of tools through sharing, repair and routine maintenance.\n\nRecycling and Compost\n\nAt the front of The Home Depot stores, we provide drop-off recycling bins with specialized services, depending on the region and our various partnerships. A few examples are our rechargeable battery recycling partnership with the nonprofit recycling program Call2Recycle, plastic garden pot recycling with East Jordan Plastics and compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulb recycling with US Ecology and Clean Earth. Although our nationwide assortment is largely LED bulbs, we still recycle CFLs through our drop-off recycling program, which recycled over 230 tons (460,200 pounds) of CFL bulbs in 2022 alone.\n\nIn addition to offering recycling stations to customers, we also sell a wide range of products made from recycled materials as well as materials that customers can recycle. We sell insulation made from recycled EPS, decking from recycled shrink wrap and fully recyclable paint.\n\nComposting\n\nThe Home Depot supports composting by selling the necessary bins and supplies as well as providing learning resources on our Eco Actions website, so customers can practice composting in their own homes, lawns and gardens.\n\nIn addition to promoting customer compost, we also sell nutrient-rich compost in more than 20 Pacific Northwest stores, which is produced from composted organic materials collected at our stores. We accomplish this closed-loop production thanks to our partnership with the composting company Cedar Grove.\n\nWater-Saving Systems\n\nCustomers of The Home Depot have significant opportunities to minimize their water use at home through a number of DIY projects we encourage on our Eco Actions website.\n\nWaterSense\n\nCustomers can quickly identify water-saving faucets, shower heads and appliances that carry the WaterSense label. These products have a lower-flow design, to tap the right amount of water needed for various applications. We also support related water-saving Eco Actions by educating customers how to fix leaky faucets on our Eco Actions website. Learn more about our water conservation efforts here.\n\nGardening Irrigation\n\nCustomers can see water-saving systems in action at our Home Depot stores, where we install drip irrigation and catchment systems to conserve water. On our Eco Actions website, we educate our DIY customers how to design and build water-saving systems for their own gardening and lawn care at home.\nSafe Home Environments\n\nIn partnership with stakeholders throughout our supply chain, we are committed to offering products that are safer for our customers to use in their homes.\n\nOur Responsible Chemistry environmental pillar is an important part of promoting the safety of all of our home furnishings and products. In 2017, we published our Chemical Strategy (see page 67) to encourage the exclusion of certain chemicals from paint, flooring, insulation, household cleaning and paint removers.\n\nCleaning Product Labels\n\nThe Home Depot offers environmentally preferred cleaners that carry third-party certifications validating their eco-friendly claims. Cleaning products that are non-toxic, biodegradable, free from harmful chemicals, plant-based and not tested on animals allow our customers to achieve clean and more sustainable homes.\n\nIndoor Air Quality\n\nPeople in the U.S. spend 90% of their time indoors on average. The U.S. EPA estimates that some air pollutants are found in concentrations two-to-five times higher indoors than outdoors. We sell high-performance air filters and ENERGY STAR rated air purifiers to help customers improve their health and comfort at home and remove dangerous mold and particulate matter from the air they breathe.\nECO-FRIENDLY CLEANING PRODUCTS SPOTLIGHT\n\nOur cleaning products help families cut down on messes and dirt in their homes with a lower environmental impact. This way, their routine cleaning habits are safer and produce less waste.\n\n**Harris All Purpose Cleaner**\nis formulated with natural ingredients so customers can avoid contacting harsh chemicals in their home environment.\n\n**FamilyGuard Disinfectant Cleaner**\nis a high-performing cleaner specifically formulated to be safe for children and pets which cleans dirt, oil and grime from hard, non-porous surfaces found in high-traffic areas of the home.\n\n**Nellie\u2019s Swedish Dishcloths**\nis made of natural fibers, but its incredible durability and biodegradable, reusable design means it can replace up to 15 rolls of paper towels.\n\n**CHECK IT OUT**\n\n\u201cWe are committed to being responsive to our customers\u2019 needs, and more and more of them are looking for environmentally conscious products. We work with our supplier partners to drive innovation across our cleaning aisle, from natural products that are still tough on bacteria and dirt, to biodegradable cleaning solutions.\u201d\n\n-Kristen Little, Senior Product Merchant for Cleaning\nSTRENGTHEN OUR COMMUNITIES\n\nOur Core Values shape our commitment to making the communities we serve stronger and more resilient.

Since 2003, we\u2019ve invested in and celebrated entrepreneurs through our Supplier Diversity Program, which has helped drive innovation, create jobs, and foster a positive impact in the communities we serve. In 2022, we spent $3.4 billion with diverse suppliers, compared to $3.3 billion the previous year.\n\nAs we announced in 2021, we plan to achieve $5 billion in annual spend with diverse suppliers by the end of 2025. We remain excited about the investments we\u2019ve made around our Tier II supplier diversity program, which is why we are expanding the scope of this goal to include both Tier I and Tier II diverse suppliers. This will allow us to support a greater number of diverse-owned businesses, beyond just those that we spend with directly.\n\nOur Tier II program is designed to drive greater spend from our direct, or Tier I suppliers, to the diverse businesses with whom they do business. Leveraging the capabilities of our new program, we can better ensure that a portion of the money we spend on products and services, even with suppliers that are not identified as diverse, makes its way to diverse enterprises. In addition, to support our Tier II suppliers, we provide supplier development programs and mentoring to assist diverse suppliers with business growth, and we partner with organizations that provide certification, education and opportunities for capital and networking.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned that increasing our spend with diverse suppliers is good for our customers and our business. By driving more spend to both our Tier I and Tier II suppliers, we will be able to drive further innovation in our value chain.\u201d\n\nBILLY BASTEK,\nEVP - Merchandising\nPartners in Growth\n\nThe Home Depot\u2019s Supplier Diversity strategy includes ethnic-minority, women, LGBTQ+, veteran and disability-owned business partners. We value a supply chain ecosystem that is diverse, drives innovation, allows us to provide the best customer experience and creates economically healthy communities.\n\nWe also believe that in order to support historically under-resourced entrepreneurs and the important role their businesses play in our own business and communities, we need to provide them the necessary investment, access, mentorship and resources. Beyond just the products we sell, we also work to identify diverse suppliers across our business, including real estate, transportation and other services. Below are just a few examples of diverse suppliers that we are proud to work with:\n\n**MYCA Material Handling Solutions**\n\nPatti Massey owns MYCA Material Handling, which provides data analytics technology to help customers uncover hidden costs in their supply chain networks.

Through The Home Depot Foundation, Team Depot and our nonprofit partners, we have built, renovated, and enhanced more than 55,000 veteran homes and facilities and invested more than $450 million in veteran related causes since 2011.\n\nThe Home Depot Foundation\n\nFor more than a decade, The Home Depot Foundation has been honored to support the U.S. military veteran community. Through its commitment to serving U.S. veterans, it has surpassed $450 million in support of the veteran community as of the end of fiscal 2022. This achievement is part of the Foundation\u2019s larger commitment to invest $500 million in veteran causes by 2025.\n\nGiving back to veterans is part of The Home Depot\u2019s culture and aligns with our Core Values. Whether it\u2019s the veterans and military spouses in our workforce or those in our communities, we are focused on helping support the brave men and women who served our country (see page 43).\n\nThe Foundation is focused on ending veteran homelessness, improving veteran housing through critical home repairs; and building accessible smart homes for veterans catastrophically wounded in combat. Since 2011, the Foundation surpassed more than $100 million invested to help address the issue of veteran homelessness at the national and local level. In 2022, the Foundation continued its commitment to end veteran homelessness across several initiatives.\n\nIn May, we announced an investment of more than $2 million towards affordable housing access and resources for homeless veterans. This investment will support nonprofit organizations, including City of Refuge, Veterans Empowerment Organization and Mary Hall Freedom Village, to provide nearly 50 new units of housing for individuals facing homelessness in our home city of Atlanta, the majority of which will be reserved for veterans. Grants to Quest Communities and Gateway Center will ensure veterans have access to supportive services, such as job skill training and stable housing.\n\nIn honor of Veterans Day, the Foundation also surprised 1,000 U.S. veterans across the country with rental and mortgage payment assistance. Many of these veterans previously faced homelessness before securing permanent supportive housing in facilities operated by longstanding Foundation partners, including U.S.VETS, Volunteers of America and Quest Communities.\n\n\u201cThe number of veterans facing homelessness was more than 65,000 when we established our first formal financial commitment to veterans in 2011, and we\u2019re proud to see progress today through significant declines in that figure,\u201d said Shannon Gerber, executive director of The Home Depot Foundation. \u201cHowever, there is much more work to be done, and we remain dedicated to working with our nonprofit partners to ensure the heroes who served our nation have a place to lay their heads.\u201d\n\nCHECK IT OUT\nLearn more about The Home Depot Foundation\u2019s 2022 Operation Surprise Campaign.\nTeam Depot\n\nIn 2022, Team Depot, The Home Depot\u2019s associate volunteer force, continued to partner with the Foundation to help improve the homes and lives of veterans, reaching approximately 1.4 million hours of service to veterans since 2011.\n\nOn Veterans Day of 2022, Team Depot volunteers and The Home Depot Foundation kicked-off their annual Operation Surprise campaign. The annual campaign aims to provide life-changing moments of surprise and support for veterans and communities in need. During our 2022 campaign, more than 12,000 Team Depot volunteers completed more than 500 projects across the country in partnership with our nonprofit partners.\n\nSince 2011, Team Depot has volunteered approximately 1.4 million hours of service to veterans.\nTRADES TRAINING: OUR PATH TO PRO PROGRAMS\n\nThe U.S. faces a significant labor shortage in skilled trades professionals. This shortage directly impacts our professional customers, which in turn impacts our customers' ability to source home improvement services.\n\nWe are committed to educating more people in the skilled trades and helping them upskill and find careers in the home improvement industry. With nearly 400,000 open roles in the trades nationally, we can't tackle this work alone. Industry leaders like Home Builders Institute (HBI), Construction Ready, SkillPointe Foundation and Atlanta Technical College (ATC) are helping us prepare skilled people for these opportunities.\n\nFive years ago, The Home Depot Foundation launched its Path to Pro program, which provides training programs, scholarships and certifications to key populations in our communities: separating military service members, youth and diverse adults. In 2020, The Home Depot launched a separate but related program to include more educational resources, coursework and job placement opportunities. The expanded program now connects our professional customer network with job seekers who have received training from the Path to Pro program. These complementary programs combine our core business values and capabilities to address our stakeholders' needs.\n\nThe Home Depot Foundation\n\nThe Home Depot Foundation\u2019s Path to Pro program launched in 2018 with a $50 million commitment to train the next generation of skilled tradespeople, diversify the trades industry, and address the growing labor shortage in the U.S.\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s trades-focused partnerships have introduced more than 132,000 people to the skilled trades and have trained more than 39,000 participants through programming available to youth, high school students, underserved communities and separating U.S. military, surpassing its initial commitment to train 20,000 people six years ahead of schedule.\n\nTo underscore our commitment to addressing the labor gap, in 2022 the Foundation committed an additional $3.7 million to support growth of youth programming with 100 Black Men of America, develop two additional academy programs in Sacramento and Phoenix, and add $300,000 in trades school scholarships, among other enhancements.\nMilitary Program\n\nThe Path to Pro military program is currently offered on 10 U.S. military bases and provides exiting service members access to a free, 12-week program that provides industry-recognized pre-apprenticeship certification (PACT) and OSHA 10 certifications. In 2022, nearly 800 military veterans were trained in carpentry, electrical, plumbing and HVAC services through this program.\n\nYouth Program\n\nThe Foundation aims to address the gap in the skilled trades by training the next generation of skilled trades people. In partnership with HBI, the Path to Pro high school program offers PACT curriculum and hands-on experience to 11th and 12th grade students in schools across more than 30 states. The Foundation also partners with Construction Ready (formerly CEFGA) to provide K-12 trades training programs in across more than 160 schools in Georgia.\n\nAcademy Program\n\nThe Foundation launched the community-based Path to Pro academy program, which offers training and certification for diverse adult populations. Path to Pro academies have successfully trained more than 1,000 students. Going forward, we expect to open additional programs in Phoenix and Sacramento to train skilled tradespeople to support those housing markets.\n\nScholarship Program\n\nThrough the Path to Pro scholarship program, The Home Depot Foundation and SkillPointe Foundation have awarded more than 190 scholarships for students nationwide to continue their education at a qualifying trades school or community college.\n\nCHECK IT OUT\n\nPathToPro.com outlines The Home Depot and The Home Depot Foundation\u2019s collective Path to Pro initiatives.\nThe Home Depot Business\n\nWe estimate 3.9 million jobs will open in home improvement-related trades over the next decade, which will continue to drive the unprecedented demand for skilled labor in the construction industry. In response, The Home Depot launched its Path to Pro program, launched nationally in October 2022, to help build the next generation of trades professionals and solve a top pain point of our Pro customers \u2013 finding the labor they need to grow their business.\n\nIn addition to the Foundation\u2019s efforts, the business-side Path to Pro program is a unique jobseeker and trades training platform that allows skilled labor candidates to learn about the trades, showcase their experience, and connect with The Home Depot\u2019s Pro customers who are looking to hire.\n\nExpanding Coursework in Path to Pro Skills Program\n\nThe Path to Pro Skills Program offers free, virtual training options for those interested in pursuing and growing a career in the skilled trades. Enhancements to the curriculum include additional \u201chow-to\u201d training content on drywall installation and paint, developed in partnership with vendors like BEHR. Additionally, the Skills Program offers OSHA 10 certification in partnership with CareerSafe, allowing participants to enhance their job site safety knowledge and qualifications for future jobs in the trades.\n\nConnecting Jobseekers & Pros Through Path to Pro Network\n\nThe Path to Pro Network is a free jobseeker marketplace created to connect skilled tradespeople to hiring trades professionals in the construction and home improvement industries. Jobseekers can visit PathtoPro.com to create a profile, upload their resume, and add photos of their work to connect with The Home Depot\u2019s Pro customers looking to hire in their local area. Pros can post jobs for free, as well as reach out to skilled labor candidates directly. Millions of Pros now have access to candidates in every state who are using the Path to Pro Network for career networking opportunities and to showcase their qualifications in the trades.\n\nBringing New Resources to PathtoPro.com\n\nSince 2021, PathtoPro.com has served student, parent, advisor, military, and Pro audiences by providing skilled trades career resources, as well as connecting interested candidates to both the Path to Pro Skills Program and Network platforms. In 2022, the content available on PathtoPro.com more than doubled, introducing eight new trade type pages, program guides translated into Spanish, as well as new pages that highlight the technical college and \u201cearn and learn\u201d pathways into the trades.\n\nDID YOU KNOW\n\nThe Home Depot works with diverse community partners like the Urban League to attract and prepare diverse trades people.\nDISASTER RELIEF & RESPONSE\n\nCommunities across North America face ongoing distress from disasters which lead to significant losses of life and property damage. The impacts of disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, floods and extreme weather events put our most vulnerable populations, including low-income families and the elderly, at risk. The Home Depot commits to providing disaster relief and response in line with our Core Values of Doing the Right Thing and Giving Back.\n\nBoth our Team Depot volunteers and The Home Depot Foundation provide disaster relief support in various ways. Our volunteers provide the service and donate their time off to assemble disaster relief kits and distribute them to communities in need. Volunteers located near disaster relief sites and from neighboring areas also give their time and energy to help remove debris and clean up their local communities after catastrophes.\n\nThe Home Depot Foundation invests in disaster relief efforts by partnering with nonprofits to target preparedness, short-term relief, and long-term recovery initiatives to build community resilience. The Foundation also invests money to target immediate needs for communities following disaster events.\n\nTeam Depot\n\nThe Home Depot has helped communities for many years prepare and recover from the devastating impacts caused by hurricanes, and 2022 was no different. In anticipation of the 2022 hurricane season, Team Depot built 7,000 disaster relief kits to be stored in The Home Depot distribution centers for strategic delivery when disaster strikes. Dozens of volunteers assembled the kits, which contain items like garbage bags, paper towels, cleaners, sponges, gloves and N95 masks in 5-gallon buckets. These kits provided essential supplies to communities impacted by hurricanes.\n\nImmediately following Hurricane Ian, Team Depot, along with the Foundation and other nonprofit partners, provided immediate assistance to communities in need by distributing water and relief supplies, delivering meals, providing shelter and removing debris in the impacted areas as soon as the storm cleared. In the weeks following one of the most devastating hurricanes to make landfall in Florida, more than 150 Team Depot volunteers traveled to work alongside Team Rubicon and provide critical relief to those in need.\n\nFollowing the catastrophic tornado outbreak that affected Central and Southern United States in January 2023, Team Depot delivered nearly 1,000 disaster relief kits and other relief supplies to a community distribution site in Griffin, Georgia, before helping clean up downed trees and removing debris from nearby neighborhoods. They also delivered water to local residents.\n\nDID YOU KNOW\n\nTeam Depot volunteerism extends beyond disaster relief. In April, National Volunteer Month, a passionate group of more than 7,000 Team Depot volunteers participated in over 400 service projects across the country.\nThe Home Depot Foundation\n\nWith the help of Team Depot and many other nonprofit partners, the Foundation is able to provide immediate support, resources and relief supplies to communities in need, while our merchandising, supply chain and operations teams move necessary product and equipment to stores in strike zones, and our stores often become command centers for first responders and relief agencies. Each year, the Foundation prepares before disaster strikes by pre-stocking nonprofit partner warehouses and The Home Depot distribution centers with relief supplies for quick deployment in the immediate wake of a storm.\n\nIn 2022, The Home Depot Foundation invested more than $7 million in key national nonprofit partners for annual operational support, early load-in of disaster response products, disaster relief kit distribution, immediate disaster relief efforts and long-term recovery efforts.\n\nThis included the Foundation\u2019s commitment of up to $1 million to support immediate disaster relief and long-term recovery efforts in communities impacted by Hurricane Ian, plus nearly $300,000 to help communities impacted by the devastating floods in the Appalachian and Midwest regions.\n\nCHECK IT OUT\n\nThe Home Depot premieres a documentary film \u201cHope Builds,\u201d offering a behind-the-scenes look at natural disasters and what it takes to rebuild.\nRESPONSIBLE BUSINESS PRACTICES\n\nWe understand our responsibility to behave ethically, to understand the impact we have on people and communities, and to fairly consider the interests of a broad base of stakeholders.\nCODE OF CONDUCT\n\nDoing the Right Thing is embedded in our culture. That applies to how we serve customers, give back to communities, support our people and conduct our business.\n\nOur Business Code of Conduct and Ethics provides straightforward information about The Home Depot\u2019s operating principles and offers tools to help associates make decisions that align with our ethical and legal obligations. The code applies to associates worldwide, and the Company expects them to comply with the code and with all applicable laws and regulations in countries in which we do business. In particular, the code outlines The Home Depot\u2019s ethical and legal standards in these areas:\n\n- Safety\n- Labor and employment\n- Conflicts of interest\n- Antitrust and fair competition\n- Confidentiality, privacy and information protection\n- Protecting the Company\u2019s assets and intellectual property\n- Insider trading\n- Financial integrity and reporting\n- Records retention\n- Environmental responsibility\n- Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and anti-bribery compliance\n- Political activity\n- Government Contracting\n\nWe empower associates to speak up when our ethical standards are not being met. We encourage them to voice concerns, express doubts, discuss problems and ask questions. In addition to sharing concerns with any member of their management team or a human resources partner, associates can report ethical or legal concerns to our Associate AwareLine, a 24/7 hotline. Reports can be made via thdawareline.com or through a live operator available in local languages. Associates may remain anonymous when reporting concerns.\n\nASSOCIATE AWARELINE\n1-800-286-4909\n\nReports are handled using a case management system. We have a longstanding policy that prohibits retaliation for making a report.\n\nWe also provide ways for suppliers, vendors, service providers and their workers to report concerns when they think our Home Depot values or compliance with the law may be compromised. Workers in countries from which we source goods may submit anonymous reports via thdsupplieralertline.com.\n\nSUPPLIER ALERTLINE\n\nIn addition, our Supplier AlertLine is answered by a live operator 24/7 in these countries:\n\nU.S. and Canada: 1-800-435-3152\nMexico: 001-888-765-8153\nChina: 400-8-801-045\nIndia: (Access Code) 000-117 (Dial) 800-435-3152\nVietnam: (Access Code) 1-201-0288 or 1-228-0288 (Dial) 800-435-3152\nRESPONSIBLE SOURCING AND HUMAN RIGHTS\n\nWe support suppliers that take action toward maintaining our collective commitment to human rights and safety in our supply chain.\n\nWe are committed to respecting the rights of all individuals throughout our supply chain. Our values of Doing the Right Thing, Respect for All People and Taking Care of Our People are at the center of our Human Rights program. The Home Depot and our affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries respect and support the dignity, well-being and human rights of our associates, the workers in our extended supply chain, the communities in which we live and those affected by our operations.\n\nFor over 15 years, our responsible sourcing program has helped us assess and manage the many aspects of our supply chain oversight and support our efforts to conduct our business in a responsible and ethical manner. We engage our suppliers by requiring them to produce products in factories that adhere to responsible sourcing standards. We report on our progress in our annual Responsible Sourcing Report.\n\nOur Responsible Sourcing Standards mandate that suppliers and factories abide by all applicable international and local laws, rules and regulations in the manufacturing and distribution of merchandise or services provided to us. We conduct audits of factories around the world to ensure compliance with our responsible sourcing standards.\n\nWe also place additional focus around higher-risk commodities, demographics and regions. As part of this approach, we monitor current trends in the domestic and international labor markets to identify growing risk areas in our supply chain and update our standards and audit practices based on any new trends.\n\nSince early 2019, we have significantly expanded the language in our responsible sourcing standards to address forced labor and the enforcement mechanisms to ensure the standards are met.\n\n- We updated and expanded our standards which prohibit all types of forced labor (including forced, bonded or indentured labor, prison labor, slavery, or human trafficking).\n- We also updated our standards to provide specific requirements regarding worker\u2019s freedom of movement, hiring practices, ability to terminate employment, access to identity or immigration documents, and payment of recruiting fees.\n- In addition, we also added a fine structure to our policy and include ways to identify forced labor indicators as part of our regular audit process.\n\nOur forced labor standards are based on the code of conduct developed by the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), the world\u2019s largest industry coalition dedicated to corporate social responsibility in global supply chains. Suppliers must maintain on-site documentation that demonstrates compliance with our responsible sourcing standards. They also must allow The Home Depot associates and/or representatives full access to production facilities, worker records, production records and workers for confidential interviews in connection with monitoring visits. We expect our suppliers to promptly correct any noncompliance, starting with timely preparation and presentation of a corrective and preventative action plan. We also re-audit supplier facilities, with the frequency depending on their performance in prior audits.\n\nIf suppliers fail to improve, we may terminate our business relationships with them. Equally important, we support factories that take action to create lasting social and environmental compliance programs. We encourage suppliers and factory workers to communicate concerns via processes outlined in our corporate Supplier Manual.\n\nOur responsible sourcing audits are designed to assess compliance in these areas:\n\n- Laws and regulations\n- Child labor\n- Forced labor\n- Harassment and abuse\n- Compensation\n- Hours of work\n- Non-discrimination\n- Freedom of association and collective bargaining\n- Health and safety\n- Environment\n- Subcontracting\n- Communication\n- Business ethics\n- Monitoring and compliance\nResponsible Sourcing Starts at the Top\n\n**BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND/OR BOARD COMMITTEE**\nprovides general oversight; receives annual progress report on and reviews results of the annual internal audit of the responsible sourcing program\n\n**EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP TEAM**\nsets the tone for our ethical standards and provides oversight and guidance, as needed\n\n**MANAGEMENT**\nresponsible for owning and managing risks and implementing actions to ensure responsible sourcing objectives\n\n**THE HOME DEPOT GLOBAL SOURCING OFFICES**\nwork with our supply chain to ensure compliance with our standards\n\n**THE HOME DEPOT\u2019S RESPONSIBLE SOURCING TEAM**\nincludes dedicated associates focused on ensuring factories adhere to our standards\n\n**THIRD-PARTY AUDITORS**\nconduct our responsible sourcing compliance audits\n\n**INTERNAL AUDIT**\nassociates conduct annual audits to ensure our responsible sourcing program is effective and operating as expected\n\n---\n\n**BY THE NUMBERS**\n\n- **1,420** factory audits\n- **229** factories audited for compliance at peak production\n- **76** subcontractors audited in 2022\n\nand 1,684 follow-up visits conducted in 33 countries under our responsible sourcing policy in 2022\nConflict Minerals\n\nWe work with our suppliers to ensure they implement responsible sourcing and encourage their smelters to obtain \u201cconflict-free\u201d designations.\n\nOur Company expects all suppliers that manufacture our products to provide appropriate information and conduct due diligence to enable our compliance with conflict minerals laws. We also expect these manufacturers to obtain products and materials from suppliers that are not involved in funding conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjoining covered countries. We partner with our private-brands and proprietary product suppliers whose products contain tin, tungsten, tantalum or gold (referred to as 3TG) to identify the source of any of these minerals in the supply chain.\n\n2022 Progress\n\nAs detailed in The Home Depot\u2019s Conflict Minerals Report for the year ended December 31, 2022, our efforts focused on collecting and disseminating information about the sourcing practices of our suppliers. We cataloged that information in a database using the conflict minerals reporting template developed by the Responsible Minerals Initiative\u00ae. We report this data for the calendar year, rather than our fiscal year, in line with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules. Our in-scope Tier 1 suppliers decreased to 14 in 2022, from 21 in 2021, and from 91 in 2020. In 2022, as part of our annual assessment of products in scope, we continued to exclude any supplier of products where the supplier merely affixed company brands, trademarks, logos or labels to generic products manufactured by a third party, as permitted by SEC guidance.\n\nThrough our due diligence process, which aligns with guidance from the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, we received 100% participation from our in-scope private-brands and proprietary-product Tier 1 suppliers.\n\nForty-three percent, or six, of our in-scope Tier 1 suppliers indicated that one or more conflict minerals were necessary to the functionality or production of covered products, down from 62% in 2021. Of the smelters or refiners reported by these suppliers, only 31 out of a total of 97 uniquely identified smelters or refiners sourced conflict minerals from covered countries. All 31 of these smelters or refiners were certified as DRC conflict-free by the Responsible Minerals Initiative, the London Bullion Market Association and/or the Responsible Jewellery Council.\n\nWe continue to work closely with our suppliers to ensure they implement responsible sourcing; obtain current, accurate and complete information about the supply chain; and encourage their smelters to obtain a \u201cconflict-free\u201d designation from an independent third-party auditor.\n\n100% of our in-scope private-brands and proprietary-product Tier 1 suppliers participated over the last three years in our efforts to collect conflict minerals information.\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nWe understand our responsibility to behave ethically, to understand the impact we have on people and communities, and to fairly consider the interests of a broad base of stakeholders.\n\nThe Home Depot has a long-standing commitment to strong corporate governance, which promotes the long-term interests of shareholders, strengthens Board and management accountability, and helps build public trust in the Company.\n\nOur Board of Directors has adopted policies and processes that foster effective Board oversight of critical matters such as strategy, risk management, financial and other controls, compliance, culture, ESG, and management succession planning.\n\nLeadership Structure\n\nOn at least an annual basis, the Board assesses its leadership structure, including the appointment of the Chair of the Board. The Board believes that, given the Company\u2019s current circumstances, having a combined Chair and CEO, a strong independent Lead Director who is annually elected by the independent directors, and Board committees composed entirely of independent directors currently provides the best Board leadership structure for the Company. Alternatively, having a separate CEO and Chair has supported a smooth management transition and ensured strong leadership at other times in the Company\u2019s history. The Board will continue to assess its leadership structure and make adjustments as circumstances warrant.\n\nOUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE POLICIES REFLECT BEST PRACTICES:\n\nShareholder Protections\n- Annual election of directors, with majority voting standard in uncontested director elections\n- Shareholder ability to call special meetings and act by written consent\n- A market standard shareholder right of proxy access\n- Independent Lead Director\n- Approximately 92% of directors and all Board committee members are independent\n- Director mandatory retirement age (age 72)\n- No shareholder rights plan, also referred to as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d\n\nBoard Engagement and Oversight\n- Annual Board strategy session and review of the Company\u2019s strategic plan\n- Director overboarding policy\n- Store-walk policy for directors\n- Board education and orientation program\n- Annual Board and committee self-evaluations, including individual director interviews\n- Management succession policy set forth in Corporate Governance Guidelines\n- Independent directors meet without management\n\nBoard Committees\n\nOur Board of Directors has established four standing committees - Audit Committee, Finance Committee, Leadership Development & Compensation (LDC) Committee and Nominating & Corporate Governance (NCG) Committee - each comprised solely of independent directors and governed by a written charter that sets forth its purpose, composition, powers, duties and responsibilities.\n\nLearn More\n\nOur proxy statement offers more details about our corporate governance and risk management. Go to our Corporate Governance Overview for additional information on our corporate governance practices.\nBoard Oversight of Risk\n\nThe Company has a robust framework designed to identify and ensure proper management of risk, including risk related to our ability to operate responsibly and sustainably. The framework that we use to identify and manage risk considers a number of enterprise-level issues, including competitive environment, brand and reputation, regulatory and compliance, and security, as well as external and internal factors that could distract the Company from our business or derail our strategic objectives. The Board oversees risk through this framework, with oversight accomplished by identifying key risks and mapping them to the appropriate Board Committee or to the full Board.\n\nOur Board reviews these key risks and the related framework annually, and the full Board or appropriate Board committees discuss selected risks in more detail throughout the year. The table below identifies key risk areas overseen by the Board and its committees. Going forward, our Board will continue to assess its oversight structure and make adjustments as appropriate.\n\n### Board of Directors\n\n#### FULL BOARD\n- Has primary responsibility for risk oversight, including approval of strategic objectives and defining risk appetite\n- Delegates oversight of management of certain risks to Board committees\n- Receives regular reports from the committees regarding risk-related matters\n\n#### AUDIT\n- Overall risk assessment and management\n- Financial exposures, statements, controls, systems and reporting\n- Regulatory and compliance, including FCPA/anti-bribery and our whistleblower program\n- Data protection and cybersecurity\n- Internal audit and related investigatory matters\n- Product quality and safety and associate and customer safety\n\n#### FINANCE\n- Long-range strategic planning\n- Long-range financial outlook and finance-related risks\n- Capital structure, including investments and capital allocation principles\n- Annual capital plan and key capital investments\n- Merger and acquisition strategy\n\n#### LDC COMMITTEE\n- Senior executive compensation\n- Senior executive succession planning\n- Overall risk related to the Company\u2019s compensation policies and practices\n- Human capital management\n- Non-employee director compensation\n- Diversity, equity and inclusion, including pay equity\n\n#### NCG COMMITTEE\n- Corporate governance\n- Director succession planning and board composition\n- Corporate social responsibility, environmental, and responsible sourcing initiatives, risks and opportunities\n- Policies on political activity, including political spending and payments to trade associations\n- Related-person transactions\nGOVERNMENT RELATIONS\n\nWe are guided by our Core Values when participating in the political process and recognize that we may need to balance competing interests when evaluating laws that impact our business.\n\nWe actively participate, and encourage our associates to participate, in the political process. Our Political Activity and Government Relations Policy provides the framework for our political activity. We engage in three key ways:\n\n- Our Government Relations department protects and expands our Company\u2019s ability to take care of our associates, customers and shareholders through effective regulatory and legislative action. Our Government Relations team works to optimize the government\u2019s impact on the business through effective lobbying, relationship building and political engagement.\n\n- We have a political action committee (PAC) that connects our salaried associates to the political process and pools their personal contributions to financially support pro-business candidates who understand issues of importance to The Home Depot and our associates. As a long-standing practice, we do not contribute to presidential campaigns or endorse presidential candidates.\n\n- The Home Depot supports trade associations that advocate on behalf of the business community and retail sector and reports annually the aggregate dues paid to those associations that engage in lobbying activities.\n\nIn deciding where we want to focus our advocacy, these are some of our top priorities:\n\n- **Creating Economic Growth** by making sure we have a say in laws that encourage job creation, support a healthy housing market, promote the use of innovative products, and affect flexibility and career growth for associates\n\n- **Supporting a Strong, Secure and Sustainable Supply Chain** by advocating for funding for traditional infrastructure as well as a global trade framework to bring quality products at low prices to consumers\n\n- **Encouraging Fair Competition** by promoting a level playing field for all retailers to follow the same rules on taxation, privacy, accountability and transparency\n\n- **Combating Retail Theft** by supporting the passage of laws across the country to fight organized retail crime, which not only is a safety issue for all retailers, but also feeds other crimes in our neighborhoods\n\n- **Building Strong Private-Public Partnerships** to ensure high-skilled trades jobs have a robust applicant pool, and continuing to invest in our communities during natural disasters and other times of need\nOur Government Relations team carefully analyzes our engagement activities, trade association partnerships, and political contributions, guided by our top priorities and our eight Core Values. Our political donations are made to promote our interests, not based on the private political preferences of our executives or directors. We may not agree with every position taken by a candidate, elected official, or trade association we support, and a contribution to any individual or organization should not be taken to mean agreement with every position taken by that individual or group. However, we use several business-focused criteria and our Core Values to make decisions that will allow us to have a seat at the table to engage, both on the issues on which we align and those on which we disagree, to support our business, associates and communities.\n\nWe may also be called upon to weigh in on issues that are not core to our business or critical to a majority of our stakeholders. We have a thoughtful process for determining if we should speak on a particular issue, which includes a risk analysis, careful deliberation, assessment of business impact, and consideration of alignment with our Core Values.\n\nPath of the PAC Dollar\n\nOur political action committee connects salaried associates to the political process and pools their personal contributions to financially support pro-business candidates who understand issues of importance to The Home Depot and our associates.\n\n1. **PREPARE**\n   Eligible associates voluntarily choose to join The Home Depot PAC.\n\n2. **PACKAGE**\n   All participating associate contributions are pooled.\n   - $3,638,000 contributed to candidates and their leadership PACs in 2022\n   - 13,500+ individual contributors in that election cycle\n\n3. **QUALITY ASSURANCE**\n   Our Core Values drive all strategic decisions inside our Company, and we build relationships with elected officials who help enable our ability to implement those strategies to the benefit of our associates, customers, shareholders and communities. Here are the primary, business-focused criteria the PAC considers when deciding which candidates to support:\n   - Service on key committees important to The Home Depot\n   - Favorable position on one or more legislative issues that align with The Home Depot\u2019s business objectives\n   - Service in a current or potential leadership position\n   - Location of a Home Depot facility in the candidate\u2019s district\n   - Industry support from business and retail organizations\n\n4. **DISTRIBUTE**\n   PAC funds are distributed to candidates and their leadership PACs.\n\n5. **CONNECT**\n   We work to build relationships with lawmakers who are well positioned to legislate on issues important to The Home Depot and our associates.\n\n6. **ASSESS**\n   Legislators make informed decisions on issues affecting our Company.\n\nCHECK IT OUT\n\nLearn more about the steps The Home Depot takes to ensure we are responsible and transparent participants in the political process and how we encourage our associates to do so, as well.\nOversight of Our Political Activity\n\nOur Government Relations department, led by a vice president who reports to our general counsel, manages our political activity. The team carefully analyzes our engagement activities, trade association partnerships, and political contributions for alignment with our key priorities, guided by our Core Values. All of The Home Depot\u2019s political contributions are made to promote the interests of the Company and without regard for the private political preferences of executives or directors. The Government Relations team is responsible for ensuring all PAC and corporate political contributions are made in accordance with the law and Company policies. The team participates in regular trainings and performs routine reviews to monitor compliance.\n\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors provides additional oversight, conducting an annual review of our Political Activity and Government Relations Policy, the Company\u2019s political contributions, payments to trade associations that engage in lobbying activities, and the Company\u2019s support of ballot initiatives.\n\nThe Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee must approve in advance any public advertisement directly or indirectly paid for by the Company that expressly advocates the election or defeat of a candidate in which The Home Depot is identified specifically as an advocate of such election or defeat. To date, the Company has not made any expenditure for such electioneering communications, and has no present plans to make any such expenditures.\n\nThe Home Depot PAC\u2019s finances, governance and communications are governed by a PAC Board. The PAC Board is chaired by the vice president of Government Relations and is made up of representatives from each functional area of the business and each field division to ensure a wide range of experiences and perspectives.\n\nWe provide transparency in our actions by publishing an annual report of the Company\u2019s political contributions and the aggregate dues paid to trade associations that engage in lobbying activities, and any independent political expenditures by the Company supporting or opposing ballot initiatives and contributions to ballot measures committees. We list trade associations to which our Company makes yearly payments of $5,000 or more, and our PAC contributions are publicly available on the Federal Election Commission website.\n\nFollowing the continued enhancements to our Political Activity and Government Relations Policy and our disclosures in recent years, we were recently elevated to the First Tier of the CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability, which seeks to measure electoral spending transparency and accountability among the largest public corporations in the U.S.\nCORPORATE TAXES\n\nWe do the right thing for our associates, shareholders and communities by ensuring we pay our fair share of taxes and manage them transparently.\n\nTaxes are a significant component of The Home Depot\u2019s economic contribution to the countries, states and local communities in which we operate.
