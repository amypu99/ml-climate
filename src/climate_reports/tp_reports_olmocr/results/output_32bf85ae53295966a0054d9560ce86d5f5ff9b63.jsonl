They position us for the long term, keeping our company vital and agile so we can keep growing and creating value for our shareholders, and all stakeholders, for decades to come.\n\nEmpowering people and communities\n\nAt the heart of this work, and at the heart of everything we do, are Target\u2019s hundreds of thousands of team members. They strive to live out our purpose\u2014helping all families discover the joy of everyday life\u2014each and every day.\n\nOutstanding talent is a critical competitive advantage in an industry where people, personal service and a culture of care for our team and guests are key differentiators. In 2022, we set a new starting wage range of $15 to $24 an hour nationwide and provided faster and expanded access to health care benefits, marking another milestone in Target\u2019s commitment to holistic team support. Our tuition-free education assistance program is helping thousands of team members, most of whom work in frontline roles, achieve their dreams and advance their careers.\n\nThese and other meaningful investments in our team have enabled us to attract, retain and develop top talent. And our longstanding commitment to building a team that reflects the communities we serve and the neighborhoods where we operate helps us stay in step with the millions of guests who shop with us daily.\n\nIn turn, that team is caring for and playing a central role in strengthening the thousands of communities where our stores and supply chain facilities create jobs, vitalize economies and serve local guests.\n\nFortifying for future growth\n\nSustainable solutions are those that fortify our future. In addition to mitigating risks to our business and long-term performance, climate-related efforts provide near-term value and cost savings, while ensuring we meet our guests\u2019 growing calls for sustainable and affordable brands.\n\nConsider the rooftop solar systems we\u2019ve added at more than 500 stores. These projects generate enough energy to offset up to 40% of a property\u2019s energy needs, and incorporating them into already planned remodels is more efficient than costly retrofits down the road. Our net zero store in Vista, California, is designed to generate more renewable energy than needed to power its operations and serves as a testing site, providing insights to inform other store designs.\n\nWork underway in our owned brands, which can only be found at Target, is another clear example of innovation designed to drive growth. We\u2019re leveraging decades of design expertise to reduce waste and meet growing guest interest in more sustainable choices, without sacrificing the value, quality, newness and joyful experience they expect from Target. Meanwhile, our $30 billion owned brand portfolio keeps deepening connection with guests and outpacing total enterprise growth.\n\nMoving forward together\n\nEthical governance and transparent measurement and reporting are key to accountability and achieving our goals. That\u2019s why Target has publicly shared our corporate responsibility efforts since 1969 and why we continue that practice in the following report.\n\nI\u2019m inspired and humbled by our team\u2019s progress, agility and commitment to these efforts, which are informed by and support areas we know are important to our business. Combined with Target\u2019s culture of care, our focus on inclusivity, our deep commitment to our guests and communities, and our spirit of learning, this team knows how to flex and adapt\u2014serving our guests in any environment.\n\nAs we continue navigating forward, I\u2019m confident these same factors\u2014underpinned by our focus on excellent execution and an unrivaled, joyful guest experience\u2014will help us keep growing stronger, together.\n\nBrian Cornell\nChair and CEO\nQ&A With Our Senior Vice President of Corporate Responsibility & President of the Target Foundation\n\nAmanda Nusz, Senior Vice President of Corporate Responsibility & President of the Target Foundation\n\nTarget Forward, our enterprise-wide sustainability strategy, is grounded in a vision to co-create an equitable and regenerative future with our guests, partners and communities. That vision reflects our holistic view of sustainability, leading us to actions that positively impact both people and planet while driving long-term growth for our business. Amanda Nusz, who leads our sustainability commitments through Target Forward, reflects on the programs and partnerships driving critical progress in reaching Target\u2019s bold\u2014and interconnected\u2014ambitions.\n\nWhat are your reflections on the Target Forward journey to-date?\n\nI\u2019m so grateful for how our team has embraced this opportunity, collaborating\u2014with innovation and ingenuity\u2014across our business and with our partners to pursue these ambitions. They\u2019ve found such energy in applying Target\u2019s unique capabilities to our efforts. This work is a critical part of our business strategy and reflects our longstanding commitment to corporate responsibility.\n\nTarget Forward was designed to drive business results, foster brand love, and help ensure our team and communities continue to thrive. With every step of progress, we advance toward those goals clarifying how innovation and our partnerships will continue to drive progress.\n\nWhere is co-creation through Target Forward showing up strongest in driving impact for Target\u2019s business, guests and communities?\n\nWe know, given the size and scope of our Target Forward ambitions and the complexity of business today, accomplishing our goals will take collaboration. That\u2019s why co-creation is the central principle we\u2019ve anchored to Target Forward.\n\nOne of the most visible ways I\u2019ve seen the power of co-creation come to life this past year, is in our work to help our business and communities build resilience in the face of climate change. I\u2019m proud to share that after years of collaboration with suppliers and partners, we reduced our greenhouse gas emissions across our entire supply chain by 8% year-over-year. That comes alongside achieving our goal\u2014three years ahead of schedule\u2014of sourcing 60% of our operations\u2019 electricity from renewable sources. These milestones are helping realize efficiencies across our business, and building a critical foundation toward our goal to be a net-zero enterprise by 2040.\n\nWe also joined with our nonprofit partners to support our communities impacted by climate change\u2014addressing needs immediately following natural disasters and identifying pathways to create greater resiliency in the face of future climate challenges.\n\nSome of our most important partnerships involve the communities surrounding our nearly 2,000 U.S. retail locations. Target team members have embraced these opportunities, donating time, talent and money to local nonprofits. In 2022, team members contributed nearly 900,000 volunteer hours to their neighbors and their communities.\n\nWhat is the role of innovation in helping realize the goals set through Target Forward?\n\nEvery day we have teams working to bring sustainable brands and experiences to our guests at the intersection of joy, ease and affordability.\n\nFor example, we\u2019ve identified Universal Thread and Everspring as our first two owned brands to be designed for circularity. Already well on the way toward fulfilling that goal, Everspring features more than 70 items that include bio-based or recycled materials or natural fibers.\n\nThis work is also evident in the growth of items across our assortment bearing the Target Zero icon. Launched in 2021, Target Zero is indicative of products and packaging designed to reduce waste. We\u2019re also partnering with national brands to enhance Target Clean, offering guests product options in several categories formulated without ingredients they may not want.\n\nWhat more will be needed to advance progress on Target Forward goals?\n\nAlthough we\u2019re still in the early stages of our Target Forward journey, we\u2019ve made incredible strides. We measure our progress by the milestones we\u2019ve reached, but also by how our team and partners have co-created, matching words with actions and putting the size, scale and resources of our business to work toward our Target Forward ambitions.\n\nWe\u2019ll continue to advance progress through the collaboration and innovation that foster mutually beneficial outcomes for Target, the industry and our communities. We know our ambitions cannot be achieved alone. It\u2019s why Target Forward is rooted in trusted partnerships, continuous learning and a pledge to keep evaluating and evolving together, in service of growing the business.\n\nAnd because Target Forward sits at the intersection of our current and future business, we\u2019re positioning ourselves to continue creating strength for Target, our partners and our communities.\nWho We Are\n\nOur purpose\nOur purpose is to help all families discover the joy of everyday life.\n\nOur culture\nOur culture is to care, grow and win together.\n\nA culture of caring means showing up \u2014 for our guests, one another and our communities. Above all else, we believe our business is built on lifting each other up and valuing all of our relationships.\n\nWe invest in our people and value building a team whose voices represent the communities we serve. By encouraging team members to share their unique experiences and perspectives, we build authentic, respectful relationships as we strive to accomplish more and drive the business.\n\nWhen we show up together, our collective power helps us \u2014 and our guests \u2014 discover joy, thrive and grow.\n\nOur values\nOur values define who we are and how we conduct our business. They guide the daily behaviors of our team members and bring our vision and purpose to life. Serving as the foundation for our culture, Target\u2019s values consist of:\n\nInclusivity: We value diverse voices and approaches. We act with authenticity and respect. We create equitable experiences for all.\n\nConnection: We build trusted relationships. We collaborate across business functions. We recognize and celebrate progress.\n\nDrive: We do what is right for Target, our team and guests. We deliver results that matter. We continually learn by valuing progress over perfection.\n\nAbout us\nMinneapolis-based Target Corporation is a general merchandise retailer, serving guests at stores across the United States and at Target.com.\n\nWe operate nearly 2,000 stores in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, and 20 offices around the world.\n\nWe are proud to be one of the largest U.S. retailers, with approximately 440,000 full-time, part-time and seasonal team members, as of January 28, 2023. 75% of the total U.S. population lives within 10 miles of a Target store.\n\nCorporate responsibility has been a priority at Target since our first stores opened. Our philanthropic giving dates back to 1946, when we started donating 5% of our profits to local communities. Over the years, our dedication has only grown. Target Forward, our enterprise-wide sustainability strategy, positions our business for lasting growth and impact.\n\nTarget takes a holistic view of sustainability, with efforts focused on our business driving positive impact for both people and planet while also generating business results. We see sustainability efforts as part of an interconnected system, where our actions help address climate change, restore natural systems and drive opportunity and equity for our teams, communities and partners. These actions impact and reinforce one another to create change that is good for all. Target Forward captures our ambition in this space.\n\nAwards and rankings\nBloomberg 2023\n\u2022 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index Member Company\n\nDisability:IN 2023\n\u2022 100% on Disability Equality Index 2023 Best Places to Work\n\nDiversityInc 2023\n\u2022 Top 50 Companies for Diversity\n\nForbes 2022\n\u2022 No. 51 World\u2019s Best Employers\n\nFortune 2023\n\u2022 No. 21 World\u2019s Most Admired Companies 2023\n\u2022 No. 26 100 Best Companies to Work For 2023\n\u2022 No. 2 Best Large Workplaces in Retail 2023\n\nGreat Place to Work Certified 2023\n\nHuman Rights Campaign 2022\n\u2022 100% on Corporate Equality Index\n\nJUST Capital 2023\n\u2022 No. 4 Industry (Retail)\n\u2022 No. 72 Overall\n\nPEOPLE\u00ae 2023\n\u2022 No. 9 Companies that Care\n\nSeramount 2023\n\u2022 Best Companies for Multicultural Women\n\nFast Facts\n\n$109,120 million total revenue\n\nTarget Circle is one of the nation\u2019s leading loyalty programs with over 100 million members and growing.\n\n50+ owned and exclusive brands\n\nApproximately 440,000 full-time, part-time and seasonal team members\n\nNearly 2,000 stores and 55 supply chain facilities in the U.S.\n\nSince 1946, Target has given 5% of our profit to communities in cash, products and through the Target Foundation, which today equals millions of dollars a week.\n\n1 As of January 28, 2023, we employed approximately 440,000 full-time, part-time and seasonal team members.\n\n2 This covers the fiscal year that ended January 28, 2023.\nTarget Forward: Our Sustainability Strategy\n\nTarget Forward \u2013 our enterprise-wide sustainability strategy \u2013 builds on our durable business model and culture of care that serves our guests, team members, partners and communities well \u2013 and delivers strong results.\n\nAdvancing bold goals and ambitions, providing inspiration and clear direction for our team members and partners \u2014 and investing in these sustainable practices \u2014 fortifies our business and drives growth for the future.\n\nWe continuously evaluate where we can make the greatest difference and, through this work, we developed an approach to managing and measuring our goals.\n\nWe remain committed to investing in new approaches to sustainability that unlock momentum, build capabilities and drive sustainable change within our company, supply chain and communities.\n\nOur goals are ambitious, may evolve over time and are built to be achieved in collaboration with our stakeholders.

Design and elevate sustainable brands\n2. Innovate to eliminate waste\n3. Accelerate opportunity and equity\n\n3 Brands or manufacturers with industry-leading products or services that have context-specific environmental and/or socially beneficial features, backed by credible standards or impact metrics.\nTarget Forward Progress Report\n\nWhile we categorize Target Forward goals by ambition, all of the goals are interconnected and shouldn\u2019t be looked at in isolation.\n\n**Design and elevate sustainable brands**\n\n- **By 2030**, Target aims to be the market leader for creating and curating inclusive, sustainable brands and experiences.\n- Expanded our Target Clean program to include four new categories, providing guests with more product options made without ingredients they may not want.\n- Expanded adaptive assortment with new products across Cat & Jack, A New Day, Pillowfort, Universal Thread, Hyde & EEK! and Goodfellow & Co. product lines.\n- **By 2025**, Target plans for 100% of our owned brands, in addition to our owned brand limited-edition and brand partnerships, to adhere to Target\u2019s already established sustainability standards.\n- Nearly doubled the use of recycled cotton in our owned brand products since 2021.\n- **By 2025**, Target plans for 100% of owned brand suppliers to have policies and programs to advance gender equity.\n- Joined WeConnect International, which supports and certifies women-owned businesses across the globe.\n- Launched our Just and Equitable Supply Chain requirements to further our progress in building a responsible global supply chain.\n\n**Innovate to eliminate waste**\n\n- **By 2040**, Target commits to net zero greenhouse gas emissions across our enterprise (scopes 1, 2 and 3).\n- Achieved our interim milestone to source 60% of electricity from renewable sources for operations three years early.\n- Reduced scope 3 emissions by 8% from FY2021, marking Target\u2019s first-ever decrease in scope 3 emissions year-over-year.\n- **By 2040**, Target plans for 100% of our owned brand products to be designed for a circular future.\n- Identified Universal Thread and Everspring as our first two owned brands that will be designed for circularity.\n- Trained more than 3,000+ team members on our circular design principles since 2018.\n- **By 2025**, Target intends to reduce annual total virgin plastic in our owned brand packaging by 20%.\n- Launched Target Zero, a curated collection with thousands of products and/or packaging designed to be refillable, reusable or compostable, concentrated, made from recycled content or made from materials that reduce the use of virgin plastic.\n- **By 2030**, Target plans to achieve zero waste to landfill in U.S. operations.\n- Received Target\u2019s first official zero waste certified location designation from the TRUE Certification (Zero Waste) for our Hawaii Flow Center.\n\n**Accelerate opportunity and equity**\n\n- Target aims to drive equitable opportunities and outcomes for advancement and engagement by continuing to be a leader in diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging.\n- Announced our updated 2022-2024 DE&I goals.\n- Launched Circle of Champions, an internal advisory council, to focus on inclusion practices.\n- Target aims to create equity through benefit access and affordability to enhance total well-being.\n- Celebrated the first full year of Dream to Be, our tuition-free education assistance benefit for team members.\n- Increased access to benefits by lowering the hours requirements for eligibility and reducing the waiting period for new team members.\n- By 2030, engage and elevate community voices as we seek to build and implement community-driven solutions.\n- Enhanced support for our Target Scholars program with scholarship extensions and new resources including for financial hardships.\n- Target team members have impacted thousands of local communities through listening and showing up in relevant ways, volunteering nearly 900,000 hours and contributing millions of dollars to charitable causes.\n\n---\n\n4 Net zero, as defined, is achieved when a company\u2019s scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions are reduced to a level that is consistent with a 1.5\u00b0C pathway, and any residual emissions are removed from the atmosphere through either nature-based or technological carbon removal solutions (e.g., forestry, regenerative agriculture, carbon capture technology), by no later than 2050, in alignment with the Paris Agreement. Target has committed to net zero greenhouse gas emissions across our enterprise, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement.\n\n5 Designing products in a way that designs out waste and keeps products and materials in use for as long as possible.\n\n6 From a 2020 baseline year.\n\n7 The conservation of all resources by means of responsible production, consumption, reuse and recovery of products, packaging and materials without burning and with no discharges to land, water or air that threaten the environment or human health, as established by the Zero Waste International Alliance. The threshold to be considered \u201cZero Waste\u201d is normally set at a minimum of 90% diversion rate.\nWe center our efforts and reporting on the issues that are most important to the long-term health of our business and stakeholders across our value chain.\n\nEngaging in sustainable practices helps fortify our business as we seek to drive growth for the future.

They make our work possible and even more impactful.\n\nWe value input from our stakeholders on how we operate our business and their unique perspectives on the issues that matter most to them.\n\nHearing a range of perspectives and sharing feedback with leadership and the Board of Directors helps us make informed decisions. Those engagements help Target take actions and achieve results that positively impact the company and our stakeholders.\n\nLearn more about our work with and for stakeholders on our corporate website. More information on our engagement with our shareholders relating to our business, sustainability and governance matters can be found in our 2023 Proxy Statement.\n\nSustainability and Governance Priorities\n\nOur Sustainability and Governance priorities identified and categorized in this assessment are increasingly interconnected and can often impact each other. As such, they should not be viewed in isolation.\n\n- Climate\n  - Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n  - Climate-Related Risks and Opportunities\n- Human Capital Management\n  - Compensation, Benefits and Well-Being\n  - Workplace Health and Safety\n  - Talent and Development\n- Circularity\n  - Product and Packaging Design\n  - Waste Elimination and Reduction\n- Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n  - Board and Workplace Diversity\n- Resource Use\n  - Environmental Impacts of Products\n  - Water Use and Management\n  - Chemicals\n  - Biodiversity\n- Serving and Strengthening Communities\n  - Community Impact\n  - Access to Products and Services\n- Ethical Business\n  - Government Advocacy\n  - Privacy and Cybersecurity\n  - Product Quality and Safety\n- Responsible Supply Chains\n  - Purchasing Practices\n  - Human Rights\n  - Animal Welfare\nGoverning Sustainability Matters\n\nOversight responsibility for sustainability and reporting matters is allocated among the Board and its Committees, and management identifies, assesses and integrates sustainability and governance-related priorities in our business. We have also introduced new governing bodies to help further this work, accelerating progress across Target Forward and strengthening our disclosures.\n\nBoard oversight\nGiven the breadth of sustainability matters for a company of our size and scale, oversight of those issues is allocated throughout the Board and its Committees:\n\nManagement-level leadership\nAt the management level, our sustainability matters are led and coordinated by our Senior Vice President of Corporate Responsibility, who reports to a member of our Leadership Team and regularly engages with the Governance & Sustainability Committee and the full Board.\n\nThe Senior Vice President of Corporate Responsibility is responsible for:\n- Conducting regular priority assessments to determine the topics of most significance to our stakeholders.\n- Collaborating with our Leadership Team to instill Sustainability and Governance priorities into our business operations, including product design and development, sourcing and supply chain operations, human capital management and our new store development.\n- Developing sustainability-related goals and managing our data, measurement and reporting.\n\nWe recognized a need to establish governance bodies to support our Senior Vice President of Corporate Responsibility by continuing to enhance both the execution and refinement of Target Forward and the quality of our disclosure.\n\nTarget Forward governance\nIn 2022, we formalized a governance structure for Target Forward to provide cross-functional management supervision and enable the execution and refinement of this enterprise-wide strategy. This change complemented the Board\u2019s oversight of Target\u2019s sustainability matters, including Target Forward, and introduced two new governing bodies:\n\n- **Target Forward Executive Steering Committee**: Consists of Target senior executives providing corporate supervision and confirming vision, goals and strategy.\n- **Target Forward Leadership Team**: Consists of senior cross-functional leaders to enable the functional execution and prioritization of Target Forward initiatives.\n\nThe Target Forward Program Management Office (PMO) facilitates the governance process for tracking and measuring performance and enables all engagement between the other Target Forward governing bodies.\n\n| Responsible party | Oversight area for sustainability matters |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Board             | \u2022 Sustainability strategy (through oversight of our business strategy and annual strategic priorities)  \n|                   | \u2022 Sustainability risks (through oversight of our business strategy and top enterprise risks)  \n|                   | \u2022 Reputation management  \n|                   | \u2022 Crisis management and response  \n|                   | \u2022 Organizational team health  \n| Audit & Risk      | \u2022 Compliance and ethics  \n| Committee         | \u2022 Supply chain corporate responsibility matters, including vendor human capital and responsible sourcing practices  \n|                   | \u2022 Cybersecurity and information security  \n|                   | \u2022 Privacy  \n|                   | \u2022 Product and food safety  \n| Governance &      | \u2022 Overall approach to significant sustainability and corporate responsibility matters (including strategy, prioritization, monitoring, and external reporting)  \n| Sustainability    | \u2022 Environmental stewardship practices (including climate and energy, waste, natural resources and chemicals)  \n| Committee         | \u2022 Social and political issues and risks not allocated to other Committees  \n|                   | \u2022 Philanthropy and community engagement  \n|                   | \u2022 Policies and practices regarding public policy advocacy and political activities  \n| Compensation &    | \u2022 DE&I  \n| Human Capital     | \u2022 Culture and team member engagement  \n| Management        | \u2022 Pay equity  \n| Committee         | \u2022 Broad-based compensation and benefits  \n|                   | \u2022 Growth and development  \n|                   | \u2022 Purpose and values  \n\nFind out more about our corporate governance practices in our 2023 Proxy Statement.\nClimate\n\n11  Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n\n17  Climate-Related Risks and Opportunities\n\nFrameworks reported on:\n\nGRI  SASB  SDG  TCFD\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions\n\nAligned with our Target Forward commitments, we are focused on cutting our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by driving energy efficiency, adopting renewable energy and eliminating waste. We\u2019re also working with our suppliers to support their decarbonization efforts.\n\nTo make progress toward our net zero goal, we continue to work towards avoiding, reducing and removing emissions. In 2019, we set our Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)-validated goal to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions and scope 3 GHG emissions. Having met our goal to achieve a 30% absolute reduction in operations (scope 1 and 2) by 2030 from a 2017 base year, we increased our ambition to achieve a 30% absolute reduction in operations (scope 1 and 2) by 2030 from a 2017 base year. While Target\u2019s scope 3 emissions have increased by 12% from our 2017 baseline, in 2022, we reported an 8% decrease from 2021, our first year-over-year reduction since setting our goal.\n\nWe signed onto the Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C Campaign and are members of Race to Zero to help drive meaningful change across our sector and value chain, and commit to emissions reductions in line with no more than 1.5-degree warming.\n\nAs we work towards our net zero GHG emissions commitment, Target opened our first net zero energy store in March 2022 in Vista, California. Alongside its new carports, the store includes features like an electric HVAC system and CO2 refrigeration \u2014 a natural refrigerant \u2014 that help reduce the store\u2019s emissions. This store is designed to generate more renewable energy than it uses each year to power its operations and is helping inform future goals and store design.\n\n2022, we reduced GHG emissions from our own operations (scope 1 and 2) by 34.9% from 2017. We are also committed to achieving 30% absolute reduction in supply chain emissions (scope 3) covering retail goods & services by 2030 from a 2017 base year. While Target\u2019s scope 3 emissions have increased by 12% from our 2017 baseline, in 2022, we reported an 8% decrease from 2021, our first year-over-year reduction since setting our goal.\n\nWe are also committed to achieving 30% absolute reduction in supply chain emissions (scope 3) covering retail goods & services by 2030 from a 2017 base year.

These sites create direct emissions through the activities under their control. They also consume electricity, which generates indirect emissions during its production. Together, scope 1 and 2 emissions account for approximately 3% of our emissions footprint. |\n| 2     | Indirect emissions | Our upstream and downstream value chain activities cover manufacturing, product distribution, guests using and disposing of our products, business travel and other indirect sources. These types of indirect emissions account for around 97% of our GHG emissions. Specifically, goods and services that we purchase account for approximately 44% of our scope 3 emissions, and the remaining 56% of scope 3 emissions come from use of sold products, transportation and other activities. |\n| 3     | Indirect emissions (upstream and downstream value chain) | |\n\n8. We are seeking validation of updated goals through SBTi in 2023 to align to the group\u2019s Net-Zero Standard.\n\n9. Net zero, as defined, is achieved when a company\u2019s scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions are reduced to a level that is consistent with a 1.5\u00b0C pathway, and any residual emissions are removed from the atmosphere through either nature-based or technological carbon removal solutions (e.g., forestry, regenerative agriculture, carbon capture technology), by no later than 2050, in alignment with the Paris Agreement.\n\n10.

This includes supporting our suppliers in calculating their carbon footprint and setting science-based emission reduction targets, so that they have the ability to measure and report progress as we work together to transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nMilestone Goal\n\nBy 2023, 80% of Target\u2019s suppliers by spend\\(^{16}\\) will set science-based scope 1 and scope 2 targets.\n\nAs we work towards this goal, we continue to monitor suppliers\u2019 progress across product categories, countries of production and emission impact categories. Suppliers in scope for Target\u2019s supplier engagement program\\(^{16}\\) on climate comprise our top 80% of spend, and account for 81% of our purchased goods and services (PGS) footprint and 35% of our total scope 3 footprint.\n\nIn service of this goal, we request that all of these suppliers complete the CDP Climate Questionnaire, which we use to inform progress on our scope 3 targets and gain greater visibility into our supply chain emissions. For more information, see our 2023 CDP Climate Response.\n\nAs of the end of FY2022,\n\n- 52% of our suppliers by spend (of the 80% of suppliers by spend) equating to 301 suppliers, have set science-based scope 1 and 2 goals. This is an increase from the reported 32% in 2021.\n\n- Our suppliers have reported improvements in their scope 1 and 2 emissions relative to the 2017 baseline, which led to 13.2% reductions.\n\nTarget\u2019s climate supplier engagement program includes education and collaboration. This includes comprehensive training and support aimed at helping suppliers set science-based emissions reduction targets and adopt emissions reduction solutions, including renewable energy. We use the Higg Facility Environmental Module (FEM) and CDP to capture allocated emissions reductions from our suppliers. These reductions were validated internally by Target or reported from datasets verified by a third party. In 2022, 68% of our suppliers reported via CDP Climate Questionnaire and 94% of our Tier 1 factories and 84% of our Tier 2 factories reported to Higg FEM.\n\nKey upstream and downstream interventions\n\n- **Regenerative agriculture:** We have established several regenerative agriculture programs, through our partnerships with The Nature Conservancy and Soil Water Outcomes Fund on initiatives to improve soil health. Learn more.\n\n- **Responsible sourcing:** With multiple partners and stakeholders, Target is working to meet responsible sourcing commitments for palm oil, forest products, cotton, coffee and seafood.\n\n- **Sustainable logistics:** We plan to work with third-party logistics providers to improve the efficiency with which they move our products, and joined the 2040 Ambition.\n\n- **Packaging:** As part of our Target Forward ambition to partner across the value chain to design solutions that eliminate waste, we are committed to eliminating problematic plastic in our packaging, in service of our work to reduce climate impacts across our operations and supply chain.\n\n- **Guest engagement:** Through programs like Target Zero, we are making it easier for our guests to identify and purchase products that have been designed to reduce waste. Target Zero creates a collective impact across our brand partners and product assortments and for our collective stakeholders.\n\nRead more about our investments into supply chain improvements.\n\n---\n\n15 Covering all purchased goods and services.\n\n16 Companies in scope represent Target\u2019s top 80% of suppliers, and include national brands, owned brands, non-retail companies, national brands where Target is the importer of record (NBIOR) and national brands that make our owned brand labels (NB/OB).\n### GHG emissions\n\n#### Metric\n\n| Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions (mtCO\u2082e) | FY2022 | FY2021 | FY2020 | Framework |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|\n| Location-based                      | 2,286,597 | 2,159,457 | 1,883,429 | GRI 305-1 and 305-2, TCFD |\n| Market-based                        | 1,671,180 | 1,746,742 | 2,192,085 | TCFD |\n| Change in scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from 2017 baseline (market-based) | -34.9% | -32.0% | -26.7% | Target goal (2020: -50%) |\n| GHG emissions intensity (scope 1 and 2, market-based) (mtCO\u2082e/sq. ft.) | 0.0056 | 0.0057 | 0.0062 | GRI 305-1, TCFD |\n| Gross quantity of direct (scope 1) GHG emissions (mtCO\u2082e) | 779,858 | 734,799 | 659,877 | GRI 305-1, TCFD |\n| Natural gas                         | 288,886 | 274,862 | 251,325 | SASB FB-FR-110b.1, TCFD |\n| Propane                             | 2,088 | 1,988 | 1,776 | TCFD |\n| Stationary diesel                   | 1,327 | 1,363 | 1,664 | TCFD |\n| Mobile (diesel, gasoline, jet fuel) | 32,360 | 29,699 | 22,554 | TCFD |\n| Refrigerants                        | 455,197 | 426,887 | 422,558 | TCFD |\n| Quantity of biogenic scope 1 CO\u2082 emissions (mtCO\u2082e) | 0 | 0 | 0 | GreenChill Partnership |\n| Corporate emissions rate for EPA-applicable refrigeration systems (greater than 50 lbs) | 13.7% | 12.8% | 13.3% | GreenChill Partnership |\n| Pounds of ODS R-22 refrigerant removed and replaced with lower Global Warming Potential alternatives | 0 | 17,575 | 19,712 | GreenChill Partnership |\n\n#### Gross quantity of indirect (scope 2) GHG emissions (mtCO\u2082e)\n\n| Scope 2 total (location-based) | 1,505,539 | 1,424,658 | 1,492,208 | GRI 305-2, TCFD |\n| Scope 2 total (market-based)   | 891,321 | 1,011,943 | 1,183,652 | TCFD |\n| Electric (location)            | 1,501,345 | 1,420,075 | 1,486,212 | TCFD |\n| Electric (market)              | 887,136 | 1,007,360 | 1,179,557 | TCFD |\n| Steam                            | 3,007 | 2,648 | 2,605 | TCFD |\n| Chilled water                    | 1,179 | 1,935 | 1,380 | TCFD |\n| Percentage of suppliers, by spend, having set science-based reduction targets for scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions | 52% | 32% | 23% | Target goal (2023: 80%) |\n| Change in scope 3 GHG emissions from 2017 baseline | 12% | 15% | 11% | Target goal (2023: -30%) |\n| Change in retail PGS GHG emissions from 2017 baseline | 24% | 11% | 15% | Target goal (2023: -30%) |\n\n#### Quantity of gross other indirect (scope 3) GHG emissions by GHG Protocol category (mtCO\u2082e)\n\n| Category | FY2022 | FY2021 | FY2020 | Framework |\n|----------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|\n| 1 \u2014 PGS  | 29,460,000 | 26,549,000 | 27,272,000 | GRI 305-3, TCFD |\n| 2 \u2014 Capital goods | 1,509,000 | 1,016,000 | 792,000 | TCFD |\n| 3 \u2014 Fuel- and energy-related activities | 466,000 | 476,000 | 383,000 | TCFD |\n| 4 \u2014 Upstream transportation and distribution | 5,758,000 | 8,213,000 | 6,343,000 | TCFD |\n| 5 \u2014 Waste generated in operations | 231,000 | 228,000 | 190,000 | TCFD |\n| 6 \u2014 Business travel | 23,000 | 7,000 | 5,000 | TCFD |\n| 7 \u2014 Employee commuting | 484,000 | 478,000 | 467,000 | TCFD |\n| 9 \u2014 Downstream transportation and distribution | 5,903,000 | 6,126,000 | 5,596,000 | TCFD |\n| 11 \u2014 Use of sold products | 22,176,000 | 24,875,000 | 24,395,000 | TCFD |\n| 12 \u2014 End-of-life treatment of sold products | 1,129,000 | 1,138,000 | 1,096,000 | TCFD |\n\n---\n\n17 Target reports based on operational control method outlined in the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard.\n18 No R-22 equipment was converted in 2022.

Supplier-reported emission reductions, which are part of our net emissions calculations, were not yet reported for 2022 at the time of publication and are not reflected in this figure.\n20 The reduction in total 2022 scope 3 emissions from 2021 is due to a slowing of Target sales growth and improvements in data quality and calculation methodologies.\n21 All 2020 and 2021 scope 3 figures have been restated from what was reported last year. This restatement is due to: an adjustment to estimate full well-to-wheel emissions; estimating the upstream emissions for products Target receives domestically; the inclusion of emissions from the sale of fuel-consuming products and fuels/feedstocks; and an adjustment to food & beverage end-of-life to account for the consumption of the product.\n22 2021 PGS was restated from 30,756,000 mtCO\u2082e to include supplier reported reductions. Supplier-reported emission reductions and greening of the electricity grid accounted for a -13.4% reduction in emissions in 2021 due to an increase in suppliers reporting to CDP Supply Chain and Higg FEM with statistically measurable emissions improvements.\n23 Upstream transportation increased overall due to the inclusion of well-to-tank emissions and a new estimate for upstream emissions for products Target receives domestically. 2022 shows a year over year decrease due to operational efficiencies.\nRenewable Energy\n\nMilestone Goals\n\nBy 2030, Target commits to source 100% of electricity from renewable sources for operations.\n\nBy 2025, Target commits to source 60% of electricity from renewable sources for operations.\n\nBy 2025, Target commits to engage suppliers to prioritize renewable energy and collaborate on solutions that protect, sustain and restore nature.\n\nBy 2025, we plan to have at least 50% of the energy used in strategic and joint business plan partners\u2019 owned operations come from renewables.\n\nOur emissions reduction strategy centers around adopting renewable energy, driving energy efficiency and implementing other sustainable practices. Our Internal Sustainable Building Council, a cross-functional team within Target Properties, coordinates sustainability strategies and helps develop priorities and roadmaps to meet our long-term goals.\n\nWe are currently partnering with our Tier 1 and 2 suppliers to increase the uptake of cost-effective renewable energy and energy efficiency upgrades. By encouraging more of our supply chain to source renewable energy and reduce energy consumption through engagement (webinars and educational resources), we are working to mitigate future risk against price and grid volatility in our suppliers\u2019 countries and adapt to the risks posed by climate change. Learn more about our Standards of Vendor Engagement (SOVE) and Climate-Related Risks and Opportunities.\n\nRenewable Electricity Consumption\n\n| Year   | Percentage |\n|--------|------------|\n| FY2022 | 60%        |\n| FY2021 | 52%        |\n| FY2020 | 38%        |\n\nTarget ranked #1 Corporate On-Site Solar User in the U.S. in SEIA\u2019s 2022 Solar Means Business Report, an acknowledgment of our achievements in sourcing of renewable electricity.\n\nIn service of these goals, we contract off-site renewable energy and rooftop solar projects at our facilities. We exceeded our initial goal to support renewable energy by increasing the number of our buildings with rooftop solar panels to 500 by the end of 2020. By the end of 2022, we had installed solar at 562 sites.\n\nIn 2022, we signed two renewable virtual power purchase agreements, including solar energy projects in California (132 MW) and in Indiana (44 MW). We also committed to purchase renewable electricity from an Alaska Native-owned wind energy project in Southcentral Alaska (5,000 MWh of renewable electricity). In addition, our portion of projects in Arizona, Texas and Florida began producing renewable energy for commercial operations. All of these projects now contribute toward Target\u2019s renewable energy portfolio.\n\nAs we advance our approach, we are focused on engaging our owned brands and national brand suppliers to become more energy efficient, procure renewable energy and develop more energy efficient products.\n\nWe recognize that refrigerants comprise a significant portion of Target\u2019s overall operational emissions footprint through the company\u2019s expanding refrigerated and frozen food offerings. That is why we are working to phase out high global warming potential (GWP) gases for refrigerants, so Target can mitigate our contributions to climate change and address the overall risks of changing climate and emissions regulations.\n\nWe upgrade to HFC-free refrigeration systems whenever technically feasible and have a long-term strategy to have all stores converted to natural refrigerants (100% CO2, a natural refrigerant with ultra-low global warming potential, significantly reduces our stores\u2019 direct emissions impact) by 2040, which would reduce our direct operations\u2019 emissions by an expected 20% from a 2017 baseline.\n\nIn 2022, Target rolled out a strategy to introduce more efficient refrigeration systems that release 99% less carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions than traditional refrigeration systems. This refurbishment will also be paired with innovative and proprietary leak detection technologies to help quickly identify and address leaks in refrigeration systems and mitigate potential emissions.\n\nAs of the end of 2022, Target has 31 stores fully operational with natural refrigerant (HFC-free), working towards a goal to have 100+ stores fully operational with natural refrigerant by the end of 2023. We will continue to refurbish additional stores over the next few years under this remodel program.\n\nTo continue reducing our operational emissions, we are also building a portfolio of highly energy-efficient stores by adopting new technologies and operating procedures. Since 2009, Target has earned ENERGY STAR certification for 1,577 stores and was recognized as an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year in 2023, the eighth straight year we have received this accolade.\n\nIn 2022, the EPA recognized Target for reaching our annual GreenChill refrigerant emissions reduction goal. Store Leadership for our net-zero store in Vista, California and Store Re-Certification Excellence for Target supermarkets that have achieved five consecutive GreenChill Store Certifications. To date, the EPA has certified 95 Target stores to GreenChill standards.\n\nElectric Vehicles\n\nWe are making progress on our electric vehicle (EV) charging program, which began in 2013. By collaborating with organizations such as Tesla, Electrify America, EVgo, and ChargePoint, over 1,600 charging spaces are now available for our guests and team members to use across 186 Target sites as of the end of FY2022.\n\nStores and Refrigeration\n\nWe recognize that refrigerants comprise a significant portion of Target\u2019s overall operational emissions footprint through the company\u2019s expanding refrigerated and frozen food offerings.

The program aims to engage and educate Target\u2019s suppliers on procuring renewable energy, with a particular emphasis on off-site renewable energy power purchase agreements. This program includes educational content, stakeholder meetings and market sourcing activities to support reductions in supply chain emissions via the acceleration of renewable energy adoption. Through SCRI, we are engaging suppliers to prioritize renewable energy, while working toward our goal to have at least 50% of the energy used in strategic and joint business partner-owned operations come from renewables by 2025.\n## Energy Consumption\n\n| Metric                                                                 | FY2022   | FY2021   | FY2020   | Framework          |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|--------------------|\n| Total energy consumption (GJ)                                          | 20,835,316 | 20,153,181 | 19,454,429 | SASB CG-MR-130a.1 (1) |\n| Energy intensity ratio (U.S. electricity) (kWh/sq. ft.)                | 13       | 12       | 12       | GRI 302-3          |\n| Percentage of total energy that is renewable and for which we retire RECs | 29%      | 24%      | 14%      | SASB CG-MR-130a.1 (3) |\n| Total electricity consumption (GJ)                                      | 14,574,997 | 14,121,121 | 13,995,525 | GRI 302-1          |\n| Percentage of total energy consumed that is grid electricity            | 40%      | 47%      | 57%      | SASB CG-MR-130a.1 (2) |\n| Percentage of global electricity consumption that is renewable          | 60%      | 52%      | 38%      | Target goal        |\n| \u2022 Covered by Target RECs                                              | 42%      | 34%      | 21%      | (2025: 60%          |\n| \u2022 Grid-renewable portion                                               | 18%      | 18%      | 17%      | 2030: 100%         |\n\n26 Renewable electricity includes renewable energy credits (RECs) from Target\u2019s onsite and off-site projects, as well as electricity that we receive from renewable energy generation serving the electric grids where Target facilities are located.

We engage with a multi-disciplinary set of upstream, downstream, and supply chain teams in corporate responsibility, legal affairs, properties, supply chain, responsible sourcing and sustainability and others who coordinate our climate change strategy, identify key initiative areas, assess risks and opportunities and implement Target\u2019s response.\n\nTarget works with policymakers at federal, state and local levels to bring awareness and understanding of our Target Forward goals, focusing on how we can work together to achieve our shared objectives and strengthen the communities we mutually serve.\n\nFor more information on Target\u2019s compliance with and monitoring of relevant state and federal regulations, see our 2023 Climate CDP response.\n\nPolicy advocacy on climate\nWe expect the long-term effects of global climate change will be widespread and unpredictable. That understanding informs our comprehensive climate policy and goals, which are designed to keep Target competitive within the retail industry.\n\nAs part of our climate-related risk management process, we track energy and carbon regulations and related legislative proposals, at all levels of government, to identify opportunities for modifying and expanding the energy commitments of Target and our suppliers.\n\nTarget works with policymakers at federal, state and local levels to bring awareness and understanding of our Target Forward goals, focusing on how we can work together to achieve our shared objectives and strengthen the communities we mutually serve.\n\nFor more information on Target\u2019s compliance with and monitoring of relevant state and federal regulations, see our 2023 Climate CDP response.\n\nClimate adaptation\nAs we further build out our net zero goal roadmap, we will also continue to evaluate our climate-related risks and opportunities in line with the recommendations of the TCFD, with an update periodically. Our TCFD analysis was last updated in 2022, and we plan to update it again in 2025.\n\nWe use these findings to inform our risk mitigation approach and make targeted enhancements to our resilience strategy at the individual store/facility level.\n\nFor physical risks, we have response plans to help keep our stores and supply chain facilities open and operational. In addition, we leverage the results of this climate scenario analysis to understand the strategies needed to limit the disruption of our supply chain both internationally and domestically.\n\nWe aim to position Target to adapt to a changing world by acting on opportunities that directly relate to our climate-related risks, which include implementing renewable energy technologies, offering sustainable brands and energy efficient products to meet the growing needs of our guests.\n\nFor more information on Target\u2019s work on climate adaptation, see our 2023 Climate CDP response.\n\nThe impact of unpredictable weather\nThe world\u2019s changing climate, the interconnection between climate and nature and resulting unpredictability of weather has shaped the development of Target\u2019s environmental goals and the actions we take to address them. This includes our response to communities impacted by disasters.\n\nTarget\u2019s corporate command center identifies man-made or natural disaster risks annually in order to identify and develop responses to threats. For example, our analysis shows that our locations in the southeastern portion of the United States, including the states of Florida, Louisiana and Texas, may be impacted by hurricanes and wind gusts. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes and tornadoes can threaten team members\u2019 physical well-being, stores and products, as well as present the risk of damaging infrastructure leading to power outages that spoil food and render Target stores inoperable.\n\nWhen climate-related events occur, Target\u2019s risk monitoring team assesses the situation to strengthen our response and the way we support our team and community. This includes Target support of disaster preparedness, immediate response, long-term recovery and community resilience throughout the year. We partner closely with several national and local nonprofit partners to aid in community resilience efforts following a natural disaster. These organizations deliver immediate basic needs like food, shelter, water and supplies into communities following disasters in addition to helping clean-up debris and damaged homes following storms.\n\nLonger-term recovery efforts are focused on rebuilding, ongoing financial assistance and disaster mitigation efforts to help communities building back better and more sustainably.\n\nFor example, in response to Hurricane Ian, Target committed $5 million to local and national disaster response partners, including the American Red Cross, Team Rubicon, Center for Disaster Philanthropy, Feeding America and a variety of local nonprofits. Target stores across the region also supported local nonprofit organizations in purchasing much-needed supplies to help the community recover. Read more about Target\u2019s response to Hurricane Ian.\n\nTarget also has a robust flood response strategy and spent over $29 million on remediation efforts in 2022, across all our properties. The first step in our response process is to confirm the safety of team members and guests, and close facilities where flooding is likely and/or if safety is compromised.\n\nWe regularly evaluate our responses for process improvements, which we then implement as part of our response to future weather-related events to reduce financial or operational impacts.\n\nFor more information on Target\u2019s disaster response strategy, please see our CDP Climate submission.\nCircularity\n\n19  Product and Packaging Design\n\n21  Waste Elimination and Reduction\n\nFrameworks reported on:\nGRI  SASB  SDG\nProduct and Packaging Design\n\nCircularity \u2014 which involves designing products and packaging in a way that reduces waste and keeps products and materials in use for as long as possible \u2014 is incorporated throughout our business.\n\nOne of many examples is the development and manufacturing of Target owned brand products. In doing so, we are taking steps to eliminate waste, keep products and materials in use longer and decrease our dependency on natural resources, thereby strengthening our business.\n\nSignature Goals\n\nBy 2040, Target plans for 100% of our owned brand products to be designed for a circular future.\n\nBy 2025, Target intends to reduce annual total virgin plastic in our owned brand packaging by 20%.30\n\nMilestone Goals\n\nBy 2025, Target aims to offer two circular owned brands.\n\nBy 2025, Target intends to have 100% of our owned brand plastic packaging be recyclable, compostable or reusable.\n\nTarget intends to incorporate 20% post-consumer recycled content (PCR) in owned brand packaging.\n\nBy 2025, Target intends to take action to eliminate problematic plastics.\n\nFor our environmental impact to be sustainable, it must be centered on circularity \u2014 by designing out waste, using more sustainable and/or durable materials and making reuse and recycling easier.\n\nThis principle guides Target team members, as we consider environmental sustainability when we design products, processes and properties.\n\nPromoting circular design\n\nBy designing our products and packaging to meet our guests\u2019 needs, and aiming to create products that are sustainable, circular and accessible, we are making great strides to realize our Target Forward vision of co-creating a regenerative and equitable future for all.\n\nIn fall 2023, Target plans to expand our partnership with EON, a retail product cloud platform, to create unique Digital IDs for each Universal Thread denim product. Through this partnership, guests will be able to scan a QR code embedded into the product label to learn more about the manufacturing and sustainability elements associated with that product.\n\nIn the future, this technology could facilitate resale and textile recycling by offering detailed product information with the scan of the QR code.\n\nWhile we work towards our circularity ambitions, we are regularly equipping our teams with the latest information and tools around product and packaging design.\n\nIn 2020, Target launched our Circular Design Guide website as an internal training hub. The website provides guidance on our four circular design principles (material choice, durability, repairability and recyclability) and includes internal case studies, resources and examples from other companies in the industry. The site was refreshed with updated information in fall 2022.\n\nThe responsible design team has also developed a training series for design teams that addresses our public-facing commitments, with details on how to meet them and track progress. These self-directed trainings are available for all Target team members and new hires. We will continue to learn from these endeavors and incorporate insights into brands within our Apparel and Accessories and Beauty and Essentials businesses and across our other merchandise pyramids.\n\nAlternative materials and recyclable plastic packaging\n\nPlastics remain a priority as part of our commitment to circularity, and our goals focus on reducing and eliminating virgin plastic material use.\n\nReducing our plastics use will require industry-wide collaboration to create change at scale. Materials innovation to reduce plastic waste, improvements to recycling infrastructure and access, and availability of affordable recycled content will all be instrumental in meeting our goals.\n\nWe continue to work toward our goal of reducing total volume of virgin plastic packaging by 20% in Food and Beverage and Essentials and Beauty businesses, measured against our total plastic packaging baseline in these categories in 2020. We work with our vendor partners to gather more complete data each year; our volume numbers also reflect sales growth in these businesses between 2020 and 2022. Our 2022 virgin plastic...\npackaging volume in 2022 for these businesses was 41,900 MT, an 8% increase against a revised 2020 baseline of 38,800 MT.\n\nOne of the ways we are working to make progress against our plastic packaging goals is by exploring reuse and refill alternatives. This includes our commitment to explore at least five reuse programs to reduce or eliminate single-use plastics by 2025. In 2022, we launched two of these pilots, including concentrated cleaning products from our owned brand Everspring and a pilot in partnership with Beyond the Bag which invites guests in New Jersey to check out reusable bags from our stores and return them for fresh ones during their next visit. We also aim to increase the use of post-consumer recycled content (PCR) in our owned brand packaging to 20% by 2025, and, in 2022, increased our use of PCR to 15%, up from 6% in 2021.\n\nIn assessing and redesigning owned brand product packaging for circularity, our engineering team considers and prioritizes the following:\n\n- Designing for recycling.\n- Designing for refill and reuse.\n- Eliminating problematic and unnecessary plastics.\n- Increasing post-consumer recycled material (PCR).\n- Reducing and eliminating packaging.\n\n**Partnerships and collaborations**\n\nTarget is involved in several groups that foster pre-competitive circularity programs and provide access to reports, insights and accelerator programs for innovators and start-ups, including: Fashion for Good, Global Fashion Agenda and Ellen MacArthur Foundation.\n\nTarget is participating in two Fashion for Good (FFG) projects that aim to reduce the impact of the fashion industry. Sorting For Circular USA is a study led by FFG focused on identifying the feedstock potential and infrastructure requirements for textile waste circularity. Dyestuff Library is a consortium project that aims to develop a tool to identify and select sustainable dyestuff innovations based on specified performance and impact metrics and fabric constructions.\n\nWe are investing in Accelerating Circularity U.S. trials, which aim to incorporate post-consumer recycled textiles into new garments. By investing in Accelerating Circularity, we have been able to gain insights into the current gaps in the collection, sortation and preprocessing of textile waste and the innovation needed to spin recycled fibers into yarn. In 2023, we will be placing orders for bulk production aligned to the Accelerating Circularity U.S. trials, with an intention to launch in 2024.\n\nOn an annual basis, Target responds to questionnaires from CDP including CDP\u2019s Water Security questionnaire, which was recently updated to add questions about plastic packaging. We also submit the same plastic packaging data to the US. Plastics Pact as part of our membership in that organization.\n\nTarget is also a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials to increase our access to educational information on biomaterials.\n\n**Guest and supplier engagement**\n\nTarget has established several programs to help guests identify the availability of sustainable products within our assortment.\n\nIn March 2022, we launched Target Zero, a curated collection of products aiming to replace single-use packaging. Products and packaging marked with the Target Zero visual icon are designed to be refillable, reusable or compostable; concentrated; made from recycled content; or made from materials that reduce the use of virgin plastic. The collection includes over a thousand products from brands such as Burt\u2019s Bees, PLUS, Saltair, Pacifica, Grove Co., Target\u2019s owned brand Everspring and more.\n\nIn January 2023, Target partnered with Lego to launch an experience on Target.com that helps guests learn and participate in Lego\u2019s Replay program. Guests may use Lego Replay to return Lego bricks they are no longer using, and those items are then cleaned and donated to charitable organizations.\n\nTarget continues to drive innovative alternative solutions for the single-use retail bag as a founding member of the Consortium to Reinvent the Retail Bag managed by Closed Loop Partners. In 2022, the Consortium synthesized best practices from its Beyond the Bag Initiative to reduce single-use bags and offer guests a reusable solution when they forget their own bag. These collaborative efforts culminated in the Consortium releasing a playbook of bag reduction solutions and announcing two pilots launching in 2023 alongside other Consortium retailers.\n\nTo make recycling options clear for our guests, we continue to use the How2Recycle label on our owned brand packaging.\n\nIn December 2022, Target launched Target Certified Refurbished, a program that refurbishes items from Target\u2019s salvage stream and brings them back into Target inventory online. Target Certified Refurbished offers guests a like-new experience with a brand name product that has gone through an extensive QA/QC process; and a minimum 6-month return policy. Target Certified Refurbished is in four initial product categories and will continue to expand.\n\n### Circular economy\n\n| Metric | FY2022 | FY2021 | FY2020 | Framework |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|\n| Cumulative number of team members we trained on circular design since 2018 | 3,399 | 3,106 | 2,422 | GRI 301-2 |\n| Recycled polyester used to manufacture primary products (metric tonnes) | 58,423 | 63,600 | 38,700 | GRI 301-2 |\n| Apparel and Accessories | 44,396 | 41,700 | 23,100 | GRI 301-2 |\n| Home and Hardlines | 14,027 | 21,900 | 15,600 | GRI 301-2 |\n| Annual amount of waste recycled from car seat recycling program (million pounds) | 7.3 | 7.7 | 3.3 | GRI 301-3 |\n\n31 Previously reported numbers included significant extrapolation to fill in data gaps. Through investments in gathering data directly from our vendors, and across more categories, we are able to report more comprehensively and with much less data extrapolation.\n\n32 Target\u2019s salvage stream is made up of guest returns, defectives and marked-out-of-stock product. Specifically, in reference to the Target Certified Refurbished program, the salvage stream is made up of guest returns.\n\n33 The reduction in FY22 is attributed to a drop in sales and orders of related inventory. The reduction of recycled polyester was not replaced by virgin polyester.\nWaste Elimination and Reduction\n\nTarget seeks to provide product options that both reduce waste and are affordable, and we recognize the need to address both rising costs and environmental impacts of waste throughout our value chain.\n\nWaste elimination and reduction strategies\nWe take several steps to maximize diversion of waste from landfill.\n\nTo increase the likelihood of recyclability, we optimize our waste reduction methods at the material level, evaluate them for efficacy and then standardize them for implementation across the broader Target enterprise.\n\nWe prioritize and focus our work on waste elimination and reduction based on weight, and we leverage waste audit insights to identify the most impactful diversion opportunities.\n\nSupplier partnerships\nOur suppliers play an integral role in helping Target achieve our waste reduction, recycling and reuse program goals. This effort begins during the onboarding process of new suppliers and continues throughout our engagement with additional training to confirm Target\u2019s expectations are understood and met.\n\nWe leverage a broad network of suppliers to optimize the reuse, recycling, donation and composting streams to continue to increase diversion capabilities on an annual basis.\n\nThrough innovation and supplier partnerships, including our textile-to-textile recycling pilot project with Circ, we are converting end-of-season, overstock and end-of-life textiles into new raw materials. These materials are subsequently reused to produce Target-branded t-shirts that team members wear during volunteer events. In April 2023, Circ delivered over three thousand t-shirts that were 100% sourced from reclaimed mixed materials, representing one of the largest commercial collections of its kind.\n\nTakeback programs to support recycling and reuse\nFor years, Target has implemented several procedures and processes to simplify the takeback (product return) process, while also making it more convenient for guests to participate in recycling.\n\nSince 2016, we have held car seat trade-in events. Materials collected during these events are reclaimed and used as inputs to create new products and generate circular materials. In addition to its positive environmental impact, the Car Seat Trade-In Program has created jobs, including roles for workers who disassemble the old car seats, and for others who are employed by metal vendors as part of the manufacturing process. Read more about our Car Seat Trade-In Program.\n\nFirst official Zero Waste certified Target location\nTarget received the TRUE Certification (Zero Waste) for our Hawaii Flow Center in Mililani, Hawaii. This is Target\u2019s first building to be certified under the TRUE Zero Waste certification program, which is dedicated to measuring, improving and recognizing zero waste performance.\n\nTo receive this certification, building management worked closely with Target headquarters to create and implement custom programs \u2014 such as animal feed and composting programs \u2014 train team members, consistently monitor program execution, conduct waste stream audits and track applicable recycling and reuse program volume.\n\nAs established by the Zero Waste International Alliance, zero waste involves the conservation of all resources by means of responsible production, consumption, reuse and recovery of products, packaging and materials without burning and with no discharges to land, water or air that threaten the environment or human health, as established by the Zero Waste International Alliance. The threshold to be considered \u201cZero Waste\u201d is normally set at a minimum of 90% diversion rate.\n\nAs a step in achieving our overarching Zero Waste goal, Target is working to have 50% of owned brand apparel, footwear, home and hardlines suppliers by spend achieve zero manufacturing waste to landfill (ZMWL) by 2025.\n\nOperational waste diverted from landfill\n\n| Year   | Percentage |\n|--------|------------|\n| FY2022 | 83%        |\n| FY2021 | 80%        |\n| FY2020 | 80%        |\n\n34 The conservation of all resources by means of responsible production, consumption, reuse and recovery of products, packaging and materials without burning and with no discharges to land, water or air that threaten the environment or human health, as established by the Zero Waste International Alliance. The threshold to be considered \u201cZero Waste\u201d is normally set at a minimum of 90% diversion rate.\nEliminating food waste\nTo further contribute to our Zero Waste goal, Target plans to reduce operational food waste by 50% by 2025 from a 2017 baseline year. This is an important component of our program, as confirmed in our 2022 waste audits, which revealed that food presents the largest opportunity for waste diversion throughout our supply chain.\n\nOur efforts to achieve this goal take many forms, including:\n\n- **Improved food forecasting:** We have improved our forecasting and replenishment strategy, and enhanced reporting and processes, so that we don\u2019t hold more food than we think we will sell.\n\n- **Recycling and composting:** Food that is not eligible to be donated can be recycled and composted or sent to anaerobic digestion. Organics recycling or composting programs are currently available at 1,513 of our facilities (across stores, headquarters and supply chain facilities). In 2022, we launched an additional 809 stores on an organic recycling program with our partner Divert Inc. Divert Inc. has also supported our efforts by analyzing our waste stream and helping us innovate to reduce wasted food. Target is continuing to expand our composting program to additional stores to further divert food waste from landfill.\n\n- **Establishing a food waste footprint:** With the support of our partner Anthesis, we have established our food waste footprint and baseline year (2017), utilizing the World Resources Institute (WRI) Food Loss & Waste Protocol. We can now start to measure, track and address our food waste categories that are most waste intensive.\n\n- **Food donation programs:** Stores and supply chain facilities may donate surplus food that is eligible and safe-for-consumption to their local Feeding America member food bank. In 2022, we donated 124.5 million pounds of food, which is equivalent to 87.7 million meals. Additionally, in 2022, Target made a key policy change that provides flexibility in verifying that donation eligible food items are no longer destroyed.\n\n**Responsible disposal of waste**\nInternally, in-store marketing is collaborating with waste minimization, store operations, store design and Target creative teams to develop a system of recycling symbols to be applied to signage and hardware to allow store teams to correctly direct materials for recapture at end of life. Target requires store team members to use Workbench, Target\u2019s internal communication and training site for store team members, to clarify recycling, reuse or donation processes. This reduces landfill and contamination of recycling.\n\nAdditionally, Target requires multiple outside, third-party certifications that provide assurances in regard to material handling, eliminating export of electronic waste and the security of data.\n\nWe manage all potentially hazardous and non-hazardous items throughout the entire chain through Target\u2019s Environmentally Sensitive Item Management (ESIM) program. ESIM is important for keeping our team, guests and communities safe. The ESIM program is designed to meet Federal and State Hazardous Waste regulations and other environmentally sensitive materials requirements. We are making continued investments in waste audits to provide insights into where to prioritize future efforts.\n### Responsible disposal of waste\n\n| Metric

We recognize the need for a full view of how our owned brand products may create strain or benefits for the planet and people, and thus we are evaluating and developing better impact metrics across the product lifecycle.\n\nWe are in the process of defining and focusing our efforts to procure leading raw materials that are recycled, regenerative or sustainably sourced. Before setting our baseline, we are first exploring stakeholder partnerships to help define these leading materials and our goals surrounding them. We expect to report more on our progress towards this goal in future reports.\n\nTarget encourages environmental awareness by providing training and resources for our team members. We have internal processes in place and utilize various applications to track and comply with environmental obligations. We monitor and verify our environmental performance by conducting internal audits and engaging with internal and external stakeholders to assess compliance with environmental regulations that impact the business.\n\nWe continue to train team members across design and sourcing to make them aware of our policies and commitments, equip them to work with our suppliers on bringing them to life by asking all the right questions, and create long-term success in choosing sustainably sourced materials.\n\nTo mitigate the environmental and social impacts of our raw material sourcing with any one country or region, we also work to establish geographical diversification and resiliency of our sourcing regions.\n\nAudits and verifications\n\nOur Responsible Sourcing and Sustainability audit program monitors the locations that produce our owned and exclusive brands, as well as those that produce national brand products for which Target is the importer of record. Environmental management indicators include possession of the appropriate permits and following the proper waste management methods, safe chemical usage and responsible wastewater stewardship practices in line with our Standards of Vendor Engagement (SOVE).\n\nAll factories in scope of the Higg Facilities Environmental Module (FEM) must complete the self-assessment on an annual basis. This includes all Tier 1 and Tier 2 factories producing Target owned brand products, as well as national brands where Target is the importer of record; however, this does not include factories regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Additional information on Target\u2019s participation in the Sustainable Apparel Coalition and the Higg Index can be found on our Traceability & Transparency page.\n\nIf any issues are found during verification by a third party, we tailor our response to the circumstances. Target believes in supporting vendors\u2019 incremental improvement in responsible sourcing performance, including helping business partners to identify the root causes of violations to reduce the potential for reoccurrence. Additionally, Target supports improvements through a variety of initiatives that build our vendors\u2019 capacity to manage and improve their own responsible sourcing programs.\n\nSignature Goals\n\nBy 2025, Target plans for 100% of our owned brands, in addition to our owned brand limited-edition and brand partnerships, to adhere to Target\u2019s already established sustainability standards.42\n\nBy 2030, Target aims to be the market leader for creating and curating inclusive, sustainable brands and experiences.\n\nMilestone Goal\n\nBy 2030, Target intends for the leading raw materials (e.g., forest products, cotton and more) that go into our owned brand products to be 100% recycled, regenerative or sustainably sourced.\n\n42 Target\u2019s sustainability standards can be found on our website.\n43 We do not currently use certifications on owned brand beef or dairy items.\nEnvironmental responsibility in the supply chain\n\n| Metric                                                                 | FY2022 | FY2021 | FY2020 | Framework |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|\n| Percentage of supplier factories that have completed the Higg FEM self-assessment (or equivalent environmental data assessment) | 99%    | 98%    | 85%    | SASB CG-AA-430a.2 |\n| \u2022 Tier 1 apparel factories                                             |        |        |        |           |\n| \u2022 Tier 2 fabric mills, packaging factories and trim factories          | 84%    | 90%    | 56%    |           |\n| Average number of environmental issues per audit                       |        |        |        |           |\n| \u2022 China                                                                | <1     | <1     | <1     | GRI 308-2 |\n| \u2022 Southeast Asia                                                       | <1     | <1     | <1     |           |\n| \u2022 The Americas                                                         | <1     | <1     | 1      |           |\n| \u2022 India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Egypt and Turkey                        | <1     | <1     | <1     |           |\n| \u2022 Other                                                                | <1     | <1     | <1     |           |\n| Percentage of new suppliers screened using environmental criteria      | 100%   | 100%   | 100%   | GRI 308-1 |\n\nStandards and certifications\n\nWe leverage a variety of certifications for products depending on what is appropriate for the product category and best addresses the specific environmental issues linked to it.\n\nThird-party standards help provide confidence in the practices used in our supply chain and help encourage positive change. For our owned brand products to claim alignment with a standard, our vendors must have the same certification for the raw materials sourced for the product. These certifications guide our sourcing decisions including where we procure our raw materials for our owned brands. Our suppliers utilize certifications including, but not limited to:\n\n- Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)\n- Marine Stewardship Council (MSC)\n- Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC)\n- Best Aquaculture Practices (BAP)\n- Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO)\n- Fair Trade USA\n- Better Cotton Initiative\n- OEKO-TEX\u00ae\nPalm oil\nIn 2023, Target launched a refreshed Palm Oil Sustainability Commitment, which requires owned brand Food and Beverage, Essentials and Beauty, and candles products suppliers to supply palm oil ingredients that comply with one of the following three RSPO trading models: Mass Balance, Segregated or Identity Preserved. The update also includes new social and environmental expectations aligned to the Accountability Framework, an aim to demonstrate that our vendors are not sourcing palm from land connected to deforestation or peatland development by 2025 and an ambition to increase the percentage of palm oil that is Segregated or Identity Preserved.\n\nWe have mapped the palm oil included in these owned brand products to mill, and all suppliers complete a traceability declaration document providing us with these details. We are incorporating palm oil volume and RSPO certification data tracking into Target\u2019s product specification system. Data is still being gathered and we will continue to report on our progress via Target.com.\n\nForestry products\nTarget is committed to sourcing wood-based products from well-managed forests to avoid contributing to deforestation or forest degradation. Target works actively with our vendors, suppliers and other stakeholders to implement our policy by eliminating any unacceptable sources and progressively increasing the amount of responsible wood, paper, paper-based packaging and wood-based fiber we source over time.\n\nOur long-term intention is that all wood, paper, paper-based packaging and wood-based fiber used in products that we purchase and sell is sourced from well-managed forests that have been credibly certified and/or are from post-consumer recycled materials. When certified or recycled materials are not available, Target works with our suppliers to confirm that they meet policy requirements.\n\nFor more information, read our Forest Products Policy and Target\u2019s CDP Forests submission.\n\nCotton\nAs part of our commitment to source cotton more sustainably for owned brand and exclusive national brand products, we nearly doubled the use of recycled cotton in our owned brand products this year, from 767 metric tons in 2021 to 1,131 metric tons in 2022.\n\nOur intention is to achieve full visibility of where the cotton we use is grown, collaborating with farmers, brands, other retailers and organizations that share our commitment. We also intend to track and validate our progress.\n\nTo remain transparent about forest protection measures throughout our supply chain and owned brand product and packaging sourcing activities, we submit annual CDP Climate, Water and Forest Responses.\n\nRead more about our sourcing of natural resources, social standards in our supply chain and our work to limit the use of conflict minerals in our owned brand products.\n\nTarget aims to use Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) physically certified palm oil, palm kernels and derivatives in relevant owned brand product categories and aims to trace palm oil to mill level by the end of 2022.\n\n- We engaged in traceability to mill work with vendors who supplied the largest volumes of palm oil in our products. We are still continuing to gather data on this goal and plan to report on our progress via Target.com throughout the remainder of the year.\n\nTarget is committed to sourcing cotton more sustainably for our owned brand and exclusive national brand products by participating in programs designed to improve cotton growing practices and working conditions.\n\n- While we are making significant progress on our goal, we are facing data measurement limitations and will continue to provide progress updates in the future.\n\nTarget is committed to rolling out implementation of our Forest Products Policy to Threshold and Smith & Hawken brands by the end of 2022.\n\n- The availability and cost of third-party certified materials, especially with solid wood products, presented challenges that prevented us from meeting our 2022 deadline for these goals. The lessons we have learned as a result are informing our strategies going forward. As we move towards 2030, we are re-evaluating our approach to meeting our goals.\n\nTarget is committed to sourcing all owned brand paper-based retail packaging from sustainably managed forests by 2022.\n\n- We have made meaningful progress against this goal, with 90% of owned brand paper-based retail packaging sourced from sustainably managed forests, and we will continue to work to close the gap where possible. There are cases where manufacturers of our owned brand products are located in countries that do not have access to sustainable (FSC- or SFI-certified) fiber. We do not intend on shipping packaging to those countries as that will negatively impact our carbon footprint.\n\n44 We are no longer reporting against RSPO\u2019s \u201cBlock & Claim\u201d trading model since it no longer meets certification requirements for Target\u2019s 2022 commitment. This was done to keep pace with external expectations of Target, setting new SBTi commitments, align with industry peers, support broader Target Forward goals and to stay ahead of regulatory/legal requirements.\n45 Sustainable palm oil from different certified sources is kept separate from ordinary palm oil throughout supply chain.\n46 Sustainable palm oil from a single identifiable certified source is kept separately from ordinary palm oil throughout supply chain.\n47 We have been reporting on progress towards our Forest Policy with a limited set of brands and will continue to do so for this year\u2019s report. Starting in 2024, we plan to extend the reporting to all owned brands.\n48 While Target does not currently have a strict \u201cNo Deforestation\u201d commitment, we will be exploring one in 2023 as part of an expected SBTi FLAG goal.\n49 Target does not currently have timber related traceability systems in place.\n50 Target does not currently have supply chain initiatives to address the impacts of timber and/or paper production.\n51 Target\u2019s Forest Products Policy can be found on our website.\n### Materials\n\n| Metric | FY2022 | FY2021 | FY2020 | Framework |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|\n| **Food and Beverage**<sup>53</sup> | | | | |\n| \u2022 Identity Preserved | 3% | 18% | 1% | |\n| \u2022 Segregated | 15% | 1% | 16% | |\n| \u2022 Mass Balance | 79% | 78% | 79% | |\n| **Essentials and Beauty**<sup>53</sup> | | | | |\n| \u2022 Identity Preserved | 2% | 0% | 0% | |\n| \u2022 Segregated | 5% | 0% | 1% | |\n| \u2022 Mass Balance | 61% | 94% | 87% | |\n| **Candles**<sup>53</sup> | | | | |\n| \u2022 Identity Preserved | 0% | 0% | 0% | |\n| \u2022 Segregated | 0% | 0% | 0% | |\n| \u2022 Mass Balance | 100% | 53% | 70% | |\n| **Wood/Pulp**<sup>54</sup> | | | | |\n| \u2022 Percentage of owned brand paper-based packaging sourced from sustainably managed forests<sup>53</sup> | 90% | 86% | 63% | SASB CG-AA-440a.4 |\n| **Percentage of SKUs**<sup>56</sup> that conform to Target\u2019s forest product policy in: | | | | |\n| \u2022 Spritz | 99% | 99% | 99% | |\n| \u2022 Up&Up, Pillowfort and Cat & Jack | 94% | 92% | 64% | |\n| \u2022 Threshold and Smith & Hawken | 47% | 31% | 24% | |\n| **Percentage of rayon meeting CanopyStyle pledge** | 100% | 100% | 100% | |\n| **Palm oil** | | | | |\n| \u2022 Amount of palm oil sourced (metric tonnes) | 8,005 | 7,542 | 7,095 | SASB CG-HP-430a.1 |\n| \u2022 Percentage of sourced palm oil certified through RSPO supply chains<sup>53</sup> | 4% | 10% | 1% | SASB CG-HP-430a.1 |\n| \u2022 Identity Preserved | 1% | 1% | 7% | SASB CG-HP-430a.2 |\n| \u2022 Segregated | 88% | 72% | 82% | |\n| **Percentage of palm oil volume traced to:** | | | | |\n| \u2022 Importer | 100% | 87% | 81% | |\n| \u2022 Mill | N/A<sup>57</sup> | 75% | N/A<sup>57</sup> | |\n| **Cotton from sustainable cotton standards (metric tonnes)** | | | | |\n| \u2022 Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) | 137,999 | 167,425 | 109,131 | SASB CG-AA-440a.2 |\n| \u2022 Cotton LEADS | 31,715 | 11,125 | 3,805 | |\n| \u2022 Recycled | 1,131 | 767 | N/A | |\n| \u2022 Organic | 1,565 | 3,312 | N/A | |\n| **Coffee** | | | | |\n| \u2022 Percentage of SKUs<sup>56</sup> of Good & Gather coffee in bags and pods certified by Fair Trade USA | 100% | 100% | 100% | SASB CG-AA-440a.4 |\n| **Seafood** | | | | |\n| \u2022 Percentage by weight of seafood meeting our Sustainable Seafood Policy<sup>59</sup> | 100% | 100% | 100% | SASB CG-AA-440a.4 |\n| \u2022 Fresh and frozen | 100% | 100% | 100% | |\n| \u2022 Owned brand shelf stable tuna | 100% | 70% | 31% | |\n\n---\n\n53.

Target works with vendors to trace all seafood items (owned brands and national brands) back to the fishery level, but not all of the way to vessel level in the case of wild-caught species.\nWater Use and Management\n\nOur dependence on freshwater ecosystems is vast and spans across our value chain and the communities in which we operate and live.\n\nIn 2022, several water crises impacted regions where we operate in our value chain around the world. Because water has an undeniable link to climate, some of the water crises have arisen from unexpected weather events where drought and floods have impacted workers, communities and operations.\n\nIn our value chain, our key challenges in combating water crises are aging, underfunded infrastructure; creation and use of water-intensive products; an increase in water requirements and pressures; and a lack of innovation and awareness.\n\nWith the intent to move toward a water secure future, we follow our 2018 established freshwater principles to continue our current work and to inform our future work across our value chain. Our primary guiding principles include improving water quality, optimizing water efficiency and increasing access to clean water.\n\nOur path to restoring natural systems includes replenishing and repairing the watersheds in which we operate, which is why we are leveraging research to better mobilize action in priority watersheds, where water risks and stress are at critical levels.\n\nThrough a partnership with Anthesis, we conducted a high-level water materiality assessment to inform our next steps. In our direct operations, we are prioritizing work that will lessen the strain on water systems in western states and water quality in the Northeast. In our supply chain, we are prioritizing the creation of new work and supporting ongoing work in Food and Beverages, Essentials and Beauty, Home, and Apparel and Accessories. And with our guests and our communities, we are participating in activities, such as those beyond the fence line and through California Water Action Collaborative (CWAC), that promote our desire to have a water secure world.\n\nRead more about our water management approach on our website and in our CDP Water response.\n\nIdentifying and managing water risks\nWe continue to refine processes to identify, prepare for, respond to and recover from water emergencies, such as floods, treatment inundation, boil water emergencies and extreme weather. Meanwhile, we are also growing our risk team's capability to understand how water shapes our operations in the long term.\n\nOur operations\nOur operations, including our stores, supply chain facilities and headquarter offices depend on a steady source of water for operational use.\n\nWe track each location's relative water stress through WRI's Water Risk Aqueduct annually. Through this program, we have learned that the number of locations that fall into this category are on the rise. In 2022, we found that 560 stores, supply chain facilities and headquarter office locations fall under WRI's definition of High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress.\n\nTarget continues to explore and implement opportunities to optimize water efficiency, reduce water scarcity, manage stormwater flows and runoff and maintain stormwater infrastructure, improve monitoring and increase investment in new technology.\n\nWe do this by:\n- Investing in smart irrigation controllers.\n- Implementing water treatment upgrades and replacements.\n- Repairing and replacing assets, including backflow replacements.\n- Replacing boosting pumps and water mains.\n- Making improvements to stormwater infrastructure.\n\nWe respond to stormwater water quality at approximately 800 self-maintained store locations and 40+ distribution locations. We aim to regularly improve our infrastructure and the maintenance practices around it.\n\nSupply chain\nTarget's supply chain constitutes 99.9% of Target's overall water use, primarily for Food and Beverage, Essentials and Home Goods. Our supply chain facilities and production depend on sufficient amounts of good quality freshwater available for use.\n\nWithin our network of supply chains across the globe, we rely on numerous watersheds in order to conduct operations and provide products for our guests. Water is essential throughout our value chain, including in the growth of leading materials such as cotton and timber, and to produce numerous products.\n\nRaw materials\nWe recognize that our agricultural practices must promote responsible water use and stewardship. For instance, we invest in Better Cotton, which trains farmers to use water efficiently, care for soil health and natural habitats, reduce use of the most harmful chemicals and respect workers' rights and well-being. In 2022, an estimated 91 billion liters of water were saved thanks to our participation in Better Cotton.\n\nRead more about our cotton commitment and transition to regenerative agriculture methods, which will help to optimize water efficiency within our supply chain.\n\nFactory-level\nTarget requires all of our Tier 1 factories that produce owned brand products and Tier 2 factories to complete the Higg FEM self-assessment annually. We use the assessment to run annual hotspot analyses to determine which regions and supplier factories need to be prioritized for our water efficiency programs.\n\nWe also have an ongoing partnership with Ali's Clean by Design program that works with home and apparel textile factories to implement better water efficiency techniques. Since 2013, we have used waterless dyeing in a growing number of owned brand fabrics for garment-washed apparel.\n\nWhile we are using water more efficiently, we also take steps to maintain the quality of water used in producing safe products. We have partnered with the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC) to set higher standards for factory wastewater discharge and reduce the presence of harmful chemicals in the manufacturing process for owned brand textiles. To learn more about this work, please visit Chemicals.\n\nProduct-level\nTarget Zero has a \u201cWaterless or Concentrated\u201d category comprised of more than 60 products. By actively supporting the availability of products that are less water-intensive, we are giving guests more options and helping them to make informed product decisions.\n\nIn 2022, Target was an associate member of The Microfibre Consortium, which facilitates...\nthe development of practical solutions for the textile industry to minimize fiber fragmentation and release to the environment from textile manufacturing and throughout the product life cycle. We have also supported OceanWise\u2019s microplastics research by funding projects through the Outdoor Industry Association (OIA).\n\nBeyond the fence line\nWe define \u201cbeyond the fence line\u201d as water-related investments that are outside of our immediate operations, both domestically and abroad, but that are within the realm of our impact and influence.\n\nAs we evaluate and invest in new water-related partnerships, we are relying on our existing partnership with California Water Action Collaborative (CWAC) to help inform our efforts. Read more about our partnership with CWAC.\n\n### Water use\n\n| Metric | FY2022 | FY2021 | FY2020 | Framework |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|\n| Manufacturing | | | | |\n| Percentage of SKUs of garment-washed owned brand apparel utilizing water-saving design principles | 89% | 56% | 52% | SASB CG-AA-430a.1 |\n| \u2022 Denim | 98% | 84% | 95% | |\n| \u2022 Non-denim | 52% | 40% | 53% | |\n| Direct operations | | | | |\n| Total water withdrawn (ML) | 11,229 | 11,399 | 10,571 | GRI 303-3 SASB CG-AA-430a.1(1) |\n| Percentage from municipal water utilities | >99% | >99% | >99% | SASB CG-AA-430a.1(1) |\n| Percentage from water-stressed areas | 37% | 37% | 37% | SASB CG-AA-430a.1(1) |\n| Percentage change in water withdrawal since 2010 | -12.6% | -11% | -17% | |\nChemicals\n\nTarget works to drive transparency, proactive chemical management and innovation across our owned and national brand consumer products and operations. Our approach varies based on the needs of the product category or part of our business.\n\nChemical use, management and innovation\n\nIn 2017, Target launched our comprehensive Chemicals Policy, followed by a Target Priority Chemical List (TPCL) created in 2021. This list is built into business processes to incentivize the design of products that are better for our guests and their families. The full TPCL is posted publicly on our Chemical Policy webpage and Target Clean landing page. We encourage all supply chain partners to pursue paths toward full material disclosure to consumers and support those who are actively going above and beyond the current transparency regulations.\n\nThe policy encompasses owned and national brand products we sell, as well as products used in our operations, such as cleaning supplies in stores. In 2022, we initiated supplemental Chemical Policy training for owned brand team members.\n\nIn 2019, we launched our Target Clean program to increase transparency with our guests around chemical use and management in categories such as Beauty, Cleaning, Personal Care and Baby products. Items with the Target Clean icon are formulated without ingredients guests may not want in the product category. In 2022, we expanded our Target Clean program to include four new categories: Insecticides, Car Seats, Over-The-Counter Medicines and Supplements. This provides our guests with more product options made without certain chemicals.\n\nTarget continues to participate in the Chemical Footprint Project survey annually and is working on our footprint calculation this year.\n\nTarget also offers numerous products within its assortment that carry third-party certification with respect to sustainability. One of many examples is Standard 100 by OEKO-TEX, which verifies that products have been tested for harmful substances against a list of up to 1,000 chemicals.\n\nTextiles\n\nWe have set goals to remove two categories of chemicals from owned brands and national brand exclusive textile products.\n\nIn 2022, we saw increased legislation at the state level around PFAS. Our government affairs team has partnered with these legislative bodies to confirm alignment and to pass on our learnings in removing PFAS.\n\nFor textiles, we restrict chemicals at a product level using a restricted substances list (RSL).\n\nBy 2022, Target plans to remove added perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) from owned brand and national brand exclusive products.\n\n- We continue to make progress on our goal to remove added PFCs from owned brand textiles product. While we did not achieve the goal, we are moving forward with lessons learned to inform our strategy, and we will continue work on this goal in 2023, as part of our broader PFAS goal for 2025. We initially prioritized items that affect vulnerable populations and touch the skin, and we have achieved our goal of removing PFCs from many footwear and soft home products, building off our previous work of removing PFCs in apparel categories.\n\nBy 2022, Target plans to improve textile products by removing added flame retardants that are potential carcinogens or pose harm to guests, workers or communities.\n\n- Target achieved our 2022 goal of removing added flame retardants that are potential carcinogens or pose harm to guests, workers or communities from owned brand products, and we will continue to monitor all new and pending legislation for ongoing compliance. The approach we took to meet this goal and further information on how the flame retardants meet these requirements can be found publicly on our corporate website.\n\nBy 2025, Target intends to remove intentionally added perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) from owned brand products, including but not limited to textiles, formulated products, cosmetics, beauty and cookware items.\n\nBy 2025, Target plans to comply with the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals\u2019 (ZDHC) progressive level wastewater standard, in regards to all owned brand apparel textile factories.\n\n---\n\n61 Given our role as a retailer and that we source all materials used in our owned brand products from third-party suppliers, Target does not manufacture any chemicals.\n\n62 In January 2023, we updated the standards of our Target Clean program to align with our new TPCL.\n\n63 The strongest data we are able to quantify is in Formulated Products, such as in our beauty and cleaning categories, for which we have disclosure of ingredient identities. As of now, we do not have measurement in place for non-formulated products, such as textiles.\n\n64 The ZDHC wastewater standards are in two parts: conventional requirements and ZDHC MRSL. The conventional parameters relate to metrics that tie to basic water quality, such as acidity and the amount of oxygen available in the water (key to support aquatic life). The conventional parameters include three levels: foundational, progressive and aspirational. At least 22% of our facilities meet the foundational requirements and at least 7% meet the progressive standard.\nand the Manufacturing Restricted Substances List (MRSL) from Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC). Target requires owned brand vendors to test for the presence of these chemicals. If these chemicals are identified in the tested samples, Target does not accept the product from vendor.\n\nOur RSL applies to all owned brand products for Target and includes the following product and facility types for products manufactured on or after January 2020:\n\n- Clothing (all garment/textile products, including trims).\n- Non-clothing (furniture, bedding, footwear, umbrellas, etc.), textile only.\n\nOur MRSL applies to owned brand textile supply chains only and doesn\u2019t include trims.\n\n- Categories: Clothing, accessories, footwear, bedding, bath and kitchen textiles.\n- Factory: Dyeing/finishing forward.\n\nIn 2022, we started implementing the ZDHC MRSL for footwear and handbags and are working with our suppliers to meet these requirements.\n\nFollowing ZDHC\u2019s recent update to its MRSL candidate list, we began making progress to eliminate the use of potassium permanganate (PP) from owned brand denim, setting a goal for ourselves to do so by 2025. To date, we have removed the use of PP for all new development of our Universal Thread Brand in 2023 and will continue to make further progress on removing PP across owned brand denim going forward.\n\nAs Target looks to evolve our business model to leverage pre- and post-consumer waste in textile production, we have partnered with suppliers and internal teams to encourage them to use the standards we leveraged for virgin products (MRSL/RSL) elsewhere in order to achieve a more circular supply chain.\n\nFormulated essentials\nFor formulated products, we have made strides in improving Beauty, Baby, Personal Care and Cleaning categories.\n\nAs of January 2023, all formulated products that are part of the Target Clean program have been verified to be free of all chemicals on the TPCL. This means that Target Clean products are formulated without select chemicals of concern in the following chemical groups: phthalates, propyl- & butyl-parabens, formaldehyde donors, musks, nonylphenol ethoxylates, ethanolamines, glycol ethers, siloxanes and perfluorinated substances (PFAS).\n\nAs of year-end 2022, we have more than 4,500 formulated items qualifying for Target Clean.\n\nInnovation in green chemistry\nTarget and the Target Foundation serve nonprofit organizations, educational institutions and public agencies advancing innovation across the chemicals value chain. Target philanthropically supports green chemistry research and implementation in four priority areas: awareness, transparency, chemical assessment and safer alternatives. Since 2017, Target has invested $5 million in green chemistry innovation.\n\nWe also participate in industry-wide collaborations, including the Change Chemistry and its Retail Leadership Council, through which we discuss implementation in an effort to drive transparency around the chemicals used in consumer products.\n\n65 We currently comply with ZDHC MRSL version 2.0.\n\n66 ZDHC released an updated version of its MRSL, Version 3.0, in 2022. MRSL 3.0 included additions to the group\u2019s candidate list and the MRSL itself. The ZDHC candidate list signals to the industry chemistries ZDHC are going to potentially restrict in future versions, i.e., 4.0. ZDHC added potassium permanganate (PP) to the candidate list and expects compliance with MRSL 3.0 for products manufactured after June 1, 2024.\n\n67 Potassium permanganate (PP) is a common bleaching agent typically sprayed on denim during manufacturing. PP spray has been shown to have human health impacts, especially for workers.\nBiodiversity\n\nAs we assess the biodiversity impacts of the raw materials we source for our products, set new biodiversity goals and embark on related initiatives, we are evaluating the effectiveness of our current programs and partnerships.\n\nRaw materials\n\nWe are doing our part to break the cycle at the raw materials level by implementing commodity-based policies that place sustainable practices at the forefront of the way we operate. For more information, see our Responsible Resource Use webpage.\n\nOutside of specific commodities policies and commitments, our soil health and sustainable cotton goals and our blanket pollinator policy also encourage biodiversity-friendly means of operating. Our goal to comply with the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC) progressive level promotes the preservation of our freshwater and oceanic forms of biodiversity. For more information, see Water Use and Management.\n\nRegenerative agriculture\n\nWe recognize the critical interconnections between climate and nature. Target is continuing to invest in regenerative agriculture and explore the best ways to integrate nature-based solutions into our strategy and action matrix.\n\nBecause of the importance of soil carbon, Target is engaged alongside other major companies in the Nebraska Soil Carbon Project, a five-year, $8.5 million initiative to support Nebraska farmers in advancing soil health techniques.\n\nTarget is also collaborating with MBOLD, The Nature Conservancy and Hormel Foods on a $1.7 million project to encourage Minnesota farmers to adopt regenerative farming practices.\n\nBiodiversity impacts don't stop at the raw materials and factory-level. The products that we design, produce and later purchase also have a role to play in protecting biodiversity. That is why we are working with a variety of initiatives and partners to help co-create a circular economy.\n\nOther projects Target is currently supporting:\n\n- Partnering with Hershey\u2019s and United Sugar on a project for sugar beet growers in the Red River Valley, giving them cost share funding to allow farmers to transition to conservation practices such as no till and cover cropping.\n- Midwest Climate-Smart Commodity Program, focused on providing direct financial incentives for farmers across 12 midwestern states to implement climate-smart practices on farms.\n- The U.S. Cotton Trust Protocol\u2019s Climate Smart Commodities Projects, working to build markets for climate-smart cotton and provide technical and financial assistance to over 1,000 U.S. cotton farmers, including underserved cotton producers and advance adoption of climate-smart practices.\n- Transforming the Farmer-to-Consumer Supply Chain with Climate Smart Agriculture Partnerships, working toward creating end-to-end supply chain partnerships to optimize the value of climate-smart commodities, focusing on dairy feedstock, and including a manure management component.\n\nCurrent partnerships\n\n| Partner | Program |\n|---------|---------|\n| Avedi | Funding a program with our apparel supplier to help 500 cotton farmers in India adopt organic and regenerative farming practices over the next five years. |\n| BCI Farmers | Helping train farmers to use water efficiently, reduce their use of harmful chemicals and commit to respecting worker rights and well-being. |\n| Cotton LEADS | Purchasing LEADS-certified products, which address environmental impacts on land and soil, biodiversity and carbon footprint, and accountability throughout the supply chain. |\n| Earthworm Foundation | Partnering on our palm oil sustainability work, including our aspiration of traceability to the mill level in our palm oil supply chain. |\n| Field to Market: The Alliance for Sustainable Agriculture | Supporting continuous improvement in U.S. commodity agriculture as an Associate Member and a partner on a Continuous Improvement Accelerator Project. |\n| FastWise | Partnering to monitor and continually improve the environmental sustainability, traceability and social impacts of farmed and wild-caught seafood. |\n| GreenBlue and its Sustainable Packaging Coalition | Developing a guide to verify responsible sourcing. |\n| The Nature Conservancy | Working as an implementation partner on initiatives to improve soil health and water stewardship. |\n| U.S. Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (USRSB) | Representing the retail sector on the Board of the USRSB and working towards goals, announced in April 2022, to make the U.S. beef industry more sustainable. |\n\nBy 2025, Target plans to reduce operational food waste by 50% across our stores, distribution centers and headquarters, which is in alignment with the Global Biodiversity Framework\u2019s goal to halve food waste by 2030.68\n\nBy 2025, Target intends to leverage soil health practices to improve at least 1 million acres of land.\n\nPartnerships, initiatives and policies\n\nWe actively participate in biodiversity partnerships, initiatives and disclosures, and we continue to build partnerships and collaborate with other organizations.\n\nIn 2022, Target became a member of the Capitals Coalition, through which we are investing in natural capital management. Our Impact Profit & Loss investments are building key partnerships, insights and action items to expand our holistic management of total impact starting with our owned brands.\n\nThe table below shows our current collaborations that are closely related to biodiversity.\nSupporting Our Team Members\n\n35  Human Capital Management\n36  Compensation, Benefits and Well-Being\n39  Workplace Health and Safety\n40  Talent and Development\n41  Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n42  Board and Workplace Diversity\n\nFrameworks reported on:\nGRI  SASB  SDG\nHuman Capital Management\n\nWe are stronger thanks to our team members\u2019 talent, energy, resilience and commitment to delivering on our purpose \u2014 helping all families discover the joy of everyday life.\n\nOur team members are at the center of our culture, strategy and success and help us meet the evolving needs of our guests and business year after year. We invest in our team members by giving them opportunities to grow professionally, take care of themselves, each other and their families. We are committed to fostering an engaged, diverse and purpose-driven culture for our team members \u2014 extending the same joy we aim to provide for our guests.\n\nTarget is also committed to fair labor practices that work for and support all team members. By executing our human capital management strategy, we aim to foster an engaged, diverse, inclusive, safe, purpose-driven culture where team members have equitable opportunities for growth and advancement. Our Board of Directors also plays a role in overseeing human capital management matters.\n\n### Employment and labor practices\n\n| Metric                                                                 | FY2022 | FY2021 | FY2020 | Framework |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|\n| Number of team members (as of fiscal year-end)                         | 440,000 | 450,000 | 409,000 | GRI 102-8 |\n| Percentage of active workforce under collective bargaining agreements | 0%     | 0%     | 0%     | SASB FB-FR-310a.2 |\n| Percentage of total employees who received a regular performance and career development review | 100% | 100% | 100% | GRI 404-3 |\n\nAs of January 28, 2023, we employed approximately 440,000 full-time, part-time and seasonal team members.\nCompensation, Benefits and Well-Being\n\nOur pay and benefits are fair, equitable and competitive. We believe all team members should be paid equitably \u2014 regardless of gender, race, ethnicity or other characteristics.\n\n**Signature Goal**\nTarget aims to create equity through benefit access and affordability to enhance total well-being.\n\n**Milestone Goal**\nTarget aims to empower team members to create the employment experience of their choice through personalized scheduling.\n\n**Compensation**\nTarget has played a leadership role in advancing equitable pay and benefits.\n\nTarget announced in 2017 that we would raise starting wages to $15 per hour, an industry-leading milestone we achieved nearly three years ago. In 2022, we announced a new starting wage range of $15 to $24, depending on the job and the local market, to competitively position Target in every market where we operate.\n\nIn 2022, we again measured whether team members were being paid the same for doing the same or similar work. Our analysis compared those team members who are in the same or similar role, location or are otherwise comparable. While the numbers will fluctuate, those analyses show that, globally, women are paid 98% of the median pay for men. We aim to maintain a small range within ~100%.\n\nTo maintain equity, we train recruiters and leaders and provide tools to reduce the risk of bias influencing decisions about starting salaries and annual pay increases. We also prohibit questions about prior salary in most hiring situations, inform each team member of their pay range and regularly conduct pay audits.\n\n**Employee well-being**\nWe offer all our part-time, full-time and salaried team members competitive benefits packages. Beginning in 2022, Target made benefits more accessible to our team members by lowering the requirements for benefits eligibility. We reduced the minimum average hours requirement from 30 hours to 25 hours per week and reduced the waiting period for new team members to become benefits eligible, which made 20% of team members newly eligible for comprehensive healthcare benefits. Team members also gained faster access to our 401(k) plan.\n\nWe provided additional and extensive resources that make it easier for team members to navigate and understand what\u2019s available to them in support of their physical and mental health, family needs and financial well-being.\n\nOne of our key priorities is to differentiate our offerings with a focus on affordability. In doing so, we will increase support for our team members on their paths to financial stability and success. In addition to maintaining the quality of our healthcare plans, we will use internal and external insights to drive our well-being strategy forward, comprehensively considering mental, physical and financial well-being.\n\nIn addition to competitive benefits packages, our ability to offer a variety of schedules is a key factor in attracting team members. Team members are scheduled within their availability.\n\n---\n\n**Compensation**\n\n| Metric | FY2022 | FY2021 | FY2020 | Framework |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|\n| Starting hourly wage range (USD) | $15.00 - $24.00 | $15.00 | $15.00 | SASB CG-MH-310a.1 |\n| Average hourly wage of store and supply chain facility team members (not including overtime) (USD) | $17.64 | $16.97 | $16.06 |\n| Percentage of store and supply chain facility team members earning locally applicable minimum wage | 0% | 2.2% | 5.6% |\n\n---\n\n**Pay equity (U.S.)**\n\n**Gender pay equity (adjusted)**\n\n100%\n\n**Race/color pay equity (adjusted)**\n\n100%\n\n---\n\n70. This starting hourly wage range applies to U.S. team members only.\n\n71. Percentage represents the number of team members with a base wage rate equal to the local applicable starting wage. Target pays 100% of our store and supply chain team members above locally applicable minimum wage as part of our strategy to competitively position Target in every market where we operate.\nwith no more than five days per week unless they request extra hours or additional shifts, and team members can swap and volunteer to pick up extra shifts at their location as they wish. We offer team members the opportunity to learn and work different jobs, as well as reduced or condensed work weeks to accommodate requests for more flexible working schedules.\n\nFor our retail stores, we do not do on-call scheduling and each shift is a minimum of four hours with team members provided 10 hours between shifts.\n\nPhysical health\nStarting in 2022, most Target medical plans now offer virtual physical therapy at no cost, as well as enhanced fertility benefits, doula reimbursement and acupuncture coverage.\n\nAdditionally, all team members have free access to several other benefits programs, including:\n\n- A virtual healthcare benefit for team members to text with a doctor, allowing them to get the care they need with no cost and no barrier to access. Not only can doctors support physical health questions, they can prescribe medications (in all states allowed) and support mental health needs as well.\n- A fitness and well-being platform including 4,000 expert-led, on-demand videos to help team members meet their fitness, nutrition, meditation and financial well-being goals.\n- A drug discount program that can help team members save on generic and brand-name medications at more than 60,000 participating pharmacies nationwide.\n- A clinically proven tobacco cessation program for team members 18 and over that can be tailored for all forms of tobacco use.\n\nMental well-being\nTeam members\u2019 mental well-being is a top priority for Target, and it\u2019s an issue that has taken on even greater importance in recent years. With individuals facing the collective trauma of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic turbulence and societal factors, we have taken additional steps to provide team members \u2014 and members of their households \u2014 access to the care they need.\n\nOur employee assistance program, Team Member Life Resources, provides confidential, 24/7 access to licensed clinicians \u2014 free of charge. We support not only our team members, but their household communities as well \u2014 with access to support, counseling sessions and resources available to anyone in their household. We also offer access to self-paced programs \u2014 at no cost \u2014 to help team members address concerns such as anxiety, sleep and substance misuse. Additionally, we provide free on-site support for team members who live in high-need communities to help them navigate community programs such as housing, food security and transportation.\n\nIn 2022, we provided all Target leaders with on-demand mental health training. Also, we continued to focus on crisis needs by providing on-site mental health and relief support for team members impacted by crisis, such as those affected during Hurricane Ian.\n\nWe want team members to feel confident they can access the care they need by removing cost and access barriers to treatment. A full list of our health promotion services and programs can be viewed on our website.\n\nAlso, team members receive an additional 20% wellness discount on select fitness and wellness products at Target \u2014 such as fruits and vegetables, athletic apparel and tobacco cessation products; all stackable with our regular 10% team member discount, plus Target Circle and Target RedCard offerings.\n\nAll benefits available for full-time employees can be viewed on our Employee Benefits page.\n\nEducation\nTarget offers our team members one of the most comprehensive tuition-free education assistance programs available in the retail industry.\n\nCreated in 2021, Dream to Be enables US-based part-time and full-time team members to pursue undergraduate and associate degrees, certificates and bootcamp programs with tuition-free program options. Our estimated $200 million investment in Dream to Be, over its first four years, is helping team members increase their skills and build their careers.\n\nIn 2022, Dream to Be expanded to include more than 250 business-aligned programs from more than 40 schools, colleges and universities in the tuition-free portion of the benefit. In addition to tuition, Target reimburses for expenses such as course fees and textbooks.\n\n### Benefits\n\n| Metric | FY2022 | FY2021 | FY2020 | Framework |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|\n| Number of team members eligible for a 401(k) | 379,127 | 270,453 | 258,983 | GRI 401-2 |\n| Number of team members participating in our 401(k) plan | 147,413 | 129,458 | 122,903 |\n| Number of team members receiving full employer match in a 401(k) | 131,307 | 117,034 | 103,000 |\n| Average team member percentage contribution to 401(k)s (for those who contribute, not including the 5% company match) | 7% | 7% | 6% |\n| Number of team members enrolled in tuition-free education assistance | 7,065 | 2,611 | N/A |\n| Number of team members receiving tuition reimbursement | 1,599 | 2,142 | 1,783 |\n| Number of people using Team Member Life Resources (TMLR) | 26,057 | 29,833 | N/A |\n| Number of people using TMLR and Onsite Life Resources | N/A | N/A | 111,583 |\n| Number of team members enrolled in Target Credit Union | 24,057 | 20,111 | 20,328 |\n| Amount saved by team members using our wellness discount (USD) | $12.7 million | $11.3 million | $11.5 million |\n\n72 Total number of team members actively enrolled in tuition-free fully-funded and partially-funded capped education assistance programs as of January 28, 2023.\n73 Tuition-free student education assistance program established in 2021.\n74 Due to a change in vendor support, TMLR utilization numbers are calculated differently as of 2021, and include only Employee Assistance Program utilization.\nTo date, more than 25,000 team members nationally have an approved Dream to Be application and those who have enrolled are working to complete a wide range of courses and programs. We\u2019re seeing Dream to Be help team members further their career or pursue new career paths within Target. As one example, a group of non-exempt team members who completed coding and web development programs through Dream to Be earned spots in Emerging Engineers, Target\u2019s year-long training program that provides onboarding and ongoing classroom instruction for newly minted engineers. Upon completion, engineers are equipped with a strong foundation to continue in their full-time engineering roles.\n\nAdditionally, in 2022 Target began to certify certain team member training programs as part of the Credit for Training initiative. This allows team members to earn and apply college credit at select universities simply for completing training at Target.\n\nFinancial security\nWe offer several resources to team members to support their financial security. For example, we offer a pay advance app that allows team members to request their earned but unpaid wages instantly (for a small fee) or the next day (for free), while also providing tools to help with budgeting and savings. We also offer credit union membership, a 401(k) plan with matching contributions of up to 5% of eligible earnings, a 10% discount on merchandise, an additional 20% discount on wellness items (on top of 5% for using a RedCard) and access to the Team Member Giving Fund.\n\nFamily support\nWe offer paid family leave after one year of service to birthing team members, partners/spouses of birthing team members, team members who are adding to their family via adoption, surrogacy or fostering, and team members caring for an immediate family member with a serious health condition. The four weeks of paid time supplements other leave and time off that may be available to our team members through our benefits. Our paid family leave policy provides job-protected leave for eligible part-time, full-time and salaried team members.\n\nTeam members can receive reimbursement up to $10,000 for adoption (per child) or surrogacy fees (per attempt). We also offer a free backup care benefit that includes an industry-leading 20 uses per year for in-center childcare or in-home child or elder care.\n\nListening to our team\nWe conduct annual and periodic pulse surveys, focus groups and value studies to gather team member feedback and insights to gauge if we are meeting the diverse needs of our team members across different career and life stages.\n\nThe ways in which we assess talent during hiring, develop our team members throughout their Target journey and review performance are all rooted in Target\u2019s values. We seek to hire, develop and accelerate talent that champions our values of inclusivity, connection and drive.\n\nOur multi-channel listening program utilizes an annual census survey, an \u201calways on\u201d weekly survey and topical surveys to better understand key priorities. The program also includes an annual experience measurement survey to better understand the team member journey. Our TeamVoice Annual survey measures engagement by looking at our six key drivers: Appreciation, Growth, Inclusion, Empowerment, Ethics and Strategy. We use the results from this survey to understand the perspectives and experiences of our team members and to drive leader decision making at all levels of the organization. These efforts, coupled with our Great Place to Work partnership, help keep our team members at the center of all we do.\n\nLearn more about careers at Target online.\nWorkplace Health and Safety\n\nIn support of our commitment to keeping our team and guests safe, Target prioritizes the prevention of guest and team member incidents, injuries and illnesses, and compliance with all relevant safety and health standards and regulations.\n\nTo meet our commitment, we treat the health and safety of team members, guests, communities and all those we support as paramount.\n\nOur Vice President of Risk Management Finance oversees our health and safety processes and directly reports to the Chief Financial Officer. Target has processes in place that seek to mitigate risk and maintain compliance. Our Audit & Risk Committee meets regularly to discuss environment, health and safety topics. Additionally, our stores and supply chain teams host forums to discuss issues or concerns.\n\nSafety and training\n\nTarget is committed to providing a healthy and safe workplace for all team members, visitors and guests. Team members must act ethically and responsibly to help maintain an environment that is safe to shop and work. Our Safety Policy establishes the requirements for Target team members to execute safety programs designed to eliminate or reduce hazards. This policy applies to Target team members, including employees of Target\u2019s subsidiaries, unless there is a documented exception approved by the enterprise policy team. The Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer is the sponsor of this policy and is responsible for its content. When Target becomes aware of potential policy violations, we conduct a fair, timely, impartial and thorough investigation.\n\nTarget prohibits retaliation against anyone who has in good faith opposed or reported a perceived violation of this policy or cooperated in an investigation or legal proceeding.\n\nTo maintain a safe working environment, we expect our team members, contractors and others under our supervision to follow laws, safety procedures and relevant Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards, as well as advocate for the safety of all team members. Our Safety Policy includes guidance on our safety requirements, as well as our Team Member Illness Policy which sets expectations for handling illness in the workplace as determined by state and local policies.\n\nAdditionally, we provide extensive team member training related to health and safety practices and procedures, and training for leaders who oversee the safety of our team members.\n\nTarget strives to create a work environment that ensures the health and safety of all team members. To support this objective, all team members \u2014 whether in a store, supply chain facility, headquarters location or elsewhere \u2014 must:\n\n- Work in a healthy and safe manner to benefit themselves and others.\n- Comply with all applicable workplace safety laws, regulations, standards and guidelines.\n- Complete and follow all required role-specific training.\n- Seek, understand and follow the health and safety policies and procedures applicable to their specific job responsibilities.\n- Immediately report any injuries to a leader.\n- Immediately report (and where possible, rectify) any observed unsafe condition, behavior or \u201cnear miss.\u201d\n- Immediately report any injuries to a leader.\n\nIn addition, team members who are leaders must:\n\n- Model and advocate for required health and safety behaviors at all times.\n- Allocate the resources necessary to ensure the health and safety of team members and others.\n- Communicate and enforce applicable health and safety-related standards and guidelines to teams they lead.\n- Remove hazards and escalate requests for corrective measures to provide sustainable safety solutions.\n\n- Neither dissuade nor prevent any team member from seeking medical treatment, reporting a safety incident or concern or stop any unsafe action or condition that presents an imminent danger or risk.\n\nTo better protect our team members and partners, we use a prevention framework that includes the following: training and communications, prevention through design, safety culture and routines, monitoring and reporting.\n\nWe have implemented an incident investigation framework that includes:\n\n- Documenting the incident, which initiates the investigation process.\n- Escalating incidents based on their severity, informed by established criteria.\n- Analyzing the incident\u2019s root cause, which involves employee participation, witness statements and assessing workplace conditions and procedures.\n- Developing, actioning and tracking solutions to completion to drive incident reduction. This entails a review and approval process completed by local leadership.\n\nRead more about our Workplace Health and Safety commitment online.\nTalent and Development\n\nWe believe in human potential and aspire to help all of our team members reach theirs. We are committed to removing barriers to development at Target because learning is a key driver for team members\u2019 ability to care, grow and win together.\n\nGrowth for all\nHelping team members learn and develop their careers is a critical component of Target\u2019s business. We strive to provide equitable opportunities for all, inspired by our culture of care and embrace of diverse voices and approaches. A career journey at Target is about working somewhere you love\u2014and somewhere you\u2019ll grow and shine. Advancing career development among team members serves as a vehicle for navigating business transformation, building critical team member and leader skills, enabling a safe and ethical workplace, and advancing goals and cultural values. Our career development work is centered on three key areas:\n\n- Accelerating the advancement and mobility of our team members in service of helping them achieve their career aspirations and creating economic vitality.\n- Leveraging information to implement or amplify relevant upskilling/reskilling programs and experiences.\n- Understanding the skills of our team and the skills needed to succeed in roles at Target.\n\nTarget continues to explore new ways of delivering best-in-class team member career and development experiences. One example of this is our commitment to onboarding and ensuring all team members are made to feel welcome, supported and prepared when joining Target. Another is our Credit for Training program, an extension of Dream to Be, where we\u2019re certifying existing Target training programs for college credit, allowing team members to apply those credits to the degree of their choosing at participating universities.\n\nWe believe in the power of mentorships, short-term projects and assignments, on-the-job-training, formal learning and leadership programs, on-demand resources, and community and cohort connection to build skills that enable performance and fuel a meaningful career.\n\nLeadership training\nTarget offers a portfolio of business-specific learning programs to enable career mobility within various functions. The programs are designed to prepare team members for their next role by building essential skills, behaviors and mindsets needed for career growth and advancement. As a way to invest in one of Target\u2019s most critical roles, a highly customized immersive experience was piloted with 220 Store Directors this year. This five-month cohort-based program included self-paced activities, tailored check-ins with their leader and peer cohorts and live in person and virtual moments, all of which Store Directors shared deeply impacted their engagement and growth.\n\nCareer development resources\nWe specially curate all of our career development resources to provide helpful information for each stage of the career journey, across each segment of Target\u2019s business. Our learning and development team co-created a development strategy of continuous listening, critical skill building and equitable access to support the development needs and growth of all learners.\n\nLearning and development\n\n| Metric | FY2022 | FY2021 | FY2020 | Framework |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|\n| Percentage of team members receiving training during the fiscal year | 94% | 90% | 98% | GRI 404-2 |\n| Excluding onboarding and compliance | 90% | >90% | 90% | |\n| Including onboarding and compliance | 90% | >90% | 90% | |\n| Select training programs (hours) | | | | GRI 404-2 |\n| Onboarding (Target Welcome) | 4,811,268 | 9,570,598 | 6,789,932 |\n| Inclusion acumen | 393,264 | 253,264 | 67,500 |\n| Leadership development | 93,522 | 56,257 | 27,332 |\n| Annual performance reviews | | | | GRI 404-3 |\n| Percentage of eligible team members receiving reviews | 100% | 100% | 100% |\n| Number of team members receiving reviews | 414,428 | 351,400 | 301,000 |\n\n78 All team members are eligible for performance reviews except those on leave of absence for more than 305 days, those hired in Q4 and interns.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion are part of our core values, shape our culture and drive our business. Across Target, we embrace diversity and strive to give everyone access to the same opportunities.\n\n**DE&I strategy**\nFor 17 years, Target has had an established diversity, equity and inclusion strategy with a long-standing commitment to drive progress for our team and business.\n\nIn 2022, we reaffirmed our commitment to creating even more equity and belonging within our team, community and business. We are accomplishing this by continuing to build a workforce that represents the communities we serve.\n\nWe\u2019ll keep working to ensure every team member has equitable experiences and access to career development. We\u2019ll continue creating an inclusive culture that values differences, ideas and experiences, helping all team members feel a sense of belonging. And we\u2019ll keep driving equitable business decisions that increase relevance with diverse guests and support economic inclusivity.\n\nAcross Target, we embrace diversity and strive to give everyone access to the same opportunities. To guide us in that effort, our DE&I strategy focuses on four key areas:\n1. Creating an inclusive guest experience.\n2. Fostering an inclusive work environment.\n3. Building a diverse workforce.\n4. Driving positive impact on society.\n\nWe established Target\u2019s REACH committee in 2020 to accelerate our diversity, equity and inclusion strategy for Black team members, guests and communities. REACH, which is overseen by six senior leaders across Target, continues to help drive diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives for our teams and business.\n\nDE&I is integrated throughout our business and our work to recruit, hire and advance a team that represents the diverse guests we serve.\n\n**DE&I training**\nTo support our commitments to DE&I, we have integrated content into specific training programs. For example, training programs on performance assessments and recruitment interviewing address important safeguards to foster inclusion and prevent discrimination. We also create stand-alone DE&I training for specific topics and audiences.\n\nWhere permitted by law, Target offers unconscious bias training for all team members and a year-long training series for HR business partners that promotes equity. In 2023, Target launched a new enterprise-wide equity training, designed to promote equitable experiences for all team members regardless of their dimensions of difference, building on past successes with DE&I-focused training.\n\nOur learning and development partners work closely with DE&I to co-create a development strategy of continuous listening, critical skill building and equitable access to support the development needs and growth of all learner groups.\n\n**Signature Goal**\nTarget aims to drive equitable opportunities and outcomes for advancement and engagement by continuing to be a leader in diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging.\nBoard and Workplace Diversity\n\nAs one of the nation's largest retailers, we embrace diversity and strive to give everyone access to equitable opportunities \u2014 in our workplace, throughout our supply chain and in our communities. Inclusivity is a core value at Target.\n\nWe believe that building a workforce of people who represent all backgrounds and demographics, interests and experiences gives us the power to better serve the needs of our equally diverse guest base.\n\nWhile we have advanced progress in many areas, continued progress is needed with the people of color turnover gap. We already have plans in motion to address this issue, leveraging data insights and segment-specific resources.\n\nMore information can be found in our Workforce Diversity Report, which provides racial and gender data across all levels of our enterprise.\n\nTo help our many communities and stakeholders reach their full potential, we have relationships with a variety of student and professional organizations including National Black MBA Association (NBMBAA), Management Leaders for Tomorrow (MLT), National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), AnitaB.org's Grace Hopper Celebration conference and many others. In addition, we've created intentional strategies and connection points with historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) along with our many other recruiting pipelines.\n\nBoard composition and diversity\n\nThe composition of our Board represents broad perspectives, experiences and knowledge relevant to our business while maintaining a balanced approach to gender and ethnic diversity. As of the end of FY2022, 38% of our Board members were female and 38% were racially or ethnically diverse.\n\nThe Board believes that its collective backgrounds, skills and experiences makes it well-qualified to exercise oversight responsibilities on behalf of Target's shareholders and other stakeholders. Tables describing key characteristics of Target's business, desired director skills and qualifications, and the self-identified skills and individual diversity attributes for each independent member of our Board nominated for election at our 2023 Annual Meeting can be found on page 22-23 of our 2023 Proxy Statement.\n\nTo find out more about our Board of Directors, including our election and nomination process, evaluations, refreshment, and composition, visit our 2023 Proxy Statement.\n### Diversity, equity and inclusion\n\n| Metric | FY2022 | FY2021 | FY2020 | Framework |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|\n| **Percentage of women in our global workforce** | | | | |\n| Total workforce | 56% | 56% | 58% | SASB CG-MR-330a.1 |\n| U.S. workforce | 56% | 56% | 58% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| Managers | 57% | 57% | 56% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| Non-managers | 55% | 56% | 58% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| Officers | 47% | 44% | 41% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| Leadership team | 41% | 46% | 50% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| Board of Directors | 38% | 38% | 31% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| **Percentage of people of color in our U.S. workforce** | | | | |\n| U.S. workforce | 54% | 53% | 50% | SASB CG-MR-330a.1 |\n| Managers | 45% | 43% | 40% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| Non-managers | 55% | 54% | 51% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| Officers | 33% | 33% | 31% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| Leadership team | 29% | 23% | 25% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| Board of Directors | 38% | 31% | 40% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| **Percentage American Indian/Alaska Native in our U.S. workforce** | | | | |\n| U.S. workforce | <1% | <1% | <1% | SASB CG-MR-330a.1 |\n| Managers | <1% | <1% | <1% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| Non-managers | <1% | <1% | <1% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| Officers | 0% | 0% | 0% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| Leadership team | 0% | 0% | 0% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| Board of Directors | 0% | 0% | 0% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| **Percentage Asian in our U.S. workforce** | | | | |\n| U.S. workforce | 5% | 5% | 5% | SASB CG-MR-330a.1 |\n| Managers | 4% | 4% | 4% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| Non-managers | 5% | 5% | 5% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| Officers | 11% | 10% | 10% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| Leadership team | 12% | 8% | 8% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| Board of Directors | 0% | 0% | 0% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| **Percentage Black/African American in our U.S. workforce** | | | | |\n| U.S. workforce | 16% | 16% | 16% | SASB CG-MR-330a.1 |\n| Managers | 13% | 13% | 12% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| Non-managers | 16% | 16% | 15% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| Officers | 9% | 10% | 9% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| Leadership team | 6% | 8% | 8% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| Board of Directors | 15% | 15% | 23% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| **Percentage Hispanic/Latino in our U.S. workforce** | | | | |\n| U.S. workforce | 29% | 28% | 26% | SASB CG-MR-330a.1 |\n| Managers | 25% | 23% | 21% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| Non-managers | 30% | 28% | 27% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| Officers | 10% | 10% | 10% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| Leadership team | 12% | 8% | 8% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| Board of Directors | 23% | 15% | 23% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| **Percentage Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander in our U.S. workforce** | | | | |\n| U.S. workforce | <1% | <1% | <1% | SASB CG-MR-330a.1 |\n| Managers | <1% | <1% | <1% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| Non-managers | <1% | <1% | <1% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| Officers | <1% | <1% | 0% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| Leadership team | 0% | 0% | 0% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| Board of Directors | 0% | 0% | 0% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| **Percentage two or more races in our U.S. workforce** | | | | |\n| U.S. workforce | 3% | 3% | 3% | SASB CG-MR-330a.1 |\n| Managers | 3% | 3% | 2% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| Non-managers | 3% | 3% | 3% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| Officers | 2% | 2% | 1% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| Leadership team | 0% | 0% | 0% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n| Board of Directors | 0% | 0% | 0% | SASB CG-EC-330a.3 |\n\nThis data is representative of Target\u2019s U.S. workforce as of January 28, 2023.\nServing and Strengthening Communities\n\n45  Community Impact\n\n48  Access to Products and Services\n\nFrameworks reported on:\nGRI  SASB  SDG\nCommunity Impact\n\nThe guests and communities we serve are integral to our success. Target Forward\u2019s vision to co-create an equitable and regenerative future reinforces the importance of our approach to proactive community engagement and collaboration with nonprofit partners.\n\nAcross Target, we continue to work to advance solutions that address community needs and drive meaningful and positive impact for people and planet. Through our corporate philanthropy, volunteerism and the ways we integrate our business assets to meet the needs of our communities, we aim to be present in ways that help all families discover the joy of everyday life.\n\n**Signature Goal**\n\nBy 2030, Target aims to engage and elevate community voices as we seek to build and implement community-driven solutions.\n\n**Milestone Goal**\n\nBy 2025, Target and Target Foundation plan to evolve philanthropic practices and place-based solutions to invite participation from communities.\n\nOur community impact primarily focuses on three areas:\n\n- **Economic opportunity**: Supporting wealth-building opportunities, including entrepreneurship, workforce development and asset-building.\n- **Community development**: Fostering a community-based approach anchored in listening.\n\n**Community impact in action**\n\n**Volunteerism**\n\nVoluntary donations of time, talent and money are longstanding Target traditions dating back to the founding of the Dayton Foundation in 1918. Since then, our team members have had a transformative effect on thousands of our communities and millions of our neighbors. Throughout the U.S., India and in international markets where we maintain sourcing offices, Target team members partner with and support local nonprofit organizations.\n\n**National Day of Service**\n\nEvery January, our team embraces the legacy of the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. by participating in the National Day of Service. In January 2023, Target team members took part in nearly 90 service projects across the United States, totaling over 3,000 hours of volunteering. In addition, thousands participated in virtual volunteer and webinars, giving team members the opportunity to learn more about Dr. King\u2019s life and legacy and how they can support a more equitable future for all.\n\n**Pro bono services**\n\nAs a signatory of the Corporate Pro Bono Challenge (CPBC), our headquarters-based legal team provides hundreds of hours of pro bono legal advice to individuals and organizations, offering guidance on housing law and immigration, helping low-income individuals to start businesses and other matters. In 2022, at least half of our legal professionals participated in pro bono activities. We are pleased to have met and exceeded CPBC\u2019s 50% threshold again in 2022.\n\nIn 2022, we expanded our program offering pro bono consulting services for small businesses.\n\nAdditionally as part of our pro bono consulting program, Target pledges an annual commitment of 10,000 hours of pro bono consulting services for Black- and Indigenous-owned (BIPOC) small businesses. This program offers tools, customized resources and support to small business owners. In 2022, we exceeded our goal, providing 16,000 hours of consulting services. Since the inception of the program, Target has partnered with over 150 clients, engaged over 600 team members and provided over 30,000 hours of consulting services valued at more than $6 million.\n\n**Economic opportunity**\n\nAs partners who continue to listen, learn and enhance each scholar\u2019s experience, in the spring of 2022 we expanded the services available through the Target Scholars Program by funding Emergency Student Aid (ESA) grants. Executed by UNCF, ESA grants are intended to support Target Scholars who are encountering just-in-time financial hardships related to academic retention, health-related issues (physical or mental), food insecurity, housing insecurity, technology, travel/transportation or natural disaster. Each Target Scholar is eligible to receive up to $500 in ESA grant funds.\n\n**Community development**\n\nAs a retailer committed to the development of thriving and vital local communities, Target has partnered with organizations such as the Center for Justice Innovation in New York City. Building on a successful grassroots partnership between our local team members and the Center, we invested in their Community First program. Together we are helping them foster a safer Times Square neighborhood for residents, workers and tourists by addressing upstream solutions to the unhoused population in the community.\n\n**Nearly 900,000 volunteer hours contributed to charitable causes**\nEnvironmental sustainability\n\nIn service of advancing our investments in environmental sustainability, Target has partnered with the Latino Community Foundation (LCF), a California-based nonprofit piloting a model to reimagine a just recovery for communities affected by wildfires and to strengthen frontline grassroots leaders serving at the intersections of climate resiliency, economic justice and racial equity.\n\nHurricane Ian support\n\nNearly half of our monetary disaster response contributions in 2022 went to relief efforts after Hurricane Ian devastated much of South and Central Florida in October 2022. Target committed $5 million to the communities most impacted \u2014 our largest disaster-related contribution ever \u2014 with funding used to support local and national disaster response partners. We have found that having an agile response to natural disasters allows us to tailor our approach and the resources we provide to the specific needs of our stores, our team members and the local communities.\n\nThe storm displaced thousands of residents, including hundreds of Target team members. To provide our team members with the help they needed in the most impacted area, we opened our first-ever Team Member Resource Centers in two local stores. There, more than 700 displaced team members and their families received supplies, access to bathrooms, shower and laundry facilities, charging stations and moral support from their colleagues, many of whom traveled long distances to staff the centers. We also offered on-site counseling and immediate medical assistance to those in need. Team members impacted by the hurricane could also apply for financial assistance through Target\u2019s Team Member Giving Fund.\n\nTarget stores across the region also supported local first responders and nonprofit organizations in donating much-needed supplies. We will take the lessons we have learned through this experience and feedback we have received to apply them as we embark on future disaster relief efforts.\n\nVolunteerism and philanthropy\n\n| Metric | FY2022 | FY2021 | FY2020 | Scope |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|\n| Number of hours volunteered | 894,477 | 870,064 | 496,260 | Target team members during paid and/or unpaid time |\n| Regular volunteer hours | 879,014 | 853,950 | 494,098 |\n| Pro bono hours | 16,463 | 16,114 | 2,162 |\n| Amount donated through Target and Target Foundation (USD): | | | |\n| Cash | $328 million | $274 million | $245 million |\n| In-kind | $236 million | $194 million | $175 million |\n| Amount donated through Target and Target Foundation (USD) to: | | | |\n| Underrepresented communities in the U.S. | $170 million | $144 million | $124 million |\n| Organizations and programs with local community impact | $308 million | $257 million | $231 million |\n| Disaster preparedness and response | $9 million | $8 million | $12 million |\n| Amount of food donated (lbs) | 124.5 million | 106.0 million | 94.5 million |\n| By number of meals | 87.7 million | 88.3 million | 78.7 million |\n| Guest-directed giving through Target Circle | | | |\n| Number of guests engaged | 4.8 million | 5.0 million | 4.8 million |\n| Number of grants distributed | 1,578 | 1,675 | 2,527 |\n| Value of grants distributed (USD) | $6.5 million | $7.0 million | $7.0 million |\n| Team member giving | | | |\n| Percentage of team members participating in the Team Member Giving Campaign | 75% | 92% | 90% |\n| Amount donated by team members through our annual giving campaign (USD) | $8.4 million | $9.1 million | $9.6 million |\n\n80 In 2020, we updated our meals calculation to mirror industry best practice, which we did by removing non-food donations and pet food from the meals calculation. The figures in the metrics reflect these changes.\n\n81 Overall engagement with the Team Member Giving Campaign, including cash donations.\nTarget Foundation\n\nGuided by Target\u2019s commitment to community, the Target Foundation invests in leaders, organizations, coalitions and networks that expand economic opportunity equitably, enabling communities to determine their own futures in Target\u2019s hometown, across the country and around the world.\n\nIn 2022, the Target Foundation made $26 million in grants to 145 partners, with 96% being multi-year or General Operating grants, which allow organizations the flexibility to invest in their infrastructure and other capacity-building needs.\n\nIn 2022, the Foundation partnered with the Center for Effective Philanthropy to conduct its inaugural Grantee Perception Report, which was sent to more than 170 partners to get their feedback on the Target Foundation\u2019s philanthropic practices, processes and approach. Their input is being used to help inform and guide its work along with its engagement with potential and current grantees.\n\nAmount donated through Target and Target Foundation (USD)\n\n| Year | Amount |\n|------|--------|\n| FY2022 | $328 million |\n| FY2021 | $274 million |\n| FY2020 | $245 million |\n\nTarget Foundation in action\n\n**Hometown**\n\nThe Target Foundation made a multi-year commitment to fund the Black Collective Foundation MN, whose mission is to build Black philanthropic power to strengthen the ecosystem of Black-led social, political and economic change in Minnesota and beyond, and it has invested $1 million in Black-led change to over a dozen organizations in Minnesota. As an early funder, the Target Foundation provided seed funding to support operations, and it continues to be committed to the work and infrastructure building of this new organization.\n\n**National**\n\nThe Target Foundation provided funding to the National Association for Latino Community Asset Builders (NALCAB), a national membership organization that represents and serves a geographically and ethnically diverse group of more than 200 Latino-serving nonprofit community development and asset-building institutions across the country. Target Foundation\u2019s multi-year funding will help NALCAB build the capacity of their nonprofit members through grantmaking, technical assistance, training and leadership development programs that ultimately advance economic mobility in low and moderate income communities.\n\n**Global**\n\nIn India, Target Foundation partner Dasra is working to help strengthen networks of grassroots leaders and build capacity for a vibrant civil society. The organization brings together leaders and funders to discuss key challenges and opportunities facing civil society in India and highlights the critical role that Global South leadership plays.\nAccess to Products and Services\n\nTarget\u2019s focus on equity includes enabling access to a wide range of products that meet our guests\u2019 diverse needs.\n\nWe build our brands, products and assortments with our Target Forward vision in mind. This means intentionally creating products, systems and experiences that span economic, social and cultural barriers.\n\nInclusive products and experiences\nIn line with our Design for All approach and our Disability Accommodation Policy, our merchandising team strives to curate a broad assortment of products that reflects the diversity of our guests, including underserved audiences.\n\nWe believe that inclusive products are best understood and co-created with communities, not for communities.\n\nTo aid us in that approach, we work regularly with our Inclusive Design Council, which has provided consultations on more than 1,500 Target products and experiences. Based on their input and recommendations, we make product, packaging and experience adjustments that provide more guests with greater access. In 2022, we created Inclusive Design standards across 17 of our owned-brand departments. These standards and attributes are recommendations that drive how we create various assortments and experiences to overcome economic, social and cultural barriers.\n\nWe continue to enhance access to stylish and affordable sensory-friendly merchandise, and functional adaptive apparel that is designed to make clothes more easily usable by everyone including individuals who have physical disabilities that make it difficult to wear standard, off-the-rack clothing. Target owned brands such as Cat & Jack, A New Day, Pillowfort, Universal Thread, Hyde & EEK! and Goodfellow & Co. released adaptive products and lines in 2022. Specifically, Hyde & EEK! significantly grew its adaptive assortment of Halloween costumes and Cat & Jack launched Cat & Jack Baby Adaptive.\n\nAccepting SNAP online\nSince 2004, Target has accepted SNAP (Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program) payments in our stores nationwide, and now that service has been extended to online shoppers. Guests shopping online can use SNAP as a payment option for SNAP-eligible grocery items via our fast, contactless, same-day services.\n\nIn 2022, after government regulations were amended, we launched our capability to also accept SNAP as an option to pay for SNAP-eligible grocery items on Target.com and extended the service for guests to have mobile payment options used for digital orders on the Target app.\n\nWe began planning our SNAP online rollout by partnering with the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the spring of 2021. Through a test-and-learn approach, we determined the easiest way to shop digitally using SNAP for our full range of products, including food. Our first SNAP online pilot was tested in Minnesota in the summer of 2022, and we\u2019ve subsequently rolled it out to other eligible states in the ensuing months.\n\nAs of October 2022, the digital SNAP payment option is available in all U.S. states except for Alaska, where we are working with the USDA on a pilot which will launch when the state becomes eligible for SNAP online.\n\nSignature Goal\nBy 2030, Target aims to be the market leader for creating and curating inclusive, sustainable brands and experiences.\nOperating Ethically\n\n50 Ethical Business\n52 Government Advocacy\n53 Privacy and Cybersecurity\n55 Product Quality and Safety\n\nFrameworks reported on:\nGRI  SASB  SDG  UNGPRF\nEthical Business\n\nTarget is committed to the highest ethical standards. Our commitment is reflected in the way we conduct business and through the actions we take.\n\nTarget team members are required to follow the law, Target\u2019s Code of Ethics (\u201cthe Code\u201d) and all applicable company policies.\n\nWe exhibit honesty, respect and concern for others through our interactions. Each team member, regardless of location or role, has a responsibility to make ethical business decisions that align to our values. Our values are reflected as we prioritize what\u2019s right for our business, team and guests.\n\nManagement and oversight\n\nThe Senior Vice President of Ethics and Compliance is accountable for Target\u2019s overall ethics program strategy and has direct access to Target\u2019s Leadership Team and Board of Directors. Assigned leaders oversee the management of the program, including its reporting measures and controls. We regularly address key risk factors with respect to compliance and ethics and update the Code as needed. We also have both internal and external audits to monitor our ethical culture and the effectiveness of our programs.\n\nThe Audit & Risk Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for oversight of compliance and ethics programs, monitoring, investigations and remediation efforts, including reports of potential misconduct. The Audit & Risk Committee receives regular updates throughout the year on ethics and compliance priorities, key risks and supporting data, and reports to the Board on its meetings. A management-level governance review committee comprised of Target\u2019s Chief Human Resources Officer and Chief Legal and Risk Officer meets regularly throughout the year and oversees major matters regarding ethics.\n\nCode of Ethics\n\nThe Code helps team members understand expectations and make ethical choices and business decisions that uphold our values and our promises to all stakeholders, including team members, shareholders, guests and the communities we serve.\n\nEach team member has a responsibility to follow the Code. All Target team members receive annual Ethics training and are required to sign off on their responsibility to comply with Target\u2019s Code of Ethics. The Code is published internally and externally and includes the company\u2019s position on a wide range of business topics and expectations. If a Target team member violates the Code, that team member may face disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\n\nTeam members have a responsibility to report any actual or suspected Code violations, to which Target will respond promptly and appropriately. Additionally, the Code outlines each team member\u2019s responsibility to report any potential conflicts of interest immediately as they arise. Select team members must complete Target\u2019s Conflicts of Interest Statement annually.\n\nOur Board members have a separate Code of Ethics, contained within our Corporate Governance Guidelines, which is tailored to the Board\u2019s unique role. New Board members participate in an orientation program that covers various business aspects.\n\nBusiness Partner Code of Conduct\n\nBecause their actions reflect directly on Target, we expect our business partners to share our commitment to the fundamental principles of respect for human rights and environmental stewardship. Our Business Partner Code of Conduct communicates this expectation, and all domestic and international business partners must comply with all expectations outlined within it, including compliance with applicable anti-corruption laws.\n\nBusiness partners must conduct their business with a high level of integrity and maintain transparent and accurate records. Every concern or possible violation related to the Business Partner Code of Conduct that is reported to the Ethics and Compliance office will be investigated thoroughly, promptly and appropriately.\n\nViolations of the Business Partner Code of Conduct could require that Target work with a business partner to help it achieve compliance within an agreed-upon time frame. Other violations may result in suspension or an end to the business relationship with Target. Some violations may involve financial penalties, which are administered as chargebacks. The Business Partner Code of Conduct is published on Target\u2019s public-facing website.\n\nReporting concerns and addressing emerging risks\n\nTarget team members are aware of our expectations for ethical conduct and decision-making, and we regularly provide information on how to report concerns or possible violations.\n\nWe have processes for identifying and addressing reported concerns. Team members may report a concern or potential violation through a variety of open-door channels, such as their leader, human resources, the ethics team or our third-party managed, 24/7 Integrity Hotline which includes anonymous reporting options.\n\nWe evaluate and address all reports received and have escalation procedures for concerns that should be investigated by legal counsel. If an investigation is required, the case is assigned to an investigation team. All Target team members are protected by the company\u2019s non-retaliation policy.\n\nAs part of the ongoing monitoring of our ethical culture, we regularly review the volume of reports received, types of allegations reported and outcomes of investigations conducted. This data is reviewed at a total company level, by business unit and by location. We also look for fluctuations in volume and category themes, as compared to historical internal data and external benchmarks.\n\nEthics and compliance training\n\nEach Target team member is responsible for contributing to Target\u2019s strong and ethical culture. Target team members, including members of management, are assigned various trainings, including training with anti-bribery content.\n\nOn each team member\u2019s first day, Target provides ethics and compliance training covering key topics, such as conflicts of interest, government interactions, anti-competitive behavior, environment, food safety and privacy. These trainings are tailored by role and location, and routinely refreshed. As part of our new hire and annual ethics training, team members are made aware of the Code of Ethics, employee handbook and reporting channels. New officers receive specialized ethics training.\n\nEthics training provides guidance on ethical decision-making, including how to appropriately manage actual or potential conflicts of interest. It also reinforces the responsibility of each team member to ask questions or seek guidance to make business decisions that align with Target values.\nNon-discrimination\nWe respect cultural and individual differences and do not tolerate discrimination, or make decisions regarding employment opportunities based on:\n\n- Race, national origin or ancestry.\n- Color.\n- Sex (including pregnancy, childbirth and lactation status).\n- Gender, gender identity or gender expression.\n- Religion or religious creed.\n- Age.\n- Medical condition or disability.\n- Sexual orientation.\n- Citizenship status.\n- Military or veteran status.\n- Genetic information or characteristics (or those of a family member).\n- Any other basis protected by federal, state or local fair employment practice laws.\n\nOur stance can be viewed in our EEO-1 Report as well as our Equal Employment Opportunity and Harassment-Free Workplace Policy, which details our position on anti-discrimination and a harassment-free workplace and can be found in our Code of Ethics.\n\nAnti-hate, anti-violence and anti-racism\nWe condemn all hate, racism and violence, and offer anti-racism experiences, immersions and trainings for all team members where permitted by law, as well as anti-harassment and safety awareness trainings.\n\nAnti-bribery and corruption\nWe do not tolerate unethical or illegal business practices. Our Anti-Bribery Policy prohibits bribery and provides guidance that all team members must follow to conduct business fairly. Team members are required to monitor third parties working on behalf of Target to check that they do not engage in illegal or improper behavior.\n\nAnti-competitive behavior\nWe believe that by complying with competition and antitrust laws, we support free and fair competition between companies. Our Antitrust Policy requires team members to comply with applicable laws and prohibits them from making agreements that restrain competition. Select team members receive annual training based on their team\u2019s operations or their individual functions.\n\nTransparency and reporting\nReporting is, and always has been, an essential way we inform stakeholders on the status of our journey. We believe Target can only achieve change by carefully managing and measuring our performance against tangible goals and publicly reporting on our progress.\n\nStaying accountable for impacts and actions helps maintain the trust of our suppliers, guests, team members, shareholders, partners and communities. We engage these stakeholders across our commitments and priority areas.\n\nSince the publication of our 2022 Report, we have refined our governance reporting infrastructure by expanding data controls, investing in data management technologies and solidifying cross-functional processes throughout our enterprise. This added rigor is designed to enhance the accuracy, consistency and completeness of our reporting for 2023 and beyond. We will continue to refine this process by maintaining our dedication to continuous learning and navigating the complexities that come with making our reporting capabilities more sophisticated and transparent.\n\nWe\u2019ve been sharing corporate responsibility efforts since Target first published a Community Involvement Report in 1969. Starting in 2010, we began publishing comprehensive corporate responsibility activities and information online. We utilize these frameworks to help hold ourselves accountable for monitoring, measuring and disclosing annual progress, including:\n\n- Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)\n- Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)\n- UN Sustainability Development Goals (UN SDGs)\n- Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\n- UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework (UNGPRF)\nGovernment Advocacy\n\nAs one of the nation's largest employers, we have a responsibility to participate in productive conversations on relevant public policy issues.\n\nOur Board of Directors Governance & Sustainability Committee oversees our policies and practices regarding public policy advocacy and political activities. An overview of the top issues that we explored last year can be found on our website.\n\nOur Political Activities, Lobbying and Government Ethics Policy guides our team members, who must comply with all campaign finance, lobbying and government ethics laws and regulations. In addition to our own policies and disclosure practices, we adhere to applicable laws that govern interactions with government officials.\n\nPromoting civic engagement\n\nDuring the 2022 election cycle, Target executed a robust get-out-the-vote program designed to reduce barriers to voting for its team members and guests. This included providing nonpartisan tools, resources and education to all interested parties with the goal of creating a well-informed electorate.\n\nIn 2020, we established Citizens@Target, a team member network encouraging active participation in democracy. It created a space to learn about and discuss issues and access resources on voting and the civic process. We also offered team members the most up-to-date nonpartisan information on local voting laws and any new or additional requirements so that they can be informed.\n\nTeam members continue to receive paid time off to vote in local, state and federal elections, and/or to serve as election judges and poll workers. They also received discounted rides to their local polling centers on Election Day through our partnership with Lyft (where permitted by law).\n\nWe also teamed up with the nonpartisan League of Women Voters Education Fund to create Vote411.org/Target, a website providing information on how to register, check voter registration status and preview the local ballot. We supported nonpartisan efforts to raise awareness of elections and encourage fair, accessible and safe voting by partnering with a number of national organizations to promote voting, including: National Voter Registration Day, Power the Polls, VoteRiders, Civic Alliance, Time to Vote and the Business for Voting Rights Coalition. Learn more about Target's civic engagement practices.\n\nOur political advocacy\n\nTarget works with elected officials from all political parties to inform them on policies that will affect our business, team members and communities. We may provide financial support to political candidates, political parties or ballot initiatives that are important to our business interests, team members, guests, communities, shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\nOne avenue for doing so is through TargetCitizens PAC, which is funded through voluntary contributions by eligible team members. TargetCitizens PAC contributes in a bipartisan manner to federal candidates and organizations. Political contributions are determined through a balance of Target's business priorities and company values. A complete list can be found on our website.\n\nIn 2022, Target \u2014 together with trade associations and policy-based organizations \u2014 advocated in areas such as taxes, trade, privacy, product safety, sustainability, data security and employment.\n\nOn a quarterly basis, Target publicly reports federal advocacy activities as required by law with the Secretary of the U.S. Senate and the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives. Our recent federal lobbying disclosure reports are available on our website.\n\nA list of trade associations and other policy-based organizations Target supports can be found on our website.\n\nPercentage of workforce eligible to receive paid time off to vote:\n\n100%\nPrivacy and Cybersecurity\n\nSecuring company systems, business information and personal information of our guests, team members and business partners is important to us.\n\nWe have systems in place to:\n- Safely receive, protect and store that information.\n- Collect, use and share that information appropriately.\n- Detect, contain and respond to data security incidents.\n\nWhen handling personal information, we follow all applicable laws, policies and processes that help us collect, use and share the information appropriately while still allowing us to effectively serve our guests and run our business operations.\n\nManagement and oversight\n\nWhile everyone at Target plays a part in information security, cybersecurity and data privacy, oversight responsibility is shared by the Board, its Committees and management as described in the table on the bottom of this page.\n\nTo inform and educate the Board and Audit & Risk Committee in their oversight responsibilities, throughout the year, management provides regular updates on these topics. For example, the Chief Information Security Officer provides information security risk and controls, cyber threats and other program updates, and the Senior Vice President of Compliance and Ethics provides privacy program updates.\n\nInformation security and cybersecurity\n\nTarget\u2019s cybersecurity team is responsible for designing and implementing our information security and cybersecurity program, including governance, policy, risk assessment, monitoring and training. We use a combination of industry-leading tools and in-house technologies to protect Target and our guests, operate a proactive threat intelligence program to identify and assess risk, and run a 24x7 Cyber Fusion Center to investigate and respond to threats.\n\nOur cyber threat intelligence and data privacy teams work to understand evolving threats, such as ransomware, developing issues and industry trends, and our vendor teams monitor and assess risks with our suppliers. Target has an Incident Response Program to address potential security and privacy incidents.\n\nOur program is based on recognized industry security standards and control frameworks like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which we validate through internal and independent assessments. Our cybersecurity team regularly tests our controls through penetration testing, vulnerability scanning and attack simulations. Beyond our in-house capabilities, we engage with leading security and technology vendors to assess our information security and cybersecurity program and test our technical capabilities. This includes annual independent Payment Card Industry (PCI) and Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) compliance audits.\n\nWe also offer ongoing practice and education for team members to recognize and report suspicious activity. Our team members and contractors receive annual information security and cybersecurity training to understand the behaviors and technical requirements necessary to protect company and guest information. During Cybersecurity Awareness Month in October, we run campaigns using engaging resources, including additional phishing simulations, to educate team members on how to secure themselves and the company against cyber risks.\n\nIn 2022, Target also expanded our support to cybersecurity education and awareness programming for consumers by investing in new partnerships with the National Cybersecurity Alliance (NCA) and, in April 2023, with Cybercrime Support Network (CSN).\n\nWe seek to be a leader in cybersecurity and have been recognized for sharing threat intelligence and collaborating with organizations across different industries to share best practices, fight cybercrime, enhance privacy, discuss new technologies, better understand the evolving regulatory environment and advance capabilities in these areas. To date, our cybersecurity team has been granted more than 20 patents, with more pending, and we actively contribute to open-source solutions. We invest in building and developing cybersecurity talent and engineering expertise in-house rather than relying solely on third-party providers. We also offer in-house training and educational courses through our technology team\u2019s 50 Days of Learning commitment and Cyber Plus Institute, which is a security training curriculum leveraging internal subject matter expertise along with curated resources.\n\nOur cybersecurity team members regularly attend and present at cybersecurity conferences, and we partner with organizations to support team members in gaining advanced cybersecurity degrees, industry certifications and other technical trainings. Target leaders serve on several boards, including the boards of the Retail & Hospitality Information Sharing and Analysis Center, the Financial Services Information Sharing Analysis Center, the Aspen Cybersecurity Group and the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council Board of Advisors.\n\nTo complement our DE&I strategy, we partner with organizations \u2014 including the Executive Women\u2019s Forum, Women in Cybersecurity and Cyversity \u2014 to strengthen support networks within the cybersecurity industry for team members and build a more diverse talent pipeline.\n\nGuests can find cybersecurity resources on our security page and Tech Blog.\n\n| Responsible party | Oversight area |\n|-------------------|----------------|\n| Board             | Oversight of these topics within Target\u2019s overall risks. |\n| Audit & Risk Committee | Primary oversight responsibility for information security, cybersecurity and data privacy, including internal controls designed to mitigate risks related to these topics. |\n| Management        | Our Chief Information Officer, Chief Information Security Officer, Chief Legal and Risk Officer, Senior Vice President of Compliance and Ethics and other senior members of our cybersecurity and compliance and ethics teams are responsible for identifying and managing risks related to these topics, and reporting to the Audit & Risk Committee and/or the full Board. |\nData privacy\n\nTarget\u2019s privacy compliance team is responsible for designing and implementing our privacy program, including governance, privacy policy, risk assessment, monitoring and training. The team identifies and manages privacy risks, elevating them to our Senior Vice President of Compliance and Ethics and our Chief Legal and Risk Officer, when appropriate. The team\u2019s work to design privacy controls into operations is supported with continual learning and professional certification opportunities, including Certified Information Privacy Professional designations.\n\nOur retail Privacy Policy provides details of how we collect, use and share guests\u2019 personal information. It also informs guests of their options for limiting marketing or other uses of their data.\n\nIn addition, the policy expressly states that Target does not knowingly collect personal information online from children under age 13. Any changes to Target\u2019s Privacy Policy, practices and procedures are noted and dated in the policy, and in some cases additional notice may be provided.\n\nEveryone at Target who works with personal information must comply with our internal Privacy Compliance Policy. Team members receive annual privacy training to understand the requirements around collecting, using and sharing personal information. Also, select teams receive additional privacy training based on their specific roles. In 2022, we refreshed privacy-related articles and resources, including those for our guest services and HR teams. Plus, a cross-functional set of team members with privacy-related roles attended privacy certification training sessions provided through the International Association of Privacy Professionals.\n\nThird parties that handle personal information must also follow applicable laws, regulations and contractual obligations. Target follows applicable legal requirements and adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) self-regulatory principles for Interest-Based Advertising.\n\nWith respect to data retention policies, we retain personal information in accordance with Target\u2019s record retention requirements and policies, all of which reflect business and legal considerations. In 2022, Target built additional capabilities and extended privacy rights to guests in applicable states to comply with new state laws.\n\nWe measure the effectiveness of our privacy processes and policies through regular reporting and auditing practices. We also conduct external cross-industry benchmarking to understand privacy best practices and industry trends, and actively contribute to the Retail Industry Leaders Association\u2019s Privacy Leaders Council and the National Retail Federation\u2019s Privacy Working Group.\nProduct Quality and Safety\n\nOne of our top priorities is to provide Target guests with high quality products that meet or exceed mandatory safety standards.\n\nWe have tools and processes in place to address product safety and assure quality during production. Overseeing these efforts are our teams in the following areas: product safety and quality assurance (PSQA), essentials safety and quality assurance (ESQA) and food safety, quality and regulatory (FSQR).\n\nGeneral merchandise\n\nTarget participates in the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission retailer reporting program for all products, regardless of brand. We work closely with our vendor partners producing FDA-regulated products to satisfy all reporting obligations. Our vendor partners must also deliver products that meet or exceed Target quality standards and are compliant with all required federal, state and local laws. Target verifies compliance in several ways, including evaluating our vendor partners and their factory capabilities. We also conduct owned brand end-to-end product reviews that may include pre-production evaluations, in-production inspections, third-party testing of products and guest feedback.\n\nAs a leading retailer, Target supports industry-wide product safety training by participating in, and contributing to the International Consumer Product Health and Safety Organization (ICPHSO) mentorship committee. Its goal is to create interest and opportunities for those contemplating a career in product safety and compliance. Many Target leaders and experts are active members of American Apparel & Footwear Association (AAFA), Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA), National Retail Federation (NRF), The Toy Association and other product-specific groups for general merchandise products.\n\nFood\n\nThe Target food safety, quality and regulatory team leverages a scientific, risk-based, preventive approach to assure that owned brand food vendors have appropriate capabilities.\n\nAccordingly, all facilities that produce owned brand foods are accountable to regulatory guidelines and Target food safety and quality standards. Target brand food vendors must comply with federal, state and local requirements. We also require owned brand food vendor partners to be GFSI-certified and provide details on their programs.\n\nOur approach includes routine monitoring of consumer trends, review of regulatory and other external developments and regular engagement with Consumer Brands Association (CBA), Food Industry Association (FMI) and federal, state and local governmental agencies.\n\nWhen guests purchase food from Target, they expect it to be high-quality, as reflected by our owned-brand promises and standards. We require that vendors be accountable for all aspects of food product production and delivery, and that they immediately inform us of any product or production issues. Target validates owned brand quality and compliance in several ways including end-to-end product assessments such as pre-production evaluations, in-production reviews, testing of owned brand products and reviewing guest feedback.\n\nProduct recalls\n\nWhen we learn about a safety concern with one of our products, we investigate and, when necessary, remove it from sale, both in-store and online.\n\nMultiple communication methods are in place to directly contact consumers about a product recall, including phone messaging, email communication and notification via the Target app. Guests can also find up-to-date recall information posted on in-store iPads, Target\u2019s Facebook Recall app page and in the \u201cRecalls\u201d link on Target.com.\n\nRead more about food, safety, quality and compliance on our website.\n\n| Metric | FY2022 | FY2021 | FY2020 |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Number of vendor factories (countries) producing owned brand foods | 1,056 (34) | 980 (29) | 925 (27) |\n| Number of factories (countries) producing owned brand non-food products | 1,909 (40) | 1,704 (30) | 1,601 (37) |\n| Number of factory evaluations by Target | | | |\n| Food | 1,732 | 1,487 | 1,505 |\n| Non-food | 1,437 | 1,480 | 758 |\n| Number of product test reports for owned brand products conducted by independent third-party labs | 26,203 | 31,627 | 29,750 |\n| Number of product inspections of owned brand products conducted by Target team members and independent third parties | 22,908 | 33,527 | 40,093 |\n| Number of vendor self-inspections (VSI) | 73,822 | 70,094 | 48,148 |\nResponsible Supply Chains\n\n57  Purchasing Practices\n63  Human Rights\n66  Animal Welfare\n\nFrameworks reported on:\nGRI  SASB  SDG  UNGPRF\nPurchasing Practices\n\nIn line with the Target Forward vision, we are committed to pursuing fair, responsible and equitable purchasing practices.\n\nThis includes measures to further responsible purchasing, broaden the diversity of our suppliers, elevate worker well-being across our supply chain and implement effective traceability measures. We regularly evaluate the way we do business with our suppliers and collaborate with them on practices and processes that are in alignment with ours.\n\nThrough our partnership with Better Buying, a nonprofit organization focused on improving purchasing practices throughout the global supply chain, we annually assess the impact of our purchasing practices on supplier sustainability through a financial, environmental and social lens. We leverage this assessment to better understand how our day-to-day purchasing practices are affecting our suppliers, their workers and the environment. The survey helps us to incorporate business partner feedback into our work where we have opportunities to improve.\n\nIn 2022, Target continued this quest for continuous improvement on our purchasing practices with a focus on driving improvements in key priority purchasing categories identified by our business partners, such as planning and forecasting, cost negotiation, design and development and win-win sustainable partnership.\n\nAlso in 2022, in partnership with Better Buying, we rolled out a new educational training course to help teams across the enterprise understand what purchasing practices are, why they are essential and how decisions can impact workers and suppliers worldwide. As of the publication of this report, more than 1,500 employees have completed the training, representing more than 50% of the Target population positioned to impact these practices throughout our business.\n\nOur commitment to supplier diversity\n\nWe define \u201cdiverse-owned businesses\u201d according to five dimensions of difference and our commitment to advancing diverse-owned businesses takes several forms, including:\n\n- Providing access to our resources and expertise.\n- Sourcing in part from diverse creators, designers, vendors, agencies, contractors and suppliers.\n- Accelerating their prosperity through mentoring and other programs.\n\nAs part of Target\u2019s overall sourcing process, we identify, assess and include diverse suppliers in long-term opportunities across the enterprise \u2013 for both merchandising and indirect categories:\n\n- **Merchandising:** Our teams assess suppliers based on their retail-readiness and capabilities for impactful partnerships to supply merchandise, in-store or on Target.com.\n- **Indirect:** Our REACH special project team made significant progress in these categories in 2022 by streamlining processes, amplifying resources and increasing discovery opportunities for our business units and sourcing teams, all in service of creating consistency, equity and higher inclusion and conversion of diverse suppliers.\n\nIn 2022, Target Supplier Diversity launched Circle of Champions, an internal advisory council comprised of leaders from various parts of the enterprise. Its goal is to focus on inclusive practices and to increase visibility for diverse-owned business partnerships.\n\nThrough partnerships with certifying and other organizations in the U.S., including Women\u2019s Business Enterprise National Council\u2019s (WBENC) Women-Owned in Retail program, Target creates preparedness opportunities through education, mentorship and connections for diverse-owned companies. By leveraging our Supplier Diversity Mentor Program, Target Accelerators and several external partnerships, we help suppliers strategically scale their businesses and improve their retail readiness.\n\nInternationally, in service of our global DE&I priorities for women, persons with disabilities and other underrepresented groups, Target joined WeConnect International, which certifies and supports women-owned businesses across the globe. Through our involvement with this organization, Target global certified and registered $300 million of direct spend with women-owned businesses in Asia Pacific and India in 2022.\n\n**Property suppliers**\n\nPart of Target\u2019s Supplier Diversity program involves increasing the involvement of diverse-owned businesses in construction. We work to identify and build relationships with suppliers at industry conferences, certification agency events and through the Supplier Diversity Professionals network.\n\nWe have had a longstanding partnership with Construct Reach, a workforce development initiative, and have also partnered with construction suppliers at internal and external events to help diverse construction companies gain insights into effectively working with Target.\nAccelerators\n\nTarget Accelerator programs offer free education, industry access, retail expertise and mentoring services to equip business founders and entrepreneurs in their quest to drive innovation, instigate change and build their businesses.\n\nIn 2022, Target Accelerators supported 90 brands through Target Takeoff, a five-week program for more mature companies that want to learn how to scale into mass retail, and Target Forward Founders, a 10-week program for early-stage companies looking to better understand retail. It\u2019s designed to help historically under-resourced founders be the next wave of wealth-building companies. These programs provide education, resources and network connections needed to scale businesses.\n\nIn 2022, 16 Target Accelerators alumni launched their product lines with Target, bringing the total number of alumni whose products are with Target to 34. One of these alumni is Luna Magic, a vibrant, women-led and Afro-Latina-owned beauty brand founded by sisters Mabel and Sha\u00edra Fr\u00edas that celebrates their multicultural heritage. Luna Magic participated in the Takeoff Beauty 2021 cohort and launched at Target in 2022.\n\nDiverse supplier spotlight: Archer Corporate Services\n\nA recent highlight of Target\u2019s commitment to broadening supplier diversity is our alliance with Archer Corporate Services (ACS), which began during one of our strategic sourcing events. An award-winning Black-owned marketing services and fulfillment company, ACS leveraged its longstanding plastic card production experience to become one of Target\u2019s prepaid card vendors in 2022. By mastering Target\u2019s process and production expectations in a short time, ACS produced 19 million units in its first year as a Target vendor, accounting for 19% of our total order volume for prepaid cards in the Target business channels they support. Based on that success, Target and ACS are exploring additional fulfillment opportunities in 2023.\n\nDiverse and local suppliers\n\n| Metric | FY2022 | FY2021 | FY2020 |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Number of companies supported by Target Accelerators during the fiscal year | | | |\n| \u2022 Target Takeoff | 30 | 31 | 25 |\n| \u2022 Target Forward Founders | 60 | \u2013 | \u2013 |\n| Number of products in Target stores from graduates of Target Accelerators (SKUs) | 340 | 220 | 123 |\n\n| Metric | FY2022 | FY2021 | FY2020 |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Number of diverse suppliers | | | |\n| \u2022 Total | 1,301 | 1,279 | 702 |\n| \u2022 New | 314 | 467 | 297 |\n| Amount of spending with diverse suppliers | | | |\n| \u2022 Tier 1 (USD) | $3,081 million | $2,483 million | $1,471 million |\n| \u2022 Tier 2 (USD) | $709 million | $783 million | $764 million |\n| Percentage of diverse supplier bid inclusion | 51% | 52% | 52% |\n| Percentage of the procurement budget spent on suppliers local to Minnesota and three counties in Western Wisconsin (Polk, St. Croix and Pierce) | 5% | 1% | 4% |\nTraceability\nWe are committed to taking care of the resources we have today and reducing the impact our product manufacturing has on workers throughout the supply chain and on the environment. Additionally, it is our mission to verify everything we source for Target is produced ethically and in accordance with all applicable laws and our policies. Our initiatives are grounded in traceability to enable holistic engagement between people and planet.\n\nTarget works with our business partners to conduct supply chain mapping and enable our ability to track the journey from raw materials to finished product. We aim to achieve full visibility not only to where our raw materials originate, but also across our suppliers throughout each tier of our supply chain, their locations and how those locations may evolve over time. To accomplish this, we have increased our requirements further back in the supply chain through location disclosure and material tracing.\n\nLocation disclosure\nTarget\u2019s Responsible Sourcing and Sustainability Location Disclosure audit program aims to assess whether the products we source are produced ethically and in accordance with laws and our SOVE. All business partners that fall into one of the below categories are required to comply with Target\u2019s Responsible Sourcing and Sustainability Location Disclosure audit program:\n- Target owned brand products and packaging\n- Target-exclusive products and packaging\n- Target-distributed products\n- Nationally branded products and packaging for which Target is the importer of record\n\nOur Responsible Sourcing and Sustainability Location Disclosure audit program covers all final production and select raw material finishing and processing facilities. Facilities that manufacture or convert raw materials for these products must be disclosed. All disclosed manufacturing locations must conduct regular audits and have them approved in accordance with our industry-aligned audit protocol.\n\nMaterial tracing\nTo help our suppliers source responsibly while minimizing harm to the planet and supporting communities, we have developed policies and programs, including material tracing programs for key materials like cotton, palm oil and seafood. Our key material prioritization is based on risk criteria and in service of achieving our ambitious Target Forward goals.\n\n- **Cotton:** We focus on cotton due to its prevalence in our assortment, the regulatory requirements surrounding cotton and our commitment to source cotton more sustainably for owned brand and exclusive national brand products.\n- **Palm Oil:** We are supporting our palm oil sustainability work to trace palm oil to the mill level. Given the challenges upstream in this supply chain, understanding where our business partners source palm oil is essential.\n- **Seafood:** Our sustainable seafood commitment, which is framed around Monterey Bay Seafood Watch\u2019s ratings, applies to all fresh and frozen seafood and shelf-stable tuna items as well as owned brand pet food. Focusing on traceability in seafood supply chains is critical due to the challenge of monitoring vessels on the high seas and the prevalence of illegal, Unregulated, and Unreported (IUU) fishing.\n\nRead more about our sourcing of natural resources, social standards in our supply chain and our work to limit the use of conflict minerals in our owned brand products.\n\nSocial responsibility in the supply chain\nTarget is committed to responsible business conduct, and we expect the same from our domestic and international suppliers. Respect for human rights and environmental stewardship are fundamental principles of our business practices and standards and suppliers must conduct their business with a high level of integrity and maintain transparent and accurate records.\n\nWe have several mechanisms in place to provide guidance on implementing Target\u2019s policies and practices for responsible business conduct, including Target\u2019s Standards of Vendor Engagement (SOVE), our Applying Target\u2019s SOVE manual, vendor trainings and our Responsible Sourcing and Sustainability inbox.\n\nIn 2022, we conducted a variety of training programs with business partners related to our SOVE and Target Forward goals. Training included a total of 28 training sessions focused on our SOVE and audit process, with over 5,000 attendees, and exceeding 9,000 training hours. Training takes place in different languages and time zones and help to enhance our partners\u2019 understanding of Target expectations on social and environmental performance and assessment. Additionally, we conducted 20 training sessions to over 3,000 attendees on our sustainability initiatives, including topics such as digital wages and gender equity for an additional 3,500+ training hours of content.\n\nStandards of Vendor Engagement\nWe require all business partners to abide by Target\u2019s SOVE. Our SOVE applies to all business partners and is managed by our responsible sourcing and sustainability team. Previously updated as new policies were codified, the SOVE will now undergo an annual update as needed. The SOVE poster is available in 27 languages, and the Applying Target\u2019s SOVE manual is available in 11 languages. As of 2023, the manual is available in Hindi. Should a supplier be unable to demonstrate compliance with basic SOVE requirements, they must remediate the non-compliance or their relationship with Target will be terminated.\n\nRead about Target\u2019s audit program, which monitors compliance with the SOVE.\n\nElevating worker well-being in the supply chain\nWe work with strategic stakeholders, including vendors, factories and partners across the globe to improve working conditions and worker well-being.\n\nWe are focused on addressing labor and environmental, health and safety risks within Target\u2019s supply chain, including the following that have particular relevance to our operations:\n\n- **Safe working conditions and fair labor standards:** We are continuing to strengthen our policies and programs to maintain safe working conditions and fair labor standards, and further protect workers from discrimination, harassment and abuse. For example, in 2022 we made SOVE updates that enhance our health and safety expectations for partners.\n- **Human rights:** We continue to enhance our human rights due diligence approaches to respect the rights of all workers in our extended supply chain through our Responsible Sourcing and Sustainability Human Rights Strategy.\n- **Access to remedy:** In 2022, we enhanced our policies within the SOVE to raise our standards on operational grievance mechanisms available to workers.\nDriven by our Target Forward vision, we are committed to a sustainable and inclusive supply chain that is just and equitable for all workers.\n\n**Signature Goal**\n\n**By 2025, Target plans for 100% of owned brand suppliers to have policies and programs to advance gender equity.**\n\nThe Just & Equitable Supply Chain (JESC) goals work together to improve working conditions. Creating a just and equitable supply chain benefits all workers and will require a holistic approach. Therefore, we are focusing on four levers as part of our JESC goal strategy:\n\n- Equitable systems for hiring and advancement.\n- Financial security for workers (inclusive of digital wages goal).\n- Effective anonymous channels for incident reporting (also known as grievance mechanisms).\n- Access to gender-responsive health information and services.\n\nThese goals focus on owned brands where we have the most opportunity to learn and iterate on approaches capable of creating change at scale. As the work advances, we will continuously re-evaluate reach and impact with input from our stakeholders.\n\nIn 2022, Target launched its JESC supplier requirements, which reinforce our SOVE requirements and industry best practices, to define how our suppliers can meet our goals. We also strengthened our SOVE grievance mechanism requirements, raising our core compliance expectations on factory-level grievance mechanisms available to workers.\n\nAs part of rolling out these new supplier requirements, we trained team members and merchandise vendors on our JESC goals and the positive impact of gender equity on factories and workers. Working with the Better Than Cash Alliance, we developed customized training for sourcing team members and merchandise vendors to understand the benefits of paying workers digitally, and provided resources to help factories to begin working to transition to digital wages. We believe transitioning from cash to digital wage payment systems is a critical step in the path towards increased financial inclusion for workers, particularly women, and it leads to cost savings and improved efficiency for suppliers, as well as increased transparency for Target.\n\nTarget is partnering with CARE Impact Partners, the corporate advisory arm of CARE International, to design strategies to drive gender equity throughout our supply chain. In 2023, we initiated an empowerment, test and learn in-factory program strategy, which delivers tailored solutions to address barriers to gender equity and enhance financial security through a harmonized, supplier-led approach.\n\nAs part of our measurement strategy to track progress against our JESC goals, we are using a factory-level Gender Equity Survey created by the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW). This online self-assessment enhances factories\u2019 understanding of how they are incorporating gender equity into practices like hiring systems and management of grievance mechanisms, based on leading industry practices. The data collected from the survey will help us determine our baseline, so that we can measure progress and identify additional resources and support needed across our supply chain to achieve our goals. In 2022, we deployed the survey to non-US, Tier 1 owned brand factories. In 2023, we will expand the survey deployment to other segments of our supply chain.\n\n**Prioritizing health and safety**\n\nWe expect all vendors to provide a safe and healthy working environment for workers. This includes having emergency measures in place, as well as policies and procedures to prevent emergencies. To minimize safety risks, our Responsible Sourcing and Sustainability audit program focuses on identifying health and safety violations. Target also participates in industry-led initiatives like Nirapon and Life and Building Safety (LABS) to enhance worker safety and create a culture of minimizing occupational hazards in our supply chain.\n\n- **Nirapon**, which translates to \u201csafe place\u201d in Bangla, is an industry-led nonprofit that collaborates with global brands, retailers, manufacturers and NGOs to create and sustain a culture of workplace safety in Bangladesh factories. This organization also aims to support workers\u2019 human rights, protect factories\u2019 most valuable assets, instill confidence in global companies sourcing from Bangladesh and drive the growth of an ethical manufacturing industry.\n- **Target** is a founding member of LABS, a global apparel and footwear industry initiative. LABS seeks to find and address building safety risks related to structural, electrical, fire safety and evacuation preparedness. Currently, LABS operates in Vietnam, Cambodia and India and expects to expand to Indonesia in 2023.\n\nIn 2022, as part of our approach to caring for the health and safety of workers within our supply chain, we launched new best practices and policies to protect workers from the impacts of hazardous temperatures applicable to locations in scope for our Responsible Sourcing and Sustainability disclosure requirements. This work is part of Target\u2019s efforts to build a climate-resilient supply chain. We are working on both mitigating the impacts of climate change to our business through Target Forward climate goals while also preparing our supply chain for the impacts of climate change with policy updates related to hazardous temperature health and safety.\n\nWe also embarked on an initiative to bolster the safety of abrasive blasting, a process in which an abrasive material or media is forcibly propelled in the manufacturing process. When this occurs, it can become hazardous if the media contains crystalline silica, as exposure can cause an incurable disease called silicosis. For this reason, Target has banned sandblasting in owned brand apparel manufacturing since 2012. Learn more about the scope of our Responsible Sourcing and Sustainability audit program.\n\nAs of 2023, Target has expanded our sandblasting policy to include all industries and locations in scope of our audit program. Exceptions may be granted for processes that use a very low-silica content media, when blasting occurs with engineering controls to reduce worker exposure; and when the site has adequate respiratory protection programs including appropriate personal protective equipment, regular air testing and worker medical monitoring appropriate to the hazard.\n\nCurrently, we are working with partners who, in 2022, disclosed newly in-scope sandblasting. These efforts are intended to enable them to meet the above criteria or phase out the process.\nBuilding a Responsible Supply Chain\n\nTarget is partnering across our value chain to drive meaningful change through holistic assessment of social, environmental and business impacts of our products and packaging. We take accountability for our own actions to generate social and environmental benefits and avoid causing adverse impacts within our manufacturing supply chain.\n\nWe are committed to a sustainable and inclusive supply chain that is just and equitable for all workers.\n\n- Programs and policies work to improve the livelihoods of vulnerable workers.\n- Support the communities where we do business.\n- Focus on co-creation and collaboration with industry peers, our suppliers and other key stakeholders.\n\nWe are collaborating with our suppliers on solutions that protect, sustain and restore nature through:\n\n- Shared science-aligned goals.\n- Unlocking and investing in renewable energy solutions.\n- Advancing and scaling regenerative agriculture.\n\nOur Standards of Vendor Engagement, our Responsible Sourcing and Sustainability governance program, oversight and performance elevation, and our commitment to Responsible Purchasing Practices serve as the foundation for this work.\n### Social responsibility in the supply chain\n\n| Metric                                                                 | FY2022 | FY2021 | FY2020 | Framework

\u201cAcceptable\u201d audit results. This is not broken down by social and environmental categories but is an overall rating that is inclusive of everything that makes up our SOVE.\n89 Our SOVE (Standards of Vendor Engagement) audit requirements found 17 Zero Tolerance audit results out of over 5,000 audits conducted. This is metric is our equivalence to Priority Non-Conformance Rate and Associated Corrective Action Rate, as all Zero Tolerance rated factories go through remediation and/or deactivation immediately following notification of the non-conformance result.\nHuman Rights\n\nWe recognize that we must take responsibility for respecting the human rights of our team members, guests and workers in the supply chain and people in the communities in which we operate.\n\nAligned with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labor Organization Core Conventions, we are committed to respecting human rights throughout our operations.\n\nIn alignment with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, we respect human rights and seek to avoid adverse human rights impacts resulting from our business activities. We are continuously working to do better; however, if adverse impacts arise, our approach focuses on mitigation and remediation through effective solutions.\n\nWe also make clear in all business relationships that we value the importance of human rights, as evidenced by the following requirements:\n\n- Embedding SOVE in all contracts tied to our supply chain.\n- Vendor training on SOVE.\n- Conducting risk-based Responsible Sourcing and Sustainability audits.\n\nTo respond to the changing external operating environment, we regularly update our SOVE policies. In 2022, we developed new and expanded policies on grievance mechanisms and revised our health and safety policies related to hazardous temperatures and sandblasting. Additionally, we implemented a new policy banning the use of third-party drug and alcohol rehabilitation service providers acting as employers. More information on Target\u2019s human rights commitment may be found on our corporate website.\n\nWe also created a Responsible Sourcing and Sustainability Human Rights Strategy to strengthen human rights due diligence in our supply chain in response to the salient human rights risks identified in our human rights impact assessment. As part of this strategy, we are piloting human rights due diligence tools in new areas of our supply chain, including indirect spend, produce farms and the distribution supply chain. This work is still in the early stages, and we anticipate scaling and institutionalizing this work in 2024 and 2025, with the objective of enhancing Target\u2019s human rights due diligence while also amplifying industry-wide impacts.\n\nAnother supply chain priority is to assess industry-aligned approaches to confirm we are following best practices. Through this effort, we are collaborating with peer brands to amplify our impact and ease the burden on our business partners, while also driving meaningful change in the industry. Two notable examples of this work are Target\u2019s participation in the Indirect Spend Alliance and the Responsible Shipping Dialogue.\n\nManagement and oversight\n\nTarget\u2019s Board of Directors, including its Committees, oversee multiple aspects of our Human Rights Commitment, as follows:\n\n- The full Board oversees our overall sustainability strategy, including the organizational team health aspect of human rights.\n- The Governance & Sustainability Committee oversees external reporting on human rights.\n- The Audit & Risk Committee oversees our compliance and ethics programs and supply chain matters, including vendor human capital and responsible sourcing practices.\n- The Compensation & Human Capital Management Committee oversees a variety of human rights topics, including DE&I, culture and employee engagement, pay equity, broad-based compensation and benefits, growth and development and purpose and values.\n\nIn addition, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Responsibility leads this work at the management level, with day-to-day implementation of our human rights commitments driven by numerous teams, including but not limited to dedicated team members in Corporate Responsibility and Responsible Sourcing. These teams work together to advance our human rights program for our owned operations and supply chain.\n\nLearn more about our governance of sustainability both within this report and in our 2023 Proxy Statement.\n\nIdentifying human rights impacts\n\nIn 2022, Target partnered with Article One, an expert business and human rights consultancy, to refresh our human rights impact assessment (HRIA) for our operations, supply chain and business relationships. The refresh process identified key salient risk areas relevant to Target, our team members, guests, supply chain workers and communities we serve. This year, our partnership with Article One continues as we refine our strategy to develop and build an impactful human rights program and further our focus on key salient risk areas relevant to our business.\n\nTo make sure we are doing our part to educate team members on the importance of human rights risk areas, Target launched our first human rights training to key business areas in 2022. Employees from Merchandising, Owned Brands (including Sourcing) and Corporate Responsibility are now automatically enrolled in the training annually and cover topics including the foundations of human rights; human rights risks in business operations worldwide; and Target\u2019s Human Rights Commitments, including our alignment with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights and the International Labour Organization (ILO) Declarations on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. We plan to build on the success of this training in 2023.\n\nKey Salient Human Rights Risk Areas\n\n| Stakeholders | Key salient risk areas |\n|--------------|------------------------|\n| Our team members | \u2022 Safe working environments.  \n| | \u2022 Professional development.  \n| | \u2022 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I). |\n| Our guests | \u2022 Inclusive merchandise assortment and marketing promotions. |\n| Workers in our supply chain | \u2022 Continuing to strengthen our policies and programs to maintain safe working conditions and fair labor standards, and further protect workers from discrimination, harassment and abuse.  \n| | \u2022 Respecting human rights for all workers, including workers in the distribution, indirect, and informal supply chains.  \n| | \u2022 Expanding continuous improvement and worker well-being efforts in categories that may be higher risk. |\n| Our communities | \u2022 Economic development.  \n| | \u2022 Diverse workforce and equitable hiring and development practices. |\nCombating forced labor\n\nWe are committed to working with supply chain partners and industry experts to prevent, identify and eradicate forced labor in our global manufacturing supply chains.\n\nWe use the UN\u2019s human rights guidance to inform and shape our policies. We inform supply chain workers of our policies through our SOVE and our detailed Applying Target\u2019s SOVE manual which is available in 11 languages. We also provide training and webinars for our suppliers and factories including required training on grievance mechanisms, health and safety, and pre-departure briefings for foreign contract workers, and posters explaining our standards, which are available in 27 languages, for display in factories.\n\nOur SOVE condemns and prohibits forced, trafficked or incarcerated labor in any supply chain activities and we will not knowingly work with suppliers who engage in these practices.\n\nWe pay particular attention to, and perform additional due diligence around suppliers located in countries, including China, India, Malaysia, Taiwan and Thailand, that we consider higher risk for underage labor, young workers and forced labor. We also have a keen focus on specific categories that may require a higher degree of manual labor such as apparel, textiles and home goods, where risk is most prevalent within these countries.\n\nIf indicators of forced labor are found at a facility, we prioritize the well-being of workers and, where possible, we strive to create and implement a corrective action plan to remediate the situation. If remediation is not possible, Target will develop a responsible disengagement strategy that is intended to mitigate additional harm to workers.\n\nAny parties wishing to report concerns related to forced labor at any Target or Target-affiliated facility may use the Target Integrity Hotline.\n\nPartnerships and collaborations\n\nTarget works with several labor rights certification bodies in specific areas of our supply chain, including the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), Equitable Food Initiative (EFI) and Fair Trade USA.\n\nTo help us identify risks through our responsible sourcing audit process, we leverage experts from our partnerships with the following organizations:\n\n- **ELEVATE**: Supports ethical case investigations and dynamic risk and oversight within our Responsible Sourcing and Sustainability audit program.\n- **Impact**: Aids ethical assessments, sensitive cases and issues related to our Responsible Sourcing and Sustainability audit program.\n- **Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment**: An Institute for Human Rights and Business initiative that supports the Employer Pays Principle. We have helped return significant sums to workers through our business partners by having them reimburse recruitment expenses and continue to help workers avoid paying fees to secure jobs.\n- **The Responsible Labor Initiative**: Promotes the rights of workers vulnerable to forced labor.\n- **Stronger Together**: Commits to tackling modern slavery in supply chains.\n- **Verit\u00e9**: Our primary partner on in-depth foreign contract worker assessments at all factories that employ foreign contract workers.\n- **The Child Rights in Business Working Group**: Supports underage investigations and remediation. Brings companies together to collaborate, share best practices and access the latest information and insights related to child rights.\n\n- **Work Better Innovations**: A research consultancy with a community service mission, working innovatively with businesses, civil society, academia and government towards a responsible economy.\n\nPreventing the use of underage labor\n\nAs articulated in the Target underage labor policy found in the SOVE, Target does not tolerate underage labor practices. We work closely with industry partnerships and multi-stakeholder initiatives alongside peer brands that share the common goal of eliminating underage labor. If underage labor is discovered within our owned brand supply chain, we will do everything possible to protect underage workers from further harm. We also work collaboratively with local partner organizations to develop and implement long-term solutions that support affected individuals and their family.\n\nAbiding by conflict minerals rules\n\nAs outlined in our Conflict Minerals Policy, Target will not knowingly purchase or sell any owned or exclusive brand product containing tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold, collectively known as \u201c3TG,\u201d that finances armed conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and its adjoining regions. Our vendors must adopt a 3TG sourcing policy that is consistent with ours and with guidance from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). We also require that vendors report on the standard form developed by the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI). Target maintains the right to audit suppliers on responsible 3TG sourcing.\n\nAs part of our overall effort to reduce the risk of human rights abuses in our supply chain, Target supports the humanitarian goals of the conflict minerals rules and annually conducts a country-of-origin inquiry covering all product categories for owned brands or exclusive brands that we believe...\ncould contain 3TG. For 2022, we surveyed 539 vendors of owned and exclusive brand products, receiving responses from 100% of them.\n\nThe product categories we surveyed in 2022 included:\n- Apparel and Home Textiles\n- Electronics, Lighting, Kitchenware and Small Appliances\n- Home Improvement and Automotive\n- Footwear and Luggage\n- Accessories, Jewelry and Watches\n- Furniture, Home D\u00e9cor, Bath and Seasonal Merchandise\n- Lawn and Garden\n- Health and Beauty Products\n- Toys, Sporting Goods and Pet Supplies\n- Paper, Office, Stationery and Scrapbooking\n\nWe encourage our vendors to identify and source from smelters and refiners certified by the RMI as \u201cConformant.\u201d Forty-six of the 47 smelters and refiners identified by surveyed vendors that provided product-level information met this status.\n\nTarget could only determine the smelters and refiners that processed a portion of the 3TG contained in its potentially in-scope products. As such, while none of the necessary 3TG within in-scope products was determined to directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the DRC and its adjoining countries, we have not determined that any of our potentially in-scope products are \u201cDRC conflict free.\u201d\n\nGrievances and remediation\nOur ethics and compliance Integrity Hotline is open to all suppliers and supply chain workers.\n\nThe centralized governance team within compliance and ethics manages the intake and triage of all reports made through the hotline and other channels. These reports can be made through our third-party hotline provider anonymously. 24 hours a day and interpreters are available.\n\nIn 2022, the responsible sourcing and sustainability team identified that, in some instances, an interpreter was not available in the language of the individuals who called the hotline. We have remediated these gaps by partnering with local service providers to properly capture all worker allegations. To enhance the capabilities of the hotline service, we added specific numbers with greetings in local languages for India, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Vietnam and Bangladesh.\n\nFor supply chain investigations, we use a combination of internal and third-party investigators depending on the issue and region. Complaints received are thoroughly reviewed and investigated.\n\nFactories are prohibited from retaliating against third-party workers, who may remain anonymous, for reporting any potential violations of our SOVE.\n\nTarget has enacted extensive remediation policies and practices to responsibly respond to human rights violations and impacts. More detail on remediation practice in our supply chain can be found here.\n\nWe also support suppliers in collecting data on grievance types, resolution and mechanism channels, and through third-party helplines associated with our audit program partners, enhancing effectiveness and worker engagement. Our Responsible Sourcing Advisory Program leverages tools from the Better Work Academy and advises suppliers on establishing and executing grievance mechanisms and monitoring performance.\n\nAudits and continuous improvement\nBecause we believe in making a collective impact, we value common or shared audit programs, addressing issues that are too big for any one company to tackle alone through collaboration with others.\n\nAll disclosed manufacturing locations must conduct regular audits and have them approved in accordance with our industry-aligned audit protocol. These disclosed manufacturing locations within our supply chain are meeting our audit expectations. Our risk-based audit program assesses facility conditions, health and safety, worker treatment and compensation, hiring processes and environmental practices. It also evaluates for compliance with applicable laws and program standards aligned with Target\u2019s SOVE. Acceptable audit programs include Amfori Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI), Better Work, Equitable Food Initiative (EFI), ITC Ethical Toy Program (ETP), Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), Fair Trade USA, Sedex Members, Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) 4 Pillar, and the Social Labor Convergence Program.\n\nSuppliers must submit onsite social audits at least annually. Furthermore, our responsible sourcing and sustainability team reserves the right to conduct unannounced audits at factories in scope of the responsible sourcing program to verify that the locations maintain compliance during the entire lifecycle when working with Target. Audits will reflect both vendor and facility compliance performance.\n\nAdditionally, any facility that employs foreign contract workers must also complete additional self-assessments and audits, focusing on identifying indicators of forced labor. Some facilities may be required to submit more regularly if issues arise.\nAnimal Welfare\n\nTarget is committed to following practices that support the welfare of animals sourced for food and non-food products. These practices are regularly updated to align with industry and governmental standards and guidelines.91\n\nOur approach to animal welfare is grounded in our belief of the Five Freedoms for every animal over the course of their entire lifetime.92 All supplier partners must comply with these standards.\n\nWe also expect suppliers to maintain written policies detailing best practices for each of the areas relevant to their products. Where possible, Target performs product testing protocols to verify conformance with our commitments. We provide training on animal welfare topics to internal teams responsible for buying or sourcing animal products and we expect all our suppliers to provide adequate training to every individual involved with the direct handling of animals throughout the supply chain.\n\nFood animal welfare standards and commitments\n\nFor all animal protein-based products, Target has established minimum requirements \u2013 in alignment with industry standards \u2013 that guide the work of our suppliers.\n\nTarget expects all vendor partners that produce owned brand and national brand food and beverage items to meet or exceed the animal welfare standards established by Target and recognized throughout the industry. Complete details of our food animal welfare standards and our owned brand animal-derived raw material product standards can be found on our website, and 2022 highlights of our work by protein type are detailed below.\n\nEggs\n\nWe continue to work toward transitioning to solely cage-free shell eggs by 2025, pending available supply. The extreme volatility in the egg market and the impact of avian influenza on our two largest facilities producing Good & Gather cage-free eggs in 2022 and continuing into 2023 significantly impeded our progress on our cage-free goal. Despite headwinds, we are pleased to have achieved an increase in our percentage of sales of shell eggs coming from cage-free systems,93 which improved to 58% in 2022. Additionally, 100% of liquid eggs have been converted to cage-free and all but one national brand fully converted to cage-free or better.\n\nGood & Gather Pork\n\nWe launched all Good & Gather fresh pork raised in an open pen gestation system in September 2022. Good & Gather represents the vast majority of fresh pork sales. Having achieved this, we are moving towards a true crate-free assortment in Good & Gather. We\u2019ll do this by continuing to collaborate across our value chain to drive progress in the industry. We are in talks with our business partners on achieving gestation crate-free products via third-party certification.\n\n100% of owned brand pork is produced in an open pen gestation system94\n\nAnimal Welfare\n\n| Metric | FY2022 | FY2021 | FY2020 | Framework |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|\n| Percentage of revenue from eggs that originated from a cage-free environment | 58% | 57% | 50% | SASB: FR-FF-430a,2 |\n\n91 We expect suppliers to adhere to animal-derived raw material product standards in a number of material categories, with the exception of leather, which is our least consumed raw material category within relevant areas of business, and therefore not material.\n92 We believe that every animal deserves to be free from 1) hunger and thirst 2) discomfort 3) pain, injury or disease 4) to express normal behavior 5) from fear and distress for their entire lifetime, including birth, growth, rearing and breeding, when feeding, watering or sheltering, transport, and slaughter.\n93 This includes cage-free, free-range, or pasture-raised systems.\n94 Target reported for the first time in 2022.\nIndexes\n\n68  About This Report\n69  Target Forward Progress Report Index\n72  GRI Index\n84  SASB Index\n93  SDG Index\n107 TCFD Index\n109 UNGPRF Index\n115 Policies and Resources\n116 Glossary\nAbout This Report\n\nOur reporting aligns to a number of leading international disclosure standards and frameworks. These frameworks and standards inform our disclosures and reflect our commitment to provide stakeholders a detailed, transparent and holistic account of our approach, performance and progress.\n\nThe responses in the following indexes include links to further information where relevant.\n\nScope\n\nTarget\u2019s 2023 reporting on sustainability and governance matters was published in September 2023 and reflects activities and initiatives in our fiscal year (FY) 2022 (January 30, 2022 \u2013 January 28, 2023). It also covers certain subsequent events and initiatives that occurred after the end of FY2022 and prior to publication, which we have endeavored to note as such. All quantitative goals and company data, unless otherwise stated, reflect FY2022. Unless noted, goals and other data in the report reflect our U.S. operations and/or owned brand portfolio, as relevant.\n\nOur last report was published in July 2022 and reflects activities and initiatives in our FY2021.\n\nReport structure\n\nMaintaining our Sustainability and Governance priorities through regular assessment of stakeholder inputs helps us confirm that we are focusing on topics that matter to us as a retailer and meeting the expectations of our investors and other stakeholders.\n\nIn 2022, we completed a comprehensive assessment of Sustainability and Governance priorities to further meet the expectations of our stakeholders. Our most recent assessment verifies that the review we completed in 2021 successfully identified the most critical priorities for Target and has resulted in some minor modifications to our reporting procedures. We conducted our prior assessment of our Sustainability and Governance priorities in 2018-2019.\n\nThe 2022 Sustainability and Governance priority assessment incorporated industry benchmark data and external stakeholder feedback in the forms of subject matter expert interviews. Through interviews with Target leadership across enterprise teams and external stakeholders, we gathered feedback on an initial topic list, which was informed by market research and the topics\u2019 potential importance to Target.\n\nIssues deemed priority for the purposes of this report are not necessarily considered material for any other purpose, including U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting.\n\nThis report has been written for a broad range of stakeholders, including but not limited to our team members, guests, suppliers, investors and nonprofits. To improve ease of use and comparability with peers, we align to and index our reporting against frameworks and standards from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework (UNGPRF), where applicable. Icons in relevant sections clearly indicate what reporting frameworks and standards the content responds to.\n\nSome of our climate and energy data are independently verified to a limited level of assurance. We did not seek external assurance for the remainder of this report.\n\nThroughout the report, policies that do not have links are references to Target\u2019s internal policies that are not publicly available. Figures in this report and their accompanying footnotes have been rounded down to the nearest whole number, excluding scope 1 and 2 emissions values.\n\nForward-looking statements\n\nThis report contains forward-looking statements based on our current assumptions and expectations.

Investments in gathering data directly from our vendors has greatly increased data accuracy and reduced extrapolation.  \n<sup>97</sup> Net zero, as defined, is achieved when a company\u2019s scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions are reduced to a level that is consistent with a 1.5\u00b0C pathway, and any residual emissions are removed from the atmosphere through either nature-based or technological carbon removal solutions (e.g., forestry, regenerative agriculture, carbon capture technology), by no later than 2050, in alignment with the Paris Agreement. Target has committed to net zero greenhouse gas emissions across our enterprise, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement.  \n<sup>98</sup> As our business continues to grow, we are working to have our scope 3 reduction efforts outpace this growth. In 2022, we saw some positive progress through improved transportation options, specifically less air freight, and supplier emissions reductions due to Greening the Grid efforts, and we are working to implement innovative solutions to raw materials and supplier engagement to drive down our upstream emissions.  \n<sup>99</sup> Waste diverted from landfill was inflated due to larger than expected inventory positions in FY22.\n## Accelerate Opportunity and Equity\n\n| Signature Goals                                                                 | Milestones                                                                 | FY2022 Progress                                                                 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| By 2030, engage and elevate community voices as we seek to build and implement community-driven solutions. | By 2025, Target and Target Foundation plan to evolve our philanthropic practices and place-based solutions to invite participation from communities. | Development of measurement infrastructure underway. |\n| Target aims to drive equitable opportunities and outcomes for advancement and engagement by continuing to be a leader in diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging. | \u2022 Percentage of women in our global workforce:  \n  - Hourly workforce: 56%  \n  - Exempt: 51%  \n  - Senior leadership: 48% | |\n| Target aims to create equity through benefit access and affordability to enhance total well-being. | Target aims to empower team members to create the employment experience of their choice through personalized scheduling. | \u2022 63% of team members are eligible for full-time benefits.  \n\u2022 56% of store team members are receiving desired hours. |\nWe continue to report against the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, the most widely used standard for reporting.\n\nTarget has reported the information cited in this GRI content index for the period covering (FY) 2022 (January 30, 2022 \u2014 January 28, 2023) with reference to the GRI Standards, specifically GRI 1: Foundation 2021.\n\n### GRI Index\n\n| GRI Standard | Disclosure Title | Disclosure Number | Target Response |\n|--------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| **Organization and its reporting practices** | | | |\n| GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 | Organizational details | 2-1 | 2022 Form 10-K: Part 1. item 1.

In line with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization Core Conventions, we are committed to respecting human rights throughout our operations.\n\nIn alignment with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, we respect human rights and seek to avoid adverse human rights impacts resulting from our business activities. We are continuously working to do better, but if there are adverse impacts, our approach is to provide access to effective remedy.\n\nIn adhering to our purpose and as part of our ongoing commitment to human rights, we conducted a mapping exercise to identify salient human rights issues across our business.\n### Policy Commitment\n\n#### Embedding respect\n\n| A2 | How does the company demonstrate the importance it attaches to the implementation of its human rights commitment? |\n|----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| A2.1 | How is day-to-day responsibility for human rights performance organized within the company, and why? |\n| A2.2 | What kinds of human rights issues are discussed by senior management and by the Board, and why? |\n| A2.3 | How are employees and contract workers made aware of the ways in which respect for human rights should inform their decisions and actions? |\n| A2.4 | How does the company make clear in its business relationships the importance it places on respect for human rights? |\n| A2.5 | What lessons has the company learned during the reporting period about achieving respect for human rights, and what has changed as a result? |\n\n#### Information on How We're Contributing\n\n- **Human Rights** p. 63\n- **Human Rights Statement**\n- **Supply Chain Labor & Human Rights Policies**\n- **Code of Ethics**\n\nWe are conducting ongoing due diligence, as well as engaging with our stakeholders to better understand our salient human rights issues. We are developing and implementing training on this policy for relevant Target team members and suppliers, and report on our progress in our annual reporting. Additionally, Target\u2019s Integrity Hotline is available to team members and suppliers with concerns about potential violations of our Code of Ethics.\n\nAt Target, we believe that all team members have a shared responsibility for respecting human rights. In addition, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Responsibility has executive oversight and the day-to-day implementation of our human rights commitments is led by numerous teams, including but not limited to dedicated team members in Corporate Responsibility and Responsible Sourcing. These teams work together to advance our human rights program for our owned operations and supply chain.\n\nIn 2022, Target partnered with Article One, an expert business and human rights consultancy, to refresh our human rights impact assessment (HRIA) for our operations, supply chain and business relationships. The refresh identified key salient risk areas relevant to Target, our team members, guests, supply chain workers and communities we serve.\n\n### Part B: Defining the focus of reporting\n\n#### Statement of salient issues\n\n| B1 | Statement of salient issues: State the salient human rights issues associated with the company\u2019s activities and business relationships during the reporting period. |\n|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|    | **Human Rights** p. 63                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|    | **Human Rights Statement**                                                                                                                                                                       |\n### Policy Commitment\n\n#### Explanation of salient issues\n\n| B2 | Determination of salient issues: Describe how the salient human rights issues were determined, including any input from stakeholders. |\n|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|    | Human Rights p. 63                                                                                                               |\n|    | Human Rights Statement                                                                                                           |\n|    | In 2022, Target partnered with Article One, an expert business and human rights consultancy, to refresh our human rights impact assessment (HRIA) for our operations, supply chain and business relationships.
