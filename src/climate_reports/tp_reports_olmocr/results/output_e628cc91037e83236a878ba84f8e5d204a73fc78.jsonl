We take a global approach to corporate responsibility, with regional programs and initiatives that support our global work. We focus our efforts where we believe we can have a meaningful impact and report our efforts under four key pillars:\n\n/ Workplace\n/ Communities\n/ Environmental Sustainability\n/ Responsible Business\nManagement & Oversight\n\nAs part of its oversight role, our Board of Directors reviews environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters, and, directly through its Committees, considers information relating to our corporate responsibility programs.\n\nIn Fiscal 2023, a Senior Executive Vice President, Group President (SEVP), added strategic oversight of our Global Corporate Responsibility program to their business function. This SEVP, along with global, cross-functional leaders, oversees the development of corporate responsibility strategies across a range of ESG matters that align with our business priorities.\n\nStakeholder Engagement\nWe strongly believe that for our policies and practices to be effective, they must evolve and be informed by the perspectives of our many global stakeholders, including our Associates, customers, shareholders, and others. We view engaging with stakeholders, in addition to industry associations, as an opportunity to gain insights and learn.\n\nLearn more about our approach to corporate responsibility on TJX.com.\n\nWe firmly believe that our continued commitment to developing and implementing meaningful environmental, social, and governance practices is important as we move forward. Our approach to corporate responsibility is intended to build on our prior efforts and sets us up to evolve over time with practices that we believe can be impactful and inclusive, reflecting today\u2019s growing responsibilities and varied expectations.\n\nErnie Herrman\nChief Executive Officer and President\nThe TJX Companies, Inc.\nFY23 Highlights\n\nWorkplace\n\n- 68% of people in managerial positions globally were women\n- 58% of managerial positions in stores and field offices were filled by internal promotions\n- 80% of promotions globally were earned by women\n- 36% of people in managerial positions in the U.S. were people of color\n- Shortened waiting periods for some of our physical well-being programs for eligible Associates at our U.S. office and store locations\n\nEnvironmental Sustainability\n\n- 29% reduction in global GHG emissions from our direct operations since FY17\n- 74% of global operational waste diverted from landfill\n- 27% of our electricity in our global direct operations came from renewable energy sources\n- B score received on the CDP 2022 Climate Change Questionnaire\n\nCommunities\n\n- 30,000 domestic violence services provided\n- 3 million young people provided access to educational opportunities\n- 30 million meals provided\n- $27 million donated for healthcare research and patient care\n- Disaster relief efforts for flooding in areas such as Pakistan, Australia, and Canada\n\nResponsible Business\n\n- Joined the Sustainable Packaging Coalition\n- 78% of Board Members are women and/or self-identify as a member of an underrepresented group (as of June 2023)\n- 78% of Board Members are independent (as of June 2023)\n- 2,900+ factory audits were reviewed\n- 29% reduction in global GHG emissions from our direct operations since FY17\n- 74% of global operational waste diverted from landfill\n- 27% of our electricity in our global direct operations came from renewable energy sources\n- B score received on the CDP 2022 Climate Change Questionnaire\nWe aim to support our Associates by making TJX a terrific place to work.

Our global environmental sustainability program includes a wide range of initiatives that work toward reducing the environmental impacts of our operations as well as certain products and packaging.\n\n**OUR APPROACH**\n\nTo learn more about our Environmental Sustainability initiatives, visit tjx.com/corporate-responsibility/introduction/overview.\n\n**FOCUS AREAS**\n\n- Climate and Energy\n- Waste Management\n- Responsible Sourcing\nOur Global Goals\n\n**NET ZERO**\n\nWe have a goal to achieve net zero GHG emissions in our operations by 2040.\n\n**100 PERCENT**\n\nWe intend to source 100% renewable energy in our operations by 2030.\n\n**85 PERCENT**\n\nWe are working to divert 85% of our operational waste from landfill by 2027.\n\n**100 PERCENT**\n\nWe aim to shift 100% of the packaging for products developed in-house by our product design team to be reusable, recyclable, or contain sustainable materials by 2030.\n\n**29%**\n\nAbsolute reduction in global GHG emissions from our own operations (from a FY17 baseline).\n\n**27%**\n\nOf our electricity in our own global direct operations came from renewable energy sources.\n\nProgress Against Net-Zero GHG Target\n\nTJX has achieved a 29% reduction in absolute GHG emissions from our own operations from FY17 to FY23.\n\nWe experienced a 7.1% increase in our absolute market-based GHG emissions in FY22 relative to FY21 due to a return to normal operations after COVID-19 related temporary store closures reduced our GHG emissions in FY21.\nClimate and Energy\n\nWe work across our global business operations to measure, manage, and mitigate our climate impacts. We\u2019ve committed to reducing the climate impacts of our own operations\u2014meaning our stores, home offices, distribution (or processing) centers, and certain vehicles. Our global climate and energy targets include:\n\nBy 2030:\n/ We expect to reach a 55% absolute reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from our own operations (Scope 1 and Scope 2) by Fiscal 2030 (against a Fiscal 2017 baseline).\n/ We intend to source 100% renewable energy in our operations.\n\nBy 2040:\n/ We have a goal to achieve net zero GHG emissions in our operations (Scope 1 and Scope 2).\n\nThrough our net zero roadmap, we have identified emissions reduction strategies and tactics that aim to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in line with our commitments. Initially, we plan to focus on reducing emissions in our facilities by accelerating investments in some energy efficiency technologies, such as HVAC and LED lighting, and increasing renewable energy purchases across our global organization. We also continue to monitor the development of electric vehicles and alternative fuels in order to reduce fleet emissions where feasible.\n\nWe have begun to evaluate how our commitment to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions might be extended to certain Scope 3 emissions sources as well. As an early step in this feasibility assessment, we have conducted a high-level estimate of both our upstream and downstream GHG emissions (Scope 3), which is helping us better understand the potential significant sources of emissions associated with certain activities in our value chain.\nTeams throughout our business work to implement cost-effective strategies to manage operational waste. We are doing this in several ways, including by eliminating operational waste where feasible and maximizing the reuse and recycling of materials in our stores, distribution centers, and corporate offices.\n\nWe have many programs across our global business that support our efforts to reuse and recycle our operational waste in our stores, distribution centers, and home offices. Recycling programs for common items like cardboard, plastic, paper, aluminum, and glass have been introduced across all geographies. In the U.S. and Europe, we utilize our Asset Recovery Recycling Centers (ARRCs) to help reuse and recycle used cardboard, plastic, excess hangers, store fixtures, display cases, and other supplies from select stores. We also have regional efforts in place to identify opportunities to remove single-use plastics from our operations and are working with our suppliers to reduce single-use packaging.\n\nFor many years, our U.S. distribution centers have used a more easily recycled material and corrugated box insert for the packaging of liquid products during shipping from distribution centers to stores. This effort has resulted in an estimated 12 million fewer plastic bags being used across our distribution network each year.\n\nSince Fiscal 2021, stores in Europe have eliminated single-use plastic merchandise carry-out bags. Customers can bring their own bags or purchase from our range of reusable bags, including our reusable \u201cbags for life,\u201d from which a portion of the proceeds goes to one of our charity partners.\n\nIn Canada, we switched to a reusable system for the containers served in our Home Office cafeteria, helping to divert an estimated 35,000 single-use containers from the waste stream annually.\nWe recognize the importance of operating ethically and sourcing responsibly, and our business dealings are grounded in our long-held core values of honesty, integrity, and treating others with dignity and respect.\n\nWe hold ourselves to high ethical standards and expect our Associates to comply with the standards set forth in the TJX Global Code of Conduct. Likewise, our Vendor Code of Conduct sets our expectations of the vendors with whom we do business.\n\nAREAS OF FOCUS\n\n/ Responsible Sourcing\n/ Global Social Compliance\n/ Supplier Diversity\n/ Governance\n\nTo learn more about our Responsible Business practices, visit tjx.com/corporate-responsibility/introduction/overview.\nResponsible Sourcing\n\nSustainable Products & Packaging\n\nAs we source merchandise, product packaging, and supplies for our own operations, we may find more opportunities to procure products and materials with sustainable attributes, and we have increased our capability to identify such opportunities.\n\n/ We aim to shift 100% of the packaging for products developed in-house by our product design team to be reusable, recyclable, or contain sustainable materials by 2030.\n\n/ Along the way, we plan to phase out use of PVC packaging of certain soft home products developed in-house by our product design team by 2025. This will include certain top-of-bed styles, easy-care linens, outdoor seating cushions, and outdoor pillows.\n\nOur subject matter experts have compiled a list of preferred sustainable product certifications in certain product categories that can be used across all of our divisions, globally.\n\nChemicals Management\n\nSince we operate a large, complex, international business, we focus our efforts in areas where we believe we can have a meaningful impact and that are most feasible for our business model. As we continue to learn and build our programs in this area, we are exploring ways to manage chemicals of concern in our operations as well as in certain products we sell.\n\n/ Business operations: We have implemented our plan to phase out all phenol-based coatings on paper customer sales receipts in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Australia.\n\n/ Merchandise and packaging: We have developed a buyer tool for Winners beauty buyers to identify beauty products free of certain chemicals of concern.\n\n/ Industry, expert, and internal collaboration: We are members of the Green Chemistry and Commerce Council (GC3). The GC3 has a mission to promote safer chemicals, materials, and products across retail supply and value chains.\nGlobal Social Compliance\n\nOur philosophy towards social compliance mirrors our culture, and, just as we are committed to honesty, integrity, and treating others with dignity and respect, we expect those that we do business with to do the same. Our approach to our Global Social Compliance Program includes:\n\nVendor Code of Conduct:\n/ Our Vendor Code of Conduct serves as the foundation for our Global Social Compliance Program, incorporating human rights, labor rights, and anti-corruption standards, among other expectations.\n\n/ Our purchase order terms and conditions include a requirement for merchandise vendors to adhere to our Vendor Code of Conduct and require that any factories or subcontractors they use also comply with our Code.\n\nFactory Auditing:\n/ Factories included in our audit program are required to undergo regular audits.\n\nTraining:\n/ We offer regular training sessions to educate buying agents, vendors, and factory management within our factory audit program on our expectations with regard to social compliance.\n\n/ TJX Associates involved in the development and buying of merchandise are expected to undergo formal social compliance training biennially.\n\nStakeholder Engagement:\n/ We believe that engaging with various audiences and a variety of industry associations and considering their guidance helps us as we strive to continually improve our program.\n\nIn Fiscal 2023, we reviewed more than 2,900 audits, which were either conducted directly by TJX\u2019s third-party auditors or were accepted from recognized sources.7\nSupplier Diversity\n\nOur Supplier Diversity Program is dedicated to broadening supplier options for not-for-resale goods and services and helps provide access to additional opportunities to businesses owned by minorities, women, veterans, LGBTQ+ individuals, and persons with disabilities.\n\nThe Program has helped us identify suppliers for mutually beneficial relationships and has helped to promote economic development in our suppliers\u2019 local communities.\n\nWe continue to expand the Program beyond the U.S., adding Canada and the U.K. in FY22 and Germany and Australia in FY23.\n\nGovernance\n\nWe believe our Board should be composed of highly engaged directors and that the Board\u2019s skills and experience should be aligned with the changing needs of the Company for current and future business environments.\n\nDirector Qualifications and Nominations:\nWe look for a Board that represents a diversity of backgrounds and experience, including as to gender and race/ethnicity, and that reflects a range of talents, ages, skills, viewpoints, professional experiences, geographies, and educational backgrounds.\n\nAs of June 2023, 78% of our directors are women and/or members of an underrepresented group (race, ethnicity, LGBTQ+) and 78% of our directors are independent.\n\nThe Executive Chairman of the Board is a woman and all four committee chairs are women.\n\nReporting & Disclosures\n\nAbout this Report\nFor more than 10 years, we have been formally reporting on our global corporate responsibility efforts. The data presented throughout this Summary denotes TJX\u2019s Fiscal 2023, which ended January 28, 2023, unless otherwise noted.\n\nWe think of our corporate responsibility reporting as ever evolving.
