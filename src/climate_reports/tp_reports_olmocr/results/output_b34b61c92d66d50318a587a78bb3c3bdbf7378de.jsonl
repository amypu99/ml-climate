So we set an even more ambitious goal \u2014 to make our products carbon neutral by 2030, across our entire supply chain and the lifetime energy use of our customers\u2019 devices. Teams across Apple quickly got to work, and thanks to their innovations, we\u2019ve made extraordinary progress.\n\nIn this year\u2019s report, you\u2019ll find the most detailed portrait yet of where we are today and where we\u2019re headed. Here\u2019s the big picture: Since 2015, we\u2019ve reduced our emissions by over 45 percent. We did it while reaching more Apple users than ever before. And, in doing so, we demonstrated that the choice between a thriving business and a thriving planet is a false one.\n\nThis was also the year we called on our suppliers to accelerate their work to address their emissions. We\u2019ve sent a clear message that the choice between a thriving business and a thriving planet is a false one.\n\nThis year, we\u2019ve also made it easier to understand the carbon impact of your Apple device and be confident in the knowledge that it has net-zero carbon impact. There are few companies that can make that claim \u2014 let alone ones that set our high standards and transparently show their progress along the way.\n\nAs we move closer to our goals, we\u2019ve continued to push the pace by bringing new clean energy online to power our supply chain. And we\u2019re investing in a growing number of renewable energy projects to balance the electricity our customers use to charge their devices.\n\nRecycled materials are also a key focus of our innovations, and another way we\u2019re driving down our emissions. Today, about 20 percent of the materials in our products are from recycled or renewable sources. Our goal is to one day reach 100 percent, and to end our reliance on mining altogether. Where we continue to extract materials, we maintain the highest standards in our due diligence and respect for human rights. And we\u2019re accelerating our work with new goals to use 100 percent recycled cobalt, tin, gold, and rare earth elements in key components by 2025.\n\nThe strides we\u2019re making play a huge role in driving down our emissions even further, reducing our reliance on energy-intensive mining, smelting, and refining.\n\nWe\u2019ll keep pursuing creative ways to reduce our footprint, and only use high-quality carbon offsets to balance emissions we can\u2019t zero out. That\u2019s why we launched the Restore Fund, which aims to help businesses invest in high-quality, nature-based solutions that restore the forests, wetlands, and grasslands that remove carbon from our atmosphere.\n\nEquity remains a central focus of our investments in clean energy and green technology. We continue to grow our Impact Accelerator, which invests in the next generation of innovative, diverse entrepreneurs in fields like clean energy, recycling, and green chemistry. We\u2019ve also expanded our Power for Impact program, which brings renewable projects to communities around the world \u2014 from neighborhoods in rural South Africa to underresourced schools in the Philippines. We believe the best way to fight climate change is to engage communities on their front lines, and every day, we put the action to those words.\n\nI\u2019ve worn a few different hats over my career \u2014 including as Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and leading this work at Apple. It\u2019s taught me that tackling climate change is possible only when we bring government, industry, and communities together. We have to meet a global challenge with global solutions \u2014 solutions that center on people.\n\nI have so many talented, passionate colleagues who share in this mission. Thanks to their tireless work, we\u2019ve hurdled barriers that once seemed impossible to clear. We have no illusions about the challenges ahead, but whatever comes, we\u2019ll keep marching forward.\n\nApple is on a journey \u2014 and we\u2019ll share the road with as many people as we can. We hope you\u2019ll join us.\n\nLisa Jackson\nVice President, Environment, Policy & Social Initiatives\nThroughout 2022, we\u2019ve achieved progress across our environmental goals as an organization. Our employees, suppliers, industry partners, and other stakeholders have each played an integral role in helping us to reduce our impact, create equitable solutions, and drive broader change across industries and our communities. These efforts have yielded positive results across our business. And where we\u2019ve encountered challenges, we\u2019ve also identified opportunities to continue to make a difference.\n\nCarbon neutral for corporate emissions\nSince April 2020, we\u2019ve achieved carbon neutrality for our corporate emissions by sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity for Apple facilities, implementing energy efficiency, and securing high-quality carbon offsets for remaining emissions. While corporate emissions represent only a small portion of our overall emissions, this is an important step toward our broader goal of achieving carbon neutrality for all our products.\n\nReduced value chain emissions by over 45 percent\nWe reduced our overall emissions across scopes 1, 2, and 3 by over 45 percent compared with our 2015 baseline year. We avoided over 28 million metric tons of emissions through reduction initiatives like transitioning our supply chain to renewable electricity and sourcing recycled content for our products.\n\nCalled on Apple suppliers to decarbonize\nIn October 2022, we urged our worldwide supply chain to decarbonize their entire Apple-related footprint by 2030, including their scope 1 and 2 emissions associated with Apple production. We also communicated that progress toward these goals will be a crucial part of the criteria we consider when awarding future business.\n\nCommitted an additional $200 million to nature-based projects\nIn 2023, Apple announced a commitment of additional funds \u2014 up to $200 million \u2014 to expand the Restore Fund to be managed by Climate Asset Management, a joint venture between HSBC Asset Management and Polinat. The new investment will broaden the portfolio of nature-based projects, including agricultural and agroforestry projects, that scale up carbon removal while aiming to achieve a financial return on investment.\n\nIntroduced our comprehensive water strategy\nThis year, we\u2019ve evolved our existing water stewardship strategy into a holistic, enterprise-wide approach that addresses water availability, quality, and equity. Our five-pillar approach is grounded in understanding the local conditions of the watersheds in which we operate.\n\nIncreased our use of recycled materials\nWe\u2019re making progress toward our goal of transitioning to 100 percent recycled and renewable materials in our products. In 2022, 20 percent of the materials we shipped in Apple products came from recycled sources, including recycled aluminum, rare earth elements, tin, cobalt, gold, tungsten, steel, brass, copper, and plastic.\n\nReduced plastic content in packaging\nIn 2022, plastics accounted for only 4 percent of our packaging \u2014 down from 21 percent in 2015 \u2014 marking significant progress toward our goal to eliminate plastics from our packaging by 2025.\n\nDrove the creation of a new standard for green cleaners\nIn 2022, Apple continued to serve as chair of the Green Cleaners for Electronics Manufacturing task group \u2014 along with more than 20 industry partners \u2014 and submitted the draft version of IPC-1402, Standard for Green Cleaners Used in Electronics Manufacturing, for public review. This new standard will help suppliers across the electronics supply chain select cleaners that are safer for employees and the environment.\n\nAdvanced the Impact Accelerator\nApple welcomed the second cohort of Black-, Hispanic/Latinx-, and Indigenous-owned businesses on the cutting edge of green technology and clean energy to participate in Apple\u2019s Impact Accelerator \u2014 a unique program designed to expand opportunities within Apple\u2019s supply chain and beyond.\nOur environmental strategy\n\nThe environmental challenges we face today are significant, and we\u2019re responding with urgency and innovation. We approach our work by focusing on fundamental questions. What matters most? And where can we make the greatest impact? These questions \u2014 and the data underlying their answers \u2014 guide our work across our strategic pillars of climate change, resources, and smarter chemistry. We know we\u2019re not alone in working to reduce our environmental footprint. So we\u2019re engaging with others to support our efforts and find opportunities to move our industries forward.\n\n**CLIMATE CHANGE**\n\nWe\u2019re already carbon neutral for our corporate operations, and we\u2019ve set a goal to become carbon neutral for our entire product footprint by 2030. We plan to get there by reducing our emissions by 75 percent compared with 2015, then investing in high-quality carbon removal solutions for the remaining emissions.\n\n- **Low-carbon design**\n- **Energy efficiency**\n- **Clean electricity**\n- **Direct emissions abatement**\n- **Carbon removal**\n\n**RESOURCES**\n\nWe aim to make durable, long-lasting products and packaging using only recycled or renewable materials, as well as enhance material recovery. At the same time, we\u2019re committed to stewarding water resources and sending zero waste to landfill.\n\n- **Materials**\n- **Water**\n- **Zero waste**\n\n**SMARTER CHEMISTRY**\n\nThrough chemistry innovation and rigorous controls, we design our products to be safe for anyone who assembles, uses, or recycles them \u2014 and to be better for the environment.\n\n- **Mapping and engagement**\n- **Assessment and management**\n- **Innovation**\n\n**ENGAGEMENT AND ADVOCACY**\n\nEngaging with others \u2014 from industry partnerships to policy advocacy \u2014 is integral to advancing our environmental work and to achieving an even greater impact that considers communities around the world. We learn from feedback, and we work with partners to influence change in our industries. And we\u2019re transparent about our challenges and achievements to inspire others to take their own action.\nGoals\n\nWe create products and services to enrich the lives of our customers. And we strive to do so in a way that sustains the ecosystems and resources that we all depend on. Setting ambitious goals is essential to this \u2014 to drive the innovation and collaboration that make change possible and to be transparent about and accountable for our progress.\n\n**Climate Change**\n- Achieve carbon neutrality for our entire carbon footprint by 2030, and reach our emissions reduction target\n- Create all products with net-zero carbon impact by 2030\n- Transition our entire product value chain, including manufacturing and product use, to 100 percent clean electricity by 2030\n\n**Resources**\n- Use only recycled and renewable materials in our products and packaging, and enhance material recovery\n- Eliminate plastics in our packaging by 2025\n- Reduce water impacts in the manufacturing of our products, use of our services, and operation of our facilities\n- Eliminate waste sent to landfill from our corporate facilities and our suppliers\n\n**Smarter Chemistry**\n- Drive comprehensive reporting of the chemicals used in our supply chain to make our products\n- Integrate smarter chemistry innovation into the way we design and build our products\n- Avoid exposure to chemicals that could be harmful to human health or the environment\n\n**Highlight**\n- We\u2019ve reduced the emissions across our value chain by **over 45 percent** since 2015.\n- **20 percent** of all materials shipped in products in 2022 came from **recycled** sources.\n- We\u2019ve made new commitments to **phase out PFAS** from our products and manufacturing processes.\nClimate Change\n\nWe aim to make all our products carbon neutral by 2030.\nGoals and progress\n\n**Goal**\nBecome carbon neutral for our corporate operations.\n\n**Goal**\nAchieve carbon neutrality for our entire carbon footprint, including products, by 2030, reducing related emissions by 75 percent compared with 2015.\n\n**Goal**\nTransition our entire product value chain, including manufacturing and product use, to 100 percent clean electricity by 2030.\n\n---\n\n**Highlight**\nAchieved carbon neutrality since April 2020 by implementing energy efficiency initiatives, sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity for Apple facilities, and securing carbon offsets for the remaining corporate emissions.\n\n**Highlight**\nOver 45 percent emissions reduction since 2015 across our value chain.\n\n**Highlight**\nAs of March 2023, over 250 suppliers have committed to transitioning to 100 percent renewable electricity for their Apple production, with over 85 percent of Apple\u2019s direct spend for materials, manufacturing, and assembly of our products worldwide included in those commitments.\nOur approach\n\nClimate change continues to define the world around us in ways that impact our daily lives. Shifting weather patterns threaten the food we eat. Widespread wildfires and flooding devastate the communities we live in and the ecosystems we depend on. These dangers are felt around the globe and are developing at an unprecedented pace. The stakes are fundamental: Human rights like life, health, food, and an adequate standard of living face grave risks, disproportionately affecting low-income and historically marginalized communities. The worst, and potentially irreversible, impacts of climate change can be prevented with global, comprehensive, and immediate action.\n\nAs a large global company, we believe it\u2019s our responsibility to take strong, decisive, and inclusive steps to mitigate our impact on the climate. We\u2019re committed to achieving carbon neutrality across our entire value chain by 2030 \u2014 reducing emissions by 75 percent compared with 2015 and balancing the residual emissions with high-quality carbon removal. This means that our goal to be carbon neutral also extends to all our products. This goal is more aggressive than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s recommendation for global carbon neutrality within 20 years.8\n\nApple is also committed to working toward reaching a 90 percent reduction in emissions from our 2015 baseline by 2050. Attaining this deep decarbonization target will require a different focus and a collective, global effort. Entire industries and economies must decarbonize. And while reaching a 90 percent reduction in emissions is outside Apple\u2019s or any one company\u2019s control, Apple is committed to supporting action as part of this global shift: to push for better policies, invest in new technological innovations, and engage in new and expanded partnerships, both public and private.\n\nOur goals are ambitious \u2014 and they come with many challenges. But we\u2019ve already made progress by cutting emissions across our value chain by over 45 percent since 2015. We began by making the transition to sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity at our offices, retail stores, and data centers, which we achieved in 2018. And in 2020, we achieved carbon neutrality for our corporate emissions.9\n\nOur philosophy for achieving carbon neutrality follows these principles:\n\nCalculate our footprint across our value chain: Our responsibility extends beyond our direct operations to our product-related emissions. That\u2019s why we model our emissions across the entire life cycle of our products \u2014 including the sourcing of raw materials, manufacturing, shipping, product use, and end-of-life processing.10\n\nWe use the results of our detailed carbon accounting to adjust our 2030 Climate Roadmap, which lays out our plan to become carbon neutral.\n\nSet ambitious targets: Our plan to reach carbon neutrality by 2030 centers around our strategy to reduce emissions by 75 percent, relative to our 2015 carbon footprint. This reduction aligns with what current climate science shows is necessary to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C.11\n\nWe plan to invest in high-quality carbon removal projects to address the remaining emissions, prioritizing nature-based solutions. And by focusing on emissions reduction, we\u2019re tackling the transformative work of making low-carbon products.\n\nMatch solutions to sources: For each activity within our value chain, we seek out decarbonization actions that tie to the source of those emissions. For example, we\u2019ll look to reduce emissions from electricity by using renewable or low-carbon electricity and decrease emissions from transportation by using alternative fuels and lower-carbon modes of transport. By matching solutions to carbon sources, we\u2019ll do our part to help decarbonize the economy.\n\nMake environmental progress good for our business: We\u2019re proving every day that there doesn\u2019t need to be a trade-off between what\u2019s good for the planet and what\u2019s good for business. This means that we seek out climate solutions that are cost competitive, offer a financial return, benefit our customers, or achieve more than one of these outcomes. For example, we\u2019re working with investment managers who are creating investment funds for clean energy and nature-based carbon removal solutions, which aim to deliver both environmental benefits and financial returns. And when we design products to be energy efficient and use recycled content, we view these as product features that add value for our customers. By underpinning our climate strategy with strong business principles and innovation, we aim to harness the power of markets to replicate our solutions at scale, creating the impact necessary to meet global reduction targets.\nExplore all solutions: Reaching our 2030 carbon goal will require scaling proven solutions that are available today, as well as exploring the solutions of the future. This includes facilitating the development of new technologies, like direct carbon-free aluminum smelting, adopting novel financial approaches such as the Apple Restore Fund, advancing policies that support a low-carbon economy, and continuing to invest in research and development to enable decarbonizing our products by 2030.\n\nBe open: We\u2019re committed to disclosing our carbon footprint as well as our climate strategy and progress. By sharing our approach, we aim to send clear signals to others and invite them to work with us. We also hope to empower our peers in their pursuit of carbon neutrality and engage investors through financing options, such as green bonds. This means sharing both challenges and successes. Our annual Environmental Progress Reports, as well as our response to the global disclosure nonprofit CDP, provide details on our progress.\n\nSupport underrepresented communities: Low-income and historically marginalized communities too often bear the brunt of the effects of climate change. So we\u2019re pursuing ways to directly support these communities in our climate program \u2014 like with the Apple Impact Accelerator, which aims to bolster equity and foster opportunity for Black-, Hispanic/Latinx-, and Indigenous-owned businesses in the environmental sector. We\u2019re advocating for greater access to clean energy, and we\u2019re investing in renewable energy projects in emerging markets. And our carbon removal projects often benefit the livelihoods of local and Indigenous communities.\n\nOur 10-year Climate Roadmap addresses Apple\u2019s carbon footprint through five pillars:\n\n- **Low-carbon design**: Design products and manufacturing processes to be less carbon-intensive through thoughtful material selection, increased material efficiency, and greater product energy efficiency.\n- **Energy efficiency**: Increase energy efficiency at our facilities and in our supply chain by finding opportunities to reduce energy use, such as retrofitting outdated or inefficient equipment and systems.\n- **Clean electricity**: Transition our entire product value chain \u2014 including manufacturing and our customers\u2019 use of our products \u2014 to 100 percent clean electricity by 2030.\n- **Direct emissions abatement**: Reduce direct greenhouse gas emissions in our facilities and our supply chain through process innovation, emissions abatement, and moving away from fossil fuels.\n- **Carbon removal**: In parallel with our emissions reduction efforts, scale up investments in carbon removal projects, including nature-based solutions that protect and restore ecosystems around the world.\n\n>75 percent emissions reduction\n\n<25 percent of footprint\nApple\u2019s comprehensive carbon footprint\n\nThis past year, we\u2019ve continued our efforts to reduce Apple\u2019s emissions. In 2022, our environmental programs avoided over 28 million metric tons of emissions across all scopes. Initiatives that we\u2019ve been growing for years \u2014 like sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity for our facilities, transitioning suppliers to renewable energy, and using low-carbon materials in products \u2014 have yielded clear results. Thanks to this work, we\u2019re decoupling business growth from emissions: While our revenue has grown by over 68 percent since 2015, our gross emissions have decreased by over 45 percent.\n\nAvoided emissions\n\nGross emissions\n\nEmissions offset\n\nEmissions categories (% of gross emissions)\n\n<1% Direct emissions (Scope 1)\n\n<1% Electricity\u2020 (Scope 2)\n\n1% Business travel, commute, work from home, upstream impacts from scope 1 fuels, and third-party cloud services\u2021 (Scope 3)\n\n65% Product manufacturing (Scope 3)\n\n24% Product use (Scope 3)\n\n9% Product transport (Scope 3)\n\n<1% End-of-life product processes (Scope 3)\n\nCorporate footprint\n\nLow-carbon materials*: 7.8 million metric tons avoided\n\nUse of renewable electricity: 1.2 million metric tons avoided\n\nProduct footprint\n\nSupplier energy efficiency: 1.4 million metric tons avoided\n\nSupplier clean energy: 17.4 million metric tons avoided\n\nProduct use RECs: 0.2 million metric tons avoided\n\n* Low-carbon materials represents emissions savings from transitioning to recycled materials in our products, or use of low-carbon aluminum, as described on page 14.\n\u2020 Beginning in fiscal year 2022, we\u2019re including transmission and distribution losses as part of scope 3 emissions, which are matched with renewable electricity.\n\u2021 Beginning in fiscal year 2022, we\u2019re incorporating emissions associated with employees working from home as part of Apple\u2019s new hybrid work model, as well as emissions from third-party cloud services \u2014 the electricity from both of which is addressed using renewable energy.\nProgress toward net-zero emissions\n\nOur plan to become carbon neutral by 2030 centers around a 75 percent emissions reduction target compared with our 2015 footprint. We\u2019ve already reduced our gross carbon footprint by over 45 percent since 2015. And we plan to address residual emissions through high-quality carbon removals.\n\n### Historical emissions\n- **Gross emissions**\n- **Avoided emissions**\n- **Emissions offset/removal**\n- **Emissions range from modeling uncertainty**\n\n### Future emissions (illustrative only)**\n- **Projected gross emissions**\n- **Projected emissions offset/removal**\n\n---\n\n**Baseline year**\n- 2015\n- 2016\n- 2017\n- 2018\n- 2019\n- 2020\n- 2021\n- 2022\n- 2023\n- 2024\n- 2025\n- 2026\n- 2027\n- 2028\n- 2029\n- 2030\n\n| Year | Gross emissions | Carbon offsets/removal | Net emissions |\n|------|-----------------|------------------------|---------------|\n| 2015 | 38.4            | -                      | 38.4          |\n| 2016 | 29.5            | -                      | 29.5          |\n| 2017 | 27.5            | -                      | 27.5          |\n| 2018 | 25.2            | -                      | 25.2          |\n| 2019 | 25.1            | -                      | 25.1          |\n| 2020 | 22.6            | 0.1                    | 22.5          |\n| 2021 | 23.2            | 0.7                    | 22.5          |\n| 2022 | 20.6            | 0.3                    | 20.3          |\n| 2023 | 25.2            | -                      | 25.2          |\n| 2024 | 27.5            | -                      | 27.5          |\n| 2025 | 25.2            | -                      | 25.2          |\n| 2026 | 25.1            | -                      | 25.1          |\n| 2027 | 22.5            | -                      | 22.5          |\n| 2028 | 22.5            | -                      | 22.5          |\n| 2029 | 20.3            | -                      | 20.3          |\n| 2030 | 20.3            | -                      | 20.3          |\n\n(million metric tons CO\u2082e per fiscal year)\n\n---\n\n* Error bars: We\u2019re continuously refining our methodology to improve our carbon footprint estimate. But there\u2019s uncertainty inherent to modeling product-related carbon emissions, which we\u2019ve illustrated through error bars in this graphic.\n\n** Future emissions: Future emissions, including offsets and removals, are displayed as a linear trend to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2030. Actual future emissions will likely not be linear.\nCarbon neutrality for our corporate emissions\n\nSince April 2020, we\u2019ve been carbon neutral for our corporate operations, including direct emissions (scope 1); indirect emissions from purchased electricity, steam, heat, or cooling (scope 2); and emissions from business travel and employee commute (scope 3). In 2022, we expanded the scope 3 emissions we include in our corporate footprint and are now also carbon neutral for work from home, third-party cloud services, electricity transmission and distribution losses, and upstream impacts from scope 1 fuels. To reach neutrality, we focused on driving energy efficiency improvements and transitioning our facilities to 100 percent renewable electricity, which we achieved in 2018. These programs have reduced our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 67 percent since 2011, when we first began procuring renewable electricity, even as our business grew. We\u2019ve addressed the remaining scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions (for a total of 324,100 metric tons) by securing high-quality carbon credits from projects that protect and restore forests, wetlands, and grasslands.\n\nMeasuring our footprint\n\nWe account for our carbon footprint by following internationally recognized standards, like the World Resources Institute (WRI) Greenhouse Gas Protocol and ISO 14040/14044. For our corporate footprint, we calculate emissions based on consumption data when available; when it\u2019s not available, we rely on reasonable assumptions and methodologies to estimate emissions, which we revisit and improve on regularly. For our product hardware carbon footprint, we use a life cycle\u2013based approach. Apple-specific data drives many of our most critical calculations; in cases where that data isn\u2019t available, we rely on secondary sources, including industry averages. We continually refine our model to include new sources of product life cycle data \u2014 and offer a more accurate and transparent assessment of our footprint. Our comprehensive carbon footprint and our methodology are assessed by a third party each year to confirm accuracy and transparency (see Appendix D). Improving the accuracy of our carbon footprint is an ongoing process \u2014 as we learn more, we refine our carbon models and adjust our climate road map. We also regularly revisit the boundary of our footprint to best reflect our impact. For example, in 2022, we expanded our corporate footprint to include work from home emissions, third-party cloud services, electricity transmission and distribution losses, and upstream impacts from scope 1 fuels.\n\nEvaluating climate risks\n\nIn 2020, we conducted a climate scenario analysis to help us better understand the potential physical and transition effects of climate change. To align with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, we considered a range of future scenarios, including a scenario below 2\u00b0C. Our assessment had a global scope to capture all our corporate facilities \u2014 including offices, retail locations, and data centers \u2014 as well as 200 supplier facilities, based on spend. The analysis highlighted how our renewable energy program and carbon neutrality goals could contribute to our corporate resilience. It also provided environmental data that we considered when developing business strategies, including around supply chain diversification, and when safeguarding our global assets. The results of the scenario analysis contributed to a larger body of internal assessments on the physical and transition impacts of climate change on our business.\n\nCarbon neutrality for our corporate operations\n\nWe\u2019ve committed to managing regulatory, reputational, and market risks related to climate change. For more information on these climate-related risks and Apple\u2019s governance of these risks, read our CDP Climate Change 2022 submission (PDF).\n\nWe\u2019ve reduced corporate emissions through energy efficiency, renewable electricity, and low-carbon fuels, and we\u2019re applying carbon offsets to the remaining emissions.\n\nCarbon removals\n\n324,100 metric tons CO\u2082e\n\nHigh-quality carbon offset projects\n\nCorporate emissions\n\n(having already reduced scope 1 and 2 emissions by 67% since 2011*)\n\nScope 1 and 2\n58,220 metric tons CO\u2082e\n\nScope 3\n265,840 metric tons CO\u2082e\n\nOffices\nRetail stores\nData centers\nEmployee commute\nBusiness travel\nWork from home\n\n* We\u2019ve reduced corporate emissions through energy efficiency, renewable electricity, and low-carbon fuels, and we\u2019re applying carbon offsets to the remaining emissions.\nLow-carbon design\n\nEach Apple product represents an opportunity to reduce our carbon footprint \u2014 even small changes can yield significant results. Our carbon footprint helps us identify opportunities to reduce the carbon intensity of our product designs. We prioritize the materials and components that account for significant portions of our carbon emissions. This means that the choices we make product by product can scale toward reducing our overall footprint. These priorities inform our work to design for material efficiency and increased use of recycled and renewable materials.\n\nImproving material and manufacturing efficiency\n\nLess means more when it comes to our approach to materials and how we process them. Making our manufacturing processes more efficient creates less waste and helps us make the most of the materials we source. We\u2019re also working to design our products so that they require less material in the first place. Combined, these efforts help reduce emissions from transporting and processing materials. And as we progress toward our 2030 carbon neutrality goal, we continue to investigate new materials and new ways to manufacture efficiently.\n\nWe\u2019ve continued to improve the carbon efficiency of the integrated circuits that we use in our products \u2014 components we\u2019ve prioritized because they\u2019re carbon-intensive. Integrated circuits perform vital functions in electronic devices but require significant energy to manufacture. We also continued our work with the sustainable semiconductor technologies and systems research program of imec, a world-leading research and innovation hub in nanoelectronics and digital technologies, of which we were the first public company to join in October 2021. Our goal in collaborating is twofold: to improve the data associated with integrated circuit production, from end to end, and to use improved data and shared expertise to identify carbon reduction opportunities for the entire integrated circuits industry.\n\nAnd we keep investigating new opportunities for improved efficiency across our product manufacturing processes. In 2022, we continued to invest in research and development projects aimed at: creating less waste in processing materials, reducing machining time and associated energy use, more efficiently transforming material into the shapes we need, and maximizing recovery and reprocessing of manufacturing scrap. Once these improved processes are successfully developed, we plan to work with our suppliers as they deploy them at scale at our supplier facilities.\n\nUsing recycled materials to lower our product carbon footprint\n\nMaterials selection is another way to reduce the carbon footprint of our products. Our strategy is to transition to materials manufactured using low-carbon energy and recycled content. We\u2019ve prioritized the materials and components that make up a large part of our product carbon footprint to move us closer to our goal of product carbon neutrality. And to accelerate collective efforts, we signed on to the First Movers Coalition\u2019s near-zero emissions primary aluminum commitment for 2030 (see more on page 26).\n\nUndertaking a comprehensive life cycle analysis for the materials and components in our products led us to prioritizing low-carbon aluminum. In 2018, Apple created an aluminum alloy made of 100 percent recycled aluminum and a reduced carbon footprint.\nSwitching to recycled and low-carbon aluminum has decreased our carbon emissions associated with aluminum by 71 percent since 2015. Read more about how we plan to address emissions from our customers\u2019 use of Apple products on page 24.\n\nAluminum is a great example of Apple\u2019s comprehensive approach. We\u2019re transitioning to recycled content, and where we haven\u2019t yet, we\u2019re moving to low-carbon suppliers and technology innovations to further decarbonize. In 2015, aluminum represented over a quarter of our product manufacturing footprint. Since then, we\u2019ve continued to introduce 100 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosures of Apple products: All iPad models in our lineup use 100 percent recycled aluminum in their enclosures \u2014 joining Apple Watch Series 8, Apple Watch SE, MacBook Air, Mac mini, and the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro computers. In addition, the new Studio Display contains a 100 percent recycled aluminum stand, and the Mac Studio enclosure and Apple TV thermal module both contain 80 percent recycled aluminum. And with iPhone 14, we\u2019ve increased recycled content by using recycled CNC chips with Apple\u2019s strongest aluminum alloy for the first time.\n\nFor products shipped in 2022 that had enclosures made with primary aluminum, we prioritized the use of aluminum smelted using low-carbon sources of electricity rather than fossil fuels, for a lower carbon impact. We also shipped iPhone SE enclosures that contained ELYSIS aluminum, which was smelted without generating greenhouse gas emissions (see page 26 for more information).\n\nWe also continue to make progress in how we source recycled aluminum. Our first priority is to recover any of our own scrap at high quality. Then, to augment this, we look to other postindustrial and postconsumer sources for high-quality recycled aluminum, which emits less carbon than newly mined materials. And we\u2019re expanding our sourcing to include postconsumer recycled aluminum from building and construction scrap that meets the high standards that our products require. These emissions reduction efforts have reduced our aluminum-related emissions by 71 percent since 2015 and now represent less than 8 percent of our product manufacturing footprint, compared with 27 percent in 2015.\n\nIn 2022, we began shipping products with certified recycled steel and expanded our use of certified recycled gold \u2014 two materials that typically have significant carbon footprints. We introduced certified recycled steel for the first time in the MacBook Air with M2 chip, which has 90 percent recycled steel in the battery tray. And we significantly expanded the use of certified recycled gold in our products \u2014 from the gold plating on the main logic board on iPhone to other product main logic boards and flexible printed circuit boards \u2014 increasing recycled gold content from 1 percent in 2021 to approximately 4 percent across all product lines in 2022.\nDriving product energy efficiency\n\nProduct energy use accounts for 24 percent of our gross carbon footprint \u2014 and it has an impact on the individual energy use of each of our customers. This is why we\u2019ve set aggressive targets to reduce our products\u2019 energy usage. We approach this challenge in the earliest phases of design, taking a holistic view of each product \u2014 from how efficiently the software operates to the power requirements of individual components.\n\nWith each generation of products, we strive to improve energy efficiency. For example, the transition to Apple silicon on Mac devices continues to drive these improvements. The latest generation of our Pro chips is enabling more Mac devices to run with improved energy efficiency. For example, MacBook Pro with M2 Pro and M2 Max made significant progress in reducing energy use in 2022, and the new Apple TV 4K is designed to minimize its impact on the environment, using nearly 30 percent less power than the previous generation while achieving more powerful performance. The efficiency gains of the A15 Bionic chip eliminate the need for an internal fan, resulting in a more compact design and contributing to a 25 percent reduction in carbon footprint over the previous generation. Through our energy efficiency improvements, we\u2019ve cut overall product energy use across all major product lines by more than 70 percent since 2008. And Apple products are consistently rated by ENERGY STAR, which sets specifications that reflect the 25 percent most energy-efficient devices on the market. In 2022, all eligible Apple products received an ENERGY STAR rating for superior energy efficiency. They also met the requirements for EPEAT registration, another environmental rating system for electronic products, which considers energy efficiency and a number of other environmental topics.\n\nOver the course of a year, Mac Studio uses up to 1000 kilowatt-hours less energy than a high-end PC desktop.\n\nApple TV 4K is designed to use nearly 30 percent less power than the previous generation while achieving more powerful performance.\n\niPhone 14 uses 57 percent less energy than the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s requirements for battery charger systems.\nOur energy efficiency goals extend well beyond our products. We\u2019re focused on using less energy across our operations, beginning with how we design, operate, and maintain our facilities. And we continue these same efforts into our supply chain. Energy efficiency is also essential to meeting our 2030 carbon neutrality goal. So we track and monitor energy use across our operations and supply chain, conducting audits to find opportunities to work more efficiently. And we view our energy use holistically, from the point of design to the point of manufacture.\n\nOperating Apple facilities efficiently\n\nWhile our data centers, retail stores, and offices all use 100 percent renewable electricity, we are focused on reducing the energy we use in the first place. We consider natural gas and electricity usage at each of these types of sites \u2014 as well as research and development facilities \u2014 auditing how we perform and, when needed, using best practices for energy management to reduce our loads. And we tailor the design of new buildings to our occupants\u2019 and lab users\u2019 specific needs. This approach helps us use our facilities efficiently and productively.\n\nExisting buildings: There are significant opportunities to save energy in retrocommissioning buildings that Apple already occupies or operates, including energy-intensive facilities like data centers. We audit the performance of buildings around the world, and then deploy identified reduction measures. Retrocommissioning focuses on building controls to emphasize energy use reduction and operational efficiency. We are prioritizing reducing natural gas usage and replacing natural gas equipment with electrical equipment. While we\u2019ve already transitioned to renewable electricity for our facilities, minimizing natural gas is also an important element of working toward decarbonization. We are focused on reviewing and benchmarking our most natural gas-intensive buildings to look for reduction and fuel switching opportunities.\n\nData centers: Data centers are traditionally energy-intensive, requiring significant resources to cool the heat-generating equipment. That\u2019s why we\u2019re continuously monitoring and improving upon the controls for our cooling systems. This retrospective view often enables us to increase cooling capacity of our existing facility, thereby maximizing the amount of servers within our data center footprint.\n\nIn 2022, we further improved energy efficiency at data centers by deploying our own server design, developed with a focus on energy and computing efficiency, resulting in over 56.7 million kilowatt-hours per year in energy savings. This work builds on previous efficiency efforts in our data centers, including developing a specification requiring our servers to be powered by high-efficiency power supplies \u2014 exceeding even the efficiency requirements for ENERGY STAR certification \u2014 which was deployed to hundreds of thousands of servers in 2021, resulting in over 4 million kilowatt-hours per year in energy savings.\n\nNew facilities: When designing new facilities, we incorporate energy efficiency principles early in the process. We look at each location\u2019s conditions, planning for local temperature, humidity, and light. As each site becomes operational, we monitor how well we\u2019re performing and make needed adjustments. For example, in designing our new campus in Austin, we put in a water-cooled air-conditioning system, rather than air-cooled, because of its increased energy efficiency. At the same time, it was critical to consider the water stress of the area, therefore the cooling system will be supplied with recycled water, which will also be used for toilet flushing. The first phase of our work on the Austin campus is saving 5.7 million kilowatt-hours per year.\n\nApple\u2019s Reno data center, opened in 2012, takes advantage of the mild climate by cooling its servers with outside air whenever possible.\nRetail stores: In 2022, we were especially focused on our efficiency measures in European retail stores as the region navigated energy shortages. Beyond aligning with all mandates in place, we established a task force to exceed them, identifying and rolling out additional measures \u2014 related to LED lighting, temperature, and even keeping doors closed \u2014 in retail stores across the continent.\n\nMeasurement and accountability: Measurement is critical to maintaining building energy performance. We continue to develop our system of energy tracking and benchmarking, which includes data from utility meters that continuously monitor 15-minute electricity and daily natural gas energy consumption. This method helps us identify performance issues at our sites early. We can then take corrective action to restore building system efficiencies and actively manage our energy footprint.\n\nFinally, across Apple, \u201cenergy champions\u201d play an important role in achieving our efficiency outcomes. These employees sit in facilities roles across the company, proactively identifying opportunities for efficiencies and bringing their teams and colleagues along to put them in action.\n\nIn 2022, our energy efficiency program avoided 69.4 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, which includes savings from the efficient servers, and 161,000 therms of natural gas per year through adjustments made to 9.3 million square feet of new and existing buildings. Together, these new initiatives reduced total energy use by 4 percent in the targeted buildings (including data centers with high loads) and will avoid an additional 27,500 metric tons of CO\u2082e per year. Combined with ongoing energy savings from past years, we saved over 89,000 metric tons of CO\u2082e in 2022.\n\nImproving energy efficiency in our supply chain\n\nThe manufacturing of Apple products accounts for 65 percent of Apple\u2019s gross carbon footprint. To address this impact, we\u2019re collaborating closely with our suppliers to prioritize energy reductions as an important element of our strategy. Together, we work to use clean energy as efficiently as possible at every point in our supply chain, creating leaner, more efficient factories all over the world. The Supplier Energy Efficiency Program, launched in 2015, exists to help our suppliers optimize their energy use. Implementing energy efficiencies reduces the energy intensity of manufacturing, which translates to reduced carbon emissions.\n\nEnergy efficiency gains and subsequent carbon savings are often found at the facility level \u2014 for example, by replacing outdated and inefficient lighting and equipment or capturing waste heat for reuse. Honing manufacturing processes using smart controls and monitoring can also offer opportunities to complete the same work with less electricity.\n\nWe support our suppliers\u2019 energy efficiency projects by helping to identify optimization opportunities and design solutions through assessments, and providing extensive education and training opportunities that include technical assistance and connections to external funding for energy efficiency projects, which can be an obstacle to making improvements. As suppliers become more knowledgeable in this space, they become more able to tackle deeper decarbonization challenges.\n\nWe continue to expand the support we provide to suppliers as they build more energy-efficient systems, through new training and educational materials, and increased access to funding opportunities \u2014 like the Asia Green Fund, which Apple launched in 2019 to help provide energy efficiency expertise and finance capital-intensive energy efficiency projects. In 2022, $8.9 million of investments have been made in supplier efficiency projects using the Asia Green Fund.\n\nIn 2022, more than 100 supplier facilities participated in our energy efficiency program, achieving over 1.6 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity savings and about 2,039,000 MMbtu in additional energy savings, which together avoided over 1.3 million metric tons of CO\u2082e, representing a 17 percent increase since 2021.\nReducing energy use begins with measuring and understanding the carbon footprint of a business. Since 2019, as part of Apple\u2019s Supplier Code of Conduct, we\u2019ve required our suppliers to regularly identify sources of emissions, measure their scope 1 and scope 2 carbon emissions, and make this information available to Apple as needed. By understanding a supplier\u2019s carbon emission sources and quantity, we can provide resources that help the supplier create an action plan to decarbonize and maximize energy efficiency opportunities. Further, we empower our suppliers to utilize the trainings, resources, and tools provided through our programs to extend their efforts beyond Apple to their own supply chains and customers.\n\nApple has made significant progress in reducing emissions in our supply chain through work on energy efficiency and renewable energy (see page 22). At the same time, we\u2019ve set \u2014 and continue to advance \u2014 clear expectations for our suppliers on the decarbonization required to meet our 2030 goal in the years to come.\n\nIn October 2022, we urged our materials, manufacturing, and assembly partners to decarbonize their entire Apple footprint by 2030, including all their scope 1 and 2 emissions associated with Apple production. We\u2019ll evaluate our suppliers\u2019 work to decarbonize their Apple-related operations \u2014 including running on 100 percent renewable electricity \u2014 and we\u2019ll track yearly progress. Progress toward these goals will be a crucial part of the criteria we consider when awarding future business.\n\nAdditionally, we encourage suppliers to address the greenhouse gas emissions beyond their Apple production, prioritizing clean energy. To help suppliers meet their commitments and go even further, we offer a suite of free learning resources and trainings, and we work closely with our suppliers and local partners to identify effective solutions for renewable energy and carbon removal.\n\nOver 250 suppliers have committed to 100 percent renewable electricity for Apple production, as part of Apple\u2019s Clean Energy Program. Holmen Iggesund in Sweden (pictured) joined the program in 2023.\nClean electricity\n\nWe\u2019re at a pivotal moment in addressing climate change. Renewable energy is poised to replace fossil fuels as the future of electricity. Its adoption means cleaner air and lower carbon emissions. Apple has generated or sourced 100 percent renewable electricity for its corporate operations since 2018, and we\u2019re swiftly progressing toward transitioning our entire manufacturing supply chain and product use to 100 percent clean electricity, too.\n\nAs we grow, we continue to bring new renewable electricity projects online around the world. In the long term, we believe that these projects provide more cost-effective energy with less price volatility. Renewable electricity can offer a competitive advantage by providing power to our operations, as well as to those of our suppliers, with greater control over energy supply and reduced exposure to cost fluctuations. And supporting our suppliers to adopt renewable energy technologies helps put them in a unique position to drive environmental action in their respective regions and significant progress toward our goal of carbon neutrality by 2030.\n\nUltimately, we find ways to optimize energy use, and we seek renewable sources to supply that energy in support of our goal of 100 percent clean electricity across our operations, manufacturing supply chain, and charging of Apple products. With the renewable energy that we source, we aim to achieve positive impacts. Before we engage in an energy project, we consider its potential environmental and social impacts. When possible, we focus on creating new renewable electricity projects, going above and beyond what might be available on the local grid. We also follow stringent assurance standards to verify our clean energy projects.\n\nCreating new projects\nNew renewable electricity projects require investment \u2014 whether in the form of direct ownership, equity investments, or long-term power purchase agreements. In total, Apple-created renewable sources account for about 90 percent of the renewable electricity that our facilities use \u2014 currently around 1.5 gigawatts.\n\nApple-created projects include:\n\n- **Direct ownership** (~9 percent of Apple-created projects)\n  We build our own projects \u2014 including solar, biogas fuel cells, and low-impact hydro projects \u2014 to provide renewable electricity, where feasible.\n\n- **Equity investment** (~3 percent of Apple-created projects)\n  We invest capital in new solar PV or wind projects in some markets, matching the renewable energy generated with our energy use.\n\n- **Long-term renewable energy contracts** (~88 percent of Apple-created projects)\n  Through long-term power purchase agreements, virtual power purchase agreements, and other forms of long-term commitments, we help support new, local, and primarily solar PV and wind projects in line with our renewable energy-sourcing standards.\n\nMaintaining 100 percent renewable electricity for Apple facilities\n\nOur retail stores, data centers, and offices around the world currently source 100 percent renewable electricity. We\u2019re proud of this accomplishment \u2014 and as we grow, we\u2019re working diligently to maintain this benchmark. We\u2019ve focused our efforts to source renewables around several key pillars: creating new renewable energy projects, undertaking projects that deliver clear benefits to local communities, and supporting renewable energy innovations.\n\nAt 200-megawatts, the Montague Wind Power Facility in Oregon is one of Apple\u2019s largest renewable projects to date.\nApple-created projects, we directly purchase renewable electricity through available utility green energy programs (about 5 percent of our total corporate load in 2022). Colocation and distribution facility vendors supply about 3.2 percent of our total load of renewable energy. And in certain situations, we purchase Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). These RECs, which account for about 3.5 percent of our total load, share the same power grid as the Apple facility that they support, where available. These purchases are subject to the same standards as our Apple-created renewable energy projects. Appendix B provides additional details on Apple\u2019s renewable energy solutions.\n\nSupporting social impact\nWe launched our Power for Impact program in 2019 to help provide local communities with needed energy resources. With funding from Apple, local communities and organizations gain access to cost-effective energy. At the same time, Apple retains the projects\u2019 environmental attributes, benefiting the community, our company, and the environment. Apple is currently supporting 20 renewable electricity projects around the world, including in the Philippines, Thailand, and South Africa. Read more about Power for Impact on page 25.\n\nAdvancing renewable electricity through innovation\nWe\u2019ve continued to pursue innovations in how we create and use renewable electricity, including through investments in energy storage.\n\nTo help address the intermittency in renewable electricity production, we\u2019ve invested in utility-scale storage in California and in research on new energy storage technologies. The California Flats storage project \u2014 an industry-leading grid-scale battery energy storage system capable of storing 240 megawatt-hours of electricity \u2014 became operational in 2021. This project supports the 130-megawatt California Flats solar farm, which provides most of our renewable energy in California, by storing excess energy generated during the day and deploying it when it\u2019s most needed.\n\nWe\u2019re also continuing to support biological methanation research at Aarhus University, Denmark, which explores the production of synthetic methane for storage in the existing gas grid. In this process, bacteria consumes both hydrogen produced from excess renewable energy and captured carbon dioxide to produce methane, the principal component of natural gas. Methane produced from renewables is a versatile energy carrier that can be used as a fuel source in households, industry, and transportation.\nTransitioning our suppliers to renewable electricity\n\nThe electricity that our manufacturing suppliers use represents the largest single source of carbon emissions throughout our manufacturing supply chain. That\u2019s why our efforts to facilitate the transition of our entire supply chain to 100 percent renewable electricity are essential to reaching our 2030 goal of carbon neutrality. And the benefits extend beyond Apple. Suppliers are able to implement best practices in advocating for and procuring renewable energy across all their operations and to share them with their own partners. At the same time, transitioning to 100 percent renewable electricity presents challenges: technical and regulatory barriers, need for capital investment, and lack of awareness about where to find and access high-quality and cost-effective solutions.\n\nOur Supplier Clean Energy Program helps enable suppliers\u2019 transition to clean, renewable electricity through policy advocacy, providing information and access to renewable energy procurement options, and creating engagement opportunities with renewable energy experts. To cover emissions from suppliers that we don\u2019t contract with directly, we plan on investing in additional renewable electricity projects. To date, we\u2019ve directly invested in nearly 500 megawatts of solar and wind projects in China and Japan.\n\nAs of March 2023, over 250 suppliers making up over 85 percent of Apple\u2019s direct spend for materials, manufacturing, and assembly of our products worldwide have committed to using renewable electricity for their Apple production. In total, the Supplier Clean Energy Program now has over 20 gigawatts of clean energy commitments, of which nearly two-thirds are already operational.\n\nIn 2022, the 13.7 gigawatts of renewable energy procured by suppliers and online in Apple\u2019s supply chain generated 23.7 million megawatt-hours of clean energy, avoiding 17.4 million metric tons of carbon emissions \u2014 a 23 percent increase over 2021. Appendix C includes more information about which suppliers have joined Apple in transitioning to 100 percent renewable electricity.\n\nIn many cases, our suppliers are leading the way with the efforts they\u2019re undertaking. We work closely with our suppliers to identify innovative methods of creating and accessing cost-effective renewable energy. And we work together to break down barriers by advocating for clean energy\u2013friendly policies.\n\nHow suppliers are responding\n\nLong-standing energy policies and infrastructure that incentivize the use of fuels like coal can make it difficult to bring new renewable energy online in some regions, prompting some of our suppliers to rely on less impactful solutions, like one-time purchases of energy attribute certificates from existing renewable energy projects. These options represent an annual cost for buyers and offer no opportunity for cost savings or a return on investment. To overcome these challenges, suppliers are leveraging new purchasing methods, creating renewable energy businesses, and even participating in some of the world\u2019s largest and most innovative renewable energy deals. Suppliers are also adapting to changing renewable energy markets by finding new solutions, including first-of-their-kind procurement structures in specific regions that include more corporate procurement options.\n\nIn China, this includes the Green Power Trading Platform and cross-provincial power purchasing agreements that have provided suppliers with more options. South Korea has expanded its options for green power, including power purchase agreements and the ability to purchase renewable energy credits. Japan has also introduced new renewable energy options, including power purchase agreements and price-competitive nonfossil credits that have the potential to scale access to renewable energy across the market. While we\u2019ve seen progress in key markets, we continue to advocate for policies that enable renewable energy to compete fairly with fossil fuels, opening more avenues for our suppliers to make the transition (see page 29).\nHow we support our suppliers\n\nGalvanizing internal champions\nWe\u2019ve been able to quickly scale the Supplier Clean Energy Program by involving supplier-facing Apple employees. Apple employees are passionate about the environment and are driven to help meet our 2030 carbon neutrality goal. We empower supplier-facing Apple employees \u2014 those who often travel to supplier sites or have direct, consistent cadence with suppliers \u2014 with the tools they need to help speed a supplier\u2019s transition to 100 percent renewable electricity. This starts with data and transparency. We track the electricity use and renewable procurement of our suppliers, including those just beginning to learn about renewable electricity and others that are well on their way to using 100 percent renewable electricity, and we help them measure progress and gain access to solutions. We\u2019ve also created internal trainings and crafted a simple engagement process, backed by resources for both Apple employees and suppliers. By connecting our suppliers with resources and providing transparency on supplier progress, our teams are scaling impact across our supply chain.\n\nSupporting supplier capacity\nWe share the experience gained through our transition to 100 percent renewable electricity with our suppliers because knowledge empowers them to identify and pursue opportunities to decarbonize as their businesses evolve. For this reason, we invest heavily in providing education and training across our supply chain through platforms such as our Clean Energy Academy.\n\nMore than 170 supplier participants in China, Korea, Japan, and Vietnam participated in our Clean Energy Academies in 2022. The academies offer updates on available energy procurement options in suppliers\u2019 markets, help suppliers prepare to participate in upcoming renewable energy pilots, and provide guidance from local experts on implementation. This program supplements our Clean Energy Portal, which is available to all suppliers and provides training materials, resources, and country-specific information to guide suppliers in their transition to 100 percent renewable electricity. In 2022, we announced plans to donate these resources to create a first-of-its-kind public training platform that will be available to businesses across many different industries. This platform will give companies of all sizes \u2014 in Apple\u2019s supply chain and beyond \u2014 access to the resources and advocacy networks we\u2019ve cultivated for nearly a decade.\n\nWe also educate suppliers through advanced and customized trainings with leading experts. And we support the creation and growth of renewable energy industry associations that our suppliers can join to learn about local opportunities.\n\nExpanding access to renewable electricity\nTo support our suppliers\u2019 transition to renewable electricity, we help them find high-quality solutions so they can decide how best to address their specific needs. When we face barriers to accessing cost-effective clean electricity, we innovate. One such innovation, the China Clean Energy Fund, enables Apple and our suppliers to invest in clean energy. As of March 2023, the fund has invested in over 650 megawatts of renewable electricity projects, with nearly 100 percent of those investments online. We also connect suppliers with opportunities to buy renewable energy directly from project developers and utilities as those models emerge around the globe.\n\nAdvocating for policy change\nOur collective ability to procure and enable high-quality renewable energy is often influenced by local policies. Effective government policies and rules can remove significant barriers to low-carbon solutions and enable solutions to rapidly scale. We recognize that to transition to renewable energy effectively, clean energy investments need to make financial sense. But carbon-intensive energy sources, like coal and gas, often have an unfair price advantage because of explicit subsidies and the ignored costs of externalities, such as air pollution and carbon emissions. We\u2019re encouraging governments not to subsidize or expand carbon-intensive infrastructure that will inhibit competition and discourage the development of new technologies, like renewable energy and advanced energy storage technologies. We also encourage governments to keep pace with the speed of technological innovation, consider life cycle emissions of energy solutions, and support new energy solutions that effectively reduce global emissions.\n\nWe lend our voice and stand with other companies and NGOs to break down policy barriers to achieve thriving clean energy markets. Across regions where our suppliers operate, we engage with policy makers to support renewable energy that\u2019s cost-effective, accessible to companies, and sourced from high-quality projects with a material impact on local markets. For example, with RE100, an initiative that brings together the world\u2019s most influential businesses through commitments to use 100 percent renewable electricity, we\u2019ve identified country-level policy barriers to procuring renewable electricity. RE100 collates the challenges that member companies face and advocates for changes on our behalf. We also cofounded the Asia Clean Energy Coalition, which convenes a diverse coalition of leading renewables private sector actors to enact critical policy shifts in Asia that will enable a variety of corporate procurement options for renewable energy.\nClean energy projects\n\nAs we expand on our strategy to cover product use with clean electricity, we\u2019re considering a number of factors in selecting projects. In accordance with global greenhouse gas accounting standards, we\u2019ll match the electricity consumption of our products with 100 percent clean electricity on an annual basis. While we\u2019ll source the majority of our clean electricity from the region, we\u2019re maintaining geographic flexibility for a portion of the emissions so that we can target grids with higher carbon intensity. This approach allows us to balance focusing on areas where our customers use our products and maximizing the social and environmental benefits of additional renewable energy. For example, while California is a large market for Apple, we might build new renewable energy projects in other locations with lower clean energy percentages on their grids, where the same renewable energy capacity can have a more significant impact.\n\nAs a first phase of this work, we\u2019re working toward developing large-scale solar and wind projects in the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., we\u2019ve invested in the 320-megawatt 2300-acre IP Radian solar project in Brown County, Texas, and plans for additional projects in the U.S. are underway. In Europe, we plan to engage in projects that range between 30 and 300 megawatts, with an initial request for proposals issued in 2022.\n\nEngaging with our customers\n\nIn many places, electricity comes from clean sources like the sun or wind at certain times of the day. Customers play an important role in deciding when to pull electricity from the grid. We\u2019re building programs to make those decisions easier for customers. Clean Energy Charging, which became available in the United States in fall 2022 through iOS 16, enables customers to help decrease the carbon footprint of iPhone. The new feature looks at the sources of electricity during expected charge times, and it optimizes to reduce carbon by charging when the grid is using cleaner energy sources (learn more here).\n\nBeyond the work that we do on our products, we collaborate with others to continue advancing climate-smart decision-making for customers across their household energy usage, as well as for our employees and partners. As an example, Apple has joined the CoolClimate Network, a research partnership of the University of California, Berkeley, that motivates and empowers individuals and organizations to make low-carbon choices.\nPower for Impact is driven by the idea that access to clean energy creates opportunities within communities while benefiting our climate. Apple launched the initiative in 2019 to provide underresourced communities with renewable power while supporting economic growth and social impact.\n\nThe program funds clean energy projects that are mutually beneficial\u2014local communities and organizations get access to cost-effective energy, and Apple retains the environmental attributes of each project. We currently support 20 renewable projects around the world, including:\n\n**Colombia:** Apple helps bring a rooftop solar power system online at the Hospital Infantil Santa Ana. The money saved on energy bills will allow the hospital to purchase more equipment and medications. A rooftop solar installation at Ciudad Don Bosco, a nonprofit that provides educational and social services for underresourced youth, helps the group advance its sustainable development goals.\n\n**Democratic Republic of the Congo:** Apple provides access to renewable energy for the Malaika School, which empowers Congolese girls and their communities through education, agriculture, water projects, health outreach, sports, and vocational training. To support Malaika students and teachers, this solar initiative builds on other Apple collaborations, including virtual Today at Apple sessions on coding with Swift, photography, filmmaking, and design, as well as other events with Apple Retail teams and Diversity Network Associations.\n\n**Israel:** Apple supports the Nitzana Educational Eco-Village, a community for at-risk youth, with a 260-kilowatt solar system to help lower electricity costs. The savings help enhance educational experiences for youth from various backgrounds.\n\n**Nigeria:** A remote mini-grid project is under development to provide energy access to community members and replace fossil fuels for some businesses. Apple will also continue to support the development of a solar power system to serve primary healthcare centers in the state of Ondo, as well as 200 households in the surrounding region.\n\n**Philippines:** Apple helps fund an educational institution that provides scholarships to high-achieving, underresourced students by offsetting electricity expenses through a new rooftop solar installation in Bataan.\n\n**South Africa:** Apple will fund new rooftop solar installations at a vocational school and at a home for senior citizens. Along with the four operational projects, these installations will reduce electricity costs, and the savings will help fund operating costs and expand programs to support underserved groups. Apple will continue to bring electricity to over 3500 households that previously lacked access with local street lighting.\n\n**Thailand:** Apple helped establish a solar energy system to replace the use of polluting diesel fuel for a remote fishing village that relies on refrigerators to maintain the quality of its fish products. We increased local renewable energy production and battery storage to improve reliable access to electricity.\n\n**Vietnam:** Apple helps provide solar electricity for 20 schools around the country, and helps teach thousands of children about sustainable development and STEM.\n\n**Zambia:** A microgrid supported by Apple will provide power to hundreds of households that are currently without electricity. The project will reduce reliance and costs associated with imported diesel and gasoline for generators, and it will increase the amount of power available to community organizations and businesses.\n\nPower for Impact is expanding access to clean, affordable power in different parts of the world. Apple will continue to focus on uplifting communities as it pursues its environmental goals.\nDirect emissions abatement\n\nSome materials that are integral to our products result in significant emissions. The same is true for certain manufacturing processes and the transportation of our products. To address these emissions, we seek technological solutions and emissions abatement, and we\u2019re moving away from fossil fuels.\n\nRethinking how aluminum is made\n\nAs part of Apple\u2019s commitment to reduce our products\u2019 environmental impact through innovation, we\u2019ve partnered with aluminum companies and the governments of Canada and Quebec to invest in ELYSIS\u2014a joint venture to commercialize patented technology that eliminates direct greenhouse gas emissions from the traditional smelting process. This is a revolutionary advancement in the manufacturing of one of the world\u2019s most widely used metals. Since our collaboration began in 2018, we\u2019ve helped accelerate the development of this technology by facilitating the joint partnership and providing initial funding and ongoing technical support.\n\nIn 2022, Apple shipped iPhone SE devices using ELYSIS aluminum, building on the production of the 16-inch MacBook Pro. The commercial-purity aluminum used in these products is the first to be manufactured without creating any direct carbon emissions during the smelting process. Throughout the past year, ELYSIS has also continued to make progress within its industrial research and development center in Quebec\u2014enabling the venture to begin producing commercial-purity primary aluminum at industrial scale\u2014and continued construction of its larger commercial-scale prototype cells.\n\nAddressing fluorinated greenhouse gas emissions\n\nOne of the largest contributors of direct emissions in our supply chain is the use of fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-GHGs). F-GHGs are used in the electronics manufacturing of semiconductors and flat-panel displays, and they have global warming potentials that are thousands of times more than those of CO\u2082. We\u2019re partnering closely with key manufacturers as they work to prevent these gases from being released into the atmosphere. So while the use of F-GHGs in certain manufacturing processes today is difficult to avoid, emissions can be abated by switching to alternative input gases, by optimizing production processes to use and emit fewer F-GHGs, and by installing gas abatement tools.\n\nTransporting products\n\nTo transport our products from our manufacturers to our customers, we\u2019re shifting to shipping modes that are less carbon-intensive than air transport, such as by ocean, whenever possible. In 2022, we launched three new products\u2014Mac Studio, Studio Display, and AirPods (3rd generation)\u2014that leveraged ocean shipping by enabling an ocean supply chain from our manufacturers. On average, shipping an item by ocean instead of on an airplane reduces transportation-related emissions by 95 percent. We\u2019re also seeking out technical innovations for transport, including working with our suppliers to use alternative fuels and electric vehicles. For example, in Europe we piloted a heavy-duty truck fueled by hydrogen, an emerging low-carbon fuel for trucks that travel long distances. And we\u2019re continuing to evaluate carriers that offer carbon-neutral deliveries using electric vehicles, including e-bikes and e-cars. These innovations help reduce our impact in the communities where our customers purchase our products. And by preferring vendors that offer low-carbon options, we signal the value of these options to us and reward those driving decarbonization in their industry. We are also combining multiple products into one delivery when possible, reducing packaging and reducing emissions though efficiency on the last leg of the journey. At the same time, Apple is working to spur entirely new solutions, for example by supporting analyses by Carbon Direct identifying pathways for developing sustainable aviation fuels.\n\nImproving employee travel and commute\n\nAnd we\u2019re exploring ways to reduce our carbon footprint from employees commuting to work. For example, we\u2019re helping our employees transition away from single-occupancy vehicles through mass transit, coach services, and campus bicycles. To incentivize the use of electric vehicles, we offer more than 16,700 EV charging stations and 3,200 ports across our U.S.-based campuses. For the commute-related emissions that remain, we\u2019re applying high-quality offsets.\nCarbon removal\n\nOur 2030 Climate Roadmap aims to reduce our emissions by 75 percent compared with 2015 levels, as well as scale up carbon removal strategies to address the remaining emissions that we can\u2019t yet avoid. We\u2019re exploring a range of carbon removal solutions to do so, which is consistent with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s position that all pathways limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C require carbon removal for unavoidable emissions.26\n\nCarbon removal projects take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and store it in long-term carbon sinks, whether nature-based \u2014 like forests, wetlands, and grasslands \u2014 or geologically, in formations such as saline aquifers or other suitable geological sites. In addition to removing carbon, nature-based carbon removal projects also offer important ecological and social benefits, such as preserving biodiversity and enhancing the resilience of ecosystems while often providing economic development opportunities for local communities.\n\nInvesting in nature\n\nThe earth\u2019s trees, plants, and soils provide some of the greatest capabilities to remove and store carbon from the atmosphere. Carbon credits provide an opportunity to invest in these solutions, but carbon markets haven\u2019t yet scaled to remove the carbon needed to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. That\u2019s why we\u2019re expanding nature-based investments to support our goal of achieving carbon neutrality across our full product life cycle by 2030.\n\nIn 2021, we partnered with Conservation International and Goldman Sachs to launch the Restore Fund, which has closed over $100 million in projects that forecast to remove over one million metric tons of carbon starting in 2025. This fund is unique because it aims to change carbon removal from a cost to a potentially profitable investment. By creating a fund that generates both a financial return as well as real and measurable carbon impact, we aim to drive broader change \u2014 encouraging capital investment in carbon removal around the globe.\n\nThrough the first phase of the Restore Fund, we\u2019re working with forestry managers to create sustainably managed forests that are optimized for both carbon and wood production, creating revenue from timber and generating high-quality carbon credits. Photo credit: Arbano Advisors.\nThe first phase of our innovative fund has focused on blending responsible forestry practices with carbon removal. We\u2019re working with forestry managers to create sustainably managed forests that are optimized for both carbon and wood production in order to create revenue from timber and generate high-quality carbon credits. The projects also seek to maximize environmental impact, including carbon, hydrology, and habitat restoration. In October 2022, Apple announced three new projects through the Restore Fund. In partnership with Conservation International and Goldman Sachs, Apple has invested with three high-quality forestry managers in Brazil and Paraguay with the goal of restoring 150,000 acres of certified sustainable working forests and protecting around 100,000 acres of native forests, grasslands, and wetlands. Together, these initial forestry projects are forecast to remove one million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere starting in 2025.\n\nTo improve the accuracy of monitoring, reporting, and verification of the projects\u2019 carbon removal impact, Apple is deploying innovative remote sensing technologies using Space Intelligence\u2019s Carbon and Habitat Mapper and Upstream Tech\u2019s Lens. Using high-resolution satellite imagery from Maxar and other providers, this initiative enables us to view detailed habitat and forest carbon maps for our Restore Fund projects. Through our engagement with the MIT Climate & Sustainability Consortium, Apple is jointly funding research with PepsiCo and Cargill on improving the measurement of soil carbon in nature-based carbon removal projects. And Apple is separately exploring the use of LiDAR data using iPhone to improve field measurements of forest carbon.\n\nBased on our learnings with these projects and the growing global need for more nature-based solutions, Apple announced an expansion of the Restore Fund in 2023. Apple has committed additional funds \u2014 up to $200 million \u2014 that will be managed by Climate Asset Management, a joint venture between HSBC Asset Management and Polikarp. The commitment will support a broader portfolio of high-quality nature-based projects that scale up carbon removal while seeking to achieve a financial return on investment.\n\nThe expanded fund will target two types of investments: sustainable agriculture and other ecosystem assets, and a pipeline of landscape restoration projects that aim to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Together, this unique blended fund structure will continue to demonstrate that we can invest in high-quality nature-based projects to achieve both financial and carbon returns.\n\nIntegrity and a rigorous approach are central to how we designed the Restore Fund with our partners. The projects aim to become certified to international standards developed by organizations such as Verra, Gold Standard, the Climate, Community & Biodiversity Alliance (CCBA), and the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). Use of these international standards helps confirm that the carbon stored in forests is measured and reported to the highest standards and that projects have the most up-to-date safeguards in place. The projects we choose will also seek to have a positive impact on the livelihoods of local communities by bringing economic opportunities to often underserved rural economies. And we\u2019ll continue to focus on projects that protect lands with high conservation values.\n\nHigh-quality carbon offsets as an interim solution\n\nWe plan to reach our goal of becoming carbon neutral across our entire value chain by 2030, using a wide range of solutions at our disposal, prioritizing significant emissions reductions and long-term carbon removal initiatives like the Restore Fund. But as the projects in the Restore Fund come online, we\u2019re also working to address difficult-to-avoid emissions in the short term.\n\nWe\u2019ve been carbon neutral for our corporate emissions since April 2020. We started by reducing our corporate emissions through the use of 100 percent renewable electricity and energy efficiency efforts at our facilities. But emissions remain difficult to avoid in some activities \u2014 including the natural gas used in some of our buildings and emissions from business air travel and employee commute.\n\nFor the emissions we can\u2019t avoid, we use high-quality offsets as an interim solution. We\u2019re intentional about identifying avoided deforestation and removal projects that are of the highest standard and that achieve meaningful impact. We often originate our own projects working with a reputable partner, like Conservation International, or we carefully select projects from third-party certified registries. For more details about our purchases of carbon offsets, see Appendix A.\nThe scientific community has laid out a clear rationale for mitigating the impacts of climate change by reducing emissions \u2014 and they\u2019ve provided stark warnings for the consequences of inaction. In addition to strong actions by businesses and individuals, we need strong government policies that support a just climate transition. That\u2019s why Apple believes that advocating for strong climate policies is a core part of our climate strategy.\n\nApple has a long history of advocating for strong climate policies. And in 2022 Apple, joined by other companies, submitted an Amicus Brief, urging the Supreme Court to uphold the U.S. EPA\u2019s authority to regulate greenhouse gases from power plants.\n\nOur climate policy advocacy centers on the following principles:\n\n**Setting strong science-based targets**\nPolicy makers need to set strong science-based targets to reduce emissions in line with the Paris Agreement and limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\n**Rapidly decarbonizing through economy-wide and sectoral policies**\nRapid decarbonization requires every sector of the economy to adopt new zero-carbon technologies as fossil fuels phase out. We not only support economy-wide policies but also acknowledge that each sector responds to different signals and the maturity of technologies to decarbonize them isn\u2019t equal. Apple\u2019s advocacy for sectoral approaches includes these principles:\n\n- Promote economy-wide carbon pricing programs with strong interim and long-term targets and accountability mechanisms.\n- Advocate for policies that make it easier and more cost-effective to deploy renewable energy.\n- Support policies that promote energy efficiency across all sectors, including for manufactured goods.\n- Invest in mature and new zero-emission technologies to cut emissions, particularly in hard-to-decarbonize sectors.\n\n**Encouraging and enabling high-quality measurement and disclosure of emissions**\nGovernments should require that companies measure their emissions along the entire value chain and disclose those emissions publicly. Developing clear rules for disclosure across all scopes of emissions will create best practices, enhance the transparency and integrity of claims, and promote competitive innovation. Governments should align to have the same high-quality standards.\n\n**Ensuring high-quality solutions**\nGovernments should establish or oversee systems to track and verify renewable energy credits and carbon credits to avoid double-counting, to incentivize participation, and to ensure environmental integrity. These credits should be transparent and verified to provide confidence to the public, and they promote energy solutions that significantly reduce emissions, including consideration of the full value chain impact.\n\n**Centering equity and justice in climate solutions**\nClimate policies should support the development of the new green economy, with new job opportunities focused on advancing clean innovation. Equity should be a guiding principle of policies supporting this economy. Communities that have been disproportionately impacted by climate change should benefit from the economic opportunities of potential solutions.\n\n\u201c[We] believe that both corporate and regulatory action are necessary to prevent the worst impacts of climate change and have a strong interest in the implementation of sound public policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d\n\nBrief Amici Curiae of Apple et al., West Virginia vs EPA (2022).\nKey milestones in our climate policy advocacy\n\n2015 (U.S.): Apple joined the White House\u2019s American Business Act on Climate Pledge, in which participating companies voiced support for a strong outcome at the COP21 in Paris and demonstrated an ongoing commitment to climate action.\n\n2016 (U.S.): Apple joined Google, Microsoft, and Amazon to sign an Amicus Brief in support of the U.S. EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan.\n\n2016 (World): Apple addressed 700 senior government, business, and community leaders at the seventh Clean Energy Ministerial, where we called for governments across the world to put a price on carbon to address climate change.\n\n2017 (U.S.): Apple urged the White House to remain in the Paris Agreement and take meaningful action on climate change.\n\n2018 (U.S.): Apple filed individual comments to the U.S. EPA, urging it not to repeal the Clean Power Plan because of its importance in reducing emissions.\n\n2018 (Japan): Apple filed comments with the Japanese government, calling for the development of a robust and verifiable renewable energy trading system.\n\n2018 (U.S.): Apple filed comments to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, urging it not to finalize a rule that would subsidize fossil fuels, which would limit the ability of renewables to compete in the electricity market.

WE\u2019VE BEEN ACTIVELY ADVOCATING FOR STRONG CLIMATE POLICIES FOR MANY YEARS.\nResources\n\nIt takes recycled guts to reduce our footprint.\nGoals and progress\n\n**Goal**\nUse only recycled and renewable materials in our products and packaging, and enhance material recovery.\n\nIn 2022, **20 percent** of the material we shipped in our products came from **recycled or renewable sources**. We've accelerated our work through new commitments to transition to 100 percent recycled cobalt, tin, gold, and rare earth elements in select components by 2025.\n\n**Goal**\nEliminate plastics in our packaging by 2025.\n\nOur product packaging contains only **4 percent plastic** \u2014 down from 21 percent in 2015.\n\n**Goal**\nReduce water impacts in the manufacturing of our products, use of our services, and our facility operations.\n\nOur **Prineville, Reno, and Mesa data centers** and **27 supplier facilities** have been certified to the Alliance for Water Stewardship standard for leading water management practices.\n\n**Goal**\nEliminate waste sent to landfill from our corporate facilities and our suppliers.\n\nOur corporate facilities waste diversion rate increased to **73 percent**, driven by progress at our data centers.\nOur approach\n\nEach of our products and services is made possible by natural resources. We\u2019re committed to sourcing, using, and recycling the materials that we rely on in a way that meets our high standards for labor, human rights, and environmental stewardship.\n\nThis commitment extends across our operations and supply chain, so we use materials in a manner consistent with our values, we responsibly manage freshwater usage so that these resources will be available and safe for others in the community, and we work to eliminate waste at our facilities and those of our suppliers. This serves our objective to minimize the overall resource footprint supporting our products. And we know that we can\u2019t do this alone \u2014 it requires collaborative stewardship of shared resources.\n\nIn the future we envision, our products are made solely from responsibly sourced recycled and renewable materials \u2014 to our same rigorous standards of quality and durability. We aim to build durable, long-lasting products that make the best use of the resources required to make them. And recycling approaches and innovations make this achievable, helping us recover and use the materials that we rely on in our products to their full potential. We\u2019re working with leading recyclers and academic institutions to realize this future through researching new technologies and identifying the challenges and opportunities to achieve positive change across industries.\n\nWater is one of the most critical resources we need to build our products. It provides vital services at our offices, data centers, and stores \u2014 and it\u2019s essential to our manufacturing processes. Water is also a community resource. For this reason, we prioritize our stewardship efforts \u2014 working toward the most efficient use of freshwater, using alternatives where possible, and managing our discharge responsibly. We also look beyond our facilities to the water basins where we operate. Through collaborations with local partners \u2014 including companies, NGOs, and government agencies \u2014 we\u2019re working together to improve the quality of the water that our communities rely on.\n\nAnother approach to conserving resources is by eliminating waste. We work to reuse and recycle across our operations and throughout our supply chain. We strive to eliminate waste where we and our suppliers operate. These efforts go beyond reducing the amount of waste that we generate. We\u2019re innovating approaches to reuse and working with local businesses to create new recycling opportunities.\n\nWe can move ahead only by working with others. When we collaborate with suppliers, NGOs, recyclers, community stakeholders, and innovation leaders, we can do more while relying on less \u2014 and reduce our overall carbon and material footprint.\n\nWithin resources, we focus on three main areas of impact:\n\n**MATERIALS**\nTransition to only recycled or renewable materials in our products and packaging, and maximize material efficiency, product longevity, and recovery.\n\n**WATER**\nReduce water impacts in the manufacturing of our products, use of our services, and our facility operations. At the same time, transition to alternative solutions, improve the quality of water that we discharge, and protect shared water resources.\n\n**ZERO WASTE**\nMinimize overall waste generated and eliminate waste sent to landfill from our manufacturing supply chain as well as corporate offices, data centers, and retail stores.\nMaterials\n\nWe\u2019re working toward a world where we create our products from, and where we contribute to, circular supply chains. This starts by building products that are circular by design and made from responsibly sourced recycled and renewable materials. This work will help us end reliance on mining, which is often both carbon-intensive and detrimental to the communities and ecosystems where it takes place.\n\nWe aim to create products that make greater use of circular supply chains that don\u2019t rely on mined resources. They do so while meeting our rigorous requirements for quality, durability, and performance. Part of what makes this possible are the recycling innovations we\u2019re developing to enhance material recovery. While these innovations support circular supply chains for Apple, we also hope our actions are inspiring others to follow.\n\nThis progress can impact those who buy our products, can influence the markets where we work, and can create change for broader global communities. These are the opportunities that drive us through the challenging work of creating circular supply chains.\n\nThe following three pillars define our approach to achieving circularity:\n\nSourcing and efficiency\nWe source recycled and renewable materials for our products and packaging, and we use these materials more efficiently. We also source the materials responsibly, whether from primary, recycled, or renewable sources.\n\nProduct longevity\nWe make the most of the materials we use by designing long-lasting products. We design durable hardware, leverage software updates to extend functionality, provide convenient access to safe and high-quality repair services, and direct devices and parts to be refurbished and reused.\n\nCollection and recovery\nWe improve how we collect end-of-life products and develop recycling innovations so that we and others can use old devices as raw material sources for the future.\n\nHow we pursue circularity for our products\n\nSourcing\nSource materials that are recycled and renewable\n\nRecovery\nRecover materials for use in new products\n\nEfficiency\nDesign efficiency into our products and manufacturing processes\n\nProduction\nMake products that last through durability, repair, and refurbishing\n\nThe source of the materials we rely on matters to us. We place a clear value on materials that don\u2019t deplete the earth\u2019s resources. As we move toward recycled and renewable content, we\u2019re joined in our efforts by many partners. We look forward to engaging with many others as part of a broader global transition. As we design new products, we continue to source materials responsibly and continue to use materials efficiently and safely.\nExpanding our use of recycled content\n\nOur progress on materials continued in 2022 as we\u2019ve moved closer to creating a circular supply chain for several materials. With tin, we first proved in 2017 that we could use 100 percent recycled tin for the solder on the main logic board (where the majority of tin is found) of iPhone 6s and in 2022, we\u2019re now using 100 percent recycled tin on many flexible printed circuit boards used across almost all newly launched products. This resulted in the total shipped recycled tin increasing to 38 percent across all product lines in 2022 \u2014 up from 30 percent in 2021. We took a similar approach with gold. Across all products, we expanded our use of certified recycled gold \u2014 from the gold plating on the main logic board on iPhone to other product main logic boards and flexible printed circuit boards \u2014 increasing certified recycled gold content to approximately 4 percent across all products that shipped in 2022 \u2014 up from just 1 percent in 2021. These and other innovations helped us increase our use of recycled and renewable content to 20 percent of all the material shipped in products in 2022.12\n\nWe\u2019ve also achieved several milestones with copper and zinc. For iPad models introduced in October 2022, we\u2019re using 100 percent recycled copper foil in the main logic board. For Mac Studio and Studio Display, we\u2019ve developed a brass alloy using 100 percent recycled copper and zinc for use in the AC inlet and cable prongs. Finally, since last year, we\u2019ve nearly doubled our use of recycled cobalt in batteries to 27 percent across iPhone, iPad, and Mac devices year over year, bringing the total recycled cobalt shipped in 2022 to 25 percent.13\n\nPrioritizing our efforts\n\nOur recycled and renewable efforts continue to focus on 14 materials that we\u2019ve prioritized based on a broad range of environmental, social, and supply chain impacts. (These are outlined in detail in our Material Impact Profiles white paper.14) Some of the materials prioritized through this process include lower-mass but higher-impact materials. Our priority materials include aluminum, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, lithium, paper, plastics, rare earth elements, steel, tantalum, tin, tungsten, and zinc, and they account for 87 percent of the total product mass shipped to our customers in 2022.15\n\nOur teams are overcoming many obstacles to creating closed loop supply chains, including material performance and traceability. This is possible through our work with a diverse group of partners. We\u2019ve been able to design a new, 100 percent recycled aluminum alloy that meets our rigorous performance standards. And we\u2019ve improved our ability to track key materials like batteries within our supply chain, end-to-end.\n\nBarriers to our progress remain \u2014 including challenges within our control and those outside Apple\u2019s direct influence. Addressing these requires a collective response. But through collaboration within the material space, we can achieve impact felt beyond our business. The supply chains we\u2019re helping create serve more than just our needs \u2014 they help promote the availability of competitively priced, quality recycled and renewable materials across geographies.\n\nMaintaining high standards for materials is an essential element of this work. Our recycled and renewable material specifications follow standards established by the international community.16 Through this process, we\u2019re able to confirm that a material has been recycled or comes from a renewable source \u2014 one that can continually produce without depleting the earth\u2019s resources.17 We approach materials from new sources with the same rigor, evaluating each for the safety of the materials\u2019 chemistry. This process allows us to scale our use of materials that are better for the environment and safe for use in our products.\n\nResponsible sourcing of materials\n\nThis diligence carries over to sourcing. We obtain our resources responsibly, regardless of whether we\u2019re using primary or recycled materials. This approach is a necessary complement to our environmental efforts \u2014 and it draws from the same reliance on international standards. Our standards for Responsible Sourcing of Materials are based on leading international guidance, including the United Nations\u2019 Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance. In 2022, 100 percent of the identified tin, tantalum, tungsten, gold (3TG), cobalt, and lithium smelters and refiners in Apple\u2019s supply chain completed recycled assessments to verify compliance with our standards, and to aid in identifying social, environmental, human rights, and governance risks. We also map other materials in our products such as mica, copper, graphite, and nickel, and, before production, evaluate suppliers of new materials for compliance with our requirements. We also continue to map, conduct additional due diligence, and facilitate independent third-party audits on other materials used in our products, such as graphite, nickel, and copper. As we build supply chains for recycled materials, we\u2019re also partnering with the smelters and refiners identified through this process.\n\nIndustry collaboration\n\nAs we focus on responsible sourcing and the use of recycled content, we continue to engage with multiple industry initiatives. These include our role on the steering committee of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI). This coalition is one of the most commonly used resources for companies \u2014 from a range of industries \u2014 that are working to address mineral sourcing issues in their supply chains. We are also a board member of the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE) and co-lead the electronics program. PACE is a global collaboration platform for public and private decision makers to share a vision, best practices, and innovations toward a circular economy. Apple is a co-champion of the First Movers Coalition for Aluminum, whose focus is to aggregate demand signals for ultra low carbon technologies and materials. We also collaborate with other industry organizations, including the Aluminum Stewardship Initiative, to promote transparency across supply chains and implement additional commodity-specific auditing and due diligence systems.\n\nUsing recycled and renewable materials helps lower our carbon footprint, moving us closer to our climate goals. To fulfill the transition to these materials, we\u2019re working with policy makers to support international standards that enable the use of these materials globally.\nOur transition to certified recycled materials by product line\n\nIn 2022, the average recycled content shipped in Apple products increased to 20 percent. We\u2019ve approached the work material by material, component by component, starting by introducing recycled content in one product and then expanding across Apple\u2019s product lines.\n\n| Material          | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|-------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Copper            |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Zinc              |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Steel             |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Gold              |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Tungsten*         |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Rare earth elements |    |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Aluminum          |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Tin               |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Plastic           |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n\nProducts launched by calendar year\n\n- All products launched in the calendar year include certified recycled content\n- Some products launched in the calendar year include certified recycled content\n- No products launched in the calendar year include certified recycled content\n- Recycled content not applicable*\n\n* Material is considered \u201cnot applicable\u201d if it\u2019s found only in small quantities dispersed across modules.\nProgress across our priority materials\n\nWe\u2019re making progress toward our goal of sourcing only recycled or renewable materials in our products: in 2022, 20 percent of the material we shipped in products came from recycled or renewable sources.37\n\nWe\u2019re also accelerating our ambition: We recently announced that by 2025, we plan to use 100 percent recycled cobalt in all Apple-designed batteries;38 100 percent recycled tin soldering and 100 percent recycled gold plating of all Apple-designed rigid and flexible printed circuit boards;39 and 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets across all products.40\n\nBelow is an overview of our progress across the 14 materials that we\u2019re prioritizing for recycled or renewable sourcing. As we work toward our goals, we\u2019ll continue to be open about the challenges that we encounter.\n\nKey challenges to developing circular supply chains include:\n\nTechnical properties\nThe properties of a recycled or renewable material may differ from the primary material. This needs to be accounted for during product design and manufacturing. For example, select recycled plastics differ in properties from other plastics. The composition of other recycled materials can also be impacted by some level of contamination during the recycling process.\n\nAvailability and access\nSupply of recycled and renewable materials can be constrained by the limited availability of scrap sources or production of renewable content. When supply exists in some locations around the world, new suppliers need to be incorporated into supply chains for the material to be accessed.\n\nSupply chains\nRecycled or renewable content may not be easily accessible on the market, requiring the development of new supply chains.\n\nTraceability\nInformation about the source of materials \u2014 whether mined, recycled, or renewable \u2014 might not be readily available.\n\nScale\nMaterials for a single component can come from hundreds of different material suppliers, representing an exponential increase in effort as we scale the use of high-quality recycled or renewable materials across components and products.\n\nRegulatory barriers\nTransboundary movement regulations \u2014 created to establish critically important community and environmental protections \u2014 can have the unintended consequence of inhibiting the ability to recover and move materials to best-in-class recyclers or refiners for use in new products. Read about our support of policies in our feature on circular economy policy that enable circular supply chains while improving social and environmental protections.\n\nWe\u2019re continuing to scale our new, 100 percent recycled aluminum alloy \u2014 which incorporates recycled content without compromising performance \u2014 across all products. Overall, in 2022, 67 percent of the aluminum we shipped came from recycled sources \u2014 up from 59 percent in 2021.41 Of the products introduced during this period, iPad Air (5th generation), Apple Watch Series 8, Apple Watch SE (2nd generation), and MacBook Air with M1 all contain 100 percent recycled aluminum in their enclosures. Apple Studio Display contains 100 percent recycled aluminum in the stand, and Apple TV 4K (3rd generation) contains 80 percent recycled aluminum in the thermal module. Because recycled aluminum can have 100% of the carbon footprint of aluminum from primary sources, this supports our pursuit of low-carbon design.42 Our recycled material comes from several sources, including scrap from the manufacture of Apple products and other postindustrial sources. And our product claims are supported by suppliers who have taken the additional step of getting their recycled content certified by an independent, third-party.\n\nIn 2022, 25 percent of the cobalt shipped in our products \u2014 nearly double the amount shipped in 2021 \u2014 came from certified recycled sources on a mass-balance basis, including both postindustrial scrap and post consumer scrap from end-of-life batteries. The cobalt from iPhone batteries disassembled by Daisy is being returned to the market, making the material available to others. And in 2023, Apple committed to using 100 percent recycled cobalt in all Apple-designed batteries by 2025.43\n\nElectronics applications require the use of high-performance copper. Yet even as challenges remain in identifying quality scrap sources, we\u2019re making progress. In March 2022, we introduced 100 percent recycled copper for the first time in any Apple product: Apple Studio Display and Mac Studio both use 100 percent recycled copper in the brass prongs of the power cord plug and AC inlet. We also continue testing 100 percent recycled copper in other applications to evaluate its technical properties and performance across product lines. Copper is also a key material in printed circuit boards. For iPad (10th generation), introduced in October 2022, we\u2019re using 100 percent recycled copper foil in the main logic board \u2014 Apple\u2019s first use of standalone recycled copper.\n\nRecycled sources are scarce for the quality of glass that we use in our products \u2014 and performance of the material is key to the durability of our final products. We\u2019re working hard to identify recycled content and incorporate it into the materials that we use to produce glass parts. The cover glass and back glass of all iPhone and iPad devices contain recycled glass. By incorporating quality scrap in our applications, we also help keep glass at its highest-purity use for future recovery.\n\n| Material | Key challenges | Progress |\n|----------|----------------|----------|\n| Aluminum | Regulatory barriers | We\u2019re continuing to scale our new, 100 percent recycled aluminum alloy \u2014 which incorporates recycled content without compromising performance \u2014 across all products. Overall, in 2022, 67 percent of the aluminum we shipped came from recycled sources \u2014 up from 59 percent in 2021.

The cover glass and back glass of all iPhone and iPad devices contain recycled glass. By incorporating quality scrap in our applications, we also help keep glass at its highest-purity use for future recovery. |\nIn 2021, iPhone 13 models were the first Apple devices to contain 100 percent certified recycled gold, used in the plating of the main logic board and wire of the front and rear cameras. In 2022, we expanded our use to the wire of every camera of iPhone 14 and to the plating of the printed circuit boards of all newly released Apple Watch models, to iPad Pro 11-inch (4th generation), and to AirPods Pro (3rd generation), increasing our use of recycled gold to about 4 percent in 2022 across all product lines \u2014 up from 1 percent in 2021. Because primary and secondary sources of gold are often commingled, to certify 100 percent recycled sources required pioneering industry-leading levels of traceability: we identified suppliers who were able to source and segregate recycled gold sources while meeting our due diligence requirements; then we elevated these suppliers as preferred vendors. This level of traceability helped us to build out a supply chain of exclusively certified recycled content. And in 2023, we committed to using 100 percent recycled gold plating in all Apple-designed rigid and flexible printed circuit boards by 2025.45 All gold in Apple products is responsibly sourced, whether it\u2019s primary or recycled. For more information, see our Conflict Minerals Report.\n\nWe\u2019re shifting toward recycled materials recovered from batteries as they become more viable and economical. We\u2019ve worked to identify sources of recycled content and test the performance of the recycled material to see if it meets our requirements \u2014 both at the material level and in its application in batteries. This rigorous evaluation is key to maintaining our products\u2019 performance as we transition to recycled content over the long term. In January 2023, Apple began using recycled lithium for the first time in some of our batteries for some products, and we\u2019re in the process of getting this material into high-performance material.\n\nWe use a broad range of plastics in hundreds of product components, from speakers to keycaps. Each plastic material has different performance requirements that we must maintain as we switch to recycled or renewable sources. And we continue to diligently pursue this effort. In 2022, we introduced more than 100 parts with an average of over 40 percent recycled plastic. These include the Apple Watch Ultra antenna lines on the housing, which use plastic from bottles that have been transformed into a stronger, higher-performance material.\n\nMore than 75 percent of the total rare earth elements that Apple shipped in products in 2022 came from certified recycled sources, a significant increase from 45 percent used in 2021. To reach this progress, we\u2019ve focused on rare earth elements used in magnet manufacturing \u2014 praseodymium, neodymium, terbium, and dysprosium \u2014 and worked with our supply chain to build circular supply paths for the rare earth elements. And we\u2019re featuring greater percentages of recycled rare earth element content across our latest devices: 100 percent in iPhone 14 and Apple Watch Series 8, 90 percent in iPhone 14 Pro Max and Apple Watch Ultra, and 98 percent in MacBook Air with M2. We\u2019ve also committed to using 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets across all products by 2025.46\n\nSince steel is a highly recycled material, we focus on keeping it in the highest-quality form possible, working to recover high-purity steel from our manufacturing scrap and our products at end of life. We\u2019re collaborating with our supply chain partners to expand the use of recycled content into components of our products. Scaling the use of recycled steel is a key challenge because there are multiple layers in the supply chain between the raw material and the many components that ultimately become part of our products. We\u2019re making progress in realigning these supply chains to use more recycled material. In June 2022, we introduced 90 percent recycled steel in the battery tray of MacBook Air with M1G \u2014 a first for Apple.\n\nWe continue to address the challenge of sourcing 100 percent recycled content at the quality we need for capacitors. We\u2019re actively investigating recovery approaches from end-of-life electronics to develop further use of this recycled material. Based on material recovery rates, our products may already contain some recycled tantalum. But, to reach our goal, we have to move beyond existing tantalum supply chains that mix primary and secondary content. This requires starting from the beginning by identifying new sources of quality tantalum scrap, then building incredible supply chains around exclusively recycled material so that we can verify to use in high quantities in our products.\n\nWithin, we began our efforts to use recycled material on the main logic board for iPhone 6s in 2017 and last year we expanded to many flexible printed circuit boards across many products. The result in our recycled tin use increasing to 38 percent on average across all product lines in 2022 \u2014 up from 30 percent in 2021. In 2023, we committed to using 100 percent recycled tin soldering in all Apple-designed rigid and flexible printed circuit boards by 2025.47 As we continue to scale use across even more components, we seek to engage an exponentially increasing number of suppliers in this effort.\n\nMore than 95 percent of the tungsten used in 2022 came from recycled sources, a significant milestone from prior years. In 2022, all released iPhone models feature 99 percent recycled tungsten across the entire device, and all released Apple Watch models feature 100 percent recycled tungsten across the entire device. And with the help of our disassembly robots, Daisy and Dave, and our recycling machines, Tai, the tungsten from our Taptic Engine can be recovered and recycled.\n\nWe continue to work to identify high-quality sources of recycled zinc. This is a challenge because the material is prone to accumulating impurities during the recycling process. Each source that we identify rigorously tested so that recycled materials meet our high performance standards. In March 2022, we introduced 100 percent recycled zinc for the first time in Studio Display and Mac Studio, which use it in the brass prongs of the power cord plug and AC inlet.\n\nHow we source materials:\n\nRecycled content\nCertified recycled content is sourced from recycled materials that have been independently verified by third parties to that standard that coincide with ISO 14021. We also account for recycled content that has been confirmed by suppliers but hasn\u2019t received third-party verification.\n\nResponsible sourcing\nApple\u2019s Responsible Sourcing of Materials Standard covers all primary and recycled materials. Our standard aligns with leading international standards, including the UN\u2019s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas.\nReducing plastic and waste through packaging innovation\n\nWe\u2019re closing in on our goal to eliminate plastics from our packaging by 2025. To get this far, we\u2019ve addressed many packaging components that typically rely on plastic, including large product trays, screen films, wraps, and foam cushioning, replacing each with fiber alternatives. We\u2019re now focusing on implementing innovative alternatives to the small uses of plastics across our packaging \u2014 like labels and lamination \u2014 which will help us address the remaining 4 percent of plastic in Apple\u2019s packaging footprint. At the same time, we\u2019re taking steps so that our packaging is recyclable and that the fiber we source comes from recycled sources or responsibly managed forests.\n\nImproving the recyclability of our packaging helps reduce our overall environmental footprint. In 2022, we released a number of products with over 95 percent fiber-based packaging, including iPhone 14 Pro, MacBook Air with M2, and iPad Air (5th generation). And this year, we\u2019ve continued this work with packaging innovations for iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Apple Watch to address the remaining plastic in the smaller parts of our packaging \u2014 labels and lamination.\n\nTo eliminate the need for labels on the latest iPhone models \u2014 iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro \u2014 we introduced digital printing directly on the back of boxes. We developed a custom high-resolution ultraviolet inkjet printer that can print on demand at the manufacturing facilities where iPhone is packaged. We estimate that eliminating the labels will avoid over 300 metric tons of plastic, over 150 metric tons of paper, and over 3700 metric tons of carbon emissions.\n\nWe\u2019re also working to eliminate plastic lamination from our packaging. In 2022, iPad Air (5th generation), iPad Pro, and Apple Watch Series 8 replaced the polypropylene plastic lamination used on boxes and packaging components with an overprint varnish. This varnish, which we developed with rigorous qualification over three years, makes packaging more recyclable while retaining the design and feel that our customers expect when first opening their product. It\u2019s also more efficient; the overprint varnish process requires a single step rather than the multiple steps needed previously. In 2022, this helped us avoid over 1100 metric tons of plastic and over 2400 metric tons of CO\u2082e.\n\nWe carefully developed our new overprint varnish to replace the polypropylene lamination while meeting rigorous quality standards for our packaging recyclability and aesthetic.\nWe're also working to improve the recyclability of our packaging. Apple's packaging design guidelines factor in packaging recyclability, requiring the use of fiber-based materials that can break back down to pulp as part of mixed-paper recycling streams, alongside materials like cereal boxes. These guidelines are supported by third-party assessments from firms \u2014 including Western Michigan University's Paper Pilot Plant and the U.S. Forest Service's Forest Products Laboratory \u2014 and we continue to monitor evolving international packaging standards.\n\nAs we eliminate plastic in our packaging, we continue to make sure that the wood fiber comes from responsible sources. Since 2017, all the wood fiber we use for our packaging comes from either recycled sources or responsibly managed forests. Through partnerships with The Conservation Fund and World Wildlife Fund, we've protected and improved forest management practices on more than one million acres of working forests in the U.S. and China. In 2022, these forests generated enough responsibly sourced fiber to balance all the virgin fiber in our packaging, while contributing to the global supply of responsibly sourced fiber.\n\nEach of these innovations has applications for our other products \u2014 and potential to eliminate plastics. We intend to implement these across our products to reach our goal of eliminating plastics in our packaging. For example, overprint varnish replaces the plastic lamination that accounts for approximately half the plastics remaining in our packaging.\n\nWe're also working to improve the recyclability of our packaging.

In 2022, only 4 percent of our packaging footprint was from plastic, and 66 percent came from recycled fiber. Since 2017, 100 percent of the virgin wood fiber in our packaging has come from responsible sources.\n\n| Year | Plastic | Responsibly sourced virgin fiber | Recycled fiber |\n|------|---------|---------------------------------|---------------|\n| 2015 | 172,000 | 21%                             | 31%           |\n| 2016 | 165,000 | 21%                             | 30%           |\n| 2017 | 169,000 | 14%                             | 30%           |\n| 2018 | 187,000 | 10%                             | 32%           |\n| 2019 | 189,000 | 8%                              | 33%           |\n| 2020 | 226,000 | 6%                              | 35%           |\n| 2021 | 257,000 | 4%                              | 33%           |\n| 2022 | 276,000 | 4%                              | 30%           |\n\n* Beginning in fiscal year 2022, we expanded our packaging goal boundary to better reflect our impact, resulting in an increase of about 36 percent of our total packaging mass, as reported here. We're now including retail bags, all finished goods boxes (including plastic content in labels and in-box documentation), packaging sent to our customers as part of Apple Trade In, AppleCare packaging for whole units and service modules (with the exception of plastics needed to protect items from electrostatic discharge), and secondary packaging of Apple products and accessories sold by Apple. Our goal boundary does not include the inks, coatings, or adhesives used in our packaging. In addition to our packaging footprint, we also calculate the fiber used at our corporate facilities. In fiscal year 2022, this number was 632 metric tons.\n\n** Beginning in fiscal year 2025, we plan to eliminate plastic from packaging. The boundary of Apple's packaging footprint reflects the boundary of our plastic elimination goal. It includes retail bags, all finished goods boxes (including plastic content in labels and in-box documentation), packaging sent to our customers as part of Apple Trade In, AppleCare packaging for whole units and service modules (with the exception of plastics needed to protect items from electrostatic discharge), and secondary packaging of Apple products and accessories sold by Apple. Our goal boundary does not include the inks, coatings, or adhesives used in our packaging. We plan to eliminate plastic from the packaging of refurbished products by 2027, since old product packaging designs are phased out.\n\n\u2020 Responsible sourcing of fiber is defined in Apple's Sustainable Fiber Specification (PDF).\nProduct longevity\n\nOur products are designed to last. Product longevity not only makes for a better customer experience but also is an important aspect of conserving Earth\u2019s finite resources and meeting our 2030 carbon neutrality goal. Our approach combines hardware designed to endure the rigors of everyday use, regular software updates that unlock new features and functionality, and \u2014 when needed \u2014 high-quality repair services.\n\nApple Trade In plays an important role in product longevity. Longer-lasting devices provide our customers with options to access the value of their current device through Apple Trade In or third-party programs. Customers can upgrade to the latest products using a credit according to their device\u2019s trade-in value. This also helps keep products in use for as long as possible so that new customers can experience Apple products and services with refurbished devices. Making more products and services available to more people is good for our business, and making those products last longer is better for the planet.\n\nProducts that are designed to last hold their value longer. iPhone, for example, has the slowest depreciation rate among the six leading smartphone manufacturers. And compared with flagship Android devices, iPhone holds an average of 30 percent more value over a four-year buy-back period. As of January 2023, iPhone 7, which was introduced in 2016, still had monetary value for Apple Trade In in the United States.\n\nWe\u2019re committed to building long-lasting devices, and part of achieving that is designing durable hardware. To minimize products\u2019 need for repair, we refine features that improve durability, like water resistance and Ceramic Shield, which protects the display on iPhone. And we provide regular software support, so customers can update their devices to the most recent operating systems and unlock the latest features and functionality years after purchase.\n\nWe\u2019ve also expanded access to safe, reliable, and secure repair services to meet our customers\u2019 needs. When products require repair, customers can more easily find repair options that work for them, such as Apple Authorized Service Providers, the Independent Repair Provider program, and, starting in 2022, Apple\u2019s Self Service Repair.\n\nBuilding products to last\n\nOur customers use our products every day. Which is why we design our devices with the rigors of continuous use in mind \u2014 and to minimize the interruptions of maintenance and repair.\n\nDurable hardware is central to our products. Engineers in our Reliability Testing Lab assess our designs against our strict durability standards that measure the performance of materials, components, and fully assembled products. They use testing methods that mimic realistic conditions in which our customers use their products, assessing many aspects of each device. In-depth user studies to understand how our customers use, and misuse, their products inform the durability standards that we\u2019ve established.\n\nDuring product development, we test numerous units of a product, relying on the results to inform each successive round of design. In 2022, Apple introduced Apple Watch Ultra, with a design developed for the highest level of durability to support the needs of our most adventurous and explorative customers. Apple Watch Ultra was designed for demanding conditions that required a series of new environmental and impact tests to maintain the device\u2019s high level of reliability. Tests that our engineering team developed included a random impact test to simulate bike falls, a gravel impact test to evaluate durability in rugged stone terrain, and additional environmental tests to support compliance with MIL-STD-810H \u2014 a standard used for military equipment that\u2019s also popular among rugged device manufacturers. This also included low-pressure testing to simulate a range of environmental conditions, from high altitude to extreme temperatures, temperature shock, chemical exposure, freezing and thawing, shock, vibration, submersion, and other assessments to emulate operations in rugged settings. Our engineers performed these tests in addition to other trusted reliability procedures developed through iteration across several generations of the Apple Watch product line.\n\niPhone retains its value over time*\n\n* According to the \u201c2021\u20132022\u2019s Phone Depreciation Report,\u201d published by BankMyCell, a website that tracks trade-in and resale value of technology products.\nImproving access to repairs\n\nWe design our products to be used daily with minimal need for repair. But if a repair is needed, customers should have easy access to convenient, quality repair services to get their product back up and running as quickly as possible.\n\nWe\u2019ve expanded our repair footprint in the past three years \u2014 nearly doubling the number of professional service locations that have access to genuine Apple parts, tools, and training. Repair options include Apple Store locations, Apple Authorized Service Providers, participating Independent Repair Providers, mail-in repair centers, onsite service, and Self Service Repair. This also includes more than 4000 Independent Repair Providers and a global network of more than 5000 Apple Authorized Service Providers, with more than 100,000 service technicians, that offer support for customers to get repairs.\n\nSince 2019, our Independent Repair Provider program has enabled independent repair businesses of all sizes to access genuine Apple parts, tools, diagnostics, and training. This program expanded from the U.S., Europe, and Canada to more than 200 countries worldwide. We also continue to expand coverage by offering repair service at our customers\u2019 homes and offices in select cities across the United States, providing greater convenience to our customers. We train and certify service personnel to repair Apple products. This helps them correctly diagnose the issue, leading to successful service and repair and preventing damage to the device so that it works as it should.\n\nIn 2022 we introduced Self Service Repair, providing individuals with access to repair manuals and genuine Apple parts and tools through the Apple Self Service Repair Store. Self Service Repair is available in the U.S. and Europe \u2014 including in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and the UK. The new online store offers more than 45 types of device repairs, intended to enable customers who are experienced with the complexities of repairing electronics to service certain iPhone models, MacBook and Mac computers, and displays themselves.\nDesigning products with repairability in mind\n\nWe continue to make progress designing more durable products and offering customers more repair options. At the same time, we\u2019re working to make repairs more accessible and affordable. iPhone, for example, has even more repairable modules than before, in addition to enhanced durability features and water resistance. iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus introduced an updated internal design that improved the repairability of the back glass and ease of access to internal components, making fixes easier. In the new internal design, the aluminum housing and back glass are no longer one enclosure, so repairs to the back glass don\u2019t require replacing the housing. The 13-inch MacBook Air with Retina display (2018) and later models also allow for battery replacement with a stretch-release adhesive, facilitating component access. And iPad mini (6th generation) and iPad Air (5th generation) now support the same unit battery replacement in select locations. We\u2019ve also expanded availability of repair parts in countries around the world to support vintage products for up to seven years. For example, a program for Mac notebooks makes battery replacement available for up to 10 years after the product was last distributed. For more information, refer to the support page about availability of service parts past warranty.\n\nKeeping products current with software updates\n\nFree software updates also support our product longevity goals. We provide these to enhance our customers\u2019 experience by allowing them to access the latest features available to their device for as long as possible. This includes important security and privacy updates. As we continually improve the operating systems that power our products, we also make sure that each software release runs seamlessly on all supported devices. Customers can benefit from the latest software updates whether they\u2019re using a brand-new device or one that\u2019s several generations older.\n\niOS 16, our most recent release, extends support back to iPhone 8 (2017). iPadOS 16 compatibility goes back to the fifth-generation iPad (2017), and macOS Ventura supports MacBook models from 2017 and later. The updates in each operating system make the latest capabilities \u2014 from Messages and the Lock Screen to Continuity features \u2014 available to a broad user base. These updates also provide more customers with access to the newest security and privacy features.\n\nSoftware updates are popular with our customers. By February 2023, more than 80 percent of all iPhone devices introduced in the last four years had updated to iOS 16, and iPadOS 16 was being used on 50 percent of devices introduced in the last four years. These continually high rates of adoption make it clear that our customers see value in software updates. We also offered customers using iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 the option to update only the security features on their device for a while \u2014 giving them more time, if they wanted it, to update the entire operating system.\n\nExtending the life of products and parts through refurbishment and reuse\n\nProducts that last longer make the best use of the resources that go into them. Refurbishing and reusing products helps lower the impact that each device has on the environment \u2014 including carbon intensity per year of life. We extend the life of our products by building them to serve more than one owner \u2014 enabling customers to exchange devices for an upgrade.\n\nWe collect devices for refurbishing and reuse through several programs, including Apple Trade In, the iPhone Upgrade Program, AppleCare, and our corporate Hardware Reuse Program. In 2022, we sent more than 12.1 million devices and accessories to new owners for reuse. The Apple Trade In program, available in 25 countries, provides customers with product end-of-life options \u2014 they can access the value of their current device if they upgrade to a newer model, or they can trade in their device for free.\n\nOur customers drive the success of our trade-in programs and those of third parties. Customers who use these options help realize the long-term value that we\u2019ve designed and built into our products \u2014 whether through trading or passing down their devices or by purchasing refurbished products. Each product that\u2019s refurbished and reused contributes to reducing our overall environmental footprint.\n\nSome device parts can also be reused. We\u2019re finding new ways to access these valuable components within our devices. After recovery, these parts can be used to replace existing components or repurposed in new creative applications. We continue to expand the number of parts that can be recovered and refurbished to our high quality and performance standards, and reused as replacements. This enables us to reduce the need to create spare parts as we repair devices. We also remain focused on innovation opportunities to reuse accessories sent for recycling. For example, we send collected power cables and adapters that still function to our final assembly sites, where they power products used on production lines.\niPhone longevity journey\n\n- Repairable at retail stores, Apple Authorized Service Providers, and central repair locations\n- Features to enhance durability\n\n2007\niPhone (1st generation)\n- SIM tray\n\n2010\niPhone 4\n- SIM tray\n- Battery\n- Haptics\n- Rear camera\n\n2016\niPhone 7\n- SIM tray\n- Battery\n- Haptics\n- Rear camera\n- Main logic board\n- Display\n  - Splash, water, and dust resistant: IP67*\n  - Sapphire crystal lens cover\n\n2017\niPhone X\n- SIM tray\n- Battery\n- Haptics\n- Rear camera\n- Main logic board\n- Display\n- Bottom speaker\n- Enclosure\n- TrueDepth camera\n  - Splash, water, and dust resistant: IP67*\n  - Sapphire crystal lens cover\n  - Surgical-grade stainless steel\n  - Ceramic Shield\n\n2021\niPhone 13\n- SIM tray\n- Battery\n- Haptics\n- Rear camera\n- Main logic board\n- Display\n- Bottom speaker\n- Top speaker\n- Enclosure\n- TrueDepth camera\n  - Splash, water, and dust resistant: IP68*\n  - Sapphire crystal lens cover\n  - Surgical-grade stainless steel\n  - Ceramic Shield\n\n2022\niPhone 14\n- SIM tray\n- Battery\n- Haptics\n- Rear camera\n- Main logic board\n- Display\n- Bottom speaker\n- Top speaker\n- Enclosure\n- Back glass**\n- TrueDepth camera\n  - Splash, water, and dust resistant: IP68*\n  - Sapphire crystal lens cover\n  - Surgical-grade stainless steel\n  - Ceramic Shield\n\n---\n\n* iPhone 7, iPhone X, iPhone 13 and iPhone 14 models are splash, water, and dust resistant and were tested under controlled laboratory conditions. iPhone 7 and iPhone X have a rating of IP67 under IEC standard 60529 (maximum depth of 1 meter up to 30 minutes). iPhone 14 has a rating of IP68 under IEC standard 60529 (maximum depth of 6 meters up to 30 minutes). Splash, water, and dust resistance are not permanent conditions and resistance might decrease as a result of normal wear. Do not attempt to charge a wet iPhone; refer to the user guide for cleaning and drying instructions. Liquid damage not covered under warranty.\n\n** Back glass repair is available for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus.\nProduct end of life\n\nEven after a product reaches the end of its life, the materials within it can serve the next generation of products. Each time that we effectively recover materials from end-of-life products, we enable circular supply chains \u2014 and make the best use of finite resources. This takes collaboration \u2014 with customers who trade in their products when they\u2019re done using them and with recyclers capable of recovering materials effectively from devices. This helps to reduce the need to mine new materials. It also saves the considerable energy expended in extracting and refining materials, driving down emissions and conserving resources.\n\nOptimizing recycling through partnerships and innovation\n\nOur recycling strategy is a key part of our efforts to create circular supply chains. We\u2019re working to make it easier for customers to recycle our products. We provide or participate in product take-back and recycling collection programs in 99 percent of the countries where we sell products. Our customers can trade in devices they\u2019re no longer using for reuse or recycling at retail locations and through recycling programs offered by local operators. They also have the option to do so online through platforms like Apple Trade In. In 2022, we directed more than 40,000 metric tons of electronic scrap globally to recycling with the help of customer and employee programs. Our customers play an important role in continuing the growth of these programs, and we encourage them to engage in these programs by returning devices after use.\n\nWe work with best-in-class recyclers to make sure we can maximize the potential of the recycling materials stream, as well as drive our efforts to close the loop on key materials. We define best-in-class recyclers as those capable of recovering materials at high rates, and doing so with the best environmental and safety performance. We verify recyclers\u2019 compliance with our Code and Standards through independent third-party assessments. In addition, we look for our recyclers to maintain regional leading certifications such as Weelabex, e-Stewards\u00ae, or R2.\n\nAs we expand our partnerships with recyclers across the globe, we\u2019re maintaining the rigorous standards that we require of all suppliers. We assess our recyclers regularly for compliance with labor and human rights, security, and environment, health, and safety (EHS) standards, regulations, and best practices. In 2022, we conducted 61 recycler assessments. We\u2019ve increasingly sought out specialty providers capable of handling specific material streams to increase the quantity and quality of materials, and we\u2019ve seen volumes handled by these suppliers grow by over 70 percent in 2022. This global footprint of recyclers also helps us build a more resilient recycling supply chain and innovate with more suppliers around the world.\n\nEducation and training can help us improve recovery rates from our products. We\u2019ve invested deeply in this because it provides recyclers with the information to improve efficiency, quality, and capacity. We work with recyclers to continue devising new recycling solutions that can be shared through training and ongoing support. We help these partners develop the ability to disassemble our products and recover as much material as possible while minimizing waste.\n\nIn 2022, we expanded our Apple Recycler Guides to include certain models of iPhone and the new Studio Display. These guides are developed by our engineering teams to help recyclers optimize recovery and make sure that the processes can be completed using tools and procedures available to a wide range of professional recyclers. The guides provide valuable insight into the recycling process, including recommendations for directing disassembled parts to the best downstream facilities for resource recovery. As we continue to improve material recovery through collaboration, we\u2019re increasing the availability of high-quality recycled content on the market for all.\n\nThrough the Apple Education Hub, part of our Supplier Employee Development Fund, we\u2019ve also supported efforts to improve recycling capacity, quality, and efficiency with our U.S.-based recycling suppliers with a lean manufacturing educational program. Embracing lean methodologies and management systems can bolster employee engagement, mitigate safety issues, and improve recycling economics.\nBeyond our programs around the world, we continue to explore ways to make e-scrap recycling even more convenient for our customers. Through our membership with Corporate Eco Forum (CEF), we\u2019ve collaborated with Amazon, Dell Technologies, Google, and Microsoft on a doorstop electronics waste recycling pilot program in the U.S. Launched in February 2022, it offers residents in the city of Denver, Colorado, direct pickup of e-waste from their homes upon request. This pilot will enable us to learn more about consumer behavior, with an ultimate goal of making recycling more convenient for users.\n\nWe\u2019re also continuing our partnership with Atea \u2014 a leading provider of IT infrastructure solutions in the Nordic and Baltic region \u2014 to collect end-of-life iPhone devices for recycling with our Daisy robot in the Netherlands. We encourage more of our customers around the world to engage with Apple to return end-of-life devices to us so that materials are returned to the circular economy. To learn more about our recycling programs, visit the Apple Recycling Programs web page.\n\nDeveloping new approaches to disassembly and recovery\n\nInnovation plays a key role in realizing the potential of recycling \u2014 not just for Apple products but throughout our industry. We continue to develop better, more efficient means of disassembling products that maximize material recovery while minimizing waste. Our Material Recovery Lab (MRL), an R2-certified facility in Austin, Texas, focuses on assessing the recyclability of our products, helping inform design decisions that support disassembly and recovery. The MRL\u2019s work has led the way in automated approaches to material recovery with our robots Daisy, Dave, and Taz.\n\nDaisy, our disassembly robot, is capable of quickly and skillfully taking apart 23 models of iPhone \u2014 including various models between iPhone 5 and iPhone 12 \u2014 into discrete components. This vital step helps improve material recovery and recycling and yields clear results. From just one metric ton of iPhone main logic boards, flexes, and camera modules recovered by Daisy, our recycling partner is capable of recovering the same amount of gold and copper as more than 2000 metric tons of mined rock.14 We hope other innovators follow suit. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued Apple five patents related to Daisy, and we\u2019re willing to license these to researchers and other electronics manufacturers that are developing their own disassembly processes.15\n\nDave, a robot specializing in disassembling the Taptic Engine, enables the recovery of rare earth magnets as well as tungsten and steel. Taz, which helps recycle modules by separating magnets containing rare earth elements from audio modules, is designed as an alternative to the conventional shredder that many recyclers rely on. While rare earth elements are typically lost in conventional shredders, Taz is designed to access these valuable materials, improving our overall recovery rate.\n\nWe\u2019re also developing new technologies at our Santa Clara Valley, California, asset recovery center that leverage automation and machine learning to facilitate recycling processes that typically require manual sorting, which can be time-intensive and error-prone. This work aims to create low-cost solutions that our suppliers can deploy to recover more materials, freeing up their employees for more complex tasks that can\u2019t be easily automated.\n\nThe benefits we\u2019re trying to achieve aren\u2019t strictly resource based. We\u2019re also working to improve the material handling efforts of demanufacturing. In 2022, we began deploying overhead projector-based augmented reality systems to recyclers. This system projects instructions for demanufacturing processes onto the work surface. This innovation is designed to further improve safety, productivity, and efficiency.\n\nDesigning for the next generation of recycling\n\nThe greatest opportunities for recycling are yet to come. We\u2019re committed to a long-term approach to recycling innovation, relying on and continually improving current approaches while nurturing new and emerging technologies. By fostering research and development, we can identify opportunities for transformative changes. We invest with this in mind. And we continue to support initiatives that set out to redefine disassembly and material recovery.\n\nWe\u2019re investing in recycling innovations that can have industry-wide impacts. For several years, we\u2019ve worked with Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Biobots Lab in the School of Computer Science\u2019s Robotics Institute to identify and disassemble e-scrap. This innovation has the potential to enable recyclers to recover the materials at a higher quality. The software from this project will be open source and available to others in the industry that are working to maximize the recovery of recyclable materials. We\u2019ve also worked with the lab to improve the accuracy of disassembly and the recovery of materials through X-ray imaging with RGB imaging. And we\u2019re optimizing our robots\u2019 abilities to handle objects and adjust to contact, enabling them to \u201cfeel\u201d by using high-frequency force feedback and machine learning. Through this work, we\u2019re driving toward developing truly intelligent disassembly technology.\nOur position on circular economy policy\n\nThe responsible use of natural resources is a critical part of Apple\u2019s environmental objectives. Extracting the materials that make up our products comes with significant environmental costs. We work to minimize these by using materials efficiently so that we can one day build all our products out of recycled or renewable materials. This circularity ambition is an integral part of our strategy to meet our goal of being fully carbon neutral in 2030, including across the lifetime use of our products.\n\nGlobal demand for electronics is increasing, and with it, so is the demand for the materials that make up those products. Awareness is growing of the finite nature of some of these resources, such as critical minerals or rare earth elements\u2014as well as of the complex, globally interrelated nature of the supply chains that electronics rely on. Circularly plays an important role in helping realize environmental benefits while building supply chain resilience. Policy can be part of the solution, helping transition from the older \u201ctake-make-dispose\u201d linear model to circular supply chains. This reflects changing technologies as well as current and future demands, making circular supply chains competitive with traditional, extractive ones.\n\nOver the last year, Apple has reached new milestones in our products and our efforts to demonstrate what\u2019s possible in circularity. We\u2019re aiming for even greater use of recycled content in our products. Our commitments include using 100 percent recycled cobalt\u2014a critical mineral\u2014in Apple-designed batteries and using 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets, both by 2025. And advancements in recycling technology help make this possible. For example, cobalt recovered from iPhone batteries disassembled by Daisy is returned to the market. And Taz\u2014which we developed as an alternative to traditional shredders for breaking down electronics\u2014enables us to recover even greater amounts of rare earth elements. This more efficient and economical approach makes these materials available to others beyond our supply chain.\n\nWe\u2019ve also expanded our Self Service Repair program from iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 to include MacBook Air and MacBook Pro notebooks with the M1 family of chips. This makes repair manuals and genuine Apple parts and tools available to customers through the Apple Self Service Repair Store. We continue to build, support, and participate in circular supply chains. But challenges remain to achieve fully circular electronics supply chains.\n\nPolicy can help accelerate progress. A thriving, responsible, circular economy supports critically important health, safety, and environmental protections. It can also enable closed loop supply chains to be cost and operationally competitive with linear models. Harmonized policies can remove barriers and drive the transition to circularity by meeting the following high-level objectives:\n\n- **Sourcing and recycling materials responsibly:**\n  - Policies should seek to improve strict labor, human rights, and environmental standards throughout recycled and primary materials supply chains.\n  - Circularity should be a priority for policies that aim to address sources of supply over new ways or locations for resource extraction. Recycling electronics will help unlock the valuable materials in those devices for reuse, reducing reliance on newly mined resources.\n\n- **Designing for longevity:**\n  - Policies should strive to maximize product longevity while minimizing environmental impact, by enabling the optimal balance between designing for reliability and ease of repair.\n  - Ecodesign policies are most effective in delivering environmental benefits when they\u2019re product-specific and globally aligned.\n\n- **Improving material recovery:**\n  - Support the development of efficient collection programs that engage customers, protect environmental and human health, and capture high volumes of electronics for reuse, repair, refurbishment, and recycling.\n  - Waste regulations should be consistent and harmonized across geographies, enabling efficient, commercially viable movement of materials. Such policies can drive maximum materials recovery, prevent downcycling, and help enable parity with newly mined resources while maintaining critical environmental and social protections.\n\n- **Improving recycling:**\n  - Incentivize the inclusion of recycled content in products by supporting the generation of increased, high-quality material supply, including improving waste collection and recycling infrastructure, the development of global waste treatment standards, and recycled content quality standards.\n  - Support the development of advanced electronics recycling facilities that can recover more types of resources, including materials that are difficult to recover or of lower value.\n\nApple is working to realize a circular economy through policy engagement and advocacy. Apple supports the ratification of the Basel Convention by the United States. This would help enable circular supply chains and address some current barriers to efficient materials recovery and reuse. The Basel Convention is the global regulatory framework guiding how some waste\u2014including electronics and e-scrap\u2014can be moved for recovery, recycling, and disposal. The convention provides critical environmental and social protections, especially against moving hazardous waste to geographies that lack the resources to manage it in an environmentally sound manner. Countries that have ratified the convention can move materials covered by the agreement among themselves, following the agreement\u2019s regulatory requirements.\n\nThe U.S. is one of a very small number of countries not party to the Basel Convention. This imposes restrictions on the movement of Basel-controlled wastes for recycling or resource recovery into or from the U.S. to nearly all other countries in the world, requiring specific trade agreements with another country. The U.S. ratifying the convention would unlock more efficient movement of material to high-quality electronics recycling facilities, helping scale circularity and the available supply of recycled material. It would also allow the U.S. to participate in the global conversation around how to protect communities and environmental health and create more efficient and effective circular supply chains.\nWater\n\nWater is among the planet\u2019s most precious resources. We consider the full life cycle of water as we bring our products and services to life. And we know that to protect this resource, we must go beyond our corporate footprint, across our supply chain and into the communities and watersheds where we operate.\n\nClimate change continues to impact global water resources \u2014 making freshwater increasingly scarce, flooding more frequent, and access more vulnerable. These effects can be felt in the communities where we and our suppliers operate, which is why we\u2019re committed to managing these resources responsibly. We can do so by reducing our freshwater withdrawals and returning clean water to the watershed. We can limit the use of freshwater. And, where appropriate, we can rely on alternative sources such as recycled water for functions like irrigation and cooling so that freshwater is available for people and ecosystems.\n\nWater quality is another challenge. We\u2019ve made it a priority to maintain the quality of the water that we use and discharge so that it will be suitable for its next use, contributing to the overall health of local watersheds.\n\nWater is a community resource, and it demands equitable distribution and access, which requires a collective approach to challenges and local solutions. This is why we\u2019re committed to engaging watershed stakeholders through supporting Alliance for Water Stewardship certifications for our suppliers and key corporate facilities, as well as by participating in local watershed management projects.\n\nWe aspire to advance water security in the places where we operate through actions that deliver on our guiding principles of improving availability, quality, and access. We\u2019ve aligned our approach across five strategic pillars: low-water design, site efficiency and conservation, site water stewardship, replenishment and nature-based solutions, and leadership and advocacy.\n\nThis strategy is informed by geographically specific insights. Resources like the World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas provide detailed insights on local watershed health, such as baseline water stress. Understanding that 37 percent of our corporate and supply chain water use is located in areas of high or extreme basin stress helps inform the prioritization of our efforts.\n\nWe continue to monitor and manage water use in our owned-and-operated facilities, and we go beyond the typical practice in our industry by further engaging with our suppliers across our manufacturing supply chain sites to better understand their water use. Only by considering impacts throughout the value chain can we achieve the water management goals that we\u2019ve set for ourselves.\n\nOur water strategy\n\n**LOW-WATER DESIGN**\nMinimize water impacts in the design of products, services, and sites.\n\n**SITE EFFICIENCY AND CONSERVATION**\nImprove the performance of existing sites and processes.\n\n**SITE WATER STEWARDSHIP**\nDemonstrate responsibility beyond our facilities through watershed level management.\n\n**REPLENISHMENT AND NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS**\nImprove water availability, quality, and access through regenerative approaches.\n\n**LEADERSHIP AND ADVOCACY**\nAdvance water management through policy, advocacy, and technology innovation.\nLow-water design\n\nWe approach low-water design by first focusing on site selection, conducting a water risk evaluation to determine whether a potential site is in a water-stressed area or not. We aim to avoid locating water-intensive processes in water-stressed locations, so we either use the results to select a more appropriate site where possible, or to mitigate the impact of our expected water use.\n\nThen, we look to systems and processes that use less water or reuse water, so that we can limit excess water consumption and, where possible, eliminate waste. We also design solutions to manage the quality of the water that we return to the watershed.\n\nIn our corporate operations, we discharge the majority of our wastewater to the sanitary sewer. Up to 44 percent of the water that we use at our corporate locations is discharged back into the local water system rather than consumed. We monitor the water quality from sites where we have an industrial wastewater discharge so that each location meets or exceeds local discharge requirements.\n\nOne example is our new Capstone campus in Austin, Texas, where we aim to achieve net-zero water use. To accomplish this, the campus will rely on an onsite wastewater reuse system, as well as condensate recovery and stormwater capture, limiting potable water use to potable purposes only. This effort will avoid 60 million gallons of freshwater use, relying instead on nonpotable water for cooling and toilet flushing. This cooling approach will also allow us to achieve 28 million kWh in energy savings annually at the location.\n\nIn our supply chain, a majority of water is used during manufacturing. For example, in 2019 we launched a pilot program at a manufacturing location in China as part of our anodizing improvement program with the aim of reducing, and eventually eliminating, potentially hazardous discharge as well as reducing water and chemical use. Anodizing is the most water-intensive process in the metal-finishing process of enclosures. As part of the pilot, we employed several water efficiency approaches, including using cascade and counterflow rinsing processes, which helped retain 75 to 85 percent of the water used during metal finishing. This process improvement has the potential to save millions of gallons of freshwater annually when applied at scale.\nWe track our corporate water use for our data centers, retail stores, distribution centers, and corporate offices.\n\n**Water use at corporate facilities**\n\nWe also capture rainwater and recover condensate as alternative water sources for use onsite.\n\n**Site efficiency and conservation**\n\nNext, we focus on identifying steps to use less freshwater in our existing operations. In particular, we prioritize regions where our efforts can immediately reduce stress on local watersheds. Our corporate and supplier sites rely on water for everything from sanitation and climate control to maintaining green spaces and manufacturing. At each point, we seek out efficiencies and approaches to reduce our freshwater use.\n\nOne challenge we\u2019ve committed to addressing is reducing water use, even as we grow in our corporate facilities. Separating growth from water use requires dedicated focus. In 2022, our facilities used about 1.5 billion gallons of water in our direct operations, a 9 percent increase from 2021. Some of this growth reflects the return to office from the COVID pandemic, but most of the increase was driven by corresponding growth in our data center cooling loads. We expect currently implemented improvements in water use effectiveness (WUE) and new dry cooling designs at our data centers to decouple water use from electricity use.\n\nLast year, alternative water sources accounted for about 10 percent of our total corporate water usage \u2014 primarily from municipal recycled water sources. At Apple locations in Texas, North Carolina, Ireland, Taiwan, and Japan, we used rainwater capture systems to source 3 million gallons of water, from our newly installed condensate recovery systems in Santa Clara Valley, Austin, and North Carolina, we captured 1.5 million gallons of condensate in 2022. Through our low-water design and site efficiency and conservation efforts, we saved 152 million gallons of freshwater in 2022 from projects implemented since 2017.\n\nThese efforts start at the local level. In Santa Clara Valley, California, where our corporate headquarters are located, we\u2019ve pursued water conservation across our landscaping efforts. This includes six new projects in 2022, saving 1.2 million gallons of water. We intend to expand this work to an additional 16 conservation projects in 2023.\n\nAt our data centers, we\u2019ve upgraded and replaced servers to reduce our cooling water usage by 60 million gallons annually. We\u2019ve also piloted a resin water treatment system that resulted in a 30 percent reduction in makeup water use and up to 60 percent reduction in discharge. Based on this success, we are implementing this technology at our data centers in Pineville, Oregon, and Mesa, Arizona. Additionally, we piloted a plant-based water treatment using sustainably harvested sphagnum moss at several data centers, helping eliminate the need for biocides and corrosion inhibitors. This system, which uses compostable, natural sphagnum moss to improve water quality, can further improve water savings. We implemented this at our Reno, Nevada, data center and have begun permanent installations in Maiden, North Carolina, and Mesa, Arizona.\n\nWe\u2019re also expanding our efforts to recover water that\u2019s otherwise wasted. Six new condensate recovery installations \u2014 including four in Santa Clara Valley and installations at our new Capstone campus in Austin, Texas, and at our Maiden, North Carolina, data center \u2014 harvest excess water from cooling systems to be redirected to cooling towers and for landscaping use that would otherwise be discharged.\n\nWe also require our suppliers to maintain the high standards for water discharge outlined in the Apple Supplier Code of Conduct. Through Apple\u2019s Clean Water Program, we help suppliers minimize process water impacts and adopt best practices in wastewater treatment. We make our expectations clear to our suppliers and help define operational approaches so that they have the support needed to achieve their optimal level of water efficiency and conservation. There\u2019s a clear business imperative to develop these practices, particularly in manufacturing and production where water is critical for power generation, cleaning, and cooling processes. Water scarcity around the world requires that we focus on shifting this program away from voluntary engagement. We\u2019re working to incorporate water requirements into our procurement decision-making so that supplier engagement scales faster.\n\nOur supply chain accounts for 99 percent of our total water footprint, based on our detailed water inventory. That\u2019s why we partner closely with our suppliers through our Clean Water Program. Since the program\u2019s launch in 2013, more than 234 participating supplier sites increased their average reuse rate to 42 percent and saved our suppliers 13 billion gallons of freshwater in 2022, for a total of over 63 billion gallons of water savings. These savings come from a range of initiatives, such as reuse of reclaimed water, upgrades to water-efficient equipment, and countercurrent rinse methods.\nSite water stewardship\n\nWe look beyond our operations and those of our suppliers to address shared water challenges. This involves engaging with the communities around our facilities for the protection of local watersheds. Since 2018, we\u2019ve partnered with the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) to advance the AWS Standard, the first global framework to measure responsible water stewardship across social, cultural, environmental, and economic criteria. In 2020, Apple joined the AWS board of trustees with the objective of highlighting water stewardship opportunities to our suppliers and promoting collective action on shared water challenges with the Information and Communications Technology sector.\n\nThrough AWS, we\u2019ve been able to certify facilities that meet the AWS Standard, considering benefits and recognizing impacts to local water catchments, communities, and ecosystems. Our Prineville, Oregon, data center was the first facility of its kind to receive AWS certification in 2021. In January 2023, our Reno, Nevada, and Mesa, Arizona, data centers also achieved AWS certification in 2021. In January 2023, our Reno, Nevada, data center was the first facility of its kind to receive AWS certification. In 2020, 17 of our supplier sites have achieved AWS certification. We are on track to certify all of our owned and operated data centers by 2025.\n\nSince 2018, 17 of our supplier sites have achieved certification for the AWS Standard, 15 of which achieved a Platinum rating \u2014 the highest score achievable within the AWS Framework. In January 2022, Suzhou Industrial Park \u2014 with the help of Apple and other partners \u2014 became the first industrial park in the world to earn the AWS certification.\n\nWe\u2019re also active in the communities where our facilities are located. In Prineville, we supported the Deschutes Land Trust in the protection of the Ochoco Preserve, which is situated at the confluence of the Ochoco and McKay creeks \u2014 a major salmon and steelhead trout habitat in the Crooked River basin. In Reno, Nevada, and the surrounding areas, we continue to partner with The Nature Conservancy for restoration and clean-up efforts of natural habitats along the Truckee River.\n\nReplenishment and nature-based solutions\n\nA key element to addressing water availability, quality, and access is replenishment efforts and nature-based approaches to restoring watersheds. Our goal is to replenish our corporate freshwater withdrawals in high stress locations. This work is underway with some key projects.\n\nIn partnership with the Bonneville Environmental Foundation, we\u2019re funding the removal of the invasive Arundo donax cane species in the San Fernando Valley area of the Los Angeles River watershed. This plant species monopolizes space, sunlight, and water, displacing wildlife and stressing local watersheds. This removal effort addresses water availability in the watershed that feeds the greater Los Angeles area and will deliver 55 million gallons of replenished water annually.\n\nIn 2018, we partnered with the City of Prineville to develop an aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) system. The ASR system pumps water during the winter off-peak months from the large aquifer that underlies Prineville, treats the water, and then conveys it uphill to a smaller local aquifer. In the summer, this stored water is pumped to meet our cooling needs so that our water usage doesn\u2019t affect city water supplies. This response to seasonal variability helps provide water security and drought resilience for the region.\n\nWe\u2019re also engaged with the Uptime Catalyst Facility in India, one of our key corporate locations with water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) challenges, to introduce an innovative performance-based program that allows clean, cold water to be more widely distributed and maintained. This will generate a volumetric water benefit annually, equivalent to our direct operations freshwater withdrawal in India.10\n\nLeadership and advocacy\n\nOur work on water affords us another opportunity: to lead with others and push for change across industries. We collaborate with groups, including AWS and the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), and speak to audiences that are in a position to impact their communities and industries. In May 2022, we addressed the AWS Global Water Stewardship Forum in Edinburgh to discuss our stewardship strategy supply chain. In October 2022, we addressed the RBA\u2019s annual conference in Santa Clara, California, with AWS to promote collective action on key catchment identification in the ICT sector in order to further accelerate supplier participation in water stewardship efforts, including supplier hubs in priority water basins.\n\nIn 2022, we partnered with Frank Water in India to develop and implement a water resource management plan through a community-based WASH grant that focuses on increasing water stewardship through improving decision making around water and climate resilience. Frank Water works alongside local partners so that safe water, sanitation, and hygiene are within reach for communities experiencing challenges in accessing water resources. And in 2023, we joined the UN Water Conference to speak to the importance of corporate leadership on water, emphasizing the importance of supply chain actions.\n\nWe also take positions on issues that matter to us and where we can try to make a difference. We\u2019re engaging with the development of the next phase of Volumetric Water Benefit Accounting methodology with the WR and others to further the replenishment and nature-based solutions industry.\nZero waste\n\nAll waste that gets sent to landfill comes with costs. These can be measured in the resources and emissions that go into discarded materials. And, too often, the most vulnerable communities around the world carry a disproportionate burden of these costs and others associated with waste disposal. We\u2019re working to change this by prioritizing waste-free operations at our own facilities as well as those of our manufacturing suppliers.\n\nReducing waste at our corporate facilities\n\nWe\u2019re reducing the amount of waste generated in our corporate operations and directing more to recycling programs \u2014 an effort that has continued since launching our Zero Waste Program in 2018. Initially we focused on U.S. campuses and retail locations. Since then, we\u2019ve grown in the U.S. and around the world while remaining committed to sending zero waste to landfill.\n\nIn 2022, recycling and composting efforts allowed us to achieve a waste diversion rate of 71 percent \u2014 up from 68 percent in 2021 \u2014 limiting landfill waste from our global operations to about 16,000 metric tons. Despite occupancy increases during our transition from COVID-related temporary closures, our overall waste generated remained low.\n\nWe haven\u2019t interrupted our efforts to make progress on waste diversion since achieving our first zero-waste certification, UL\u2019s Zero Waste to Landfill validation, in 2015 for our campus in Cork, Ireland. In 2023, our Taiwan Technology Center became the second Apple facility to receive the UL Solutions Zero Waste to Landfill validation. And our data center in Viborg, Denmark, became the third facility to receive TRUE certification in 2023, joining our data centers in Mesa, Arizona, and Prineville, Oregon. These facilities achieved TRUE Platinum, the highest certification level. TRUE recognizes facilities that divert more than 90 percent of waste for recycling, compost, or reuse. To accomplish this, we improved waste separation through infrastructure upgrades and moved away from single-use materials to reusable alternatives. These certifications also reflect efforts working and coordinating with local partners, from composters to specialty recyclers capable of handling specific waste streams, like plastic wraps and foams. By partnering with these providers, we\u2019re able to support the local economies engaging in recycling and composting as an alternative to municipal waste disposal programs.\n\nPromoting material reuse, composting, and waste diversion across our corporate and retail locations\n\nAs our company grows and changes, we\u2019ve prioritized finding opportunities to recycle construction and demolition waste. In 2022, we achieved a waste diversion rate of 83 percent \u2014 approximately 23,500 metric tons \u2014 from corporate office and data center construction and demolition projects through recycling and source separation efforts. We expanded source separation efforts for our corporate office and data center construction projects \u2014 from 7.2 percent participation in 2021 to 36 percent across projects in 2022. The locations using this approach saw a 10 percent higher overall diversion rate. An example of the effectiveness of source separation is our new office in Battersea Power Station in London, United Kingdom. Our team there achieved a 98 percent diversion rate of construction waste, including 300 tons of drywall, one-fifth of which was directed to agricultural uses such as mushroom cultivation and farming. The project reused timber onsite and donated key construction materials, including plasterboard, for local uses. The location also recycled personal protective equipment used during construction and build-out.\n\nIn 2023, our Viborg, Denmark, facility became the third to receive TRUE Platinum certification, which requires more than 90 percent of waste from a facility to be recycled, composted, or redirected for reuse.\nWe also focus on using less so that we reduce the waste to be recycled or sent to landfill. By identifying significant sources of waste \u2014 like packaging materials and commonly used equipment \u2014 and then working with our suppliers, we\u2019ve found bulk packaging solutions and recyclable and reusable alternatives. Across our data center sites, we\u2019re switching to reusable air filters. Previously, there were no off-the-shelf reusable air filters available for our application. In 2019, we partnered with an industry-leading automotive filtration and technology company to design a sustainable solution that met very specific design criteria for our data centers. And more than 38,000 reusable high-performance air filters \u2014 which are available for other companies to use \u2014 have been placed in Apple-managed facilities worldwide to date. By replacing disposable air filters with reusable ones, we avoid landfilling 25 tons of dirty filters each year. Further, the reusable air filters are more energy efficient, leading to 35 percent savings in fan energy use. And we intend to rely exclusively on reusable filters at data centers from here on out.\n\nWe\u2019re working to keep waste that\u2019s unavoidable out of landfills. This requires sorting items correctly to redirect waste to recycling and composting where possible. To enable this, we make clearly labeled containers available throughout our locations. For example, we\u2019re working to reduce contamination and increase recycling rates by continuing to roll out consolidated bins for recycling, composting, and landfill and by improving signage. We recycle paper, plastic, aluminum, and cardboard materials at most of our corporate and retail sites worldwide. And more than 450 of our corporate offices, retail stores, and data centers are participating in composting. We\u2019re also using technology to improve our diversion rates at corporate locations. At our offices in Santa Clara Valley and Culver City, California, we piloted waste sensor technology, a system that employs cameras and data collection within dumpsters to monitor contamination and increase diversion efficiency. The data provides collectors with accurate information on volume to inform scheduling of pickups and the use of appropriately sized hauling containers.\n\nWe remain committed to the safe and responsible management of hazardous waste. So that wastes are treated, recycled, or incinerated according to safety and environmental standards in the U.S., Apple performs audits of treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDFs), with 12 performed in 2022. We continually reevaluate the facilities used for disposal and management of hazardous and regulated wastes, working to assess disposal method, availability, economics, and sustainability.\n\nDriving solutions internally through communication, reporting, and education\n\nOur employees are one of our best resources in achieving our zero-waste goals. They play a critical role in reporting on waste and facilitating waste audits at our locations. We support these efforts with training, education, and access to resources. In 2022, we standardized waste reporting requirements across all our data centers and corporate offices and implemented a centralized dashboard system. Our retail auditing program examined 13 locations in North America, documenting the material characteristics of our waste. This data will allow for better assessment of our waste practices and opportunities to improve our approaches. We also launched site-specific zero-waste training for all Apple data centers. All new data center employees are now required to complete the site-specific zero-waste training and receive manager approval of completion. Finally, we\u2019ve standardized signage at our data centers with contextual signs for logistics and operations, as well as for office and administrative sites.\n\nTaking a zero-waste approach with our suppliers\n\nWe\u2019re committed to leaving no waste behind in the communities where we build our products. Our suppliers, recyclers, and waste solution providers are central to achieving this goal. We\u2019re working with them to eliminate waste from our manufacturing processes. Since we launched the Zero Waste Program for our manufacturing partners in 2015, we\u2019ve continued to make considerable progress. And this program has expanded to include more than 300 supplier facilities across 14 countries and regions.\n\nIn 2022, we shifted our Zero Waste Program from an opt-in effort for suppliers to a requirement as part of our Supplier Code of Conduct. This means that suppliers are now required to implement a systematic approach to identifying all sources of waste and characterizing each stream in the waste inventory, developing a program or solution to quantify and monitor their waste-to-landfill diversion rate, setting waste-minimization goals, and maintaining progress toward achieving zero waste to landfill. Our Zero Waste Program provides training and tools to help suppliers track their waste, set waste-minimization goals, and create improvement plans toward achieving zero waste for their operations.\n\nWe make available to all facilities participating in the program resources and guidance on how to reduce waste and then reuse, recycle, or compost the waste they do create. Suppliers at these locations can also access tools to improve waste management and, in some cases, onsite support. The program is making an impact: In 2022, suppliers redirected 523,000 metric tons of waste from landfills (up from 401,000 metric tons the previous year), bringing the total to 2.5 million metric tons since the program\u2019s inception \u2014 the equivalent of eliminating 3.1 million square meters of landfill space. Throughout 2022, 100 percent of established final assembly sites \u2014 including for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, AirPods, HomePod, Apple TV, and Beats \u2014 maintained zero-waste-to-landfill operations.11\n\nAnd we\u2019re working on the next challenge in achieving zero waste, which is a level deeper into the subassembly module suppliers who assemble the individual components that make up Apple products. The waste stream at this level is often more complex than final assembly sites, but we\u2019re making progress. This year, module suppliers \u2014 including core technology suppliers \u2014 that are participating in the Zero Waste Program increased by 50 percent. Eliminating landfill waste across these sites marks both a significant effort and an achievement, diverting more than 307,000 metric tons of waste from landfills.\nGetting to zero through innovation\n\nInnovation plays a significant role in advancing progress toward zero waste within our supply chain. We use novel recycling strategies and approaches to divert greater quantities of waste from landfill in our supplier facilities at even greater rates. But we also pursue material solutions to impact the waste streams coming into these facilities to simplify and maximize the recyclable content that our suppliers work with.\n\nWe\u2019ve partnered with our suppliers and local businesses to create new recycling options and develop opportunities for material reuse. Recycling and reuse provide environmental benefits and can help our suppliers increase material efficiency while reducing the costs associated with material waste. At final assembly supplier sites, more of our suppliers use the recyclable and reusable alternatives that we helped develop for key sources of waste. In particular, our Recyclable Protective Films (RPFs) that protect products during manufacturing are often mixed with paper tape, making it difficult to sort and divert from landfill to a recycling process. And in many cases, the plastic tape wasn\u2019t needed. We found that for 75 percent of the parts secured with plastic tape, paper tape could perform equally well. We then worked with an industry-leading tape producer with the technology to produce a strong, lower-cost paper alternative. This new paper tape alternative was put to use for 200 parts, eliminating 1200 metric tons of virgin plastic from our waste streams.\n\nAnother opportunity for waste reduction is to decrease the amount of plastic tape used on our production lines \u2014 and to develop a stronger paper tape that can act as an alternative. An audit of our production processes showed that the plastic tape used to secure parts before assembly is often mixed with paper tape, making it difficult to sort and divert from landfill to a recycling process. And in many cases, the plastic tape wasn\u2019t needed. We found that for 75 percent of the parts secured with plastic tape, paper tape could perform equally well. We then worked with an industry-leading tape producer with the technology to produce a strong, lower-cost paper alternative. This new paper tape alternative was put to use for 200 parts, eliminating 1200 metric tons of virgin plastic from our waste streams.\n\nEngaging with suppliers to reduce waste\n\nWe work closely with our suppliers to realize our zero-waste goals. This work faces a range of challenges, including a lack of access to recycling technologies, the absence of local infrastructure, and the lower value of recyclable material that impacts the economics of recycling. We engage with our suppliers to address these challenges through knowledge sharing. The Waste to Resource database that we designed provides access to available technologies and local recyclers that we\u2019ve collected from the suppliers that we work with. The database provides information on more than 1000 resources across more than 177 cities in China, Thailand, and Vietnam \u2014 a number that grows as we and our suppliers share valuable resources through the database. As more of our suppliers achieve their zero-waste goals, we\u2019re able to learn and share more information. We plan to make this resource public for the benefit of the entire electronics industry.\n\nReducing waste is an ongoing collaboration between us and our suppliers and recycling vendors. We\u2019re actively sharing best practices and innovative approaches to reduce waste, and we\u2019re matching our suppliers with capable recycling technologies that help eliminate waste throughout the process of manufacturing our products.\n\nOne example of this is a tool developed by Apple and UL Solutions, our partner that validates zero-waste efforts. The tool provides the first-ever supply chain zero-waste management system assurance program, which allows for third-party zero-waste verification at a systems level rather than at a site level. The assurance procedure has allowed us to accelerate the verification process significantly and establishes a new model that companies across industries can employ to verify zero-waste programs at scale. This streamlined approach has brought even more suppliers into our program, with more than 150 validated in 2022 \u2014 a 50 percent increase from the previous year.32\n\nWe also provide support for our suppliers in verifying their zero-waste efforts. The foundation of our Zero Waste Program since launch has been following the UL 2799 Zero Waste to Landfill Environmental Claim Validation Procedure (ECVP), which requires at least 90 percent diversion through methods other than waste-to-energy. Through this standard, our supplier facilities can certify against clear benchmarks for waste diversion, including Platinum, Gold, and Silver levels of verification. We\u2019ve spent the last seven years expanding this program throughout our supply chain, with suppliers in China, India, and Vietnam becoming UL validated. In 2022, Thailand joined that list when a local Apple supplier became the first in the country to receive UL 2799 ZWTL Gold validation. Since we switched from individual site verification to system-level verification, suppliers participating in the assurance program can easily apply their verification statements from UL. Following the switch, many suppliers maintained their individual certification for their own purposes.\nEach space that we build presents an opportunity to realize the type of world we\u2019d like to live in \u2014 one that\u2019s inclusive and accessible, reflects the value we place on creativity and innovation, and furthers our environmental goals. Whether we\u2019re constructing a data center or corporate office or restoring a historic site to house a retail outlet, we have an opportunity to advance our vision.\n\nOur environmental approach to design and construction adheres to industry-recognized best practices for green buildings that promote renewable energy, water conservation, energy efficiency, and responsible material sourcing. As of 2022, 100 of our corporate offices and data centers across the world are LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) or BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) certified. That number grows each year as we develop more than 17 million square feet of green building space globally.\n\nOur global footprint requires that we adapt to the needs of different locations and climates while pursuing our overall objectives. In 2022, four Apple sites in the U.S. and China earned LEED Gold certification. One example is for the construction of a corporate facility in California, where we achieved an 80 percent diversion rate for construction materials \u2014 15 percent more than the average diversion rate typically observed in this region \u2014 by separating the majority of recovered materials and sending them to local specialty recyclers. We sourced FSC-certified wood for 98 percent of the wood used in this project. And 50 percent of its structural materials were sourced from regional manufacturers, less than 500 miles away, minimizing material transport by using local suppliers.\n\nWe bring a similar environmental approach to our retail store development. In Vancouver, Canada, we reopened Apple Pacific Centre, nearly doubling the previous store\u2019s size while reimagining features and elements to incorporate the location as a creative hub for the community. The design drew from the local landscape and ecosystem, including a facade surrounded by 10 magnolia trees sourced from the Pacific Northwest. The store\u2019s exterior is framed by a living wall spanning more than 40 feet and featuring 144 species of locally sourced plants. Designed to stay lush throughout the year, the living wall promotes bee and insect habitats and naturally absorbs heat and traffic noise. Our new store in London, United Kingdom, Apple Brompton Road features a unique curved ceiling and 12 towering Sicilian ficus trees. Both spaces, like all Apple facilities, source 100 percent renewable electricity.\n\nEach Apple building needs to coexist with its environment while meeting our standards for human-centric design. We work hard to strike this balance and harness the creativity and innovation that these challenges demand.\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nProtecting those who make, use, and recycle our products by using safer materials.\nGoals and progress\n\n**Goal**\nAvoid exposure to chemicals that could be harmful to human health or the environment.\n\n**Goal**\nIntegrate smarter chemistry innovation into the way that we design and build our products.\n\n**Goal**\nDrive comprehensive reporting of chemicals used in our supply chain to make our products.\n\n**Highlight**\nWe performed toxicological assessments on **over 1300 materials** in 2022 to proactively evaluate and eliminate potentially harmful substances from our products.\n\n**Highlight**\nApple led the IPC task group that helped develop and publish a **new IPC industry standard** on the use of safer cleaners in 2022.\n\n**Highlight**\nWe\u2019ve included **over 47,000 materials** in our comprehensive material library.\nOur approach\n\nWe carefully consider the chemicals that we use in our products and manufacturing processes. These choices directly impact the safety, recyclability, and reuse of our products, which are key to truly circular supply chains.\n\nSmarter chemistry is our approach to identifying chemicals that best serve all our priorities, including safety, performance, and environmental impact. This supports our circular supply chain efforts by minimizing the recirculation of potentially harmful substances. Our efforts to remove potentially harmful chemicals from our products help create safer and healthier workplaces for our employees and suppliers, and safe products for people and the environment.\n\nOur approach to limiting potential chemical exposure in product manufacturing leverages the hierarchy of controls. The hierarchy of controls is a concept used to control hazard exposure and consists of five actions in order of preference: elimination, substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal protective equipment (PPE). Elimination and substitution are the most preferred forms of control. When no alternative is available to eliminate or substitute potential exposure, we rely on engineering and administrative controls to safeguard against it. As we focus on this for our manufacturing processes, we push our industry to do the same.\n\nWe\u2019ve taken the important initial step of accounting for the materials that we use, both in our products and in the processes to create them. This information helps us better protect the people who design, make, use, and recycle our devices. It also informs our efforts to protect the environment. We\u2019re working side by side with leading members of the scientific community, NGOs, and industry organizations to move forward, and we continue to push for the development and broad adoption of safer alternatives.\n\nOur approach involves proactively promoting the use of smarter materials and chemicals. This involves establishing safety requirements that often exceed local industry standards and empowering our suppliers to meet our guidelines. We also help suppliers source materials that are safer alternatives, which provide the necessary level of performance and are also better for people and the environment. We have created standards and programs to support these efforts, including the rigorous requirements defined in our Regulated Substances Specification (RSS) and the deep supply chain engagement through our Full Material Disclosure (FMD) and Chemical Safety Disclosure (CSD) programs. We also share what we\u2019ve learned in creating these systems with others in the industry\u2014and we push for change that can transform product manufacturing.\n\nAdvocacy and leadership are needed to make this happen. We\u2019re committed to providing both this role, pushing to broaden the use of safer and more sustainable materials based on smarter chemistry\u2014and working with our suppliers and material manufacturers to create alternatives that can help move our industry forward.\n\nOur smarter chemistry strategy\n\n**Mapping and Engagement**\nEngage our supply chain partners to comprehensively identify the chemicals in the materials used to make our products and the processes used to make them, allowing us to drive change that goes beyond what\u2019s required for regulatory compliance.\n\n**Assessment and Management**\nAssess the potential human health and environmental risks of chemicals to evaluate compliance with our requirements and inform product design.\n\n**Innovation**\nDrive the development and use of innovative materials that enable the creation of groundbreaking products and support industry-wide change.\nMapping and engagement\n\nWe\u2019re committed to creating products of the highest quality \u2014 and that commitment extends to the health and environmental impacts of everything we make. This begins with a clear understanding of the chemistries of the materials that go into our products. Through collaboration, we can build a comprehensive view of the chemicals in the materials that we use and drive improvements in how we make our products.\n\nSeveral Apple programs support these efforts. Our FMD program maps the materials and their chemistries in our products, while our CSD program tracks the materials used to manufacture our products. We drive our supply chain partners to collect in-depth information on the chemicals they use, including the purpose for their use, the amount consumed, and how the chemicals are being applied, stored, and handled. We also work closely with our partners to review the steps being taken to protect their employees.\n\nWe have criteria for the performance needs, environmental impact, and safety of the materials that we use. Our goal is to identify material chemistries that meet these standards. We examine the effects of material chemistries across a product\u2019s life \u2014 from design and manufacturing to the customer experience and, ultimately, recycling and recovery. Through early engagement and effective data collection, we\u2019re able to develop a comprehensive view of each material, and its chemistry, in support of our health and environmental goals.\n\nWe\u2019re leading in these efforts. With our partners, we\u2019re engaged in the work required to understand the chemical composition of the materials in our products, as well as the chemicals and materials used during manufacturing. Close collaboration with our partners allows us to account for the materials used across our supply chain. This information informs our decisions when it comes to health and environmental risks. The way that we effectively collaborate with our partners can help others in our industry take their own steps toward eliminating potentially harmful chemicals in their products and manufacturing processes. This progress across our industry supports our effort to build responsible circular economies at scale.\n\nBuilding a comprehensive view of the materials in our products\n\nGood data is fundamental to delivering safer products. We rely on detailed and comprehensive information to inform our decision-making on material chemistries. The FMD program, launched six years ago, is integral to this process. It aims to catalog and map each chemical in the materials used in our products. Material manufacturers are at the center of these efforts. They provide thorough reporting on material compositions from deep within our supply chain \u2014 proprietary data that\u2019s shared through our innovative and secure data collection system. This system enables us to make informed choices about the materials that are used. For iPhone, iPad, and Mac products released in 2022, we collected detailed chemical information of 91 percent of each product by mass, on average. For the Apple Studio Display, we collected information on more than 93 percent of the product by mass.\n\nOur suppliers are required to participate in the program. Collectively, they share information on thousands of materials used to manufacture our products. To make this process easier, we\u2019ve implemented an advanced collection system for suppliers with access to a library of more than 47,000 materials, which have been researched and validated by Apple. Our suppliers use this materials library to select the materials they use in our products. If a material that our supplier uses isn\u2019t yet listed in our library, we authenticate the new material with documentation from the manufacturer that provides it.\n\nSmarter chemistry matters at EVERY STAGE\n\nPRODUCT DESIGN\nApple uses our Regulated Substance Specification to drive our internal teams and supply chain partners to select materials that meet our requirements.\n\nRECYCLING\nRecyclers can recover materials that are safer for use in new products.\n\nMANUFACTURING\nApple requires suppliers to manage materials and chemicals and helps them switch to safer alternatives.\n\nPRODUCT USE\nCustomers use products made with smarter materials.\nThe FMD program includes tens of thousands of parts and assemblies across our product lines. We prioritize high volume materials and those that come under prolonged skin contact \u2014 for which we look closely at biocompatibility. The program helps address a challenge faced across our industry: the lack of visibility into the chemical composition of materials. To reduce potential toxicological risk and pursue opportunities to develop better chemistries, we need deep knowledge of the materials that are used. Through the program, we\u2019re able to identify these opportunities to improve and contribute to our health and environmental goals.\n\nThe comprehensive materials library helps inform decisions across our product life cycles. It drives better material selections by our supply chain partners through the RSS, and it provides a foundation for assessing the materials that we specify, how our products are manufactured, and, eventually, how they\u2019ll be recycled. We\u2019re using innovative approaches to this process, including machine learning to digitize data from chemical tests so this information can be more easily assessed. And we\u2019re finding ways to share this information by supporting the development of industry standards that will help encourage the exchange of data on materials. These efforts support our goals of improving the safety of our products and the broader electronics industry and beyond.\n\nUnderstanding chemical ingredients leads to better materials for Apple products.\n\nThrough the FMD program, Apple manufacturing partners share the materials used to manufacture Apple products. Apple works with material manufacturers to understand the chemistries of the materials to enable evaluation.\n\nData helps Apple suppliers manage chemicals and materials when making Apple products.\n\nInformation on how chemicals are used, how they\u2019re stored, and how employees are protected is shared with Apple by suppliers through our CSD program.\n\nCSD data informs and prioritizes supplier engagement, encouraging rigorous chemical management practices and adoption of safer alternatives.\n\nApple customers benefit from using products made with safer materials and chemicals.\n\nThe FMD and CSD programs help support the creation of best-in-class products in a responsible manner for our customers.\n\nCreating an inventory of chemicals used in manufacturing\n\nWe prioritize the health and safety of the people in our supply chain. The Apple Supplier Code of Conduct and Supplier Responsibility Standards outline our requirements for our suppliers in the areas of health and safety, labor and human rights, environment, ethics, and management systems. We also account for how chemicals are selected and managed within our supply chain \u2014 and the impact this can have on people working in our supply chain.\n\nDetailed and accurate information drives this process, including which chemicals our suppliers use as they make our products and how they store, handle, and consume each one. Through the CSD program, suppliers are required to provide this data as part of a rigorous disclosure process. With a detailed chemical inventory from our suppliers, we can support our supply chain partners in identifying risks and opportunities to implement safer alternatives.\n\nIn 2022, more than 1000 supplier facilities shared their chemical inventories as well as their storage and control information through the CSD program, including suppliers representing the majority of Apple\u2019s direct spend. This extensive reporting provides direct insights into how our suppliers manage their chemical inventories and practices. And through this program, we\u2019ve identified more than 19,000 unique materials and chemicals used in manufacturing process. All these efforts contribute to a safer work environment for people across our supply chain.\nWorking with suppliers to meet global requirements\n\nWe\u2019re supporting our suppliers in their efforts to meet our requirements. And we\u2019ve created systems for our suppliers to learn about our material specifications, track and assess the materials they use, and regularly communicate material usage. This also helps our suppliers meet global standards and regulations governing their operations. The FMD and CSD programs require suppliers to gather, understand, and share information on materials they\u2019re using \u2014 a requirement beyond regulatory requirements.\n\nWe support supplier engagement with these programs \u2014 and the RSS \u2014 through ongoing training. This continued engagement is central to our partnership and to our shared efforts to promote smarter chemistry in our products and processes. Since 2020, our suppliers in China worked under the new regulations governing the use of materials containing volatile organic compounds (VOCs). And we went even further to support compliance by assessing and qualifying over 3500 low-VOC materials for use, helping our suppliers transition to these alternatives. In 2022, we continued to provide additional support for suppliers through trainings on the new regulations, which were attended by more than 800 participants. By deploying a VOC specification worldwide, we\u2019re also helping drive adoption of low-VOC alternatives around the world. And we\u2019re working with our suppliers to identify and develop materials that meet the current and upcoming complex per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) regulatory requirements.\n\nThese programs, along with the RSS, allow us to engage with suppliers through ongoing training. This fosters our partnerships and shared efforts to promote smarter chemistry in our products and processes.\n\nWe evaluate materials for substances restricted in our Regulated Substances Specification \u2014 including VOCs \u2014 using equipment like this gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) system.\nAssessment and management\n\nWe base key decisions on our product designs, manufacturing processes, and approaches to recycling and reuse on the data that we collect on chemicals and materials. This information enables us to establish requirements for our suppliers, including those set in our Regulated Substances Specification and our Restricted Chemicals for Prolonged Skin Contact Materials specification.\n\nOur requirements provide clear restrictions on potentially harmful materials and chemicals, including those that are restricted. Through our assessment system, we work so that only materials that meet our stringent requirements are used in Apple products. The data that we gather on chemicals and our rigorous assessments allow us to make informed decisions for chemical management, for the safety of those who use, make, and recycle our products. These decisions also help make the materials recovered from our products at end of life safer for reuse in new products, enabling circular supply chains.\n\nSetting and maintaining rigorous chemical safety requirements\n\nOver 20 years ago, we first published the Regulated Substances Specification, setting requirements for the use of chemicals or materials in our products, accessories, manufacturing processes, and packaging. The specification builds on our history of advancements in material safety \u2014 and it reflects our dedication to the collection of necessary data to uphold these requirements.\n\nWe continue to evolve the RSS with new chemicals and restrictions based on the latest scientific research and standards, drawing from regulations, international standards, and voluntary requirements. Many of the specification\u2019s restrictions exceed the most stringent local regulatory requirements in order to protect human health and the environment. The specification designates restricted substances and requires reporting on additional substances. We\u2019ve updated and expanded chemical restrictions that, in many instances, surpass current regulatory restrictions. Most recently, we\u2019ve added perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxA) \u2014 which is a subset of the larger group of PFAS \u2014 phenol, isopropylated, phosphate (3:1) (PIP 3:1), and several skin-sensitizing substances well ahead of regulatory restrictions.\n\nOur Green Chemistry Advisory Board provides feedback on key initiatives, including potential updates to the RSS. The advisory board is an independent group of leading researchers and academics. Their diverse experience and perspectives help us lead the way to protect our customers and those who make or recycle our products.\n\nWe remain focused on materials that will be in prolonged skin contact. We apply rigorous controls defined in our Restricted Chemicals for Prolonged Skin Contact Materials list. The restrictions focus on substances that are potential skin sensitizers to minimize the potential for reactions commonly reported across wearable products, like jewelry. These restrictions are derived from leading standards, recommendations from toxicologists and dermatologists, international laws and directives, and Apple policies. We mandate that our suppliers analyze each material that comes into prolonged contact with skin according to Apple\u2019s requirements, and we review compliance with these requirements. Our specifications are incorporated into contractual obligations for our suppliers, and each one helps us maintain our stringent requirements.\n\nWe test all our products, and place special attention on materials that come into prolonged skin contact. In this nickel leach test, we place Apple Watch bands in jars of artificial sweat to ensure the nickel, a potential allergen, stays where it belongs \u2014 in the product.\nVerifying and developing in the Environmental Testing Lab\n\nWe evaluate the safety of our products and materials through chemical analyses at our Environmental Testing Lab. Our chemists test materials to monitor compliance with our specifications. And the lab continues to grow in its mission and capacity as we expand our testing facilities with new technologies to conduct chemical analysis while expanding our FMD and CSD programs. Our teams also review test reports from suppliers to evaluate substances against the Regulated Substances Specification and Restricted Chemicals for Prolonged Skin Contact Materials specification. In 2022, we performed toxicological assessments on over 1300 new materials to proactively evaluate and eliminate potentially harmful substances from our products.\n\nThe data that we collect from our disclosure programs drives our assessments. We\u2019re able to generate comprehensive assessments like GreenScreen\u00ae, a methodology that we use to gauge the impact of chemicals on individual health and the environment based on 18 criteria. We develop toxicological profiles on new chemicals, using both scientific literature and internal assessments. These profiles detail the impacts of each chemical, providing data that allows us to evaluate the safety of the use of a substance in a particular product. In 2022, we continued to expand the scope of biocompatibility testing beyond individual materials to include modules and whole products. Through this work, we have an even more comprehensive view of each material and the impact that assembly has on safety. We perform toxicological analysis of the materials in our products to help guide our material safety guidelines. The information that we share through material specifications benefits our suppliers and those that we collaborate with in the industry.\n\nCreating a list of safer cleaners\n\nWe\u2019re making an immediate impact in our efforts to protect human health and the environment through our approach to the application of cleaners and degreasers. These substances account for some of the highest-use materials at final assembly sites. Regulators and environmental health and safety organizations have focused considerable attention on the chemistries of cleaners and degreasers. We\u2019re investing in the due diligence required to identify preferred alternatives for use by suppliers and others in the industry.\n\nWe now proactively provide our suppliers with a list of cleaners and degreasers that are safer to use. In 2022, we approved 58 safer cleaners for use in our supply chain, bringing the total number of safer cleaners we\u2019ve approved over the past three years to 133. Each of these cleaners has gone through a rigorous independent assessment against a comprehensive set of criteria.\n\nOur efforts have had a direct impact on health and safety \u2014 and they have the potential to change how our industry operates. We\u2019re promoting the use of safer alternatives for process chemicals in our supply chain by making it easier for suppliers to select preferred substitutions from the start. All our final assembly sites have used only safer alternative cleaners and degreasers, as defined by Apple, since 2018. We\u2019ve since expanded this work to the component manufacturers who create modules used in final assembly, helping them identify and implement opportunities to use safer alternatives in their operations. In 2020 and 2021, we received the EPA Safer Choice Partner of the Year Award for our work to scale the use of safer process chemicals and protect those working in our supply chain.\n\nWe\u2019re also looking outside our own supply chain to promote a broader transition to safer chemicals. See page 66 for more about how we\u2019re advocating for safer cleaners and degreasers across our industry.\nInnovation\n\nWe\u2019re continually developing our knowledge of material properties to improve the chemical safety, performance, and environmental impact of materials. These three factors drive our assessments of substances and help us pursue innovations that align with our values.\n\nThe foundation of these innovations is our work in mapping, assessing, and managing the chemicals used in our products and supply chain. We also look at how these materials are used in a product life cycle, from design and manufacturing to end of life. With this knowledge, we can seek out and support the development of safer chemistries that have an impact, and we can contribute to continually improving the overall safety of our products and processes.\n\nInnovating the designs and processes used to make our products\n\nBy focusing on materials early in product development, we create opportunities to innovate improvements throughout the process of creating a product. We assess materials for performance, safety, and environmental impact. These represent our holistic approach to smarter chemistry, allowing us to design for our customers\u2019 needs while creating products that exceed expectations and are safer for use, reuse, and recycling.\n\nTo achieve these goals, we focus on the process of material selection. This involves choosing the substances incorporated into our product designs and those that our suppliers use to manufacture our products. Our comprehensive chemical profiles of each material provide the basis for each decision. The FMD program documents material information \u2014 like composition \u2014 for review by our experts so that a substance\u2019s suitability meets our standards before it enters our supply chain. This includes toxicological assessments of each chemical in a material, focusing on those that come into prolonged contact with skin. Each design choice determines the materials included in our product and the chemicals required to make them. Through the CSD program, we look at the conditions in which a material is used so that we can make recommendations that reflect the existing controls around a substance. And we work proactively with our suppliers so that their employees are protected through proper storage, handling, and material application controls.\n\nOur work considers the impact of materials when our products reach their end of life. We take steps to prevent potential releases into the environment during the recycling process and to protect those involved in recycling our products. This involves monitoring chemistries that may be harmless in small quantities but become more concentrated through recycling processes. And it also entails assessing how potentially harmful substances impact the recyclability of a material to avoid downsizing \u2014 use of the material in lower-quality applications \u2014 or substances that could make the material unsafe for any use.\n\nWe also pursue innovation projects that lead to better products. In 2019, we launched a pilot program at a manufacturing location in China as part of our anodizing improvement program with the aim of reducing, and eventually eliminating, potentially hazardous discharge, as well as reducing water and chemical use. As part of the pilot, we employed several water efficiency approaches, including using cascade and counterflow rinsing processes, which helped retain 75 to 85 percent of the water used during metal finishing. This process improvement has the potential to save millions of gallons of freshwater annually when applied at scale.\n\nIn addition, we advanced our ability to recover acids used in chemical polishing and anodizing. These acids are typically discarded after one use, but we were able to purify and recycle them back into the manufacturing process, reducing consumption by more than 90 percent. This approach has enabled us to reduce the largest source of solid waste from the anodizing process, and at scale could potentially eliminate 4000 tons of waste.\n\nThe material and process innovations that we develop result from all these efforts. Our work to share information across our supply chain, perform detailed process and chemical assessments, and partner with suppliers on chemical management lays the foundation for improvements. We\u2019re able to better protect those who make and use our products and enable the reuse of key materials. And by keeping harmful chemicals out of our supply chain at the outset, we make it possible for us and others to recover materials for the next generation of products.\n\nCreating new, safer chemistries to move the industry forward\n\nOur strict requirements that govern potentially harmful substances in our products and processes encourage the suppliers we work with to also prioritize safer materials, helping create a market for better alternatives. We\u2019re lending our expertise on safer chemistries to help our suppliers meet the growing demand for safer materials. Prioritizing these materials also means phasing out chemistries that don\u2019t meet our specifications. We\u2019ve approached this across our company and products while investing in safer alternatives to drive change across our industry. The use of safer cleaners today supports the circular supply chains of the future.\nUsing our research and analysis of materials, we\u2019ve collaborated with suppliers to find safer alternatives \u2014 including for substances where none currently exist. In those cases, we lend our technical capabilities in material science to work with suppliers to develop entirely new chemistries. We maintain the same high safety, performance, and environmental standards for new alternative materials, submitting them through rigorous testing and evaluation to avoid regrettable substitutions.\n\nThis work isn\u2019t new to Apple; we\u2019ve been leading in the identification and successful removal of potentially harmful substances since the late 1990s. This process has involved the rigorous assessment of chemicals and the removal of those that don\u2019t align with our goals \u2014 in some cases, before removal becomes a requirement and industry standard. We\u2019re committed to phasing out our use of PFAS and engaging with all our supply chain partners to restrict PFAS from our products and manufacturing processes. While our analysis indicates that PFAS used in our products are safe during product use, we felt it was important to broaden our scope to consider manufacturing along the supply chain. We\u2019re prioritizing our phaseout activities in applications that result in the highest volumes of PFAS reductions and the most meaningful environmental impact. We\u2019re pursuing our phaseout in three steps: compiling a comprehensive catalog of PFAS uses in our products, identifying and developing non-PFAS alternatives that can meet our performance needs, and confirming that non-PFAS alternatives align with our human health and environmental goals.\n\nSubstances that we keep out of our products*\n\n**PVC and Phthalates**\nWe\u2019ve replaced these with safer thermoplastic elastomers. Both are still used by other companies in power cords and headphone cables.\n\n**Brominated Flame Retardants (BFRs)**\nIn 2008, we eliminated BFRs from thousands of parts, such as enclosures, cables, circuit boards, and connectors. We use safer metal hydroxides and phosphorus compounds in their place.\n\n**Mercury**\nWe eliminated mercury from displays in 2009. We use energy-efficient, mercury-free LEDs and OLEDs instead of mercury-based fluorescent lamps in all our displays.\n\n**Lead**\nApple phased lead out of display glass and solder in 2006.\n\n**Arsenic**\nArsenic, traditionally used in glass, has been eliminated from Apple display glass since 2008.\n\n**Beryllium**\nEliminated from all new product designs, beryllium is found in copper alloys used to make connectors and springs.\n\n**PFAS (PFOA and PFOS)**\nWe eliminated PFOA and PFOS from our products, with RSS restrictions added in 2010 and 2013, respectively. These types of chemicals are commonly used in manufacturing water-resistant materials. We\u2019re committed to eliminating PFAS entirely from our products.\n\n---\n\n* Apple\u2019s Regulated Substances Specification describes Apple\u2019s restrictions on the use of certain chemical substances in materials in Apple products, accessories, manufacturing processes, and packaging used for shipping products to Apple\u2019s end customers. Restrictions are derived from international laws or directives, regulatory agencies, ecotag label requirements, environmental standards, and Apple policies. Apple products are free of PVC and phthalates with the exception of AC power cords in India, Thailand (for two-prong AC power cords), and South Korea, where we continue to seek government approval for our PVC and phthalates replacement. Apple products comply with the European Union Directive 2011/65/EU and its amendments, including exemptions for the use of lead. Apple is working to phase out the use of these exempted substances where technically possible.\nWe've focused on cleaners and degreasers \u2014 building out a safer cleaners innovation ecosystem through multiple efforts. In 2022, we continued our role as a founding signatory of the Toward Zero Exposure program from the Clean Electronics Production Network (CEPN). Led by the NGO Green America, CEPN is a multi-stakeholder initiative to accelerate companies' efforts to eliminate workers' exposure to hazardous chemicals and to raise awareness of the need to improve chemical management practices across the global electronics manufacturing industry.\n\nAs a signatory, we report on the progress we've made to remove nine process chemicals from our supply chain that have been collectively identified as priorities for replacement at our final assembly sites. We're also accountable for our efforts to protect workers from exposure to potentially harmful substances. We prioritize this work by emphasizing effective engineering solutions and administrative controls across manufacturing processes. While personal protective equipment is essential and foundational to protecting people, we focus on employing safer alternatives from the start, and we support that with PPE as a measure to eliminate exposure to potentially harmful chemicals.\n\nIn 2022, we continued our collaboration with IPC, the premier global electronics standard-setting body, by drafting and helping launch IPC-1402, Standard for Green Cleaners Used in Electronics Manufacturing. This standard resulted from work over the past two years with the Green Cleaners for Electronics Manufacturing task group, where Apple has served as a chair working with more than 20 industry partners. This new standard will help suppliers across the electronics industry select cleaners that are safer for employees and the environment. Last year, Apple received the IPC Stan Plzak Corporate Recognition Award for our work on this effort and our contributions to the industry.\n\nWe continued to partner with ChemFORWARD \u2014 a nonprofit organization committed to creating broad access to chemical hazard data and a registry of cleaners \u2014 to make it easier for suppliers to choose safer alternatives. We also supported the RBA in producing a comprehensive technical guide on responsible chemical management, as well as over 20 hours of related training content to educate millions of workers across thousands of companies about controlling occupational exposures to hazardous chemicals.\nEngagement and Advocacy\n\nWe hear our stakeholders loud and clear.\nOur approach\n\nApple is committed to achieving clear impact across our environmental goals \u2014 and beyond our footprint as a company. This is urgent work that we can\u2019t do without others. As a member of the global community, we see it as part of our responsibility to engage thoughtfully with those addressing environmental challenges \u2014 from those in the policy community to the direct stakeholders involved in issues day-to-day and driving change.\n\nThis means working with our partners, learning from their feedback, and providing support where we can make a difference. We aim to effect positive change within and beyond our operations and supply chain. And we respond to the world around us by looking for opportunities where our leadership can impact policies, industries, and communities in a transformative way.\n\nListening to voices from a range of backgrounds and experiences\n\nWe approach our conversations with others through curiosity and with the intention of learning from diverse communities devoted to environmental stewardship. We purposefully engage those who bring a range of perspectives and understanding of the issues that matter to us. The conversations we have with policy makers, nonprofits, and community leaders help shape how we see regulations, approaches, and the promise of emerging technologies. We learn from this engagement, too. This process helps us discover opportunities to navigate challenges and improve in our efforts to achieve our environmental goals. Ultimately, we\u2019re able to put these conversations into action \u2014 whether that means aligning with new standards and best practices or exploring the potential that cutting-edge research can have on our operations.\n\nThis year, we continued to hold roundtable discussions on environmental issues with key stakeholders, including members of academia and industry associations, to better understand issues and regulations region by region. We value the input that these forums provide; each helps us understand the role that enhanced transparency plays for those working directly on policy. And these conversations also offer the opportunity to share information on our efforts.\n\nWe engage with the scientific community to better understand emerging approaches and cutting-edge tools that can support our environmental goals. We\u2019re working with researchers at Carnegie Mellon University to create robotic recycling systems to enhance material recovery for Apple and others through the development of advanced mechanisms for product disassembly and material sorting. We also continue to engage our Green Chemistry Advisory Board, an independent group of toxicologists and experts who advise on our smarter chemistry initiatives, including potential updates to the RSS. Their diverse expertise and perspectives help us lead the way to protect our customers and those who make and recycle our products.\n\nThis means working with our partners, learning from their feedback, and providing support where we can make a difference. We aim to effect positive change within and beyond our operations and supply chain. And we respond to the world around us by looking for opportunities where our leadership can impact policies, industries, and communities in a transformative way.\n\nWe can better achieve a TRANSFORMATIVE IMPACT within our industry and for global communities when we work alongside a diverse group of stakeholders.\nEngaging with others has also helped us refine our approach to industry standards and best practices. We draw from cross-sector engagement platforms to help guide our programs and set standards for environmental efforts. The Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) is one example of this. Their expertise defines the world-class water stewardship practices that we\u2019ve implemented at key Apple and supplier facilities, earning AWS certification for adherence to their Standard.\n\nWe\u2019re motivated by what we hear from within the business community, including our customers, employees, suppliers, industry partners, and investors. Their input provides vital support for our environmental goals and pushes us further in our efforts. For example, as co-chair of the United States Information Technology Office (USITO) \u2014 a trade association representing the U.S. information and communications technology industry in China \u2014 we lead the environmental protection and energy efficiency working groups. In this role, we engage with other companies in China as we work to comply with new environmental regulations and with policy makers on future standards. We continually look for more opportunities to hear from others \u2014 at the industry and national levels \u2014 to receive feedback and make progress.\n\nAchieving change together\n\nAn important part of leadership is the responsibility to influence change \u2014 whether through policy advocacy or direct engagement with groups invested in issues. Collective action provides the best means to achieve results on pressing environmental issues. When we take a proactive role in sharing our experiences and contributing to collaborative efforts on our areas of focus and expertise, we can better realize the goals on climate, resources, and smarter chemistry that we share with other stakeholders.\n\nPolicy advocacy\n\nPolicy is instrumental in effecting change across industries. Apple supports climate and environmental policy through our actions and stakeholder engagement. This also involves actively advocating for policies that advance environmental objectives \u2014 and support the Paris Agreement \u2014 by evaluating the positions of our industry partners to align business goals to address climate change.\n\nFor example, in the U.S. in 2022, we filed comments with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to encourage more rapid integration of renewable energy to the transmission grid, a key bottleneck to renewable energy deployment. And Apple, joined by other companies, submitted an Amicus Brief, urging the Supreme Court to uphold the U.S. EPA\u2019s authority to regulate greenhouse gases from power plants.\n\nIn Asia, we spoke at a carbon neutrality conference calling for Korea\u2019s 2030 energy plan to increase the ambition of its target for renewable energy solutions. And we serve as an executive member of the Japan Climate Leaders\u2019 Partnership (JCLP), a business coalition focused on renewables and pushing for greater climate ambition in Japan. Partnership and collaboration with the government is essential to this. JCLP has called for an increased focus on the renewable energy transition in alignment with the Paris Agreement\u2019s 1.5\u00b0C target and the level of carbon pricing needed to incentivize emissions reduction. Read more about how we advocate for climate policy around the world on page 29.\n\nWe\u2019re also partnered with the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE), a global group of public and private decision-makers focused on the circular economy \u2014 and how to push forward the vision and best practices needed to scale advancements. Building community around these efforts is essential to achieving our environmental goals. Through its engagement at key global events, PACE provides a vital platform to pursue solutions across governments, the private sector, and civil society. Read more about our position on circular economy policy on page 47.\n\nIndustry engagement\n\nWe engage in dozens of industry initiatives so that we can support beyond our own operations. These allow us to share knowledge and discover additional pathways to advocate for change. Through partnerships and coalitions, we contribute to various industries by sharing proprietary tools and standards and pursuing policy objectives that drive toward our shared goals. This year, with IPC, a global electronics trade association, we developed and released IPC-1402, a new standard for chemical cleaners intended to support safer, greener practices among manufacturers.\n\nEngagement with trade and industry associations helps to achieve alignment with environmental and climate policy in our collaborative efforts. We\u2019re deepening our engagement on climate policy with our U.S. federal trade associations. As part of this process, we\u2019re evaluating relevant trade association positions on climate and identifying specific areas of misalignment with Apple\u2019s values and principles on climate change. We then work with our trade associations to reduce areas of misalignment.\nCollaborative impact\nCollective action matters when it comes to taking on environmental challenges. We make public commitments alongside our partners to make our support clear and signal the change we are working to create. We\u2019re transparent about the progress we make against these commitments, so that we and our partners can be accountable for results. The work we do with others yields tangible results across our environmental goals \u2014 and it provides a catalyst for others to take action.\n\nAn example of this is our commitment to 100 percent renewable electricity with members in markets across the globe through RE100, an energy initiative aiming to scale zero carbon grids by uniting the world\u2019s most influential businesses committed to transitioning their electricity use to entirely renewables.\n\nWe\u2019re also part of the First Movers Coalition, a global initiative harnessing the purchasing power of companies to decarbonize seven \u201chard to abate\u201d industrial sectors that currently account for 30 percent of global emissions according to WEF. Through this initiative, we\u2019ve committed to moving to sustainable aviation fuel for 5 percent of our passenger air travel footprint; to procuring at least 10 percent of annual primary aluminum at or above First Movers Coalition\u2019s definition of \u201cnear-zero emissions primary aluminum\u201d; and to ensuring at least 50 percent of all aluminum procured annually is sourced from secondary aluminum by 2030. We\u2019re also supporting investments in forestry and carbon removal through external initiatives like the Forest Investor Club and our own Restore Fund (see page 27), which help us back projects that offer a financial return while contributing to our environmental goals.\n\nThrough Race to Zero and America is All In, we\u2019re tracking our shared commitment to support the Paris Agreement and efforts to achieve robust near-term emissions targets. As a founding member of the Asia Clean Energy Coalition \u2014 launched in 2022 at COP27 \u2014 we support accelerated corporate renewable electricity procurement in Asia, as part of a just and equitable energy transition in the region.\n\nWe remain committed to addressing issues beyond climate change, including chemical safety and reducing the amount of plastics in our products. As part of the Toward Zero Exposure program with the Clean Electronics Production Network (CEPN), we\u2019re working to address health and safety challenges in the electronics supply chain with other stakeholders. We share our pledge to eliminate plastics from our packaging by 2025 with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.\n\nKey Partnerships and Memberships\n\n| Stakeholder | Our engagement |\n|-------------|----------------|\n| Aluminium Stewardship Initiative | Supporting responsible sourcing within the aluminum value chain; recently completed an audit against their Performance Standard of environmental, social, and governance criteria.

(Member) |\nSupporting communities around the world\n\nThrough our engagement efforts, we have the opportunity to work directly with those who have been addressing environmental injustice in their communities. A range of organizations \u2014 from NGOs to startup technology companies \u2014 share our goals across climate change, resources, and smarter chemistry. We evaluate each opportunity to collaborate based on the potential to scale a proven environmental approach, test or pilot an innovation, or take steps to improve equity in communities disproportionately impacted by climate change and environmental dangers. When we partner with another organization, we believe success hinges on close collaboration on mutual objectives. To track our progress, we work with each partner to align on the metrics that best reflect the unique contribution that each organization is making to its community.\n\nWe value the opportunity to work with partners to contribute beyond our direct corporate operations \u2014 outside our areas of expertise and sometimes in new spaces. This is where some of the most vital work is being done to support transformational change for communities. Our work combines both collaborative work and philanthropic contributions, which we determine based on each organization\u2019s focus and their potential to effect change. And we recognize the importance of community-driven leadership on many issues by providing support.\n\nIn 2022, we supported efforts that span a breadth of work. The Conservation Fund is actively engaging and supporting land retention among Black landowners in the rural U.S. South. Working to support and center local organizations like McIntosh S.E.E.D., this collaboration helps landowners become more resilient to climate change through workshops and trainings on topics like sustainable forestry. World Wildlife Fund is engaged at the community level in developing alternative livelihood and other climate resilience projects through their Climate Crowd program. Beyond Benign works to increase BIPOC representation in smarter chemistry by providing students and faculty in minority-serving institutions with training, resources, networks, and curriculum support. Frank Water works with communities in India by using technology to map local watersheds and monitor the health of water ecosystems. The China Green Carbon Foundation is working on innovative approaches to carbon sequestration, including developing and restoring semi-urban forests and strengthening management practices. And Conservation International founded the Finance Lab for Irrecoverable Carbon to create business models and new approaches for incentivizing the protection and repair of ecosystems essential to meeting global climate goals.\n\nThe Conservation Fund works to center local organizations, like McIntosh S.E.E.D., to support land retention amongst Black landowners in the rural U.S. South. In 2022, Black landowners from Georgia participated in workshops and trainings hosted by McIntosh S.E.E.D. on topics relevant to climate resiliency.\nWe continue to collaborate with environmental justice groups by providing grants to minority-led and minority-centered organizations that focus on environmental issues. These organizations play a significant and vital role within their communities. They also support our efforts to avoid negative impacts for underrepresented communities as we pursue our environmental goals. We\u2019re able to provide both financial support and assistance in amplifying the work and impact that these groups have in and beyond their communities. And we work with these groups to address the global effects of climate change and environmental hazards that traditionally impact overburdened communities.\n\nWe expanded our Strengthen Local Communities grant program \u2014 which provides funding to local organizations in the communities where Apple team members live and work \u2014 to communities outside the United States. In 2022, we supported the Environmental Justice Foundation based in the United Kingdom and the Karrkad Kanjdji Trust and Original Power in Australia with grants that focused on access and equity. We also continued to support organizations in the U.S., including The Green Door Initiative, the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition, the Environmental Leadership Program, Native Conservancy, and UPROSE.\n\nWe\u2019re seeing progress, too. Hispanic Access Foundation works to support diverse Latino voices in their communities to advocate for environmental issues that directly affect their daily lives. Through our partnership, the organization was able to double the number of interns that it employs while paying a competitive market wage and jumpstart the Latino Climate Council, a new network of young, talented Latino leaders who are diversifying the field and bringing frontline perspectives to the climate justice movement. And representatives from the Center for Rural Enterprise and Environmental Justice traveled to Japan to learn about the country\u2019s approach to renewable energy. They also met with local representatives and partners to better understand Japanese perspectives around equity, inclusion, and justice in connection with the environment.\n\nApple supports the Hispanic Access Foundation, which focuses on amplifying diverse Latino voices in their communities and advocating for environmental issues that directly affect their daily lives.\nAdvancing our commitment to equity with the Impact Accelerator\n\nWe\u2019re working so that environmental progress and equity go hand in hand. And through the Impact Accelerator, we aim to expand access to opportunity through our investments in environmental sectors \u2014 such as renewable energy, carbon removal, recycling innovation, and smarter chemistry \u2014 which also help fight systemic barriers that impact communities disproportionately affected by environmental issues.\n\nAs the Impact Accelerator enters its third year, we\u2019re deepening our commitment to this initiative.\n\nThe Apple Impact Accelerator is designed for Black-, Hispanic/Latinx-, and Indigenous-owned businesses that share our focus on innovation and our commitment to the environment. With customized training and access to Apple experts, our Impact Accelerator helps companies as they achieve their next stage of development. As part of Apple\u2019s Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, the Impact Accelerator supports businesses that drive innovation and positive outcomes in our supply chain \u2014 so that together, we can work to support communities disproportionately impacted by environmental issues.\n\nIn 2022, our second class of the Impact Accelerator included 16 businesses at the leading edge of environmental services and solutions. Each company selected is at least 51 percent owned, operated, and controlled by a Black-, Hispanic/Latinx-, or Indigenous individual and aligns closely with our environmental strategy, including our commitment to become carbon neutral by 2030. Many of them share a focus on bringing clean energy, opportunity, and vital services to vulnerable and underserved communities.\n\nThe companies participate in a three-month program aimed at accelerating progress toward their goals. The program includes live virtual sessions, online courses on supply chain management, supplier diversity, financial and legal subjects, and one-on-one mentorship with an Apple expert on topics from renewable energy to responsible sourcing. Executives and their teams receive customized training that provides the knowledge and tools that organizations need to succeed as Apple suppliers, as well as access to Apple mentors and experts to help align their business priorities with Apple\u2019s environmental goals. The program culminates in an opportunity for participants to pitch their services and solutions to decision makers and business leaders within Apple.\n\nThe companies sustain their commitment after the program. Each participant transitions to Apple\u2019s Supplier Success community to further foster the connections developed during the program \u2014 and to forge new connections across all generations of the program.\n\nEvery business is given the opportunity to attend a business executive leadership program focused on supply chain and growth through a leading university.\n\nOur most recent class featured a diverse set of companies engaged in work on water stewardship, recycling technologies, and green building and engineering, among other areas. The program supports these companies as they better position themselves for growth, improve their abilities to engage larger contracts, and expand their customer base \u2014 all while supporting their commitment to the environment. The program has also connected like-minded business leaders, both within our Impact Accelerator classes and at Apple, to create new opportunities for innovation and to realize our shared goals.\n\nThe goal of the Impact Accelerator is that Apple\u2019s strategic work and investments to protect the environment also help expand access to opportunity for communities of color. Since their participation in the program, companies have seen increased recognition for their work within their sector and local communities, have built connections with public- and private-sector leaders, and have seen their overall business opportunities expand. Several are currently working with Apple as part of the company\u2019s supply chain network, and every company has participated in selective opportunities to be assessed for potential business with Apple.\n\nThe Impact Accelerator\u2019s goal is to ensure that Apple\u2019s work to protect the environment also helps advance equity and expand access to opportunity for communities of color. Participants, like Bench-Tek, engage in online courses, live sessions, and mentorship throughout the three-month program, and continue their connection with other program participants through Apple\u2019s Supplier Success community.\nAppendix\n\nFOCUSING ON THE FINER DETAILS OF OUR PROGRESS\n## Appendix contents\n\n| Page | Section |\n|------|---------|\n| 76   | Appendix A: Environmental data |\n| 77   | Greenhouse gas emissions |\n| 78   | Carbon offsets |\n| 79   | Carbon footprint by product |\n| 81   | Apple's life cycle assessment methodology |\n| 82   | Energy |\n| 83   | Resources |\n| 84   | Normalizing factors |\n| 85   | Appendix B: Corporate facilities energy supplement |\n| 94   | Appendix C: Supplier Clean Energy Program supplement |\n| 99   | Appendix D: Assurance and review statements |\n| 100  | Net comprehensive carbon footprint, facilities energy, carbon, waste, paper, and water data (Apex) |\n| 102  | Product carbon footprint (Fraunhofer Institute) |\n| 104  | Supplier Clean Energy Program (Apex) |\n| 105  | Supplier Energy Efficiency Program (Apex) |\n| 106  | Packaging fiber and plastic footprint (Fraunhofer Institute) |\n| 108  | Appendix E: Environment, Health and Safety Policy |\n| 110  | Appendix F: ISO 14001 certification |\n| 112  | Report notes |\n| 113  | End notes |\nAppendix A\n\nEnvironmental data\n\n77 Greenhouse gas emissions\n78 Carbon offsets\n79 Carbon footprint by product\n81 Apple\u2019s life cycle assessment methodology\n82 Energy\n83 Resources\n84 Normalizing factors\n## Appendix A\n\n### Greenhouse gas emissions\n\nWe account for our carbon footprint by following internationally recognized standards, like the World Resources Institute (WRI) Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol and ISO 14040/14044. Improving the accuracy of our carbon footprint is an ongoing process\u2014as we learn more, we refine our carbon models and adjust our climate roadmap. We also regularly revisit the boundary of our carbon footprint as our data sources improve and our business evolves. For example, in 2022, we expanded our corporate footprint to include work from home emissions, third-party cloud services, electricity transmission and distribution losses, and upstream impacts from our scope 1 fuel use.\n\n### Fiscal year\n\n| Corporate emissions (metric tons CO\u2082e) | Gross emissions | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| **Scope 1**                          |                |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Natural gas, diesel, propane         |                | 39,700 | 40,070 | 39,340 | 40,910 | 42,840 |\n| Fixed vehicles                       |                | 12,660 | 12,090 | 4,270 | 6,950 | 11,110 |\n| Other emissions\u00b9                     |                | 2,000 | 3,040 | 3,830 | 4,870 | 3,490 |\n| **Scope 2 (market-based)**           |                | 3,000 | 2,780 | 0 | 0 | 8,730 |\n| Electricity                          |                | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 8,730 |\n| Steam, heating, and cooling\u00b2         |                | 3,000 | 2,780 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| **Scope 3**                          |                | 265,800 | 108,400 | 287,000 | 521,000 | 520,000 |\n| Business travel                      |                | 113,500 | 22,850 | 153,000 | 326,000 | 337,000 |\n| Employee commute\u00b3                    |                | 134,200 | 85,570 | 134,000 | 195,000 | 183,000 |\n| Upstream fuel                        |                | 10,650 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Work from home (market-based)        |                | 7,500 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Transmission and distribution loss (market-based) | 0 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| Third-party cloud (market-based)     |                | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| **Carbon removals**                  |                | \u2013324,100 | \u2013167,000 | \u201370,000 | 0 | 0 |\n\n### Product life cycle emissions (metric tons CO\u2082e)\n\n| Gross emissions (Scope 3) | 2028,000 | 23,020,000 | 22,260,000 | 24,460,000 | 24,560,000 |\n|----------------------------|----------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Manufacturing (purchased goods and services) | 13,400,000 | 16,200,000 | 16,100,000 | 18,000,000 | 18,000,000 |\n| Product transportation (upstream and downstream) | 1,900,000 | 1,750,000 | 1,800,000 | 1,400,000 | 1,300,000 |\n| Product use (use of sold products) | 4,900,000 | 4,950,000 | 4,300,000 | 4,100,000 | 4,700,000 |\n| End-of-life processing | 80,000 | 80,000 | 60,000 | 60,000 | 50,000 |\n\n### Carbon removals\n\n| Product carbon offsets | 0 | \u2013500,000\u00b2 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n\n### Total gross scope 3 emissions (corporate and product) (metric tons CO\u2082e)\n\n| 20,550,000 | 23,128,400 | 22,547,000 | 24,980,000 | 25,070,000 |\n\n### Total gross carbon footprint (without offsets) (metric tons CO\u2082e)\n\n| 20,650,000 | 23,200,000 | 22,600,000 | 25,000,000 | 25,200,000 |\n\n### Total net carbon footprint (after applying offsets) (metric tons CO\u2082e)\n\n| 20,300,000 | 22,530,000 | 22,530,000 | 25,100,000 | 25,200,000 |\n\n### Notes:\n\n1.

Apple\u2019s carbon footprint boundary is aligned with the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol framework and includes emissions that are material and relevant to Apple, where data is available. Apple\u2019s carbon footprint includes direct scope 1 emissions, indirect scope 2 emissions from purchased electricity, steam, heating, and cooling, and indirect scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services, transportation and distribution, business travel, employee commute, product use, and end of life.\n4. Apple is a carbon neutral for corporate emissions as of April 2022. Beginning in fiscal year 2022, we\u2019ve expanded our footprint boundary to include scope 3 emissions associated with work from home, third-party cloud services, electricity transmission and distribution losses, and upstream impacts from scope 1 fuels.\n5. Emissions from R&D processes and refrigerant leaks.\n6. We estimate the life cycle emissions associated with our use of renewable electricity for our corporate facilities to be about 60,000 metric tons CO\u2082e. We do not currently account for these emissions in our corporate footprint, due to the poor quality of the data.\n7. Beginning in fiscal year 2021, we\u2019re accounting for scope 2 emissions from the purchase of district heating, chilled water, and steam.\n8. Beginning in fiscal year 2020, we updated our methodology for calculating emissions from employee commute to reflect employees working from home during COVID-19.\n9. For a detailed breakdown of carbon offset purchases applied to our corporate footprint, see the carbon offsets table on the following page.\n10. We retired 167,000 metric tons of carbon credits from the Chyulu Hills project in Kenya to maintain carbon neutrality for our corporate footprint as of fiscal year 2021. This project is certified to the VCS and CCB standards.\n11. We retired 70,000 metric tons of carbon credits \u2014 53,000 from the Chyulu Hills project in Kenya and 17,000 from the Cipal\u00e1 Mangrove project in Guatemala.\n12. Because we\u2019re committed to accuracy and transparency, we regularly refine our product life cycle assessment model and sources of data. For example, last year we obtained more granular data summarizing in which countries our products are sold and used, resulting in more granularity possible for grid emission factors used in the carbon footprint of the product use phase. This net result was an increase in our fiscal year 2021 carbon footprint. When using the same level of data granularity and relevant to Apple, where data is available.

The threats to the area have increased in the last decade with the development of regional infrastructure projects and the rising price of coffee \u2014 the main crop grown in this area \u2014 leading to increasing deforestation and the subsequent loss of ecosystem services that this area provides. In response, Conservation International and its allies in the region designed the Alto Mayo Conservation Initiative (AMCI) to promote the sustainable management of the AMPF and its ecosystem services for the benefit of the local populations and the global climate. With the financial support of carbon financing, these actions are facilitating the conservation of large expanses of forest with associated climate change mitigation benefits while also creating opportunities for the sustainable development of local communities. | 2016\u20132018 | 9,100 | registry.verra.org/app/projectDetail/VCS/944 |\n| Chyulu Hills | The Chyulu Hills REDD+ Project (CHRP) is a multi-partner initiative designed to promote climate change mitigation and adaptation, restore biodiversity, and create alternative livelihoods under the UN scheme of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+). It\u2019s located in the Tsavo-Amboseli ecosystem in southeastern Kenya and stretches over an area of over 410,000 hectares. Its main geographic feature is the volcanic Chyulu Hills mountain range, from which the project derives its name. This project presents a broad ecosystem approach, including REDD+, to provide long-term sustainable financing and management to maintain the ecological integrity of an iconic African landscape. The project will help protect a very high-value wildlife and biodiversity area while supporting the development needs of Indigenous and other local communities. | 2017 | 315,000 | registry.verra.org/app/projectDetail/VCS/1408 |\n## Appendix A\n\n### Carbon footprint by product\n\nThe following tables list the carbon footprints (in kilograms) of Apple products sold as of March 9, 2022, along with select configurations.*\n\n#### iPhone\n\n| iPhone          | Unit | 64GB | 128GB | 256GB | 512GB | 1TB |\n|-----------------|------|------|-------|-------|-------|-----|\n| iPhone 14       | kg   | \u2013    | 61    | 67    | 83    | \u2013   |\n| iPhone 14 Plus  | kg   | \u2013    | 68    | 75    | 91    | \u2013   |\n| iPhone 14 Pro   | kg   | \u2013    | 65    | 71    | 84    | 116 |\n| iPhone 14 Pro Max| kg  | \u2013    | 73    | 80    | 93    | 124 |\n| iPhone 13 mini  | kg   | \u2013    | 61    | 69    | 81    | \u2013   |\n| iPhone 13       | kg   | \u2013    | 64    | 71    | 83    | \u2013   |\n| iPhone 12       | kg   | 70   | 75    | 85    | \u2013     | \u2013   |\n| iPhone SE (3rd generation) | kg | 46   | 50    | 58    | \u2013     | \u2013   |\n\n#### iPad\n\n| iPad            | Unit | 64GB | 128GB | 256GB | 512GB | 1TB | 2TB |\n|-----------------|------|------|-------|-------|-------|-----|-----|\n| iPad Pro 12.9-inch (6th generation) Wi-Fi + Cellular | kg   | \u2013    | 135   | 142   | 158   | 163 | 264 |\n| iPad Pro 11-inch (6th generation) Wi-Fi + Cellular | kg   | \u2013    | 107   | 121   | 127   | 146 | 249 |\n| iPad Air (5th generation) Wi-Fi + Cellular        | kg   | 80   | 84    | 92    | \u2013     | \u2013   | \u2013   |\n| iPad (10th generation) Wi-Fi + Cellular            | kg   | 72   | 82    | \u2013     | \u2013     | \u2013   | \u2013   |\n| iPad (9th generation) Wi-Fi + Cellular             | kg   | 75   | \u2013     | 84    | \u2013     | \u2013   | \u2013   |\n| iPad mini (6th generation) Wi-Fi + Cellular        | kg   | 68   | 71    | 77    | 90    | \u2013   | \u2013   |\n\n#### Apple Watch\n\n| Apple Watch     | Unit | Aluminum case with Sport Loop | Aluminum case with Sport Band | Stainless steel case with Sport Band | Titanium case with Ocean Band | Titanium case with Trail Loop |\n|-----------------|------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Apple Watch Ultra, 49mm | kg   | \u2013                             | \u2013                             | \u2013                                    | 56                            | 56                            |\n| Apple Watch Series 8, 45mm | kg   | \u2013                             | 33                            | 35                                   | \u2013                             | \u2013                             |\n| Apple Watch SE (3rd generation), 44mm | kg   | 28                            | 31                            | \u2013                                    | \u2013                             | \u2013                             |\n\n**Notes:**\n- Dashes indicate that the configuration does not exist.\n- Product carbon footprint data for Apple products are published in our Product Environmental Reports and are accurate as of product launch.

life cycle assessment methodology\n\nWhen conducting a product life cycle assessment (LCA), we calculate carbon emissions using the 100-year time horizon global warming potentials (GWP100) from the 2014 IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), including biogenic carbon. The following details the five steps we use to conduct our LCA:\n\n1. To model the manufacturing phase, we use part-by-part measurements of the entire product along with data on part production. In some cases where part-by-part data is not readily available, we also use design-level data for size and weight detail. The measurements help us accurately determine the size and weight of the components and materials in the product, while data on manufacturing processes and yield loss during production allows us to account for the impact of manufacturing. The LCA includes accessories and packaging, as well as decreased emissions through Apple\u2019s Supplier Clean Energy Program. When calculating Apple\u2019s comprehensive carbon footprint, we also include units that are repaired and replaced through AppleCare.\n\n2. To model customer use, we measure the power consumed by a product while it is running in a simulated scenario. Daily usage patterns are specific to each product and are a mixture of actual and modeled customer use data. For the purposes of our assessment, years of use, which are based on first owners, are modeled to be four years for macOS and tvOS devices and three years for iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS devices. Most Apple products last longer and are often passed along, resold, or returned to Apple by the first owner for others to use. More information on our product energy use is provided in our Product Environmental Reports.\n\n3. To model transportation, we use data collected on shipments of single products and multipack units by land, sea, and air. We account for transporting materials between manufacturing sites; transporting products from manufacturing sites to regional distribution hubs; transporting products from regional distribution hubs to individual customers; and transporting products from final customers to recycling facilities.\n\n4. To model end of life, we use material composition data on our products and estimate the ratio of products that are sent to recycling or disposal. For products sent to recycling, we capture the initial processing by the recycler to prepare the product for recovery of electronic, metal, plastic, and glass material streams. Subsequent downstream recycling processes are not included, as these are considered stages of production and not end-of-life processing. For products sent to disposal, we capture the emissions associated with landfilling or incineration of each type of material.\n\n5. After we collect data about manufacturing, use, transportation, and end of life, we combine it with detailed greenhouse gas emission data. This emission data is based on a combination of Apple-specific and industry-average data sets for material production, manufacturing processes, electricity generation, and transportation. Renewable energy used in the supply chain, initiated by suppliers independently or through the Apple Supplier Clean Energy Program, is also accounted for within the LCA model. Combining product-specific information with emission data in our LCA allows us to compile detailed results for greenhouse gas emissions as they relate to each product. The data and modeling approaches are checked for quality and accuracy by the Fraunhofer Institute in Germany.\n\nThere is inherent uncertainty in modeling carbon emissions due primarily to data limitations. For the top component contributors to Apple\u2019s carbon emissions, Apple addresses this uncertainty by developing detailed process-based environmental models with Apple-specific parameters. For the remaining elements of Apple\u2019s carbon footprint, we rely on industry average data and assumptions.\n\n* Myhre, G., O. Shindell, F.-M. Br\u00e9on, W. Collins, J. Fuglestvedt, J. Huang, D.

Beginning in fiscal year 2021, we\u2019re accounting for the purchase of district heating, chilled water, and steam.\n2. Because energy efficiency measures have lasting benefits, energy efficiency savings are calculated cumulatively since 2012. All efficiency measures are retired based on their effective useful lifetime as documented by the California Energy Commission. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, corporate facilities\u2019 energy use declined temporarily as we adjusted lighting and climate controls due to shutdowns and reduced occupancy. These savings are not included in the total savings from our energy efficiency program initiatives. We also recognize that energy use at our employees\u2019 homes likely increased during this period. We have not accounted for this energy use because we anticipated this impact is small relative to our overall energy use and as we\u2019re still evolving our methodology.\n3. Energy savings from supplier energy efficiency improvements are reported as annualized numbers. Beginning in 2020, supplier energy savings are calculated based on the fiscal year instead of on a calendar-year basis.\n4. Beginning, January 1, 2018, 100 percent of the electricity we use to power our global facilities is sourced from renewable energy.\n5. Supply chain renewable electricity capacity (operational) and renewable electricity use for fiscal year 2021 do not include REC purchases Apple made, equivalent to 0.3 GW and 500,000 MWh, respectively, to address a small increase to its carbon footprint.\n## Appendix A\n\n### Resources\n\n| Water | Corporate facilities | Unit | Fiscal year | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 |\n|-------|----------------------|------|-------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|       |                      |      |             |      |      |      |      |      |\n|       | Total                | million gallons | 1,527 | 1,407 | 1,287 | 1,291 | 1,258 |\n|       | Freshwater\\(^1\\)     | million gallons | 1,380 | 1,259 | 1,168 | 1,178 | 1,190 |\n|       | Recycled water\\(^2\\) | million gallons | 142  | 141  | 113  | 106  | 63   |\n|       | Other alternative sources\\(^3\\) | million gallons | 5    | 7    | 5    | 7    | 4    |\n| Supply chain | Freshwater saved | million gallons | 13,000 | 12,300 | 10,800 | 9,300 | 7,600 |\n| Waste | Corporate facilities\\(^4\\) | % | 71 | 68 | 70 | 66 | 67 |\n|       | Landfill diversion rate | pounds | 33,263,560 | 33,202,200 | 25,626,050 | 36,317,120 | 32,572,890 |\n|       | Landfilled (municipal solid waste) | pounds | 78,678,250 | 73,489,220 | 63,612,300 | 73,338,130 | 66,340,630 |\n|       | Composted            | pounds | 8,728,170 | 4,844,960 | 6,302,410 | 10,882,120 | 10,387,430 |\n|       | Hazardous waste      | pounds | 2,780,610 | 3,525,840 | 4,053,770 | 6,096,600 | 6,277,800 |\n|       | Waste to energy      | pounds | 1,197,570 | 657,890 | 786,250 | 1,129,080 | 1,105,140 |\n| Supply chain | Waste diverted from landfill | metric tons | 523,000 | 491,000 | 400,000 | 322,000 | 375,000 |\n\n### Product packaging footprint\n\n| Packaging | Total | metric tons | 276,100 | 257,000 | 226,000 | 189,000 | 187,000 |\n|-----------|-------|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n|           | Recycled fiber\\(^5\\) | % of total | 66 | 63 | 60 | 59 | 58 |\n|           | Responsibly sourced virgin fiber\\(^5\\) | % of total | 30 | 33 | 35 | 33 | 32 |\n|           | Plastic | % of total | 4 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 |\n\n---\n\n1. We define freshwater as drinking-water quality. The majority of our freshwater comes from municipal sources, and less than 5 percent comes from onsite groundwater sources.\n2. Recycled water represents a key alternative water source. Our recycled water is sourced primarily from municipal treatment plants, with less than 5 percent coming from onsite treatment. Recycled water is primarily used for irrigation, makeup water in cooling, and toilet flushing.\n3. Other alternative sources of water include rainwater and recovered condensate captured onsite. Water used for construction activities like dust control is not included in this total and represents 13 million gallons of water used in fiscal year 2021.\n4. Total does not include construction and demolition waste or electronic waste. We\u2019re refining our methodology for collecting this data and plan to include it in future years. We\u2019ve also restated the total for 2018 without these categories of waste.\n5. Responsible sourcing of wood fiber is defined in Apple\u2019s Sustainable Fiber Specification.

We\u2019ve learned a lot about how best to secure renewable energy, which has helped us educate suppliers and expand our renewable energy efforts into our supply chain. This appendix summarizes the types of renewable energy solutions we\u2019ve deployed, and it details how we implement renewable energy at our data centers \u2014 our largest energy loads.\n\nHow we procure renewable energy\n\nSince launching our renewable energy program in 2011, we\u2019ve implemented a number of solutions to procure renewable energy. Our strategy has evolved over time to create the most positive impact.\n\nOwnership and PURPA\n\nIn 2011, Apple\u2019s 100 percent equity ownership of our Maiden solar arrays was the first time a nonenergy commercial company built its own utility-scale solar PV project. We used a 1978 federal law called the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) to structure the project. We then applied this same structure to two more large solar PV and biogas fuel cell projects in North Carolina and two microhydro projects in Oregon. This was a landmark moment in corporate renewable energy development and led to an increased use of PURPA in these states.\n\nDirect Access\n\nSince 2012, in California and Oregon, we\u2019ve used a program called Direct Access to bypass the default electricity generation offered by the utilities servicing our data centers in those states. Instead, we contracted directly with independent power producers who could supply 100 percent renewable electricity. After initially buying from existing, third-party-owned projects, we\u2019re now procuring renewable energy from projects we created. The Solar Star II and Montague Wind projects deliver renewables to our Oregon data center, and the California Flats solar project delivers renewables to our data centers, offices, and retail stores in California.\n\nGreenEnergy Rider\n\nIn 2013, we opened a new data center in Reno, Nevada. With no PURPA or Direct Access options in Nevada, we worked directly with the local utility, NV Energy, to create a whole new regulatory structure. The Nevada GreenEnergy Rider enables us to secure a long-term, fixed-price contract for renewable electricity from a new solar PV project built for us but managed by the utility. We\u2019ve used this partnership to create four solar projects totaling 320 megawatts.\n\nEquity investment\n\nIn 2014, we invested in two 20-megawatt solar PV projects in Sichuan, China, to support all our in-country retail stores, corporate offices, and data storage facilities. This project represented the first time a commercial company created a new large-scale project in China for its own use. We\u2019ve since replicated this model many times for Apple\u2019s supply chain.\n\nPortfolio solutions\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, we adapted to land scarcity constraints in Singapore and Japan by contracting for solar PV on 800 rooftops in Singapore and 300 in Japan. We adapted our approach in each country to fit local partnerships and regulatory structures: We signed a long-term agreement similar to a power purchase agreement in Singapore and made an equity investment in Japan. These projects offer us long-term flexibility as our load grows.\n\nRenewable microgrid\n\nSince 2017, we\u2019ve been powering Apple Park with 100 percent renewable energy \u2014 about 75 percent of which is generated onsite and managed by a microgrid. The onsite generation comes from 14 megawatts of rooftop solar PV and 4 megawatts of base load biogas fuel cells. Any additional energy required is drawn by Direct Access from the California Flats solar project in nearby Monterey County. The microgrid system with battery storage manages the renewable energy generation and the building\u2019s energy use, optimizes demand management, load shifting, and frequency regulation services; and ensures uninterrupted energy reliability against local grid outages.\nFacilities renewable energy projects\n\nTo reach 100 percent renewable electricity for Apple\u2019s own facilities, Apple has helped create 1,549 MW of renewable energy around the world. The projects listed to the right represent Apple-created renewable energy projects that support Apple facilities\u2019 electricity use and contribute to cleaner grids around the world. Operational projects apply a mix of clean energy technology, including wind (22.9 percent), solar (76.0 percent), microhydro (0.21 percent), and biogas fuel cells (0.9 percent).\n\nThis table represents all operational renewable energy projects that Apple has helped create.\n\n| Location          | Renewable energy technology | Size (MW)

emissions from purchased electricity is zero. But, we also account for purchased steam, heating, and cooling, which resulted in 5,020 metric tons of emissions in fiscal year 2022.\nA focus on data centers\n\nWe used over 2.14 billion kWh of electricity in 2022 to power our data centers and colocation facilities around the world. We\u2019re proud that 100 percent of that electricity came from clean, renewable sources including solar, wind, biogas fuel cells, and low-impact hydropower. To cover our needs, we build our own renewable power projects and work with utilities to purchase clean energy from locally obtained resources. We\u2019re staying at 100 percent even as Apple\u2019s data center presence continues to grow.\n\nWe now operate eight data centers, and more are being developed. These data centers are spread across North America, Europe, and Asia. Each has unique design features that conserve energy and reflect the climate, as well as other aspects, of its location.\n\nMaiden, North Carolina\n\n100 percent renewable since opening June 2010\n\nBetween 2011 and 2015, we installed 68 megawatts of Apple-created projects: two 20-megawatt solar projects, an 18-megawatt solar project, and 10 megawatts of biogas fuel cells. We then worked with the local utility, Duke Energy, to help build five solar projects through its Green Source Rider program. These solar projects came online beginning in 2015 and were Duke Energy\u2019s first Green Source Rider projects to become operational. We worked with Duke Energy for several years to develop this green energy tariff option, which allowed Apple and Duke Energy to develop new renewable energy projects. The five Green Source Rider projects have a combined capacity of 22 megawatts. In 2017, we made long-term commitments to five more solar projects in North Carolina, for an additional 85 megawatts of clean energy. In 2022, the Maiden data center was supported by projects that generated 432 million kWh of renewable energy, which is equivalent to the energy used by over 11,000 homes in North Carolina for a year. Use of renewable energy allowed us to avoid over 171,000 metric tons of CO\u2082e during the fiscal year.\n\nThe energy efficiency measures we\u2019ve implemented at our Maiden data centers include use of outside air cooling through a waterside economizer during night and cool-weather hours, which, along with water storage, allows the chillers to be idle 75 percent of the time.\n\nMaiden, North Carolina: Grid mix versus Apple-sourced renewable energy\n\n| Default grid mix (North Carolina) | % | Apple actual renewable energy allocation | % |\n|----------------------------------|---|----------------------------------------|---|\n| Coal                             | 16| Apple\u2019s solar projects                  | 75|\n| Gas                              | 37| Apple\u2019s biogas fuel cells               | 3 |\n| Nuclear                          | 33| Apple\u2019s wind projects                   | 21|\n| Hydro                            | 5 | Source: 2022 energy data                |    |\n| Renewable                        | 10| Note: Totals don\u2019t add up to 100 percent, due to rounding. |    |\n| Other                            | <1|                                        |    |\n\nSource: eGRID 2021\n\n2 Carbon emissions equivalences calculated using 2021 data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration: www.eia.gov/totalenergy/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table5_a.pdf\n\n3 Emissions avoided are calculated using the GHG Protocol methodology for calculating market-based emissions.\nPrineville, Oregon\n100 percent renewable since opening May 2012\nTo support our Prineville data center, we signed a 200-megawatt power purchase agreement for a new Oregon wind farm, the Montague Wind Power Facility, which entered commercial operation at the end of 2019. It\u2019s our largest project to date, producing over 562 million kWh of clean, renewable energy a year.\n\nThis is in addition to our power purchase agreement for the 56-megawatt Solar Star Oregon II project located just a few miles from our data center. This solar PV project, which came online and began supporting the data center in 2017, produces 141 million kWh of renewable energy per year. To strengthen the connection between Apple and these projects, we use Oregon\u2019s Direct Access program to supply the renewable energy from these projects directly to our data center.\n\nAlso supporting the data center are two microhydro projects that harness the power of water flowing through local irrigation canals that have been operating for over 60 years. In 2022, these microhydro projects are expected to generate nearly 2 million kWh of renewable energy. To supplement these projects, we executed a long-term purchase agreement for all environmental attributes from a 69-megawatt portfolio of eight solar projects in Oregon.\n\nIn 2022, the Prineville data center was supported by projects that generated 275 million kWh of renewable energy, which is equivalent to the energy used by over 8,000 homes in Oregon for a year. Use of renewable energy allowed us to avoid over 196,000 metric tons of CO\u2082e during the fiscal year.\n\nOur Prineville data center takes advantage of the cool and dry climate by cooling its servers with outside air whenever possible. Indirect evaporative cooling is enabled when the outside air temperature gets too high to cool the servers with outside air alone.\n\nReno, Nevada\n100 percent renewable since opening December 2012\nUnlike competitive energy markets where some of our data centers are located, the regulated electricity supply in Nevada did not offer a simple solution for us to create new renewable energy projects dedicated to our data center. So, in 2013, we created a partnership with the local utility, NV Energy, to develop the Fort Churchill Solar project. Apple designed, financed, and constructed the project, and NV Energy operates it and directs all the renewable energy it produces to our data center. The Fort Churchill Solar project uses a photovoltaic panel with curved mirrors that concentrate sunlight. The 20-megawatt array has an annual production capacity of over 40 million kWh.\n\nTo facilitate further renewable development in Nevada, Apple worked with NV Energy and the Nevada utility commission to create a green energy option open to all commercial customers, called the NV GreenEnergy Rider, that does not require the customer to fund project development up front. Thanks to this new option, in 2015 we announced our second Nevada solar project, the 50-megawatt Boulder Solar II project. This project came online in 2017, producing about 137 million kWh of renewable energy per year. We\u2019ve used the NV GreenEnergy Rider program two more times, first for the 200-megawatt Techren II solar project. Apple\u2019s largest solar project to date, it\u2019s estimated to produce over 540 million kWh per year and came online in late 2019.\n\nNext was the 50-megawatt Turquoise Nevada project, which came online in late 2020. The project is estimated to produce 110 million kWh of renewable energy per year. In 2022, the Reno data center was supported by projects that generated 419 million kWh of renewable energy, which is equivalent to the energy used by nearly 12,000 homes in Nevada for a year. Use of renewable energy allowed us to avoid more than 145,000 metric tons of CO\u2082e during the fiscal year.\n\nLike in Prineville, our Reno data center takes advantage of the mild climate by cooling its servers with outside air whenever possible. When the outside air is too warm to cool the servers alone, it draws from indirect evaporative cooling.\n\n---\n\n**Prineville, Oregon: Grid mix versus Apple-sourced renewable energy**\n\n| Electricity use in 2022: 275 million kWh | % |\n|----------------------------------------|---|\n| Gas                                    | 35 |\n| Hydro                                  | 45 |\n| Renewable                              | 20 |\n\nSource: eGRID 2021\n\n**Reno, Nevada: Grid mix versus Apple-sourced renewable energy**\n\n| Electricity use in 2022: 419 million kWh | % |\n|----------------------------------------|---|\n| Coal                                   | 7  |\n| Gas                                    | 63 |\n| Hydro                                  | 5  |\n| Renewable                              | 26 |\n\nSource: eGRID 2021\n\nNote: Total doesn\u2019t add up to 100 percent due to rounding.\n\n---\n\n4 Carbon emissions equivalences calculated using 2021 data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration: www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table5_a.pdf\n5 Emissions avoided are calculated using the GHG Protocol methodology for calculating market-based emissions.\n6 Carbon emissions equivalences calculated using 2021 data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration: www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table5_a.pdf\n7 Emissions avoided are calculated using the GHG Protocol methodology for calculating market-based emissions.\nNewark, California\n100 percent renewable since January 2013\n\nOur data center in Newark, California, is powered by 100 percent renewable energy. We hit this milestone in January 2013, when we began serving the data center with energy sourced primarily from California wind power. We acquired this energy directly from the wholesale market through California\u2019s Direct Access program. In 2017, Apple\u2019s 130-megawatt California Flats solar project in nearby Monterey County came online, and now we use Direct Access to supply power from that project directly to our data center and other Apple facilities in California.\n\nIn 2022, the Newark data center was supported by projects that generated 20 million kWh of renewable energy, which is equivalent to the energy used by nearly 10,000 homes in California for a year. Use of renewable energy allowed us to avoid more than 804 metric tons of CO\u2082e during the fiscal year.\n\nMesa, Arizona\n100 percent renewable since opening March 2017\n\nOur global command data center in Mesa, Arizona, came online in 2016. To support this facility, we partnered with the local utility, the Salt River Project (SRP), to build the 50-megawatt Bonnybrooke solar project, which became operational in December 2016. This project produces over 148 million kWh of clean, renewable energy a year, which roughly matches the energy used by the data center.\n\nAs the Mesa data center grew, it became apparent that we needed additional sources of renewable energy to maintain our 100 percent renewable electricity goal.\n\nWe began to explore onsite solar options at the data center and determined that we could provide valuable shaded parking that paid for itself through energy bill reductions while adding to our renewable energy portfolio. The resulting PV facility includes five elevated parking canopies and three ground-mounted arrays, for a total generating capacity of 4.67 MW. The onsite PV system began commercial operation in February 2019 and generates approximately 8,000 MWh per year.\n\nIn addition, we began working with SRP to develop a customer renewable energy program in 2017, resulting in their Sustainable Energy Offering, which launched in 2019, to provide a diverse mix of commercial electric customers with new renewable energy at an affordable price. Under this program, Apple has executed an agreement with SRP to purchase a portion of the output of their 100 MW Central Line PV facility. The project became operational in April 2022.\n\nIn 2022, the Mesa data center was supported by 379 million kWh of renewable energy, which is equivalent to the energy used by over 10,000 Arizona homes. Use of renewable energy allowed us to avoid more than 158,000 metric tons of CO\u2082e during the fiscal year.\n\n---\n\n### Newark, California: Grid mix versus Apple-sourced renewable energy\n\n| Electricity use in 2022: 20 million kWh | Apple actual renewable energy allocation | % |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---|\n| Default grid mix (California)          | Coal                                   | <1 |\n|                                        | Gas                                    | 49 |\n|                                        | Nuclear                                | 8  |\n|                                        | Hydro                                  | 7  |\n|                                        | Renewable                              | 34 |\n|                                        | Other                                  | <1 |\n| Source: eGRID 2021                     |                                        |    |\n\n### Mesa, Arizona: Grid mix versus Apple-sourced renewable energy\n\n| Electricity use in 2022: 379 million kWh | Apple actual renewable energy allocation | % |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---|\n| Default grid mix (Arizona)             | Coal                                   | 12 |\n|                                        | Gas                                    | 44 |\n|                                        | Nuclear                                | 29 |\n|                                        | Hydro                                  | 6  |\n|                                        | Renewable                              | 8  |\n| Source: eGRID 2021                     |                                        |    |\nDenmark\n100 percent renewable energy from the first day of operations\n\nOur data center came online in 2020. The data center\u2019s construction phase was powered with 100 percent wind energy from a local renewable energy retailer in Denmark. Our Northern Jutland PV project achieved commercial operation in late 2019, will meet all the data center\u2019s near-term energy needs, and at 42 megawatts, is one of Denmark\u2019s largest solar power plants. Our second renewable project in Denmark, a 17 MW wind project, also came online in late 2020. We have secured long-term supply contracts with both Danish renewable projects, which will scale up as our data center loads grow.\n\nThe power system design at the data center is based on a resilient substation that eliminates the need for backup diesel generators. This reduces the carbon footprint of the data center and completely eliminates the need for large diesel fuel storage systems and diesel engine emissions that would impact the local community.\n\nIn 2022, the Denmark data center sourced 27 million kWh of renewable energy, avoiding more than 14,479 metric tons of CO\u2082e.13\n\nChina\n100 percent renewable energy from the first day of operations\n\nTo cover the electricity load at our two data centers in China, we procure 100 percent renewable electricity from a solar project that came online recently in China.\n\nAs the data centers further expand, we\u2019ll continue to source renewable electricity in-country to support the growth with renewable electricity.\n\nIn 2022, the China data center was supported by 98 million kWh of renewable energy, avoiding more than 60,503 metric tons of CO\u2082e during the fiscal year.14\n\n---\n\n13 Emissions avoided are calculated using the GHG Protocol methodology for calculating market-based emissions.\n14 Emissions avoided are calculated using the GHG Protocol methodology for calculating market-based emissions.\nOur colocation facilities\n\nThe majority of our online services are provided by our own data centers; however, we also use third-party colocation facilities for additional data center capacity. While we don\u2019t own these shared facilities and use only a portion of their total capacity, we include our portion of their energy use in our renewable energy goals.\n\nStarting in January 2018, 100 percent of our power for colocation facilities was matched with renewable energy generated within the same country or regional grid. As our loads grow over time, we\u2019ll continue working with our colocation suppliers to match 100 percent of our energy use with renewables.\n\nThird-party computing\n\nBeyond the use of our own data centers and colocation facilities, we also use third-party services to support some of our on-demand cloud computing and storage services. As of 2022, all the electricity associated with Apple\u2019s load at our third-party computing vendors is matched with 100 percent clean energy.\n\n| Year | Total energy use (kWh) | Renewable energy (kWh) | Default utility emissions (metric tons CO\u2082e) | Apple\u2019s emissions \u2014 including renewable energy (metric tons CO\u2082e) | Percent renewable energy (%) |\n|------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| FY2011 | 42,500 | 0 | 10 | 10 | 0 |\n| FY2012 | 38,552,300 | 1,471,680 | 12,300 | 16,500 | 4 |\n| FY2013 | 79,462,900 | 46,966,800 | 31,800 | 14,500 | 59 |\n| FY2014 | 108,659,700 | 88,553,400 | 44,300 | 11,000 | 81 |\n| FY2015 | 142,815,000 | 121,086,100 | 60,500 | 12,700 | 85 |\n| FY2016 | 145,520,900 | 143,063,200 | 66,300 | 1,600 | 98 |\n| FY2017 | 289,195,800 | 286,378,100 | 125,600 | 1,500 | 99 |\n| FY2018 | 327,681,850 | 326,969,700 | 146,600 | 400 | 99.8 |\n| FY2019 | 339,047,649 | 339,047,649 | 146,400 | 0 | 100 |\n| FY2020 | 372,901,398 | 372,901,398 | 163,459 | 0 | 100 |\n| FY2021 | 384,727,076 | 384,727,076 | 146,780 | 0 | 100 |\n| FY2022 | 487,921,930 | 487,921,930 | 182,700 | 0 | 100 |\n\n15. We calculate default utility emissions to provide baseline emissions of what our carbon footprint would have been without the use of renewable energy. This allows us to demonstrate the savings resulting from our renewable energy program.\n\n16. Apple\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions are calculated using the World Resources Institute Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodology for calculating market-based emissions.\n\n17. We calculate our progress toward our 100 percent renewable energy goal on a calendar-year basis, while the numbers reported in this table are based on fiscal year. Beginning January 1, 2018, all the electricity use at our colocation facilities is from 100 percent renewable energy.\n\n18. Over the past few years, we\u2019ve been installing submeters in colocation facilities to better track electricity usage. Beginning in fiscal year 2016, we started reporting this submetered electricity usage. Prior to fiscal year 2016, reported electricity usage was conservatively estimated based on maximum contract capacity quantities. We\u2019ve updated our fiscal year 2016 colocation facilities footprint to more accurately reflect Apple\u2019s operational boundaries. Per the GHG Protocol, we\u2019ve removed from our electricity usage and scope 2 calculations those emissions associated with colocation facility cooling and building operations.\nAppendix C\n\nSupplier Clean Energy Program supplement\nThe Supplier Clean Energy Program is integral to Apple\u2019s goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2030. We\u2019re focused on working with our suppliers to help them increase energy efficiency at their facilities and transitioning suppliers to clean, renewable electricity. These efforts are helping reduce product-related carbon emissions, create a more resilient supply chain, and contribute to healthier communities \u2014 while offering a model for others to follow.\n\nWe\u2019re proud of the progress our suppliers have made. As of March 2023, over 250 manufacturing partners in 28 countries have committed to 100 percent renewable electricity for Apple production (see below for the suppliers participating). Additionally, Apple itself has directly invested in nearly 500 megawatts of renewable electricity projects to cover a portion of upstream emissions. The Supplier Clean Energy Program now has over 20 gigawatts of clean energy commitments, of which nearly two-thirds are operational. In 2022, the Supplier Clean Energy Program and Supplier Energy Efficiency Program together have over 20 gigawatts of clean energy commitments, generating 18.2 million megawatt-hours of clean energy, avoiding 17.4 million metric tons of carbon emissions \u2014 a 23 percent increase over 2021.1\n\n### Apple\u2019s clean energy standards\n\nWe help our suppliers select projects with the greatest potential for impact and with a clear carbon, ecological, and social benefit, and we consider the life cycle emissions associated with current and emerging clean energy technologies. In most cases, wind and solar solutions meet our criteria. For some energy solutions, such as biomass and hydroelectric generation, we review individual projects so that they deliver positive impact while minimizing harm. We also uphold stringent assurance standards so that all clean energy can be verified through third-party assessment.2\n\nWe want to be a driving force for the development of new projects and help overcome barriers to bring new renewable electricity online. With the rapidly changing policy dynamics in some of our key countries, we continuously evolve our framework both to comply with local laws and regulations and to yield the most positive and meaningful energy transformation.\n\n### Supplier energy efficiency and clean energy achievements\n\n| Year | Event | Details |\n|------|-------|---------|\n| 2015 | Launch of the Supplier Clean Energy Program | Initial Apple investment toward the development of 500 megawatts of solar and wind projects to address upstream emissions in Apple\u2019s supply chain. |\n| 2017 | Launch of the Supplier Clean Energy Portal | Supplier Code of Conduct requires suppliers to maintain an inventory of air emissions, including greenhouse gases. |\n| 2018 | Launch of the China Clean Energy Fund | Apple and our suppliers to invest in more than 1 gigawatt of renewable energy in China. |\n| 2019 | Key supplier commitments reached in major supply chain countries | First in-person training hosted by Apple for over 30 suppliers in China. |\n| 2020 | More than 100 suppliers committed to 100 percent renewable electricity for Apple production | All Apple products\u2019 final assembly sites committed to 100 percent renewable electricity for Apple production. |\n| 2021 | 214 suppliers across 26 countries committed to 100 percent renewable electricity for Apple production | Over 250 suppliers committed to 100 percent renewable electricity for Apple production, corresponding to over 80 percent of Apple\u2019s direct manufacturing spend. |\n| 2022 | Apple called on its global supply chain to decarbonize by 2030 | |\n\n---\n\n1 2021 renewable electricity figures associated with Apple\u2019s Supplier Clean Energy Program do not include REC purchases that Apple made to address a small increase to its carbon footprint. When accounting for the REC purchases, the total renewable energy online in Apple\u2019s supply chain was 10.6 gigawatts, generating 18.8 million megawatt-hours and avoiding 14.2 million metric tons of carbon emissions.\n\n2 Apple\u2019s independent assurance provider for the Supplier Clean Energy Program conducts work against standard procedures and guidelines for external verification of sustainability reports, based on current best practice in independent assurance.

This review and verification focuses on Scope 3 emissions for products sold by Apple Inc. (as defined by WRI/WBCSD/Greenhouse Gas Protocol \u2013 Scope 3 Accounting and Reporting Standard). Confidential data relating to product sales and shipments were excluded from the scope of this verification.\n\nThis review and verification covers Apple\u2019s annual greenhouse gas emissions and does not replace reviews conducted for individual product LCAs for greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). The life cycle emissions data produced by Apple for individual products has been calculated in accordance to the standard ISO 14040/14044: Environmental management \u2013 Life cycle assessment \u2013 Principles and framework / Requirements and guidelines. This review and verification furthermore complies with ISO 14064-3: Greenhouse gases \u2013 Part 3: Specification with guidance for the validation and verification of greenhouse gas assertions.\n\nThe review of the annual carbon footprint has considered the following criteria:\n\n- The system, boundaries and functional unit are clearly defined\n- Assumptions and estimations made are appropriate\n- Selection of primary and secondary data is appropriate and methodologies used are adequately disclosed\n\nThese criteria are also fundamental to the review of LCAs conducted for individual product emissions. The reviewers note that the largest share (99%) of Apple Inc. annual carbon footprint is comprised of scope 3 emissions from individual products. The aforementioned criteria have been regularly reviewed by Fraunhofer IZM since 2007 with a view to providing independent feedback that can facilitate continuous improvement and refinement in the LCA methodology applied by Apple Inc.\n\nData reported by Apple is as follows:\n\n| Category          | 2022 MMT CO2e | 2021 MMT CO2e | 2020 MMT CO2e | 2019 MMT CO2e | 2018 MMT CO2e |\n|-------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Manufacturing     | 20.1          | 19.8          | 19.5          | 19.2          | 18.9          |\n| Transportation    | 2.2           | 2.1           | 2.0           | 1.9           | 1.8           |\n| Product Use       | 2.0           | 1.9           | 1.8           | 1.7           | 1.6           |\n| Recycling         | 0.08          | 0.08          | 0.08          | 0.08          | 0.08          |\n| Total base product| 24.3          | 23.6          | 22.9          | 22.8          | 22.5          |\n\nMMT CO2e: million metric tons carbon dioxide equivalents\n\nThe total scope 3 product related carbon footprint is reported to be 27.84 million metric tons CO2e, applying a location-based method reflecting the average emissions intensity of grids on which energy consumption occurs. This figure does not include greenhouse gas emissions reductions for manufacturing resulting from Apple renewable energy projects, supplier renewable electricity purchases, and supplier renewable electricity installations.\n\nBased on the process and procedures conducted, there is no evidence that the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) assertion with regards to scope 3 carbon footprint:\n\n- Is not materially correct and is not a fair representation of GHG data and information, and\n- Has not been prepared in accordance with the related International Standard on GHG quantification, monitoring and reporting.\n\n2 Reviewed Data and Plausibility Check\n\nA verification and sampling plan as required by ISO 14046-3 has been established for the comprehensive carbon footprint review and verification, defining the level of assurance, objectives, criteria, scope and materiality of the verification.\n\nAs part of this review and verification Apple disclosed following data to Fraunhofer IZM:\n\n- Sales data for FY2022, including accessories and including AppleCare, Apple\u2019s extended warranty and technical support plans for their devices.\n- Life cycle GHG emissions for all products, differentiating the actual product configurations (e.g. memory capacity).\n- Calculation methodology for the comprehensive carbon footprint.\n- Detailed analysis of the comprehensive carbon footprint including:\n\nAppendix D\nProduct carbon footprint (Fraunhofer Institute)\nThe breakdown of the carbon footprint into life cycle phases: manufacturing, transportation, product use and recycling.\n\nThe contribution of individual products and product families to the overall carbon footprint.\n\nThe data and information supporting the GHG assertion were projected (use phase and recycling) and historical (i.e. fiscal year 2022 data regarding sales figures, manufacturing, transportation, use patterns where available).\n\nThis review comprises a check of selected data, which are most influential to the overall carbon footprint. The overall plausibility check addressed the following questions:\n\n- Are product LCAs referenced and updated with more recent data correctly?\n- Are results for products, for which no full LCA review was undertaken, plausible?\n\nThis review was done remotely.\n\n3 Findings\n\nIn FY2022 and beginning of FY2023 11 recent product LCA studies have been reviewed successfully against ISO 14040/44. These LCAs cover product segments iPhone, iPad, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro. These recently reviewed LCA studies cover products which represent in total 35.6% of the total scope 3 carbon footprint. Representatives of other product segments (iMac, Apple Watch, iPod, Mac Pro, HomePod, AirPort Express / AirPort Extreme, Apple TV, AirPods and Beats products) underwent no or only minor design changes compared to those which went through a full LCA review in former years. All reviewed LCA studies up to now cover in total 68.4% of the total scope 3 carbon footprint.\n\nAll questions raised in the course of the review were answered by Apple and related evidence was provided where needed.\n\n4 Conclusions\n\nApple\u2019s assessment approach is excellent in terms of granularity of the used calculation data. A significant share of components is modelled with accurate primary data from Apple\u2019s suppliers.\n\nFor all product LCA calculations, where exact data was missing, the principle of a worst-case approach has been followed and results have been calculated with rather conservative estimates.\n\nThe review has not found assumptions or calculation errors on the carbon footprint data level that indicate the scope 3 carbon footprint has been materially misstated. The excellent analysis meets the principles of good scientific practice.\n\nBerlin, March 1, 2023\n\nKarsten Schischke\nFraunhofer IZM\nDept.

The scope of the fiber and plastic packaging footprint includes Apple\u2019s corporate packaging fiber and plastic usage from products, retail operations and Apple care services. The packaging fiber and plastic footprint tracks the total amount of plastic, virgin and recycled wood fibre, that Apple uses in packaging. Apple obtains and analyses supplier-specific data for each product line and sums up these figures for the entire company using sell-in numbers. For some products, a representative supplier is chosen to calculate the product-specific packaging. The output is a total packaging fiber and plastic footprint. For labels, beats products and accessories, individual sell-in numbers were only available for a share of products. These were extrapolated for the whole category. ESD packages (within Apple care) are excluded from the packaging plastic footprint.\n\nThe review of the corporate annual packaging fiber and plastic footprint has considered the following criteria:\n\n- The system boundaries are clearly defined\n- Assumptions and estimations made are appropriate\n- Use of supplier data is appropriate and methodologies used are adequately disclosed\n\nData reported by Apple is as follows:\n\n| Material Type | Total Virgin Recycled Plastic w/o adhesives | Total Fiber |\n|---------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|\n|               | 10,400                                     | 265,700     |\n|               | 10,400                                     | 84,100      |\n|               |                                            | 181,600     |\n\nAll results and figures reviewed for fiscal year 2022 are plausible.\n\n2 Reviewed Data and Findings\n\nAs part of this review Apple disclosed following data to Fraunhofer IZM:\n\n- Calculation methodology for the corporate packaging fiber and plastic footprint\n- Sales data for FY2022, including accessories\n- Selected product and supplier specific data on packaging materials and production yields\n- Aggregated packaging fiber and plastic data for all products and the total corporate packaging fiber and plastic footprint for the fiscal year 2022\n\nThe methodology paper provided by Apple (Packaging Plastic Footprint at Apple \u2013 Methodology Description \u2013 V1.0 in 2018, Fiber Footprint at Apple - Methodology Description - V1.1 reviewed in 2017), is considered a sound and appropriate guidance for determining the company packaging fiber and plastic. Where appropriate, this approach follows methodological principles applied for state-of-the-art Life Cycle Assessments.\n\nThis review comprises a check of packaging fiber and plastic data for selected products (Apple watches, iPhone 12).\n\nPlausibility of some data has been questioned and discussed with Apple in detail. No corrections were needed. However, more granular data for accessories is recommended.\n\nThis review was done remotely. All questions raised in the course of the review were answered by Apple and related explanation was provided where needed.\nBased on the process and procedures conducted, there is no evidence that the corporate packaging fiber and plastic footprint is not materially correct and is not a fair representation of fiber and plastic data and information.\n\nBerlin, March 10, 2023\n\n- Marina Proske -\n  Dept.

Our goal does not include the inks, coatings, or adhesives used in our packaging. We plan to eliminate plastic from the packaging of refurbished Apple products by 2027, once old product packaging designs are phased out.\nTo account for recycled aluminum, we leverage third-party certified recycling data, as well as supplier verified data, meaning it has been reported by the supplier and cross-checked by Apple. Our packaging design guidelines apply to retail packaging and accessories sold by Apple. Our goal does not include industry-average recycled content, which may result in lower coverage of our priority materials to 90 percent or those that have been reported by the supplier and cross-checked by Apple, or supplier reported, meaning it has been reported by the supplier based on production and allocation values. In all cases, Apple defines recycled content in alignment with ISO 14021. We do not currently include industry-average recycled content, which may result in underestimating actual recycled content. Total recycled material shipped in products is driven by product material composition and total sales \u2014 as a result, this overall recyclable or renewable content percentage may fluctuate based on the number and type of products sold each year.\n\nApple's commitment is to use 100 percent recycled cobalt, on a mass balance-system basis, at all Apple-designed batteries beginning in fiscal year 2025. We calculate our use of recycled cobalt on a mass balance-system basis at the end of each fiscal year.\n\nApple's commitment is to use 100 percent recycled tin soldering and gold plating in all Apple-designed rigid and flexible printed circuit boards beginning in fiscal year 2025.\n\nBeginning in fiscal year 2025, we plan to eliminate plastic from our packaging. Apple's goal to eliminate plastics from our packaging includes retail bags, all finished goods boxes (including plastic content in labels and box documentation), packaging sent to our customers as part of Apple Trade In, AppleCare packaging for whole units and service modules (with the exception of plastics needed to prevent electrostatic discharge), and secondary packaging of Apple products and accessories sold by Apple. Our goal does not include the inks, coatings, or adhesives used in our packaging. We plan to eliminate plastic from the packaging of refurbished products beginning in fiscal year 2025, once old product packaging designs are phased out.\n\nBreakdown of U.S. retail packaging by weight: Adhesives, inks, and coatings are excluded from our calculations of plastic content and packaging weight.\n\nRefers to retail packaging.\n\n51 Estimation of acidified plastics, paper, and carbon emissions are based on weight of materials used and projected sale data.\n\n52 Estimation of acidified plastics, paper, and carbon emissions are based on weight of materials per unit and projected sale data.\n\nOur packaging design guidelines apply to retail packaging and shipping, and exclude plastic-based components, snaps, and adhesives.\n\n54 Based on expected equivalent fiber production from our forestry projects and virgin fiber used for Apple product packaging. To determine the output of Apple's projects, we work with our partners to understand the productive potential of these working forests. The forest management plans required to achieve or maintain certification limit harvest volumes to sustainable levels. We use these potential harvest volumes to estimate the sustainable productive capacity of these forests.\n\n55 According to \u201c2021\u20132022 Phone Depreciation Report\u201d published by Battelle, a website that tracks the trade-in and sale value of technology products.\n\n56 This applies specifically to our U.S.-based Trade in Program.\n\n57 MIL-STD 810H is a certification for military equipment.

For sites where these evaporative activities are not present, we estimate that water withdrawal is returned to municipal systems. We estimate our margin of error to be approximately 10 percent, and we will continue to update our model with new sources of data.\n\n63 Based on previous estimated consumption and observed use patterns of nearby facilities.\n\n64 These savings do not include reduction in water use from facility closures and reduced occupancy due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We consider these savings temporary, and we acknowledge that the water use was transferred to employees\u2019 homes.\n\n65 These savings are based on data observed from pilot operations.\n\n66 We account for savings through this program on a fiscal-year basis rather than a calendar-year basis as reported in publications before fiscal year 2021.\n\n67 Per the WRI Volumetric Benefit Accounting methodology.\n\n68 Waste diversion rates do not include construction and demolition waste or electronic waste for fiscal year 2022. Electronic waste is accounted for in the total metric tons of electronic waste that we sent to recycling, found on page 83.\n\n69 These sites have been third-party verified by UL Solutions against the US. 2799 Zero Waste to Landfill Environmental Claim Validation Procedure (ECVP). UL Solutions requires at least 90 percent diversion through methods other than waste-to-energy to achieve Zero Waste to Landfill (Silver: 90\u201394 percent, Gold: 95\u201399 percent, and Platinum: 100 percent) designations.\n\n70 Our Mesa and Prineville data centers are third-party certified as Zero Waste by USGBC TRUE, receiving their certifications in 2021 and 2020, respectively. TRUE requires 90 percent diversion or higher from the landfill without the use of waste-to-energy to achieve the TRUE-certified project designation.\n\n71 All established final assembly supplier sites \u2014 or those that have been Apple suppliers for more than one year \u2014 for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, AirPods, HomePod, Apple TV, and Beats are third-party verified as Zero Waste by UL Solutions US. 2799 Zero Waste to Landfill Environmental Claim Validation Procedure (ECVP).
