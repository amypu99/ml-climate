At Microchip, we continuously strive to reduce, reuse and recycle to minimize our impact on the environment and maximize the benefits of cleaner air, water and land.\nEnvironmental Responsibility\n\nMicrochip is committed to protecting the environment and minimizing the potential environmental impact of our operations and products within the global communities in which we operate. See additional details on the Our Planet page on www.microchip.com.\n\nMicrochip\u2019s environmental initiatives are focused on reducing our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, enabling a clean energy transition, promoting judicial use of water resources and establishing circularity within the value chain. This is demonstrated by the mid- and long-term climate targets we have set for our organization that are aligned with the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\nMicrochip\u2019s Environmental Performance and Goals:\n\n| Focus Area | Mid-Term Goals (Estimated 2030) | Long-Term Goals (Estimated 2040) |\n|------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| GHG Emissions | 50% reduction (Scope 1 + 2) | Net Zero |\n| Energy\u00b9 | 40% global electricity sourced by renewable energy | 100% global electricity sourced by renewable energy |\n| Waste\u00b2 | 80% waste diversion from landfills | 100% waste diversion from landfills |\n\nOur progress towards achieving our climate targets is a culmination of effective and meaningful initiatives taken by our teams worldwide. Notable 2022 accomplishments:\n\n2022 Environmental Performance\u00b3\n\n| Focus Area | Performance |\n|------------|-------------|\n| GHG Emissions \u2013 Scope 1 | Achieved short-term target of reducing normalized emissions by 15% |\n| Energy Consumption | Reduced energy consumption by 10% and sourced 7% of our global electricity from renewables |\n| Waste Diversion | Achieved 60% diversion from landfills and increased our 2030 mid-term goal from 50% to 80% as a result of successful circularity programs implemented by our facilities |\n\n\u00b9 We are committed to increasing the share of renewables in our total electricity use, provided such supply is available at commercially reasonable rates.\n\u00b2 We aim to divert our waste from landfills to the extent technically and commercially feasible.\n\u00b3 All progress is reported against 2018 as a baseline year.\nEmissions and Climate Change\n\nMicrochip is committed to reducing the environmental impact of its operations by reducing the associated GHG emissions. In 2021, we announced our goal to be Net Zero by 2040 and have since set multiple emissions reduction targets as shown in the table below. We remain committed to being aligned below the 1.5\u00b0C scenario as defined by the Paris Climate Agreement through our sustainability approach focused on driving process efficiency within our organization as well as our supply chain.\n\n### Targets\n\n| Scope | Target | Target Year (Estimated) |\n|-------|--------|-------------------------|\n| \u2713 GHG Emissions (Scope 1) | \u2713 15% reduction (normalized) | \u2713 Short-term (2023) |\n| GHG Emissions (Scope 1, 2) | 50% reduction | Mid-term (2030) |\n| GHG Emissions (Scope 1, 2, 3) | Net Zero | Long-term (2040) |\n\n\u2713 Successfully achieved in 2022\n\n### Performance\n\nIn 2022, Microchip successfully achieved its first climate target of reducing normalized Scope 1 emissions by 15% using 2018 as a baseline year. We also continued to reduce our Scope 2 emissions despite an increase in production. The absolute and normalized Scope 2 emissions were down by 14% and 18%, respectively, from our baseline year.\n\n### Scope 1+2 Emissions\n\n**GHG Emissions (Absolute)**\n\n| Year | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| MTCE | 1,000,000 | 800,000 | 600,000 | 400,000 | 200,000 |\n\n**GHG Emissions (Normalized)**\n\n| Year | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| MTCE/Mn Production Units | 200,000 | 150,000 | 100,000 | 50,000 | 0 |\n\n1 Microchip derived the normalized values by dividing the absolute data by \u201cNormalized Production Units.\u201d The normalization factor takes into consideration the quantity of units manufactured, tested, and assembled in a calendar year, and incorporates the associated process or product complexity.\n\n### Scope 3 Emissions\n\n| # | Category\u00b9 | 2021\u00b2 | 2022\u00b2 |\n|---|-----------|-------|-------|\n| 5 | Waste generated in operations | 1,219 | 2,162 |\n| 6 | Business travel | 612 | 6,933 |\n| 7 | Employee commuting | 20,400 | 20,400 |\n\n1 Categories 10, 13, 14, and 15 as defined by the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard were determined to be immaterial to our business operations.\n\n2 Scope 3 emissions were calculated using Quantis Suite 2.0 Scope 3 Evaluator which uses expenditure within a Scope 3 category to estimate the relevant emissions. These emissions are estimates only based on financial data for the reporting period and the actual numbers may differ.\nEmissions-Saving Projects and Strategies\n\nFeatured Projects\n\n- **Scope 1** - We partnered with independent third-party consultants to perform detailed audits of installed tools/equipment at our fabs to guide our upcoming net zero roadmap.\n\n- **Scope 2** - We sourced heating from a climate-friendly district in Karlsruhe, Germany, where 90% of heating is produced from industrial waste heat coming from the Middle Upper Rhine Mineral Oil Refinery and Rheinhafen Steam Power Plant. Additional projects are covered under the following energy efficiency section.\n\n- **Scope 3** - We expanded our trip reduction program to contribute towards improving air quality and decreasing traffic congestion in Maricopa County.

Our commitment to maintaining the highest standards of ethical conduct and business practices builds a foundation from which we can operate with dignity and respect.\nSupply Chain Standards\n\nMicrochip is committed to being a responsible corporate citizen and acting ethically and transparently in accordance with local, national and international laws, regulations and industry standards. Microchip has adopted the RBA Code of Conduct as its standard for labor, health and safety, environment and ethics throughout its supply chain.\n\nIn line with our Guiding Value, \u201cSuppliers, Representatives and Distributors Are Our Partners,\u201d the Supplier Code of Conduct applies to suppliers and their directors, officers, employees, contractors and subcontract labor. The Supplier Code of Conduct requires that suppliers are dedicated to ensuring working conditions are safe, workers are treated with respect and dignity, and business operations are environmentally responsible, conducted ethically and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations throughout their supply chain.\n\nMANVITH N.\nBangalore, India\nThe earth would die if the sun stopped kissing her\nMicrochip recognizes the significant risks and adverse impacts which may be associated with extracting, trading, handling and exporting conflict minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (CAHRAs). Recognizing that Microchip has the responsibility to respect human rights and not contribute to conflict, we commit ourselves to taking actions to source responsibly throughout our operations worldwide.\n\n**Conflict Minerals**\n\nMicrochip is a member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI). The RMI provides companies with independent, third-party audit information regarding which Smelters or Refiners (SORs) have been verified as responsibly sourcing minerals in line with current global standards.\n\nWe perform a Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry (RCOI) on our integrated circuit products supply chain twice per year and publicly disclose our conflict minerals policy, RCOI implementation procedures and SOR sourcing due diligence procedures. More information regarding our RCOI process may be found on Our Supply Chain page on www.microchip.com.\n\nWe use professional third-party consultants to perform due diligence on 3TG SORs that are in our integrated circuit products supply chain. These consultants work with SORs that are non-conformant to RMI standards in order to assist them in becoming conformant.\n\nWe continue to work to remove SORs from our integrated circuit supply chain if they are not cooperating with, or have been removed from, the RMI\u2019s Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP).\n\nOur 2022 RCOI is complete and posted to our website. There may be smelters listed in the RCOI report that are currently not considered Active or Conformant, but these smelters may have been Active or Conformant during the 2022 reporting period.\n\n| 3TG Progress          | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|-----------------------|------|------|------|------|\n| Conformant Smelters   | 224  | 235  | 230  | 222  |\n| Active Smelters       | 0    | 1    | 6    | 1    |\n| Non-Conformant Smelters | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0    |\nHuman Rights\n\nMicrochip is dedicated to protecting human rights. Consistent with our policy, practice and culture, we do not tolerate the use of forced labor and have trade control procedures designed to prevent unauthorized use of our products. As part of our policies and procedures for the protection of our workers and the workers of our supply-chain partners, Microchip joined the RBA in 2020 and adopted its Code of Conduct for our suppliers. In fiscal year 2023, Microchip became an RBA Full Member. Our Human Rights Policy sets standards for labor, health and safety, the environment and ethics for our operations.\n\nIn 2022, Microchip completed RBA Self-Assessment Questionnaires at the corporate level and at our non-U.S. manufacturing facilities. We had independent auditors audit three of our four non-U.S. manufacturing facilities under RBA\u2019s Validated Assessment Program. A summary is in Appendix V of this report.\n\nMicrochip\u2019s Human Rights Policy sets out principles embedded in our business operations and culture designed to prevent us from supporting activities that violate human rights. This policy is based on the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the International Labor Organization\u2019s 1998 Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. The key elements of the policy are ethical business conduct, fair labor practices, diversity, non-discrimination and anti-harassment, safe working conditions, the prevention of forced labor and child labor, and freedom of association.\n\nIn 2021, Microchip enhanced its supplier auditing program to include labor-related questions aligned to the RBA Code of Conduct. To further develop our supply chain assessment methodology, we used the RBA framework and the Responsible Labor Initiative to enhance the analysis of our supply chain\u2019s labor practices, with focus on forced labor and human rights issues. In 2021 and 2022, we surveyed the top 80% of our manufacturing supply chain partners (by spend) resulting in a more than 99% response rate with all responding suppliers meeting our requirements after follow-up. In 2022, we extended the survey to the remaining 20%, resulting in an over 96% response rate. We continue to follow up with the remaining suppliers that have not yet responded, and are investigating certain suppliers. We also implemented enhancements to our qualification process for new suppliers to include forced labor questions.\n\nAdditionally, Microchip does not support or condone the use of our products for applications for which they are not authorized, including actions by Russia against the Ukraine or other military actions against civilians. Therefore, in March 2022, Microchip voluntarily stopped sales of products to Russia and Belarus, even those not restricted by law, because the actions of Russia against the Ukrainian people go against our Guiding Values. We also closed our office in Russia and ended relationships with Russian distributors. Microchip complies with applicable export controls and trade sanctions. We maintain supply chain integrity by methods including screening customers against restricted party lists.\n\nPlease see our Corporate Responsibility page on www.microchip.com for additional information on Microchip\u2019s practices and public disclosures related to protecting human rights.\nMicrochip understands the importance of a robust business continuity program and is committed to maintaining systems designed to provide continuity of supply and provide for mitigation of potential impact to our customers, partners and other stakeholders.\n\nWe have established a Corporate Business Continuity Steering Committee and created a Guidance Document to establish the expectations and standards to be used by all Microchip entities with respect to business continuity planning.

We base recognition, advancement and compensation on an employee\u2019s achievement of excellence in team and individual performance. We are committed to providing strong benefits and wellness programs, safe and inclusive workplaces, continuous opportunities for training and professional development and equal employment opportunities to all.\n\nLearning and Development\n\nEmployees Are Our Greatest Strength\n\nLike the nearly infinite permutations of microcontroller design, every employee brings a unique set of interests and experiences to their work. Microchip\u2019s award-winning Global Organizational Learning and Development (GOLD) department supports each employee on their personal journey to career success. In FY23, employees engaged in over 2,300 live classes, 170,000 online courses, and over 1,200 one-on-one coaching sessions.\n\nWe teach essential business competencies like global teamwork, empowerment and communication. We offer an expanding suite of technical programs for our vibrant engineering community. We enable our client engagement teams to serve our customers with insight and purpose. And we offer specialized resources for people building skills in IT, manufacturing technology and beyond.\n\nTuition reimbursement helps many employees achieve degrees while growing their careers, and we get excited when seeing our talented interns transition to full-time positions after graduation.\n\nMicrochip employees often take up the challenge of leadership service. We are proud of our robust pipeline that offers tailored development for roles from front-line manufacturing to leadership and a serious track record of internal promotion. Over 1,000 people completed leadership programs in FY23.\n\nWe know that diverse and inclusive teams are the strongest teams. Our Working Globally, Crossing Cultures core course brings insight into cultural-behavioral diversity. Inclusive Leadership training was a global FY23 initiative, ensuring that leaders in every function are equipped to consciously foster and sustain a culture of belonging.\n\nEmployees are the heart of Microchip, and it is our privilege to empower our people to innovate, excel and thrive.\nUniversity Programs\nOur university involvement aids in our overall recruitment efforts to attract top talent. We actively recruit at university career fairs, student organization events and conferences and job posting sites. We value the partnerships and brand recognition we have built with top universities through many activities, including judging at engineering-related competitions, participating in campus informational sessions and industry conferences such as IEEE, assisting in curriculum design, sponsoring senior-level capstone projects and serving as guest speakers in various capacities. We also provide product samples, development tools and demo boards to educational institutions in many locations.\n\nNew College Graduates\nWe consider a New College Graduate (NCG) as anyone who successfully completed a bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s degree within the last three years. Microchip hosts a biannual in-person/virtual program in the U.S., Asia and Europe for NCG employees that focuses specifically on their needs by providing engagement with the executive staff, technical training, personal development workshops, a formal mentoring program, team-building activities and community service work. The goal of this program is to prepare our NCG hires for success in their Microchip journey and inspire the next generation of engineers.\n\nInternships\nOur internships provide challenging and rewarding hands-on experience and the opportunity to work closely with senior staff and industry professionals. Our interns contribute to critical projects and significant day-to-day business activities. Their term of service can be anywhere from three months to one year or longer, and many return to Microchip several times during their educational journey. Our goal is to transition as many successful interns as possible to full-time roles upon their graduation.\nBenefits\n\nWe believe our employees are essential to our ongoing success, so our global compensation and benefits programs have been designed to reflect this value. We offer competitive and comprehensive benefits packages to our employees around the world. While the specific details may vary by country or region, Microchip\u2019s philosophy is to provide total compensation for all employees through shared profit and ownership. Microchip has several quarterly cash bonus programs and equity plans (restricted stock units and employee stock purchase program) that allow employees to share in the company\u2019s success and build their personal wealth. Other benefits include retirement savings plans with company match, company-paid holidays, paid vacation and sick leave, family and medical leaves of absence, short- and long-term paid disability, long-term care insurance, health and wellness programs, and continuing education and training opportunities.\n\nPhysical and Financial Health\n\nMicrochip organizes a \u201cWell-Being Management\u201d seminar to provide information about resources that will help support the health and welfare of employees, as well as their dependents and other members of their household. We also support our employees\u2019 physical health by maintaining accessible and affordable on-site medical clinics at our sites in Arizona, Colorado, and Oregon, which serve our front-end manufacturing population as well as employees in other roles. We provide periodic on-site mammograms, prostate exams, and shots for the flu, COVID-19 and pneumonia. In various locations, Microchip also maintains on-site gyms and offers virtual yoga and meditation classes to encourage employees to incorporate healthy habits into their workday.\n\nIn addition to physical health resources, we also offer webinars to educate employees on financial planning. Each year, E*TRADE\u00ae holds sessions to educate employees on tax specifics related to equity. Webinars and resources on investing and retirement are hosted by Fidelity\u00ae. Both E*TRADE and Fidelity offer one-on-one appointments for employees to meet with financial advisors at their convenience. Microchip has also offered webinars with local Social Security personnel to educate employees on Social Security benefits and Medicare.\nEmployee Engagement\n\nLabor/Management Relations\nWhile none of Microchip\u2019s employees are unionized, we do acknowledge the right to collective bargaining where allowed by law. We have strong employee programs to support employees and their families, including robust benefits plans and career development opportunities. In 2022, we had employees participating in collective bargaining agreements in the following countries: Austria (100%), Finland (100%), France (100%), Germany (~65%), Italy (100%) and Spain (100%).\n\nNon-Discrimination and Equal Employment Opportunity\nWe acknowledge the right of all employees and applicants to be treated fairly and as individuals free from any discrimination, including harassment, bullying and intimidation. We provide a safe and inclusive work atmosphere that is free of harassment, and we recognize that our success depends on the inclusion of all qualified people that work for and with our company regardless of race, color, ethnicity, religion, age, national or social origin, ancestry, citizenship status, marital or familial status, physical or mental disability, legally protected medical condition, genetic information, pregnancy, gender (including gender expression, gender identity, transgender and sex stereotyping), sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, or related medical condition and sex stereotyping), sexual orientation, military or veteran protected activity (such as opposition to or reporting of prohibited discrimination or harassment, or seeking an accommodation for a disability), or any other status or classification protected by applicable federal, state and/or local laws.\n\nGOKUL D.\nBangalore, India\nWhen colleagues become friends!\nCommunity Involvement\n\nA great community is measured by the compassionate action of its members. Microchip is an active participant in the communities in which we operate. We give back by supporting and donating to schools, clubs and charities and through volunteer work. To encourage volunteering, we offer our employees two paid days per calendar year to work together with local charities at organized events and serve others. The ways in which we support the local communities where we operate reflect the diversity of the people and the needs of those communities.

These organizations offer hands-on STEM learning through building robots for competition. Students interact with industry mentors and learn workforce skills such as time management, critical thinking, problem solving, teamwork, public speaking and marketing.\n\nIn 2022, Microchip was the organizing sponsor for two FIRST Robotics regional events and the Steve Sanghi Family Foundation sponsored the Arizona FIRST Robotics State Championship, advancing seven FIRST Robotics Competition teams to the FIRST Championship in Houston, TX. Microchip hosted a FIRST Lego League tournament and a VEX Robotics Competition in Chandler, where each event advanced teams to the state championship, including a VEX Robotics Competition team sponsored by Microchip employees. The Ganesh and Hema Moorthy Family Foundation sponsored two new scholarships, joining the two that were sponsored by the Sanghi Foundation. These four scholarships enable students to pursue a college degree in science, engineering or mathematics. Rich Simoncic\u2019s foundation, Simoncic\u2019s Opportunity for Art and Robotics (SOAR), provided registration funding for rookie FIRST Robotics Competition teams to attend the championship event.\n\nMicrochip offers financial and individual support for robotics programs in a variety of ways including:\n\n- Providing a full-time STEM representative to FIRST and VEX\n- Providing a regional director for FIRST in Arizona\n- Awarding financial grants to rookie FIRST and VEX teams\n- Offering facilities, supplies and supply discounts for participants and staff volunteers working with FIRST, VEX and AZFirst, a local non-profit supporting robotics in Arizona\n- Supporting employees who mentor robotics teams and volunteer at events\n- Sponsoring VEX teams for the children of Microchip employees\n- Providing financial sponsorship to two FIRST regional events in Arizona\n- Providing financial sponsorship for the VEX World Championship\nProject C.U.R.E.\n\nProject C.U.R.E. is the world\u2019s largest distributor of donated medical supplies, equipment, and services to resource-limited locations around the globe. Founded in 1987, the organization has shipped more than $1 billion of life-saving resources to 135 nations worldwide. Since 2007, Project C.U.R.E. has been utilizing approximately 46,000 square feet of space donated by Microchip as their Arizona warehouse location, where they collect donations of excess, unused items from local medical facilities and distribute them to hospitals and clinics in developing countries.\n\nIn 2022, the Project C.U.R.E. Phoenix warehouse loaded 17 containers totaling over $6.3 million in Gifts In Kind (GIK) that were ultimately distributed to 11 different countries. Two relief shipments went to Ukraine from this location; the first one departed on March 7, 2022, shortly after the war in Ukraine began. The Phoenix warehouse also assisted with preparing pallets of gauze, dressing, and other medical supplies from six other Project C.U.R.E. warehouses across the U.S. in support of those in need throughout Ukraine. After the 2021 coup in Myanmar, many Burmese refugees fled to Mizoram State, India. The Phoenix warehouse loaded a container of medical relief to help with refugee healthcare and treatment throughout the state.\n\nBy eliminating the overhead cost of maintaining warehouse space, Microchip is enabling Project C.U.R.E. to allocate more funds to providing care and resources to those who need them most. In 2022, this space donated by Microchip allowed Project C.U.R.E. to welcome 2,038 volunteers, who completed over 18,477 hours of service. Microchip employees directly joined in the effort as well, helping to sort and prepare donated items prior to distribution abroad.\n\nSTACEY H.\nMount Holly Springs, United States\nMicrochip supports one another.

Over $246,000 was distributed to communities and organizations that provide educational resources (36%), increase access to health and food support (28%), and contribute to programs needed to help end hunger and homelessness (19%). The remaining funds went to Force for Mighty Change support (11%) and Financial Stability program access (6%). Microchip\u2019s Lifetime Giving support reached $5.86 Mn in 2022 including corporate gifts, special event funds and employee giving.\n\nBRIAN V.\nBurnaby, Canada\n170 km bike ride up Mt.
