Working as a united team around the world embodying one purpose makes a significant impact on the planet and our communities.\u201d\n\nSusan Lorenz-Fisher\nSenior Vice President, Global Sustainability & ESG Integration\nProgram Officer, AmerisourceBergen Foundation\nAbout AmerisourceBergen\n\nBuilt for worldwide health\n\nAmerisourceBergen is a global healthcare solutions leader centered on improving the health of people and animals around the world. Supply chain excellence is at the core of our organization and the platform from which we serve pharmacies, providers, and pharmaceutical partners to impact global access to care and accelerate positive health outcomes. We increase access and advance health equity with a commitment to environmental sustainability as we unite in our responsibility to create healthier futures for all.\n\nWe look to the year ahead with anticipation and excitement as we build a more unified corporate identity as Cencora.\n\nESG at AmerisourceBergen\n\nWe are committed to advancing our environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives to create healthier futures around the world. From a foundation of ethics, integrity, and transparency, we strive to foster a positive impact on the planet and people \u2013 centered on improving access and equity in healthcare \u2013 through three priorities that align with our services and beliefs.\n\n- Purpose-drive team members\n- Resilient and sustainable operations\n- Healthy communities for all\n\nIn keeping with our commitment, we are incorporating an ESG metric into the executive compensation program that furthers our business objectives and aligns to the three priorities of our ESG strategy. The ESG metric, effective for FY23, includes three quantifiable components focused on driving female representation in leadership roles globally, employee inclusion and engagement, and business resiliency planning for climate-driven events.\n\n$230B+\nannual revenue\n\n6.7MM\nproducts shipped daily\n\n44,000+\nteam members\n\n1,300+\nglobal locations\n\n50+\ncountries\n\u201cAntibiotics are essential infrastructure for modern healthcare systems, but lives and livelihoods are at risk from the silent and insidious pandemic of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). AMR is a material risk to the global economy and our financial stability. Our solutions need to consider the whole supply chain, with sustainable antibiotic use as the social and economic norm. I commend the efforts of Alliance Healthcare to mitigate AMR, and through your ESG exemplify your corporate responsibility on the global AMR emergency.\u201d\n\nProfessor Dame Sally Davies, UK Special Envoy on Antimicrobial Resistance\n\nResponding to global health challenges\n\nOur purpose is never more critical than the work we do in times of crisis \u2014 such as our response during the COVID-19 pandemic. Every day, we ship more than 6.7 million healthcare products to our tens of thousands of healthcare provider customers around the world, and this essential work to aid in the delivery of care never ceased throughout the pandemic. We also supported the distribution of vaccines and test kits internationally and continue to serve as the exclusive distributor of emergency use authorization treatments authorized by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n\nBeyond the pandemic, we have further evolved our capabilities and response measures to increase our agility and resiliency in the face of the next crisis. We are well positioned to tackle emerging healthcare challenges, in particular those that disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, due to our global distribution model and strong partnerships with international governments, manufacturers, and non-profits throughout local communities.\n\nIn FY22, we began distributing mpox vaccines, supporting the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to quickly deliver vaccines and treatments to communities with the greatest risk of infection. We are also leveraging our critical position in the supply chain to promote awareness of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a significant global public health issue, and to champion safe and responsible use of antibiotics.\n\nWe also launched AB Health Ventures, a dedicated corporate venture capital fund, with an initial $150 million to invest in and partner with emerging healthcare startup companies to further drive value and innovation over the long term while advancing the development and delivery of healthcare.\nAt AmerisourceBergen, we put people first.\n\nWe strive to provide a safe, supportive work environment where team members can be authentic and have a voice to share their unique perspectives.

We work collaboratively across the enterprise to share best practices in energy efficiency, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions management, waste management, and responsible packaging to maximize our efforts. Additionally, to ensure the resiliency of our operations, we are continuously assessing our climate-related risks so that we can serve our customers and their patients without disruption.
