The divestiture of WarnerMedia in April 2022 created a more streamlined AT&T and helped enable us to invest at record levels to bring the benefits of our 5G and fiber technologies to even more people (page 7).\n\nOur network investment supports increasing customer demand for reliable, high-quality connectivity solutions. In 2022, we realized a 7.7% increase in mobility subscribers, 3.5% increase in postpaid phone subscribers from the previous year, and 15.6 million mobility net subscriber additions. We had 1.2 million net additions of AT&T Fiber\u00ae broadband connections, an increase of 17.5% in 2022. From July 2020 through the end of 2022, we\u2019ve demonstrated sustainable momentum, with 7.5 million postpaid phone net customer additions and 2.9 million AT&T Fiber net adds. This momentum, combined with continued demand for high-quality connectivity services, gives us confidence in our trajectory to deliver profitable and durable growth in 2023 and beyond.\n\nOur focus on fiber and 5G\n\nOur world is being transformed by the widespread and growing availability of 5G and fiber. And AT&T is leading the charge with our ongoing investments in these technologies across our network.\n\nFiber network connections support more bandwidth and faster uploads than standard cable \u2013 in addition to >99.5% proven reliability. We remain committed to our target of passing more than 30 million fiber locations \u2013 including 5 million business locations \u2013 by the end of 2025, having achieved the milestone of passing approximately 24 million fiber locations (including 4 million business locations) at the end of 2022.\n\nOur expanding fiber footprint also helps more people enjoy 5G, as fiber provides critical bandwidth connecting our cell towers back to the internet. We\u2019ve enhanced 5G reliability and launched our mid-band 5G spectrum. At the end of 2022, our 5G network covered more than 285 million people.\n\nPeople across the country rely on our fast and secure 5G network, which is critical to our efforts to help close the digital divide (page 10), reimagine healthcare and tackle supply chain challenges. AT&T 5G also supports FirstNet\u00ae \u2013 America\u2019s public safety network \u2013 providing first responders with the critical connectivity they need to save lives (see page 14).\n\n| Increase in mobility subscribers | Increase in AT&T Fiber broadband connection net adds |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| 7.7%                            | 17.5%                                         |\n\n**READ MORE**\n\n- 2022 Annual Report\n- 2022 10-K\n- 2023 Proxy Statement\n\n**CONNECTING MORE PEOPLE TO GREATER POSSIBILITY**\n\n| Total U.S. Mobility Subscribers (thousands) | U.S. Postpaid Phone Subscribers (thousands) | AT&T Fiber Broadband Connections (thousands) |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n| 182,558 | 201,791 | 217,397 | 64,216 | 67,260 | 69,596 | 4,951 | 5,992 | 7,215 |\n| 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n| 24M | 285M | 2022 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\nNetwork Quality & Reliability\n\nWe provide customers with the connectivity they need via a network built for speed, security, reliability and overall performance.\n\nOver the past 5 years, we\u2019ve invested more than $140 billion primarily in our U.S. wireless and wireline networks, including capital investments and acquisitions of wireless spectrum. Our network covered more than 2.9 million square miles at the end of 2022, including:\n\n- Reliable 5G that covered more than 285 million people in nearly 24,000 cities and towns.\n- Fiber passed at approximately 24 million locations across more than 100 U.S. metro areas.\n\nReliability when it\u2019s needed most\n\nBecause network connectivity is central to our lives, we are collecting and analyzing data on our network 24/7 to ensure it\u2019s working correctly, to improve its performance and to deliver the best customer experience.\n\nWe\u2019ve developed a comprehensive network resilience program to maximize service continuity in the face of extreme weather and other disruptions. The AT&T Weather Operations Center helps us stay prepared by proactively monitoring potential nature-related threats to our network, employees and communities.\n\nFor example, in the lead up to Hurricane Ian, AT&T was able to position disaster response equipment and personnel in strategic areas to respond faster when the storm made landfall (see page 14 for more on our response to Hurricane Ian).\n\nWhen disaster strikes, AT&T is there. Our Network Disaster Recovery program helps rapidly restore communications to affected areas. We have invested more than $650 million in the program, and our employees have dedicated 160,000 working hours to recovery exercises that test the preparedness of our equipment and capabilities.\n\nAT&T was awarded most reliable 5G network according to Global Wireless Solutions OneScore for the 2nd year in a row.\n\nINCREASE IN WIRELESS NETWORK COVERAGE (SQUARE MILES) ~100K\n\nINCREASE IN LENGTH OF FIBER LAID IN THE U.S. (MILES) >60K\n\nNETWORK TRAFFIC ON AN AVERAGE BUSINESS DAY (PETABYTES) 594\n\nCAPITAL INVESTMENT9 $24.3B\n\n> $140B invested primarily in our U.S. wireless and wireline networks over the past five years (2018\u20132022), including capital investments and acquisitions of wireless spectrum.\n\nMore than $650M invested in our Network Disaster Recovery program.\n\nREAD MORE\n\n- Network Quality & Reliability Issue Brief\nNetwork Quality & Reliability\n\nIncreasing climate resilience\n\nOur approach to climate risk recognizes that we must not only transition to a low-carbon economy (page 24), but importantly, address the physical impacts of climate change. Building climate resilience means understanding the threats we face from climate change and taking steps to prepare our infrastructure to withstand more frequent extreme weather. Fortifying our network helps ensure continuity for the millions of people who depend on our connectivity services every day.\n\nIn collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne), we developed AT&T\u2019s Climate Change Analysis Tool (CCAT), which helps visualize wind, drought, wildfire and flooding at the neighborhood level \u2013 up to 30 years in the future. With CCAT, we can take climate change into account as we plan for network buildouts, maintenance and disaster preparedness. We also collaborated with Argonne and the Federal Emergency Management Authority to share our climate expertise more widely through the launch of ClimRR, a climate risk and resilience portal that offers CCAT data for community preparedness initiatives across the U.S. (page 15).\n\nIn 2022, we continued to enhance our climate risk management by engaging an external vendor to conduct a scenario analysis, building on our existing climate impact assessment work. Relevant insights will be incorporated into AT&T sustainability governance, risk management, and financial and strategic planning processes.\n\nREAD MORE\n\n- Climate Change & Greenhouse Gas Emissions Issue Brief\n- Network Quality & Reliability Issue Brief\n\nPRIVACY AND NETWORK SECURITY\n\nEveryone deserves a safe, secure online experience, and AT&T is committed to protecting the privacy and security of all our customers.

But many people can\u2019t reliably access the internet, as millions of Americans still don\u2019t have broadband internet access at home. Others also miss out because they don\u2019t have the skills necessary to take full advantage of its potential. Through our ongoing investment to help close this digital divide, we\u2019re helping more people get online and connected to greater possibilities.\nWe\u2019ve committed $2 billion to helping close the digital divide by focusing not only on access to affordable high-speed internet, but also the skills and community resources that encourage safe and successful adoption.\n\n**ACCESS**\n\nWe\u2019re keeping customers and communities connected through investing in our network (page 7) and working with state and local officials to extend our broadband networks.\n\nWe\u2019re also providing access to AT&T Fiber, Wi-Fi, and computers at AT&T Connected Learning Centers in underserved neighborhoods (page 11).\n\n**AFFORDABILITY**\n\nAT&T is participating in the FCC\u2019s Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) to help make wired and wireless services more affordable for millions of American households.\n\nBy combining the federal ACP benefit with one of the Access from AT&T plans, eligible households can take advantage of free high-speed internet.\n\n**ADOPTION**\n\nHaving a broadband connection and digital resources isn\u2019t enough. The AT&T Connected Learning initiative equips people and communities with digital literacy skills so they can thrive online (page 13). It also helps communities understand and appreciate the value of their connectivity.\n\n**CONNECTING TOWNS ACROSS AMERICA**\n\nNearly 1 in 4 rural Americans say that broadband internet access is a major problem in their communities. Throughout 2022, AT&T continued to partner with state and local authorities in smaller towns and cities to address this issue. These efforts contribute to our target to pass more than 30 million fiber locations, including business locations, in the United States by the end of 2025.\n\nWe began work on a $24 million collaboration between AT&T and the city of Amarillo, Texas to bring reliable, high-speed internet to more than 22,000 residential and business locations in the city. One of the areas that will benefit directly is East Amarillo\u2019s Barrio neighborhood, which has been the focus of a revitalization plan since 2018.\n\nIn Kentucky, Oldham County selected AT&T to build a state-of-the-art fiber network that will connect every home and small business in the county. In neighboring Indiana, we\u2019ve been working with the City of Martinsville, the City of Boonville and Vanderburgh County on fiber projects that will bring the benefits of broadband to their communities.\n\nAll these investments help narrow the digital divide so all Americans have the opportunity to connect to a better future.\nDigital Divide\n\nExpanding access to low-cost broadband\n\nEstablished in 2016, Access from AT&T makes low-cost internet service available for qualifying low-income households. In 2022, we expanded the program\u2019s eligibility to all households that qualify for ACP and apply the federal benefit to AT&T internet service. We also updated the program to include speeds up to 100 Mbps where available. We work with grassroots organizations to ensure low-income people and families are aware and can take advantage of the offer.\n\n$2B\nour 3-year commitment to address the digital divide\n\n20\nConnected Learning Centers opened by end of 2022\n\n50+\nConnected Learning Centers to be opened by end of 2024\n\nAT&T Connected Learning\n\nThrough AT&T Connected Learning\u2120, we\u2019re investing in technology, digital literacy and digital learning solutions to help connect today\u2019s learners with success. We\u2019re guided by our target to reach 1 million people in need with digital resources by year-end 2025, and had reached more than 290,000 by the end of 2022.\n\nPROGRESS: PROVIDE 1 MILLION PEOPLE IN NEED WITH DIGITAL RESOURCES BY YEAR-END 2025\n\n290,000 people reached\n0 Targeting 1,000,000 people by year-end 2025\n\nWe\u2019ve established AT&T Connected Learning Centers in underserved neighborhoods across the country, working with local community organizations to provide students and families free access to high-speed fiber internet, Wi-Fi and Dell computing devices. AT&T employees also serve as tutors and mentors at these centers through our AT&T Believes\u2120 volunteerism initiative (page 21).\n\nIn 2022, we opened centers in cities including:\n\n- Atlanta\n- Augusta, Georgia\n- Chicago\n- Cleveland\n- Detroit\n- Houston\n- Los Angeles\n- San Francisco\n- Tupelo, Mississippi\n- Raleigh, North Carolina\n\nWe reached our target to open at least 20 AT&T Connected Learning Centers by 2023 and have increased our ambition to establish more than 50 centers by the end of 2024.\n\nPROGRESS: OPEN MORE THAN 50 CONNECTED LEARNING CENTERS BY YEAR-END 2024\n\n20 centers opened\n0 Targeting more than 50 centers by year-end 2024\n\nWe\u2019re also providing technology and equipment directly to low-income learners who need it most.

The Esperanza center offered her free access to high-speed broadband, Wi-Fi and computers, as well as educational and mentoring resources. Despite thinking it was too late at age 42 to learn digital skills, Ivy got online at Esperanza and has started taking college classes.\n\nOn the other side of Cleveland, the AT&T Connected Learning Center within the Ashbury Senior Computer Community Center hosted a block party in 2022 that brought together more than a hundred neighbors. At the event, attendees learned about how they can access low-cost internet through Access from AT&T and many parents with school-age children took home refurbished laptops.\n\nOur 2 Cleveland AT&T Connected Learning Centers \u2013 and the growing number of others across the country \u2013 demonstrate one way AT&T is committing to closing the digital divide, from school kids to retirees and everyone in between.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people like me, who are struggling, and the AT&T Connected Learning Center at Esperanza brings us hope.\u201d\n\nIvy Fontanez, Esperanza client\n\nRead more about Ivy\u2019s experience at Esperanza.\nDigital Divide\n\nDigital literacy and digital learning\n\nEven with access to affordable internet, many lack the skills, tools and resources to navigate the web safely and effectively. Through AT&T Connected Learning, we provide free digital literacy and learning resources for parents, caregivers and families. In 2022, we made hundreds of educational videos, lessons and learning activities available to students through The Achievery, a free and safe online distance learning platform offering educational content and lesson plans aligned with academic standards.\n\nWe also collaborated with organizations including All4Ed, National After School Association, Connected Nation, Digitunity and others \u2013 to help bring The Achievery to students in and out of school. In 2022, more than 78,000 students participated in learning with The Achievery.\n\n78,000+ students participated in learning activities through The Achievery\n\nOur impact is amplified when we equip community members with the tools and expertise necessary to act as digital navigators - facilitators that help others in their community develop digital skills necessary to leverage their internet access. In 2022, we invested $2.5 million to launch our digital navigator program and community-based IT helpdesk that will provide training to community members in navigator roles. Deploying digital navigators within local communities has been proven to drive adoption across underrepresented communities because residents feel more comfortable and safer receiving help through local organizations.\n\nCOLLABORATING FOR IMPACT\n\nThrough our collaboration with the Public Library Association (PLA), we worked to bring bilingual, in-person digital literacy workshops to 160 libraries in 2022.\n\nTo help us gauge the effectiveness of our workshops, we collaborated with the PLA to survey participants about their experience. As indicated by the results below, the vast majority felt more confident and knowledgeable about digital resources as a result of their participation in a library workshop and intend to apply what they\u2019ve learned.\n\n- 88% feel more confident using digital resources\n- 90% feel more knowledgeable about using digital resources\n- 91% intend to apply what they\u2019ve learned\nCommunity Resilience\n\nWhen disaster and tragedy strike, it\u2019s crucial that people are able to connect with loved ones and access what they need to get back on their feet.\n\nRecognizing the important role we play as a connectivity provider, we\u2019ve set a target to help 1 million people prepare for and recover from the impacts of disasters by year-end 2030. This commitment focuses on essential support for communities and public safety through strategic partnerships beyond our normal emergency response and network disaster recovery operations. For example, we have partnered with Information Technology Disaster Resource Center, a volunteer organization that provides connectivity and charging solutions to support survivors in times of crisis.\n\nSince establishing the target in 2021, we have helped more than 500,000 individuals prepare for and recover from natural disasters.\n\nConnecting first responders through FirstNet\u00ae\n\nWhen first responders get the call, a reliable network is essential to coordinate their response. To address this critical need, the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet Authority) partnered with AT&T to deliver FirstNet, Built with AT&T \u2013 the only network built specifically for America\u2019s first responders and extended public safety community. FirstNet stands above commercial offerings by providing first responders with truly dedicated coverage and capacity when they need it, unique benefits like always-on priority and preemption and innovative mission-ready solutions. Throughout 2022, FirstNet played an important role in supporting community safety, including during and after the Colorado and Yosemite fires, flooding in Kentucky, and Hurricane Ian.\n\nRecognizing that disasters have contributed to a mental health crisis among our nation\u2019s first responder community, we established the FirstNet Health & Wellness Coalition to coordinate holistic health and wellness support. Through the Coalition, we provided health and wellness training to nearly 12,000 first responders.\n\n>99%\n\nU.S. population covered by AT&T and FirstNet networks\n\nOUR RESPONSE TO HURRICANE IAN\n\nHurricane Ian struck Florida in September 2022, bringing record flooding and significant devastation to Gulf Coast communities. Prior to landfall, the AT&T Weather Operations Center (page 7) tracked Ian\u2019s approach to help us set up resources in strategic locations to expedite our response. As the storm passed, the FirstNet Response Operations Group at AT&T responded to more than 110 public safety requests with first responders and deployed more than 85 full-scale communications solutions to support response efforts.\n\nIn the aftermath, we opened our networks so people from all carriers could connect with loved ones \u2013 even if their carriers\u2019 services were not available because of the storm. To ease financial pressures as communities recovered and rebuilt, we waived various service charges and fees for affected residents and businesses.\n\nAT&T and the AT&T Foundation provided further support by donating $400,000 to local organizations for recovery efforts (page 22).\nCommunity Resilience\n\n\u201cOur resilience is interconnected with that of our communities \u2013 that's why we're helping others prepare for the impact of severe weather in the years to come.\u201d\n\nCharlene Lake\nAT&T Chief Sustainability Officer & SVP Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nHelping communities adapt to climate change\n\n1 in 3 Americans say they have been personally affected by an extreme weather event in the past 2 years. As these events become more frequent and intense, community leaders need to understand how they can better protect critical infrastructure and vulnerable populations.\n\nWe're helping communities enhance their resilience through the launch of a climate data platform called the Climate Risk and Resilience Portal (ClimRR) \u2013 developed in partnership with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Argonne National Labs.\n\nClimRR gives local and state leaders free access to localized climate data about potential future climate-related risks and how their community could be affected. Similar to how AT&T uses climate data to inform its own investment decisions (page 8), ClimRR can inform where and how communities can make their own infrastructure more resilient. It can also support community preparation initiatives through an enhanced understanding of how climate hazards may evolve into the future.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nClimate Change & Greenhouse Gas Emissions Issue Brief\nClimRR on AT&T website\nEmployees\n\nAcross all 50 U.S. states and in more than 55 countries, AT&T employees deliver technology and telecommunications services to millions of consumers and businesses every day.

The feedback behind this score demonstrates that employees are proud to be associated with AT&T and feel a sense of personal accomplishment from their work, among other factors.\n\nEngagement scores and other AT&T Employee Survey results are shared throughout the organization, and leaders take responsibility for targeted initiatives based on feedback from their teams. For example, as part of our ongoing cultural transformation initiative, we\u2019ve been amplifying our most effective corporate behaviors and empowering employees to simplify or discontinue business practices that no longer aid in the success of our company.\n\nCONNECTING OUR PEOPLE TO WHAT MATTERS\n\nEmployees who participate in community engagement programs are significantly more likely to stay with the business, recommend AT&T as a place to work, and generally feel better about working for the company.\n\nRecognizing the importance of connecting our people to our social and environmental efforts, we\u2019re working to increase employee awareness of our commitments to address the digital divide and climate change.\n\nAT&T employees are volunteering to bridge the digital divide in their local communities (page 21), stepping up as Environmental Champions (page 22), and innovating to help our business customers reduce their emissions (page 26).\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I)\n\nBy building a diverse, equitable and inclusive workforce, we help strengthen and empower the many communities in which we live, work and play. Our approach to DE&I puts our employees and their experiences at the heart of our inclusive culture, valuing and celebrating the diversity of their backgrounds, perspectives and abilities.\n\nWe prioritize recruiting and hiring talented people who reflect the world in which we live, with heightened focus on growing our senior leadership pipeline of diverse talent. We also continue to focus on ensuring diversity in promotions and professional development (see page 20 for more on how we integrate DE&I into our training efforts).\n\nEmployee Group members are our organization\u2019s cultural lifeblood and at the forefront of our efforts to advance DE&I. In 2022, more than 40,800 employees participated in networking, volunteering and fundraising opportunities sponsored by Employee Groups. In addition, our Employee Groups awarded more than 300 scholarships totaling more than $565,000.\n\nWe\u2019re proud to be recognized by top DE&I organizations for our support of diverse communities in 2022.\n\n**Employee Demographics (End of Year 2022)**\n\n- **37%** women in senior management\n- **49%** people of color in U.S. workforce\n- **>6.7K** individuals with disability in U.S. workforce\n- **>11.4K** veterans in U.S. workforce\n- **>2.7K** individuals identify as LGBTQ+ in U.S. workforce\n\n**Hiring and Advancing at AT&T (2022 Reporting Period)**\n\n- **37%** of new hires were women\n- **65%** of new hires were people of color\n- **75%** of open positions were filled by women and/or people of color candidates\n- **69%** of internal promotions were filled by women and/or people of color candidates\n\n**Read More**\n\n- Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Issue Brief\n- AT&T Diversity, Equity & Inclusion website\n\n**Employee Group Members**\n\n- Bloomberg Gender Equality Index\n- DiversityInc Top 50 Companies for Diversity\n- Best Places to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality\n- Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion\n\n**Overview**\n\n- Shareholders & Customers\n- Communities\n- Employees\n- Environment\n- Suppliers\n- Progress Toward Goals\n\n**AT&T 2022 Sustainability Summary**\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I)\n\nEquality First\n\nIn 2021, we began our Equality First movement with the launch of the Equality First mobile app, giving employees access to an immersive hub of content and hands-on tools. The content within the app continues to grow, including personal storytelling from employees across the broad spectrum of diversity at AT&T, as well as major film festival shorts that bring stories from the communities we serve to employees. We provide this content at no cost to our employees, all while investing back in the filmmakers who create it to continue their art and connect with greater possibilities.\n\nIn 2022, we expanded the Equality First offering to introduce a desktop experience focused on building inclusive leadership practices. This imperative provides people leaders the tools needed to make small, incremental changes to their behaviors that add up to big cultural changes over time. The platform offers bite-sized learning on our key DE&I pillars that can be integrated into daily operations and provides a safe, private forum for discussing the content, asking questions, and sharing challenges. With this experience, our people leaders:\n\n- Improve trust-building know-how, built on a foundation of psychological safety.\n- Learn how to communicate to inspire broader audiences.\n- Sharpen their ability to recognize and counteract how bias impacts their teams\u2019 work and relationships.\n- Upskill in assessing team members\u2019 contributions through the lenses of inclusion and equity.\n- Gain expertise to more consciously and comfortably build diverse teams.\n\nPEOPLE, PURPOSE AND POSSIBILITY\n\nThe annual AT&T Employee Group conference is one of the most anticipated employee events of the year. Under the banner of People, Purpose and Possibility, the 2022 conference brought together 1,000 employees in five locations across the U.S. and Mexico, and another 15,000 online attendees from 21 different countries. Employees said that the conference showcased how AT&T is truly living diversity and inclusion, and more than 90% of attendees said they would recommend the conference to a colleague.\n\nWhen surveyed about the AT&T Employee Group conference, our people said:\n\n\u201cI loved the energy, it really helped to keep me engaged and I would attend this event again.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat event, it really provided a big picture of the level of diversity at AT&T.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE\n\n- Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Issue Brief\n- AT&T Diversity, Equity & Inclusion website\nTraining & Career Development\n\nWhen our employees succeed, our company does better. We invest in skills development programs for our people throughout their careers. Through these efforts, we help our employees \u2013 and our business \u2013 thrive.\n\nIn 2022, our employees completed an average of 30 courses per employee through AT&T Learning & Development \u2013 our award-winning internal training organization that engages our team with training, mentoring and career development programs. We also partner with learning institutions such as Harvard Business and LinkedIn Learning to offer leadership and career courses. Key outcomes of our training and development programs in 2022 include:\n\n- **$135M** investment in employee training and professional development programs\n- **197K** employees reached\n- **8M** total hours of employee training\n- **$10.5M** tuition assistance for employees\n- **326K** hours devoted to upskilling for future roles\n\n**PROGRAMS FOR ALL CAREER STAGES**\n\nOur training and skills development activities are designed to maximize our employees\u2019 success in their current roles and support their future aspirations.\n\n**NEW HIRE TRAINING**\n\nWe focus on creating a positive onboarding experience for all candidates to ensure their job readiness and continued engagement. In 2022, we delivered 4 million hours of new hire training to help incoming employees learn about the company and their department-specific roles and responsibilities.\n\n**ROLE-SPECIFIC SKILLS**\n\nWe help employees develop role-specific skills through training optimized to their current position. For example, our Real Time Training method helps employees develop role-specific skills by using machine learning to deliver short-form training content to the right employees at the right time. With Real Time Training, we are able to identify who needs training and when, as well as which training solution is most likely to drive the greatest performance improvements for the employee\u2019s respective key performance indicators.\n\n**ADVANCED LEARNING PROGRAMS**\n\nOur advanced learning programs help employees identify the most impactful path to grow their skills. In 2022, employees recorded 2.1 million training hours on advanced learning programs, with 326,000 hours registered toward employee upskilling for a future role.\n\n**DEVELOPING LEADERSHIP SKILLS**\n\nIn 2022, we reimagined our approach to leadership development. We focused on developing and enhancing leadership skills and capabilities that aim to develop leaders who can play a role in developing others and who can role model key future capabilities for the rest of the organization. Participants in programs AT&T Learning & Development facilitates gain strategic exposure and engagement opportunities with their peers and other AT&T leaders.\n\nConsistent with our talent strategy to meaningfully improve leadership diversity at AT&T, AT&T Learning & Development facilitates several programs targeted at developing diverse leaders. Examples include:\n\n- Leadership Education for Asian Pacifics\n- SMU Rising Latino Leaders Program\n- Black Enterprise Black Men Xcel Summit\n- Black Enterprise Black Women of Power Summit\nCommunity Engagement\n\nThrough their jobs and beyond, our employees connect people to greater possibility every day.\n\nOur people are dedicated to amplifying their positive impact through a range of community engagement initiatives. Throughout the year, AT&T employees contribute their time and resources to organizations and causes including bridging the digital divide, disaster relief, and environmental stewardship. Recognizing the importance of community engagement to our team, we established a target to engage 50% of employees in grassroots volunteering and charitable giving initiatives by year-end 2030. At the end of 2022, we had engaged 31% of employees and continue to progress toward our target.18\n\nPROGRESS: ENGAGE 50% OF EMPLOYEES IN VOLUNTEERISM AND GIVING BY YEAR-END 2030\n\n0% engagement\n\nTargeting 50% by year-end 2030\n\nREAD MORE\n\n- Community Engagement & Philanthropy Issue Brief\n- AT&T Believes website\n\nAT&T BELIEVES AND THE DIGITAL DIVIDE\n\nThrough AT&T Believes\u2120, our global employee volunteer program, our people participate in grassroots efforts to create positive change in local communities.\n\nAddressing the digital divide was a major focus for AT&T Believes in 2022. Throughout the year, U.S. employees volunteered to support underserved learners at AT&T Connected Learning Centers both virtually and in-person (see page 11 for more on AT&T Connected Learning Centers). Our employees helped students reach their full potential by serving as tutors and mentors, teaching digital literacy workshops, and participating in computer distribution events.\n\nHelping close the digital divide was the focus of a company-wide employee engagement campaign, Bridge to Possibility: Closing the digital divide, together. During the campaign, AT&T employee volunteers beautified five Connected Learning Centers and our Employee Groups (see page 18) assembled 10,000 connected learning kits for distribution to 18 local communities. The kits provide tools to support students in completing their schoolwork online.\nCommunity Engagement\n\nOur Environmental Champions\n\nOur Environmental Champions program engages employees in our work to protect the environment by equipping them with information and skills to help them live and work more sustainably. The program has grown to include more than 1,800 individuals, who incorporate learnings into their own lives and share information with colleagues and friends. Our employees also took part in environmental stewardship projects including building bee habitats, planting seed balls, and cleaning up parks and lakes.\n\nThe generosity of our people\n\nWe encourage our employees to donate to causes they care about through a year-round giving program. In 2022, more than 40,000 AT&T employees generously donated $15.7 million to more than 17,000 charities. AT&T is committed to helping employees further their philanthropic impact. We offer a program that matches employee charitable contributions to 501(c)(3) nonprofits and allows employees to earn Volunteer Rewards \u2013 grants based on time volunteering in the community that can be directed to the 501(c)(3) charity of their choice. In 2022, more than 45,000 employees earned Matching and Volunteer Rewards.\n\nOur people also supported special fundraisers throughout the year. Employees donated more than $250,000 to support the citizens of Ukraine, the communities of Uvalde and Buffalo, survivors of Hurricanes Fiona and Ian, and more (see page 14 for additional information on our community resilience efforts).\n\nTOTAL AMOUNT OF CORPORATE AND AT&T FOUNDATION GIVING\n\n$89.1M\n\nTOTAL AMOUNT CONTRIBUTED OR DIRECTED THROUGH CORPORATE, EMPLOYEE AND AT&T FOUNDATION GIVING PROGRAMS\n\n$104.8M\n\nTOTAL VALUE OF EMPLOYEE VOLUNTEERISM\n\n$11.6M\n\nPERCENTAGE OF EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE ENGAGED IN COMMUNITIES THROUGH GRASSROOTS VOLUNTEERISM AND GIVING INITIATIVES\n\n31%\n\nREAD MORE\n\nCommunity Engagement & Philanthropy Issue Brief\nEnvironment\n\nAs one of the world\u2019s largest companies, we can play a role in creating a better, more environmentally sustainable future. We\u2019re acting to address climate change and prepare for its impacts because it is good for our business, for the stakeholders we serve and for our planet.\n\nWe\u2019re on our way to carbon neutrality by the end of 2035 and are actively working with our suppliers and customers to help reduce their environmental impact as well.\n\nANNUAL ENERGY PRODUCTION OF OUR U.S. RENEWABLE ENERGY PORTFOLIO\n\n2.9 M MWh\n\nU.S. EPA GREEN POWER PARTNER LIST RANKING\n\n6th\n\nCUSTOMER EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO AT&T SMART CLIMATE SOLUTIONS SINCE 2018 (METRIC TONS CO\u2082e)\n\n149.2 M\n\nGROSS ANNUALIZED COST SAVINGS SINCE 2015 FROM ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECTS\n\n$663 M\nCarbon Neutrality\n\nClimate change is one of the world\u2019s most pressing challenges. Our connectivity can be part of the solution.\n\nGuided by our Climate Strategy and Transition Plan, we\u2019re acting to address climate change and prepare for its impacts. We have set a goal to be carbon neutral, targeting net zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for our operations by the end of 2035, guided by a science-based target (SBT) aligned with keeping global temperature increases to below 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nWe continue to progress toward our carbon neutral and SBT ambitions, having reduced emissions by more than 41% at the end of 2022 (2015 baseline).\n\nLooking beyond AT&T\u2019s operations, we\u2019ve achieved our objective for at least 50% of our suppliers to set their own science-based targets (page 29). We\u2019ve also committed to supporting a gigaton of customer emissions reductions through our Gigaton Goal (page 26).\n\nEnhancing our efficiency\n\nOur greatest opportunity for emissions reductions is to reduce electricity consumption and accelerate our energy efficiency efforts. Being smarter with purchased electricity also brings financial savings \u2013 as we drive kilowatts out of the business, we remove both emissions and energy-related costs.\n\nFrom 2015 through 2022, we\u2019ve implemented approximately 161,000 energy efficiency projects across the organization. These projects reduced our Scope 2 emissions and amounted to gross annualized savings of approximately $663 million. We will continue to act on opportunities to drive down energy consumption in support of our carbon neutral goal.\n\nReducing fleet emissions\n\nOur carbon neutral goal also includes reducing emissions from our global fleet. We expect to reduce our fleet emissions \u2013 which currently account for 51% of our Scope 1 emissions \u2013 at least 76% by 2035. Our strategy involves optimizing routes, switching to hybrid and electric vehicles and reducing the overall size of the fleet.\nCarbon Neutrality\n\n\u201cWe're investing in renewable energy because it is good for the planet and good for our business.\u201d\n\nSupporting clean energy\n\nAT&T is one of the largest corporate buyers of renewable energy in the U.S.24 Over the past few years, AT&T has transitioned from generating only a few megawatt-hours of renewable energy to being #6 on the EPA Green Power Partner List.\n\nGoing big on renewable energy also benefits local communities. AT&T-backed renewable energy projects are creating hundreds of construction jobs and dozens of permanent jobs in the fast-growing clean energy sector. In early 2022, we confirmed 2 virtual power purchase agreements from new solar projects in Maryland and Pennsylvania \u2013 generating up to 300 construction jobs in each state.\n\nWe also administered a national request for proposal in 2022 to procure community solar subscriptions. This resulted in executed agreements with 38 wetted community solar projects across 4 states \u2013 totaling a maximum capacity of 55 MW \u2013 that are projected to save AT&T $15 million over a 15-year term. These agreements will enable the production of over 191,000,000 kWh of clean energy per year, avoiding over 135,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions.\n\nWe remain committed to expanding our clean energy efforts and expect to continue to grow our renewable energy portfolio. This will be an integral part of how we meet our emissions reduction goals.\n\n2.9 M MWh\nannual energy production of our U.S. renewable energy portfolio\n\nJoe Taylor\nAT&T Vice President of Global Infrastructure Optimization & Implementation\nGigaton Goal\n\nWe are amplifying our climate efforts by developing innovations that help others become more efficient and manage their carbon footprints. Since 2015, we have been working with business customers and nonprofits to drive adoption of AT&T Smart Climate Solutions that reduce GHG emissions.\n\nRecognizing the opportunity for connectivity solutions to support emissions reductions at scale, we established the Gigaton Goal \u2013 a commitment to help our customers collectively reduce a gigaton of GHG emissions by the end of 2035 (2018 baseline). At the end of 2022, we\u2019ve supported 149.2 million metric tons of customer emissions reductions \u2013 approximately 15% of the way toward our Gigaton Goal.25\n\nConnected Climate Initiative\n\nThrough the Connected Climate Initiative (CCI), we convene the brightest minds from leading technology companies, AT&T Business customers, universities and nonprofits to identify best practices, develop new products and scale innovations. The CCI drives our Gigaton Goal progress through increasing the adoption of Smart Climate Solutions that use AT&T connectivity to reduce emissions.\n\nSome of the Smart Climate Solutions that the CCI worked on in 2022 include:\n\n- **SALESFORCE**\n  Integrating AT&T Internet of Things (IoT) solutions into the Salesforce Net Zero Cloud to make it easier for customers to monitor assets in near real-time and quickly identify emissions reduction opportunities.\n\n- **GEOTAB**\n  Working with GeoTab to help customers make informed decisions about how to electrify their fleets.\n\n- **MICROSOFT AND DELOITTE**\n  Collaborating with Microsoft and Deloitte to bring the Connected Spaces product to market, which helps facility operators track emissions data with more accuracy.\n\nDATA MANAGEMENT FOR NET ZERO\n\nMonitoring and reducing an organization\u2019s GHG emissions can be complex. Our IoT solutions enable customers to monitor and manage many different types of equipment, including lighting, heating, cooling and other mechanical equipment to optimize their use. For example, AT&T developed Equipment and Machinery Solutions to better track, monitor, control and optimize heavy machinery and equipment, such as dozers, forklifts and cranes, and help companies manage their performance all in a single view.\n\nThis IoT solution helps companies collect and survey vital equipment data, such as engine hours and fuel consumption of machinery, to calculate emissions within the Salesforce Net Zero Cloud - enabling businesses to better track their sustainability goals from the job site to the boardroom. Net Zero Cloud provides AT&T\u2019s customers with critical data accessible from virtually any location via a web portal or mobile app. This AT&T capability is available for any of our business customers.\nWaste Management\n\nAs the scale of human impact on our planet continues to grow, it\u2019s become clear that conventional, linear methods of production and disposal need to be reconsidered. We must move toward a circular economy, which involves embedding sustainability throughout the life cycle of a product or service.\n\nMany materials that we work with can be reused or repurposed instead of being sent to landfill. Together with our waste management partners, we\u2019ve progressed closer toward our target to reduce the amount of U.S. waste sent to landfill by 30% by year-end 2030 (2019 baseline).\n\nAt the end of 2022, we reduced the amount of landfill waste by 27.9% from 2019.26\n\nWe worked to reduce our waste footprint in 2022 through:\n\n\u2022 Improving data accuracy in our supply chain through targeted training for mobility and fleet vendors.\n\u2022 Contracting with more vendors located closer to our waste streams, which increases diversion opportunities and reduces waste-related emissions.\n\u2022 Continuing to divert fiber-optic cable scrap, which can be shredded and milled to serve as components for roofing materials.\n\nProgressing toward circularity\n\nAll electronic devices should be reused, refurbished or recycled. Reusing devices contributes to a circular economy and helps create more affordable product options for consumers.\n\nIn 2022, we recovered more than 14.8 million devices including mobile phones, internet gateways and television set top boxes.27 Some of these devices are refurbished and distributed to students affected by the digital divide (page 10). If a device cannot be reused in its entirety, we extract individual parts that may be reusable and recycle any remaining plastics and metals.\n\nAT&T makes it easy for customers to give a second life to their old devices, including:\n\n\u2022 Encouraging customers to return old phones during the upgrade process or by taking advantage of our trade-in programs.\n\u2022 Refurbishing or recycling broadband internet devices through in-home appointments where an AT&T technician will recover used equipment.\n\u2022 Offering options for customers to mail their devices back to us to recycle.\n\nWe\u2019re proud that 0% of materials from take-back programs went to landfill in 2022.28\n\nThese efforts provide a solid foundation for our circular economy approach, which we expect to expand in 2023.\nSuppliers\n\nWhether it\u2019s combatting climate change, enhancing diversity, or upholding human rights, we accomplish more when we work together with our trusted suppliers.\n\nAs a global company, we rely on a diverse set of suppliers around the world. We partner with suppliers who hold themselves to high ethical standards and who work with us to advance sustainable business practices throughout our supply chain.\n\nSUPPLIERS WITH THEIR OWN SCIENCE-BASED GHG TARGETS\n\n53%\n\nSPEND WITH DIVERSE SUPPLIERS IN 2022\n\n$16.3B\nResponsible Supply Chain\n\nCombatting climate change together\n\nWe\u2019re using our scale and influence to encourage AT&T suppliers to reduce their own carbon emissions. Part of AT&T\u2019s science-based target (page 24) includes a commitment to ensure 50% of our suppliers set their own science-based GHG targets by year-end 2024. We\u2019re proud to report that we achieved our goal \u2013 as of year-end 2022, 53% of our suppliers have set science-based targets.\n\nThrough the year, we also trained suppliers on using environmental reporting to track progress and reduce their environmental impact over time. Suppliers representing more than $7 billion in annual spend participated in the training.\n\nEnhancing supplier diversity\n\nAT&T is proud to be a long-standing leader in supplier diversity. Over the last 54 years, we have spent more than $230 billion with businesses and enterprises owned by minorities, women, veterans, LGBTQ+ persons, and people with disabilities. In 2022, we met our annual goal to exceed 21.5% of supplier spend and $10 billion in total procurement expenditures with diverse suppliers, reaching $16.3 billion. This represents 26.3% of our overall procurement spend.\n\nAs we adopt new and emerging technologies critical to our business initiatives, we\u2019re focused on ensuring diverse businesses are part of our transformation.\n\nWe participate in regional and national supplier diversity events and work with several diversity business organizations, such as the National Minority Supplier Development Council, for targeted supplier identification. In 2022, AT&T sponsored or participated in roughly 250 in-person and virtual supplier diversity outreach events.\n\nOur supplier financing programs allow small, diverse businesses to leverage the credit power of AT&T. In 2022, participants in our supplier financing program included 96 certified women-owned business enterprises, 91 certified minority business enterprises and 10 certified disabled-veteran enterprises.\n\nSupplier sustainability integration\n\nWe engage our strategic suppliers to integrate sustainability performance metrics into sourcing decisions. These assessments cover a range of ESG factors such as environmental management, circular economy, stakeholder engagement and a supplier\u2019s management of its own supply chain. Our objective is for at least 80% of spend to be covered by supplier sustainability assessments through 2025.\n\nAs a signatory to the UN Global Compact, we recognize the importance of upholding human rights in our supply chain. Through our membership in the Joint Alliance for CSR (JAC) we conduct audits annually within our supply chain using a common audit framework that includes facility evaluations, management interviews, confidential worker interviews and supplier documentation reviews. The JAC audit framework addresses 10 focus areas, including human rights considerations such as the use of child labor and forced/bonded labor.\n\nIn 2022 JAC audited 79 factory locations, including 41 AT&T suppliers, impacting over 133,000 individuals. AT&T led a combination of 6 audits and Mobile Worker Surveys of AT&T suppliers\u2019 factory locations. JAC identified 549 corrective actions and closed 51% of all open and newly identified corrective actions \u2013 including 61% rated as major, 30% rated as minor and 10% flagged for priority.\n\n$16.3B\nsupplier spend in 2022 with businesses owned by minorities, women, veterans, LGBTQ+, and people with disabilities\n\n82%\nof spend had sustainability performance metrics embedded in sourcing decisions in 2022\nProgress toward Goals\n\nCommunities\n\n**GOAL / TARGET**\nInvest $2 billion to help bridge the digital divide by the end of 2023.\n\n**PROGRESS**\nInvested $1.35B across programs including Access from AT&T and AT&T Connected Learning.\n\nAs part of our 3-year $2 billion digital divide commitment, we reached our goal of opening at least 20 AT&T Connected Learning Centers across the U.S. With our original goal met, we set a new goal to open more than 50 AT&T Connected Learning Centers by the end of 2024.\n\nAccess from AT&T helps bridge the digital divide by making low-cost internet service available for qualifying low-income households. In 2022, we expanded the program\u2019s eligibility to all households that qualify for ACP and apply the Federal benefit to AT&T internet service. We also updated the program to include speeds up to 100 Mbps where available.\n\n**GOAL / TARGET**\nProvide 1 million people in need with digital resources through AT&T Connected Learning by the end of 2025.\n\n**PROGRESS**\nReached more than 290,000 individuals through AT&T Connected Learning, we\u2019re investing in connectivity, technology, digital literacy and digital learning solutions to help connect today\u2019s learners with success.

Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations includes adjusting items to revenues and costs that we consider non-operational in nature, including items arising from asset acquisitions or dispositions. We adjust for net actuarial gains or losses associated with our pension and postemployment benefit plans due to the often-significant impact on our results (we immediately recognize this gain or loss in the income statement, pursuant to our accounting policy for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses). Consequently, our adjusted results reflect an expected return on plan assets rather than the actual return on plan assets, as included in the GAAP measure of income. The tax impact of adjusting items is calculated using the effective tax rate during the quarter except for adjustments that, given their magnitude, can drive a change in the effective tax rate; in these cases we use the actual tax expense or combined marginal rate of approximately 25%.\n8. Capital investment from continuing operations is a non-GAAP financial measure that provides an additional view of cash paid for capital investment to provide a comprehensive view of cash used to invest in our networks, product development and systems.
