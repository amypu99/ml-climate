With approximately 120,000 miles of pipelines spanning the country, our operations include natural gas gathering, intrastate and interstate transportation and storage; crude oil, NGL and refined products transportation; terminalling services, acquisition, and marketing activities; as well as NGL storage, fractionation and LNG regasification.\n\nOur geographic diversity includes a strategic footprint in all the major domestic production basins and world-class export facilities on the U.S. Gulf and East Coasts.\n2022 Company Highlights\n\nFrom coast to coast, we offer a diverse portfolio of energy assets, with a strategic footprint in all major domestic production basins. We maintain our success using a two-pronged approach to growth: organic growth and mergers and acquisitions. In 2022, we invested $1.9 billion in organic growth projects, primarily in the midstream, interstate, NGL, and refined products segments. Since going public in 2004, our partnership has completed more than 25 acquisitions.\n\nIntegration of Enable Assets\n\nWe completed the acquisition of Enable Midstream Partners in December 2021. The acquisition improved our connectivity and allowed for commercial and operational synergies which enhanced the capabilities of our systems. It also allowed us to capitalize on improved efficiencies and increase utilization and profitability of our combined assets.\n\nThe acquisition strategically expanded our footprint in Oklahoma, Arkansas, Texas and Louisiana with approximately 14,000 miles of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and produced water gathering pipelines, approximately 2.6 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas processing capacity, approximately 7,800 miles of interstate pipelines, approximately 2,200 miles of intrastate pipelines, and seven natural gas storage facilities comprising 84.5 billion cubic feet of storage capacity.\n\nGULF RUN TRANSMISSION PIPELINE\n\nIn December 2022, we placed the Gulf Run pipeline into service in Louisiana. The pipeline provides domestically produced natural gas from key U.S. producing regions to meet the rapidly growing demand along the Gulf Coast and international markets. The 135-mile, 42-inch natural gas pipeline runs from Westdale to Starks, Louisiana, with a capacity of 1.65 billion cubic feet per day. It receives natural gas from Energy Transfer\u2019s extensive intrastate and interstate pipeline network. Volumes originating from all the major natural gas basins in the U.S. have access to the pipeline. Due to growing producer demand, we concluded a non-binding open season for the pipeline that may lead to additional growth opportunities.\n\nNederland Terminal Expansion\n\nThe Nederland Terminal, located along the Sabine-Neches waterway in southeast Texas, is a 1,200-acre complex that is home to the second largest NGL export facility in the world. In addition to crude oil activities, Nederland received, stored and shipped natural gas liquids for a wide range of customers in 2022 and exported a record amount of NGLs. As a result of expansion projects completed in 2020 and 2021, we are now capable of exporting more than 700,000 barrels per day of NGLs. These expansions also further integrated our Mont Belvieu assets with our Nederland assets. In 2022, we loaded nearly 43 million barrels of ethane out of Nederland. In addition, we completed a FEED study on a potential expansion project at our Nederland Terminal, which would provide us with additional NGL export capacity.\nMont Belvieu Storage Expansion & Frac VIII\n\nEnergy Transfer\u2019s Mont Belvieu Complex is an integrated liquids storage and fractionation facility. The facility is strategically located along the U.S. Gulf Coast, 30 miles east of Houston, above one of the world\u2019s largest underground salt dome formations, and provides access to multiple NGL and refined products pipelines, the Houston Ship Channel trading hub, and numerous chemical plants, refineries and fractionators.\n\nConstruction on Frac VIII continued in 2022 due to significant tightening in available fractionation capacity. Total fractionation capacity at Mont Belvieu will be over 1.15 million barrels per day and is expected to be in service in the third quarter of 2023. We also brought a new storage cavern online with a capacity of approximately 3 million barrels, which supports our ongoing growth at the facility. This brings our total underground NGL storage capacity at Mont Belvieu to approximately 60 million barrels.\n\nMarcus Hook Industrial Complex\n\nOur Marcus Hook Terminal is a premier hub for natural gas liquids on the East Coast. It includes fractionation, terminalling and storage assets. The facility can receive NGLs and refined products via marine vessel, pipeline, truck and rail, and can deliver via marine vessel, pipeline and truck. In addition to providing NGL storage and terminalling services to both affiliates and third-party customers, the Marcus Hook Terminal also serves as an off-take outlet for our Mariner East pipeline system. We completed expansion work at our Marcus Hook Terminal in 2022, which allows us to increase ethane exports, resulting in a new record of ethane exports. We also completed a dredging project in 2022 to increase the depth at one of our docks to 42 feet, which now allows us to fully load Very Large Ethane Carriers (VLECs) at this dock.\n\n120 years ago the first shipment of crude oil was delivered to the Marcus Hook Refinery in Pennsylvania. Today, the facility is a world-class industrial complex where we process, store and distribute NGLs including propane, ethane and butane.\nSpindletop Acquisition\nIn March 2022, we completed a $325 million bolt-on acquisition of underground storage assets and an ethylene storage header in Mont Belvieu, Texas, from Caliche Coastal Holdings, LLC. The acquisition included two active storage caverns and one cavern under development, with the potential to develop at least four more storage caverns. It also included a header system that is connected to multiple ethylene pipeline customers. This system will play a major role in connecting ethylene supply in markets along the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast and help meet growing interest from the petrochemical industry.\n\nWoodford Express Acquisition\nIn 2022, we acquired Woodford Express, LLC, a mid-continent gas gathering and processing system for approximately $485 million. Woodford Express is in the heart of the SCOOP play in Oklahoma and has 450 million cubic feet per day of cryogenic gas processing and treating capacity and over 200 miles of gathering and transportation lines. This acquisition is complementary to our existing infrastructure and offers increased connectivity for our pipeline network.\n\nCushing South Pipeline\nIn 2022, we completed Phase 2 of the Cushing South Pipeline, nearly doubling the pipeline\u2019s capacity to 120,000 barrels per day. The crude oil pipeline provides transportation service from our Cushing Terminal to our Nederland Terminal.\n\nTed Collins Link\nTed Collins Link allows us to transport up to 275,000 barrels per day of crude oil from West Texas and Nederland to our Houston Terminal, showcasing our unique ability to provide low gravity Bakken and WTI barrels to markets along the Gulf Coast. This strategic project significantly increases the utilization of existing assets by repurposing the Eaglebine Pipeline.\n\nIn April 2022, the Ted Collins Link was placed into service and our Houston Terminal celebrated its inaugural shipment of oil for export.\nPermian Processing Plants\n\nThrough our extensive Permian Basin footprint, we achieved record processing volumes in 2022. Supporting this increased activity are the new Grey Wolf and Bear Processing Plants. The Grey Wolf Processing Plant, a 200 million cubic feet per day cryogenic processing plant in the Delaware Basin, was placed into service in December and helps support the growing producer demand in the region.\n\nConstruction of the Bear Processing Plant, our eighth 200 million cubic feet per day processing plant in the Delaware Basin, continued throughout 2022. Completion of the Bear Plant is expected in 2023.\n\nPermian Bridge Project\n\nIn 2022, Energy Transfer completed an expansion of the Permian Bridge Pipeline. First placed into service in 2021, Permian Bridge provides operational flexibility between our gathering and processing assets in the Delaware and Midland Basins. The expansion project brings the pipeline\u2019s total capacity to over 200 million cubic feet per day. This project allows us to move rich gas out of the Midland Basin to utilize available Delaware processing capacity more efficiently, while also providing access to additional takeaway options.\n\nSale of Energy Transfer Canada\n\nIn August, we sold our 51 percent interest in Energy Transfer Canada for cash proceeds of approximately $300 million. The sale allowed us to divest these noncore assets and utilize the cash proceeds to further deleverage our balance sheet and redeploy capital within our United States footprint. The sale reduced our consolidated debt by approximately $850 million.\n2022 Business Segment Overviews\n\nNATURAL GAS\nWe provide natural gas gathering, compression, treating, transportation, storage and marketing services. In 2022, our pipelines transported approximately 30 percent of our nation\u2019s natural gas. Our midstream gathered gas volumes were a record ~18.6 BBTu/d, and we transported a record ~29.2 BBTu/d of natural gas via inter- and intrastate pipelines in 2022. This was the result of record exports to Mexico, record local distribution company sales, record interconnect activity and record cogeneration demand.\n\n- Total Miles of Natural Gas Pipeline: ~90,000 (interstate, intrastate and gathering)\n- Total Storage: 235 billion cubic feet\n- Processing & Treating Facilities: 75\n\nNATURAL GAS LIQUIDS\nIn 2022, our NGL exports represented approximately 20 percent of worldwide exports, which was more than any other country or company. We are the only energy logistics provider with world-class export facilities on both the U.S. Gulf Coast and U.S. East Coast. Our average fractionated volumes set a new partnership record, averaging 911 million barrels per day for full-year 2022. We exported a record number of NGLs out of our Nederland Terminal, and we had record volumes through our fractionation facility located in Mont Belvieu, Texas. Our NGL transportation volumes on our wholly-owned and joint venture pipelines increased to a record 1.9 million barrels per day.\n\n- Total Export Capacity: 1.1 million+ barrels per day\n- Storage Capacity: ~70 million barrels\n- Fractionation Capacity: 900,000+ barrels per day\n- Total Fractionators: 10\n- Terminal Capacity: ~9.96 million barrels\n- Aggregate Transportation Capacity: 3 million barrels per day\n- Miles of Pipelines: ~5,200\n\nCRUDE OIL\nWe have an integrated system of pipelines, terminalling, and acquisition and marketing assets that service the movement of crude oil from producers to end-user markets. In 2022, our pipelines transported approximately 35 percent of our nation\u2019s crude oil. We also proudly own the largest single-owner, above-ground storage facility in the United States, located in Nederland, Texas. In 2022, our crude oil transportation volumes were a record 4.3 million barrels per day, and our crude terminal throughput was a record 3 million barrels per day.\n\n- Terminals: 8\n- Transportation Capacity: 4.6 million barrels per day\n- Total Export Capacity: ~1.85 million barrels per day\n- Miles of Trunk & Gathering Lines: ~11,300\n- Permian Takeaway Capacity: ~1 million barrels per day\n- Terminal Storage Capacity: ~66 million barrels\n\nREFINED PRODUCTS\nWe provide refined products transportation and terminalling services, as well as acquisition and marketing activities, to several regions of the U.S. via our integrated pipeline and terminalling assets.

As one of the leading exporters of propane and ethane, we help to significantly reduce global emissions by providing clean-burning fuel as an alternative to diesel and bunker fuel.\n\nEnergy is a national security issue. The U.S. economy benefits from the production and distribution of domestic energy. Domestic production reduces America\u2019s reliance on unstable and sometimes unfriendly overseas sources. The shale revolution resulted in American refiners and petrochemical manufacturers being able to use more domestic resources instead of importing crude oil from other regions. This increased need for U.S. resources means a greater need for pipelines to safely deliver the energy used. Energy delivered through our pipelines helps to fuel America\u2019s economic engine and maintain our nation\u2019s energy security.\n\nAdditionally, we have increased our export capabilities to meet rising NGL demand both in the U.S. and overseas. Our export terminals transported energy products to 59 countries around the world in 2022 alone. We are the only logistics provider with export facilities on both the U.S. Gulf and East Coasts, and in the last two years our market share of worldwide NGL exports doubled to approximately 20 percent \u2013 a larger percentage than that of any other country or company in the world.\n\nThe U.S. is fortunate to have vast reserves of oil and natural gas that can reliably and safely support our domestic energy needs, as well as supply international markets, for decades to come.\n\nOur Growing Export Capabilities\n\n**HOUSTON TERMINAL**\n- 330 acres on Houston Ship Channel\n- 18.2 million barrels of crude and heated product storage\n- ~500,000 barrels per day of crude export capacity\n- 5 ship docks, 7 barge docks\n- Rail and truck loading and unloading\n- Connectivity to the Gulf Coast refining complex\n- Pipeline connectivity to all major basins\n- Deepwater marine access\n\n**NEDERLAND TERMINAL**\n- ~1,200 acre site on Gulf Coast\n- ~29 million barrels crude storage capacity; 1.9 million barrels refrigerated propane/butane storage capacity\n- 1.2 million barrels (standard) ethane storage tank (Orbit joint venture)\n- ~700,000 barrels per day of combined LPG, ethane and natural gasoline export capacity\n- ~600,000 barrels per day of crude export capacity\n- 6 ship docks (3 NGL, 4 crude-capable) and 4 barge docks accommodate Suez Max-sized ships\n- Rail and truck unloading capabilities\n\n**MARCUS HOOK**\n- ~800 acre site: inbound and outbound pipeline along with truck, rail and marine capabilities\n- ~2 million barrels underground NGL storage; ~4 million barrels refrigerated above-ground NGL storage; ~1 million barrels crude storage capacity\n- ~1 million barrels refined products storage capacity\n- 4 export docks accommodate VLGC- and VLEC-sized vessels\n- ~400,000 barrels per day of combined LPG and ethane export capacity\nAlternative Energy Initiatives\n\nEnergy Transfer\u2019s Alternative Energy Group actively pursues pathways to multi-source energy projects that complement our extensive midstream assets and strives to help reduce our environmental footprint in a manner that makes economic sense. Various opportunities include carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) projects, infrastructure to support hydrogen and ammonia projects, and renewable fuels. We also continue to look at using our land positions for renewable energy projects and forestry carbon credit projects in partnership with third-party developers.\n\nIn 2022, we began working with CapturePoint Solutions to jointly develop a CCS hub in northern Louisiana. It has the potential to be one of the largest onshore deep underground carbon storage centers in the U.S., with the capacity to permanently secure millions of tons of carbon dioxide annually that would have otherwise been emitted into the atmosphere. The proposed project includes the construction of a carbon dioxide gathering system to transport carbon emissions from natural gas producers in northern Louisiana to a carbon sequestration facility capable of permanently storing carbon dioxide in a secure geological formation.\n\nWe also executed a Letter of Intent with Oxy Low Carbon Development (Oxy), a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, to collaborate on developing a CCS solution for the greater Lake Charles industrial region in Louisiana. The project would include the construction of a carbon dioxide pipeline to connect customers to Oxy\u2019s sequestration site in Allen Parish, Louisiana.\n\nWe are developing a carbon dioxide pipeline solution for the Houston to Port Arthur/Beaumont industrial corridor. With multiple sources of carbon dioxide in and around these regions and high-quality sequestration sites within this corridor, we\u2019re working with several customers to introduce an open access carbon dioxide pipeline solution.\n\nWe are pursuing several projects in South and West Texas to utilize the carbon dioxide captured from our natural gas treating facilities for permanent sequestration, enhanced oil recovery projects or e-fuel synthesis.\n\nCarbon Capture and Sequestration\n\nWe continue to pursue carbon capture opportunities. We believe our strategically positioned franchise will allow us to participate in projects to provide carbon dioxide pipeline solutions to several CCS projects being developed by third parties. We are also pursuing CCS projects related to our assets, including the capture of carbon dioxide from processing and treating plants for permanent sequestration, or for use in enhanced oil recovery.\nRenewable Natural Gas\n\nEnergy Transfer is growing its Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) business with an increasing number of RNG interconnects. Organic waste from dairy farms, animal residuals, landfills, or wastewater treatment plants can be repurposed into a clean, renewable fuel source called biogas. Biogas can be conditioned or upgraded to pipeline-quality natural gas, becoming RNG. Through our extensive gas system, we are able to safely and reliably transport RNG. At the end of 2022, we had eight RNG plants/interconnects in place, transporting over 5 billion cubic feet of product.\n\nCordelio/Tenaska Renewable Energy Development\n\nWe continue to evaluate the repurposing of acreage within our asset footprint. As a part of that effort in 2022, we leased 14,000 acres for Tenaska and Cordelio Power\u2019s proposed renewable energy park in northern Kentucky.\n\nPowering our Assets\n\nPowering our assets through renewable energy sources, primarily solar and wind, is an established part of our operations where it is economically viable to do so. Since 2019, we have entered into dedicated solar contracts to purchase 108 megawatts of solar power to support the operations of our assets. We also operate approximately 32,500 solar panel-powered metering stations.\n\nHydrogen and Ammonia\n\nClean hydrogen is emerging as a component of decarbonization efforts in Europe and Asia. As a derivative of hydrogen, ammonia is both a carrier for hydrogen and an energy vector for co-burning in coal-fired power plants. As the sources and uses for hydrogen and its derivatives such as ammonia expand, there is a developing need for open access midstream infrastructure to facilitate the growth of this sector.\n\nThe Beaumont/Port Arthur areas of Texas have an existing hydrogen ecosystem that is growing to both produce and consume clean hydrogen. To support this expanding hydrogen ecosystem, we conducted a pre-FEED study in 2022 to determine viability and cost to develop an underground hydrogen storage cavern at our Spindletop salt dome storage cavern facility and a hydrogen pipeline system connecting the storage cavern to regional supply and demand nodes. We have been pleased with customer interest in our efforts to develop this hydrogen infrastructure.\n\nOur land holdings at Nederland and Lake Charles, with deep water docks and access to international waters, are well suited for developers of clean ammonia projects. We are working with several global organizations on developing clean ammonia projects either at or around our properties at Nederland and Lake Charles.\n\nRenewable Natural Gas\n\nEnergy Transfer is growing its Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) business with an increasing number of RNG interconnects. Organic waste from dairy farms, animal residuals, landfills, or wastewater treatment plants can be repurposed into a clean, renewable fuel source called biogas. Biogas can be conditioned or upgraded to pipeline-quality natural gas, becoming RNG. Through our extensive gas system, we are able to safely and reliably transport RNG. At the end of 2022, we had eight RNG plants/interconnects in place, transporting over 5 billion cubic feet of product.\n\nCordelio/Tenaska Renewable Energy Development\n\nWe continue to evaluate the repurposing of acreage within our asset footprint.

OpsHub is a powerful navigation tool that allows for quick searching of various software applications that are a part of routine operations.\n\nManagement of Change Templates\n\nIn 2022, we introduced a new Management of Change (MOC) template. MOC templates are an important, proactive tool to use before implementing a change in operations. It helps employees identify potential safety risks that can come with change, minimize potential negative impacts, create adequate and timely measures, ensure the correct employees/groups are involved, and create consistency across the organization.\n\nThe templates provide specific details for what should be entered for the specific topic, including:\n\n- Changes to Set Point and/or Control Logic Requirements\n- Temporary Pressure Reduction Requirements\n- Increase in MAOP/MOP (Uprating)\n- Decrease in MAOP/MOP\n- Tank Cleaning and Recommissioning\n- Tank Conversion to DOT Service\n\nThe template specifically addresses the following information in the MOC:\n\n- Who the MOC Requestor should be?\n- What to include in the description?\n- What groups need to be listed as an SME?\n- Who needs to be listed in the People to Notify?\n- Who should be the MOC approvers?\n- What action items need to be included and who they should be assigned to?\nInternal Pipeline Inspections\n\nRegular cleaning and inspection of pipelines are integral to maintaining the safety of our operations. The only way to do this is through the process known as pigging. Our Organizational Excellence group, in partnership with our Operations Teams, rolled out a new site-specific Pigging Checklist to guide our pigging operations. The purpose of the checklist is to create consistency across the organization, which is a major priority for maintaining our culture of continuous improvement.\n\nSafety Recognition Initiative\n\nAt the end of 2022, we implemented a new safety recognition initiative to help encourage the engagement of our Operations leadership. The purpose was to ensure Operations Directors and Managers were investing time in the field to witness the work involved in more complicated activities. This important engagement by leadership helped provide appropriate oversight, coaching and recognition for strong performance.\n\nEmployee Qualification & Competency\n\nOur pipeline safety protocols use the most proven technology, and we employ the most skilled pipeline workers in the industry. As of 2022, we have more than 3,800 operations personnel who are trained and qualified in accordance with pipeline safety regulations. Per federal and state requirements, we developed 124 Operator Qualification (OQ) Tasks supporting the regulatory aspects of pipeline asset operations and maintenance. Our operations employees collectively maintain 64,427 individual qualifications, and per our operator qualifications processes, which are continually tracked in our Career Development Management System (CDMS). Each OQ Task has an identified requalification frequency based on a Difficulty, Importance, and Frequency Analysis conducted by company Subject Matter Experts. Additionally, to keep our operations employees informed on OQ, equipment, procedure and process updates, more than 2,000 computer-based and instructor-led trainings are available annually for initial and refresher training.\nRisk Reduction\n\nOur health and safety management system consists of an integrated set of programs, systems, policies and procedures (listed below) to effectively manage our EH&S compliance, performance and risk. Our programs use advanced data management software systems to guide how we operate and drive continuous improvement and accountability amongst our employees.\n\n**Programs:**\n\nOverarching programs that support our EH&S compliance and performance.\n\n- DataPARC\n- Ops Playbook\n- Project Manager Development Guide\n- Asset Management and Reliability\n- Public Outreach\n- Damage Prevention/One Call\n- EH&S Management and Compliance\n- Emergency Preparedness\n- Internal Audit\n- Mechanical Integrity Program\n- Organizational Excellence Program\n- Pipeline Integrity Risk Management\n- Process Safety Management\n- Security\n- Spill Prevention Program\n- Training Programs\n- Pipeline Safety Management System\n\n**Systems:**\n\nKey EH&S and compliance programs to support and promote continuous improvement.\n\n- Asset Compliance Tracking Software (ACTS)\n- Learning Management System\n- Engine Reliability\n- Environmental Information Management System\n- ET/PSM Management of Change\n- GIS Database\n- Incident Management System (IMS - Intelex)\n- Job Plans\n- SAP Preventative Maintenance\n\n**Policies & Procedures:**\n\nExpectations and requirements to maintain compliance and improve EH&S performance.\n\n- Code of Business Conduct and Ethics\n- Contractor Safety Manual\n- E&C Standard for Procurement, Design, Construction and Commission\n- Environmental Policy and Guidelines Manual\n- Organizational Excellence Policy\n- Pipeline Integrity Management Plans\n- Remediation Policy\n- Safety Procedures and Forms/Manuals relevant to our industry\n- Standard Operating Procedures\n- Vehicle Safety Policy\n\n**People & Capital:**\n\nResource commitment to maintain compliance and improve EH&S performance.\n\n- 700+ individuals support Operations and E&C performance and compliance by providing EH&S, Technical Services and Integrity support\n- $743 million in capital expenditures to maintain our assets\n- Security team to plan and manage all security operations\n- Dedicated team to communicate and implement One Call Damage Prevention\n- Employee Volunteer Program\n- Right-of-Way team to work with landowners\n- Power Optimization group improving energy efficiency\n- Provide employees PPE\nProcess Safety Management\n\nEnergy Transfer has a comprehensive, disciplined and audited Process Safety Management (PSM) system in place that strives to follow the rules and practices required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). PSM is a federal regulation from OSHA designed to manage natural gas as well as highly hazardous chemicals. The goal is to prevent or minimize the consequences of a release, should one occur. A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) helps identify, reduce and manage workplace hazards with a detailed, step-by-step review of operating processes and procedures. A Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA) combines both qualitative and quantitative elements of hazard evaluation and risk assessment to analyze and judge the adequacy of existing or proposed safeguards against process deviations and accident scenarios. This in-depth and formulaic process helps us focus on the most critical safeguards.\n\nAsset Management & Reliability Program\n\nEnergy Transfer\u2019s Asset Management and Reliability (AMR) programs are fundamental to the performance of mechanical equipment across the partnership. The AMR Executive Steering Committee is composed of senior leaders within Energy Transfer who meet on a quarterly basis to review the AMR program.\n\nThe committee meets to:\n\n- **Align** reliability goals across a diverse range of business units\n- **Review** the effectiveness of the reliability program through KPIs\n- **Define** reliability initiatives and priorities\n\nDataPARC\n\nEnergy Transfer successfully rolled out a new, cutting-edge enterprise solution in 2022. DataPARC is a data visualization and analytics platform that provides enterprise accessibility and improved asset optimization of our assets. It allows us to consolidate manual entry systems and integrate our existing asset data to provide a single source for critical information. Employees and management can easily view real-time operating conditions and data from across our 480 facilities and 120,000 miles of pipeline. The program was a $6 million investment, and within only one year, we\u2019ve captured more than $10 million in annualized savings using DataPARC.\n\nProject Manager Development Guide\n\nIn 2022, Energy Transfer began the rollout of a new Project Manager Development Guide (PMDG). The PMDG defines criteria for a successful project, including both compliance and environmental stewardship. It applies to all project types, both facilities and pipelines, and details best practices, lessons learned and provides guidance on the requirements and deliverables throughout the lifetime of a project.\nIncident Management System Platform\n\nWe continuously pursue a zero-incident culture by implementing strategic protocols to mitigate risk and eliminate adverse events.\n\nTo help achieve this goal, our Incident Management System (IMS) employs a five-step risk reduction cycle to document and report any unwanted events. Events reported through this system undergo a thorough investigation, followed by corrective actions and then sharing of lessons learned to prevent future similar events. The custom platform offers tracking and trending data on all established metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).\n\nDRAFT\nAll employees are empowered to create an initial incident in IMS and submit to their supervisor for verification\n\nVERIFICATION\nSupervisors verify the draft incidents and send to local subject matter experts for investigation\n\nINVESTIGATION\nSubject matter experts complete the investigation and submit for approval\n\nAPPROVAL\nArea director or discipline director approves the completed incident investigation and submits it for closure\n\nCLOSURE\nThe risk reduction cycle ends when the incident is closed. Incident data is then evaluated and communicated to management\n\nEvents tracked in the IMS platform include:\n\n- Abnormal Operations\n- Contractor Incidents\n- Damage Prevention Events\n- Environmental Incidents\n- Injury/Illness\n- Mechanical & Tank Integrity Events\n- Mechanical/Electrical/Controls\n- Pipeline Regulatory Leak/Failure\n- Pipeline Safety\n- Property Damage\n- PSM Incidents\n- Security Incidents\n- Vehicle Incidents\nKey Performance Indicators\n\nOur Environmental and Safety Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) provide a data review of incident types and occurrence rates in real time. Interactive maps provide a platform to pull the data for specific geographic areas and time periods. Incident information and GIS location data is processed directly from the IMS platform to the dashboard. KPIs are based on quantifiable metrics established in accordance with OSHA and PHMSA and are used to identify and track industry safety and environmental trends.\n\nBusiness Intelligence Reports\n\nUsing a Power Business Intelligence (BI) analytics tool, we customize real-time reports to provide more information than the typical EH&S incident management system that traditionally focuses on lagging indicators. These interactive reports provide data analytics in a way that can be used to make business decisions to drive continuous improvement.\n\nPower BI reports in place include:\n\n- **EH&S Dashboard** - Provides an overview of environmental, illness/injury, vehicle and near-miss incidents.\n- **Engineering Records** - Provides an overview of the total number of projects that have been received and are complete.\n- **Management of Change (MOC) Report** - Provides an overview of all MOC records. Other reports within the MOC Report include the MOC Approvals and MOC Action Items reports.\n- **Underground Storage** - Shows the working storage of each storage field.\n- **Engine Reliability Report** - Provides valuable information to use in maintenance planning and Engine Life-Cycle management.\n- **GIS Regulatory Metrics** - Provides an overview of the total number of pipeline miles by state, asset, class and product shipped.\n- **Operations Incident Report** - Shows details pertaining to each of the following incident types: injury/illness incidents, vehicle incidents, contractor incidents, property damage, security incidents, PSM incidents, environmental incidents, pipeline leaks/failures, abnormal operations, pipeline safety-related conditions, damage prevention, mechanical and tank integrity, and MEC.\n- **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Revision History** - Provides an overview of all SOP revision requests.\n- **Operator Qualifications (OQ) Report** - A series of reports related to the pipeline OQ program including: Pipeline Operator Qualifications, Technical Training Summary Report, Company Evaluators and Proctors, Control Room Operator Qualifications, Employee Qualification and Technical Training Overview.\n2022 KPI Trends & Improved Performance\n\nWe determine the success of our safety, regulatory and environmental management programs by analyzing our year-over-year progress through our KPIs. The below improvements include our 2022 averages in our required PHMSA reportables:\n\nOver 70 percent of the releases related to our liquid accident rates had no material impact to the surrounding area.\n\nSpecific highlights include:\n\n- **52 percent fewer** accidents in high consequence areas (HCAs) from 2021\n- **85 percent less** volume released in HCAs from 2021\n- **31 percent fewer** accidents in HCAs from 5 year average (2017-2021)\n- **70 percent less** volume released in HCAs from 5 year average (2017-2021)\n- **96 percent less** volume released in HCAs than 2021\n\nApproximately 65 percent of our gas releases had no material impact to the environment and surrounding areas. Additionally, five incidents in 2022 were for newly regulated Type C Gathering lines, which began reporting in May 2022.\n\nSpecific highlights include:\n\n- **52 percent less** volume released in a Class 3 location than 2021\n- **85 percent less** volume released in HCAs than five year average (2017-2021)\n- **70 percent less** volume released in a Class 3 location than five-year average (2017-2021)\n- **50 percent fewer** incidents in HCAs in 2022 than 2021\n- **96 percent less** volume released in HCAs than 2021\nSafely Monitoring Our Assets\n\nControl Centers\nThe pipeline controllers for Energy Transfer are highly trained and are qualified to ensure that our products reach the customers in a reliable and safe manner. It is a unique role, as these employees are often the first to recognize or respond to a safety-related condition in real time, as they continually analyze and monitor our assets 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Energy Transfer has over 245 pipeline controllers who are dedicated and trained by product type.\n\nPipeline Surveillance Technology Committee\nOur Pipeline Surveillance Technology Committee was formed in 2016 to evaluate available technologies within the pipeline industry and determine implementation potential on Energy Transfer assets. The committee also evaluates current testing and new or advancing technologies within the industry through various industry consortiums and state or federal programs such as iPIPE, PRCI, FAA, HSAC and Texas A&M.\n\nAdditional committee functions and 2022 highlights include:\n\n- Recommendations for pilot study programs to be initiated on Energy Transfer assets.\n- Increase member participation across business segments (Environmental, Regulatory Affairs, IT \u2013 SCADA and Engineering) to broaden groups\u2019 ability to address regulatory drivers such as Greenhouse Gases (GHGs), Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG) criteria, Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) and methane mitigation, and recommend proven technologies that can be deployed for specific applications.\n- Utilized Orbital Sidekicks (OSK) Optical Gas Imagery technology via fixed-wing aircraft to satisfy regulatory methane leak detection survey requirements in Southeast New Mexico. OSK\u2019s satellite technology enables earlier detection and prevention of leaks along pipeline rights-of-way, using hyperspectral data analysis to drive broad improvements in community safety, environmental performance and overall operating efficiency.\n- Guidance on the use of drone technology by company and contractor personnel relative to company assets.\n- Evaluated stationary methane detection technology at a gas processing facility in Oklahoma.\n- Participated on the Intelligent Pipeline Integrity Program (iPIPE) technology committee managed by the Environmental and Energy Research Center (EERC) from the University of North Dakota which conducted four research projects focused on leak detection (liquid and gas), change detection (geohazards) and pipeline surveillance (damage prevention).\n- Participated in the Pipeline Research Council International (PRCI) Surveillance Operations & Monitoring committee which had six active research projects focusing on leak detection, change detection and pipeline surveillance.\nPipeline Protection Committee\n\nOur Pipeline Protection Committee is an interdepartmental network formed to provide managerial oversight of strategic programs within our pipeline safety management system, including damage prevention and continuous improvement of the protection of pipelines from unwanted events. While each function has a unique role of its own, there are also clear, purposeful overlaps. The Committee includes Aerial Patrol, Encroachments, One Call/Damage Prevention and Public Awareness.\n\nAERIAL PATROL\n\nSince we first began to track the group\u2019s flight time in 2007, the group has successfully completed 86,505 hours without an accident. The Aerial Patrol group consists of 14 employees, including 10 pilots and three mechanics, using 12 aircraft that are strategically located throughout the United States. Patrol pilots can inspect up to 1,000 miles of pipeline per day, including patrol areas that are difficult to access from the ground. The department also assists with field personnel ride-along flights for rights-of-way inspections, FAA airspace restrictions for planned pipeline blowdowns, and post-natural disaster inspections. The Aerial Patrol Department complements existing pipeline integrity programs and contributes to Energy Transfer\u2019s pipeline safety initiatives.\n\nENCROACHMENTS\n\nAn encroachment is a temporary or permanent structure across, on, along or under a facility or pipeline right-of-way. These require written consent from pipeline operators to ensure the continued integrity and safe operation of the pipeline. All requests are tracked to make sure existing assets stay safely maintained. As our company grows, so does the number of encroachments. In 2022, we processed 1,496 encroachment requests. The department is also responsible for the management of relocation projects, both reimbursable and non-reimbursable. In 2022, we processed 20 relocation projects.\n\nONE CALL/DAMAGE PREVENTION\n\nThe greatest risk to underground pipelines is accidental damage during excavation by third-parties. To protect our pipelines and other underground facilities, individuals are required to use the One Call system prior to any excavation-related activities on public and private property. Our One Call/Damage Prevention group tracks all line hits, near-misses and One Call violations that happen on our system and performs Root Cause Analyses to determine how to avoid these events in the future. In 2022, we received 798,824 One Call tickets, including 32,716 emergency tickets which require a response within four hours. The group is also responsible for loading all new pipelines into the company\u2019s GIS mapping system, along with keeping the mapping files current and covered for One Call with the various state One Call agencies.\n\nPUBLIC AWARENESS\n\nEnergy Transfer has a comprehensive public awareness program designed to raise key stakeholders\u2019 awareness of the presence of pipelines in their communities. In 2022, our annual public awareness mailings reached more than 2.3 million stakeholders. Our public awareness plan is consistent with federal pipeline safety regulations and follows the guidance provided by the American Petroleum Institute (API) Recommended Practice (RP) 1162, \u201cPublic Awareness Programs for Pipeline Operators.\u201d\nEnergy Transfer\u2019s \u201csafety strong\u201d focus is integrated across all areas of our operations and is central to our core culture. Our rigorous safety performance processes clearly outline the expectations and personal responsibility required of all employees and contractors. Paving the way for continuous operational excellence, these processes provide the framework for an injury- and incident-free workplace by addressing risk management, required training, leadership, communication, personal wellness and properly maintained facilities.\n\nEverything Starts With Safety\n\nOur commitment to safety is at the forefront of everything we do. We embrace a mindset of continuous improvement to ensure our safety procedures and processes are best-in-class. Just as important, however, is the verification that our procedures and processes are clearly understood throughout our operations teams and that they are always followed by employees and contractors. Our safety training program for field employees begins upon hiring. Knowing how to safely perform tasks and respond to incidents is crucial to steady performance and to the protection and well-being of our people, our facilities, and the surrounding communities. Annual training addresses standard operating procedures, emergency response procedures, vehicle safety and safe work habits.\n\nSafety Olympics\n\nThe Energy Transfer Safety Olympics took place in October 2022. Select employees from operations, operations services and measurement competed in interactive, hands-on challenges. The event promotes our strong safety culture through building upon the foundation of our six critical work practices, known as our \u201cSafety Lifesavers.\u201d It is designed to ignite a friendly competition as teams pass a series of challenges intended to evaluate knowledge and skills on topics such as electrical safety, excavation safety, confined space entry and energy isolation.\nSafety Lifesavers\nThe life you save could be your own! This is the motto of our Lifesavers safety campaign, first launched in 2019. The Lifesavers campaign was created to help our employees know and follow six critical safe work practices to help move us toward our goal of zero incidents.\n\n- Defensive Driving\n- Safe Work Permits\n- Energy Isolation\n- Electrical Safety\n- Excavation Safety\n- Confined Space Entry\n\nVehicle Safety Training\nFor our commercial motor vehicles in 2022, we continued to pursue excellence with our DOT Motor Carrier Safety program which adheres to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration\u2019s standards. This comprehensive program encompasses aspects such as commercial driver\u2019s licenses (CDL), alcohol and drug assessments, placarding, driver logs, medical cards, inspections and registrations.\n\nDriver Intervention Program\nOur Driver Intervention Program monitors employees\u2019 driving habits and helps prevent vehicle incidents. There are three elements to the Driver Intervention Program:\n\n- Rank drivers by risk and identify drivers with driving behaviors that put them at a higher risk\n- Coach drivers to modify their driving habits to reduce risk\n- Monitor drivers to verify improved driving habits\n\nSafety Engagements\nEmployees at all levels of our organization are encouraged to document \u201cSafety Engagements\u201d using our proprietary mobile application. A safety engagement is any type of safety-related interaction with other employees and/or contractors during routine work, projects or everyday tasks. Engagements are a leading indicator that show how focused we are in our safety processes. They also provide us with trending data on our safety metrics, identifies opportunities for improvement and provides a mechanism for feedback. Engagements help document and verify that: standards are understood, standards are maintained, and individuals are accountable. In 2022, 2,210 safety engagements were completed by our employees, as well as close to 1,400 quality job reviews.\n\nIncreased investment in personal gas monitors to ensure all employees working around hydrocarbon-containing assets are safely equipped.\nSafety Incident Rates\n\nThere are over 225 Environmental, Health & Safety (EH&S) professionals that support our operations. The EH&S group assists others throughout the organization in identifying consistent training for personnel, including the training that is required by applicable laws, regulations, standards, and permit conditions. Our impressive safety accomplishments are due to these engagement and intervention efforts to prevent incidents (as opposed to reacting to them), which is supported by our safety culture and accomplished by individual efforts and focus. The management team sets internal safety incident rate goals, setting the stage for continuous improvement year over year and striving toward our goal of zero incidents.\n\nPreventable Vehicle Incident Rate\n\nA key metric for measuring vehicle safety is the Preventable Vehicle Incident Rate (PVIR). In 2022, our PVIR was 1.09, which was below our internal target and a 14 percent decrease from 2021. The PVIR is based on 136,267,794 miles driven.\n\nDays Away, Restricted or Transferred Incident Rate\n\nThe Days Away, Restricted or Transferred (DART) Incident Rate reflects more serious injuries resulting in lost workdays. In 2022, our DART incident rate was 0.69 \u2013 based on 18,151,332 hours worked. In 2022, there was a slight increase in our DART rate due to the onboarding of acquired assets from Enable Midstream. Enable systems now operate under Energy Transfer\u2019s SOPs and Engineering Standards, which is expected to increase system reliability, integrity and safety.\n\nTotal Recordable Incident Rate*\n\nA key metric in looking at a company\u2019s safety performance is the Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR). In 2022, our TRIR was 1.01 based on 18,151,332 hours worked. Energy Transfer uses the industry standard measurement of incidents (injuries) per 200,000 man-hours worked in calculating our total recordable incident rate and lost time incident rate. The TRIR for contractors working on major projects was 0.63.\n\nAs a result of our 2022 Total Recordable Incident Rate, Energy Transfer received the 2023 Safety Excellence Award from the International Liquid Terminals Association (ILTA).\n\nThe Terminal organization performed at a TRIR of 0.64, which was below our internal target and significantly below the industry average of 0.92. The ILTA Health and Safety Committee updated the selection process to require recipients to score in the top two quartiles for both a leading and lagging indicator survey.\n\nWe believe our low TRIR speaks to our investment in and focus on safety and environmental compliance as well as the reliability of our assets.\n\n*Data does not include COVID-related cases\nCrude Trucking\n\nOur crude truck business includes 367 drivers who operate 294 trucks and are responsible for safely delivering crude oil from our field operations to various pipeline injection points along our assets. In 2022, they drove 19 million miles, safely hauling over 40 million barrels of crude oil. Notably, this was completed with an impressive spill rate of 0.00000047 percent. Additionally, our Abilene District met a major milestone by reaching the \u201cmillion-mile club,\u201d safely driving at least a million miles without having a single preventable motor vehicle accident. The 48 drivers in the Abilene District drove an astounding 2,068,922 miles from October 2021 \u2013 August 2022 without having a single preventable motor vehicle accident.\n\nTRUCK RODEO\n\nAfter a short hiatus due to Covid, the Crude Trucking division hosted their Annual Truck Rodeo in Ft. Worth, Texas. The annual competition began in 2018 and in its 3rd year, the top two drivers from each of the six divisions and the returning champion came together to compete for the first place prize. To participate at the rodeo, drivers must be part of the top 10% based on their scorecard reports in the Power BI dashboard along with additional monthly driver audits, like truck inspections and safety records. Participants must complete a series of approximately ten challenges ranging from backing up, safe lane changes, safe turns, distracted driving and other driving proficiency events demonstrating their skills in a variety of circumstances. To promote safety and a positive work environment, prizes are awarded to the top three drivers at the event.\n\nNear-Miss and Good Catch Program\n\nOur Intelex platform provides a robust system for capturing, analyzing, and reporting situations considered \u201cnear-misses\u201d and \u201cgood catches.\u201d A near-miss is an unplanned event that did not result in injury, illness, or damage \u2014 but had the potential to do so. A good catch is an action-oriented program that implies someone did something positive to prevent an incident from occurring.\n\nThese programs help create a healthy safety culture and serve as significant leading indicators that help us assess potential hazards and prevent safety and environmental incidents. Information on near-misses and good catches are collected and shared with others so they can be on the lookout for similar situations. In 2022, we had over 3,200 near-misses/good catches reported internally.\nComprehensive Environmental Management\n\nProtecting the public and the environment is the primary goal of our environmental management teams. Our environmental professionals are focused on ensuring we are responsibly and efficiently reducing emissions, protecting and preserving the land, water and air around us, and that we remain in compliance with all applicable regulations.\n\nEnvironmental Management System\n\nEnergy Transfer operates and maintains an Environmental Management System to drive improved performance and compliance while providing necessary capital and personnel to implement our environmental policies. Our environmental management teams consist of 117 environmental professionals supporting operations and 15 environmental professionals supporting engineering and construction. There are over 8,500 environmental tasks that are completed on an annual basis by the environmental professionals supporting our operations, which include but are not limited to tasks that help ensure compliance with the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts.\nEmission Reduction Task Force\n\nAs part of our decades-long initiative to continuously reduce emissions, we established an Emission Reduction Task Force in 2022 that works in conjunction with third-party consultants to enhance emission data collection and reporting and explore new technologies to reduce emissions. The task force is a two-tiered, multidisciplinary team of functional leaders and an Executive Steering Committee which provides guidance to the working task force.\n\nThe task force initially focused on three key areas to improve and enhance GHG data collection and reporting:\n\n1. Utilize dataPARC for real-time data capture of operational GHG information\n2. Enhance equipment count accuracy and field measurement\n3. Utilize existing software platforms to expand field data collection\n\nThe task force\u2019s ongoing efforts related to continued emission reductions involve the following:\n\n1. Expand leak detection program with additional resources to monitor and repair leaks\n2. Retrofit existing gas operated pneumatics with compressed air where feasible\n3. Reduce and/or prevent pipeline blowdowns when possible\n\nIn 2022, at the recommendation of the task force, Energy Transfer hired 18 additional GHG technicians and invested approximately $1 million on new FLIR cameras, or optical gas imaging cameras.\nEmissions Reduction Opportunities\n\nAsset Optimization\n\nAsset optimization is the process of identifying and evaluating commercial and operational synergies. These synergies enhance the operational capabilities of our systems by capitalizing on improved efficiencies and increasing utilization. Additionally, this process includes retiring older, less efficient assets, further reducing our carbon footprint.\n\nCarbon Capture & Sequestration\n\nWe implement carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies at several of our existing treating and processing facilities, which allowed us to sequester approximately 94,500 metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2022.\n\nOne way we prevent carbon from going into the atmosphere is through the process of Acid Gas Injection (AGI). AGI is an environmentally beneficial method of managing acid gas in our system and is essentially the compression of the gas stream to low enough pressure to achieve injection and storage in a deep and secure geologic formation. Acid gas storage wells and related infrastructure must meet rigorous safety design requirements, even beyond those of a normal production or service well. Currently, three of our natural gas processing facilities capture and recover hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide from various process streams and inject the gas into permanent geologic storage formations.\nDual Drive Technologies\n\nIn 2022, this one-of-a-kind compression technology allowed us to operate using electric power on our units over 80 percent of the time, reducing emissions by 752,062 tons of carbon dioxide annually.\n\nThrough our subsidiary, Dual Drive Technologies, the use of our proprietary Dual Drive compression technology offers the ability to switch compression drivers between an electric motor and a natural gas engine. This allows us to reduce our emissions of nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and volatile organic compounds. The first Dual Drive was installed in East Texas in 2000. Since then, our fleet has grown to include nearly 100 units with approximately 425,000 total horsepower and 316 megawatts in multiple services from field gathering, transmission and cryogenic plant installations.\n\nDUAL DRIVE IN ACTION\n\nIn addition to the environmental benefits, the Dual Drive compression system significantly reduces the burden on the electrical grid during severe weather events and peak usage periods. Since the compressor is driven by either a natural gas or electric motor, it is capable of seamlessly transferring between the two drivers with no change in throughput. Dual Drives are the only critical infrastructure compressors allowed to participate in the ERCOT Ancillary Service market without the use of back-up generation.\n\nEnergy Transfer recently began selling Dual Drive compressors to third parties under a licensing agreement, which helps further reduce the industry\u2019s carbon footprint. This is in addition to the energy management agreements that have been available to third parties since the inception of Dual Drive compressors. In 2022, there were 11 units operated by third parties across the West Texas region, saving an additional 110,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually.\n\n2022 Energy Transfer\u2019s Emissions Saved Using Dual Drive Technologies\n(82 Dual Drive Units)\n\nNOx 859 tons  CO 899 tons  VOC 570 tons  CO2 752,062 tons\n\n2022 Estimated Third Parties\u2019 Emissions Saved Using Dual Drive Technologies\n(11 Dual Drive Units)\n\nNOx 160 tons  CO 170 tons  VOC 106 tons  CO2 110,000 tons\n\nDavid Coker, VP of Power Optimization at Energy Transfer, was awarded the D CEO 2022 Energy Award in the Excellence in Innovation and Sustainability category. The publication recognized the proprietary Dual Drive Technology for its ability to reliably manage energy services and its GHG emissions-reduction capabilities.\nEngine & Turbine Emission-Reduction Technologies\n\nEnergy Transfer has used various emissions-reduction technologies on engines and turbines for several years. These include:\n\n**ENGINES**\n\n- **Lean-burn Technologies** \u2013 computer programs are used to maximize air-to-fuel ratios so that consistent low emissions (primarily nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide) may be achieved on a more regular basis.\n\n- **Oxidative Catalysts** \u2013 filter media which are inserted in the exhaust stream of the engine to reduce carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and formaldehyde in varying quantities depending on the specific type of catalyst. These are mainly used on lean-burn-style engines and some turbines.\n\n- **3-Way Catalysts** \u2013 catalysts are used on rich-burn engines where a reduction in nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and formaldehyde are needed.\n\n- **Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)** \u2013 catalyst used to reduce a specific pollutant, typically nitrogen oxide, within an exhaust stream. This may be used in conjunction with an oxidative catalyst to obtain a reduction in multiple pollutants. Typically, urea or ammonia is injected as a fine mist into the exhaust stream to cause a chemical reaction with nitrogen oxide. After the injection process, the exhaust stream is routed through a catalyst media to complete the reduction process.\n\n**OPTICAL GAS IMAGING**\n\nWe use Optical Gas Imaging (OGI) or FLIR cameras at many of our 2,200 gas gathering and processing facilities, which allow us to reduce emissions, improve safety, reduce costs, prevent product loss and maintain equipment integrity. The cameras allow us to pinpoint the exact location of emissions originating from various components (valves, flanges, pumps, pipe fittings, etc.) located within processing and compression facilities. Cameras provide an additional layer of safety and emissions prevention, as they are used in addition to the regularly scheduled inspections performed by our highly skilled technicians several times per year. In 2022, we invested approximately $1 million in new FLIR cameras.\n\n**TURBINES**\n\nGas turbines are used as an energy efficient way to increase pipeline gas pressure at our control and transmission stations, as well as generate electricity for critical facilities. Gas turbines without any emissions controls normally produce 10 percent of the emissions of engines on a per energy input basis.\n\n- **SoLoNOx (Solar Turbines) & Dry LowNOx (DLN)** \u2013 company-specific proprietary emission-reduction technologies, similar to the lean-burn methodology on engines. Approximately 75 percent of our gas turbines are equipped with SoLoNOx, which allows us to reduce nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon emissions by 32 percent annually.\n\n**Solar Turbine Emissions Summary:**\n\n- Solar units with SoLoNOx packages: 41.51%\n- Solar horsepower with SoLoNox: 72%\n- Reduction in emissions by using SoLoNOx: 30.23%\n\n- **Water Injection** \u2013 technique using water injected into the combustion chamber to reduce the combustion temperature, thereby reducing nitrogen oxide generation.\n\n**THERMOELECTRIC GENERATOR**\n\nIn remote areas where local commercial power isn\u2019t available, we often use a Thermoelectric Generator which is a solid-state device that converts heat flux (temperature differences) directly into electrical energy through a phenomenon called the Seebeck effect. These generators consume up to 50 percent less fuel than competitive technologies and are tied directly into our pipelines. They use natural gas as a fuel source for heat and produce low voltage that keeps our batteries charged and communications up and running for our Gas Control Centers.\n\n**THERMAL OXIDIZERS**\n\nThermal oxidizers are an important emission-control device that reduce the environmental footprint of natural gas operations. Thermal oxidizers destroy volatile organic compounds and convert methane to carbon dioxide (a less intense greenhouse gas), thereby reducing volatile organic compounds and methane emissions by 98 percent or more. Thermal oxidizers are installed voluntarily at many of our more than 50 natural gas processing and sweetening plants. These plants improve the quality of the gas product and make it suitable for transportation and use in homes and businesses.\nPNEUMATIC DEVICES\nTo date, we have installed approximately 23,000 low-emission pneumatic devices throughout our pipeline system to help reduce methane emissions primarily at our automated valve sites. Pneumatic devices allow us to safely and efficiently adjust and control our operations through liquid level controllers, pressure regulators and valve controllers. Low-emission pneumatic devices allow us to effectively prevent approximately 119 tons (5.6 million standard cubic feet) of methane emissions every day.\n\nPIPELINE BLOWDOWN DIRECT INJECTION\nWhen possible, we use the direct injection system when conducting pipeline blowdown procedures for maintenance operations and testing on pipelines. Direct injection reduces the pressure within the pipeline and thereby prevents release of methane into the atmosphere.\n\nSMART PIGS\nWe use in-line inspection tools, or smart pigs, which allow us to detect corrosion, cracks or other defects along our pipeline systems, thereby protecting the environment and the safety of our communities, employees and landowners.\n\nLIQUIDS MANAGEMENT PROCESS ON GAS GATHERING PIPELINES\nWe implemented an innovative liquids management process throughout much of our natural gas gathering pipeline system by using stabilizers at our processing plants. All 44 of our stabilizers, which reduce the vapor pressure of natural gas liquids for storage and transport, have vapor recovery units to route any vapors from the stabilization process back into the plant for processing. Our liquids management process has allowed us to minimize flash emissions and methane emissions.\n\nWe also use large, specially designed slug catchers at the inlets of our gas processing facilities to separate the incoming gas and liquids, preventing the liquids from entering the gas stream. This process allows us to manage and store liquids within pipelines and pressure vessels, thereby eliminating flash emissions and methane emissions that may be associated with liquid storage tanks. These captured liquids are pushed to the natural gas processing plants where the liquid is stabilized. By stabilizing the liquid instead of storing it in a traditional liquid storage tank, a single 10,000 barrel per day stabilizer can keep as much as 40,000 tons of volatile organic compounds per year out of the atmosphere.\n\nCRUDE TRUCKING DIRECT INJECTION\nUsing a direct injection method to move crude oil from delivery trucks in a one-step process rather than an often-used two-step process allows us to reduce emissions at our crude trucking unloading stations. Our direct injection process routes crude oil directly into large pipeline storage tanks rather than multiple small temporary storage tanks that are then required to be pumped into the larger pipeline tanks. In addition, hundreds of tons of volatile organic compounds emissions are prevented annually through the process of pulling the vapors back into the large pipeline tanks when unloading the crude trucks through a vapor vent-back process.\n\nCHEMICAL INJECTION PUMPS\nChemical Injection Pumps (CIPs) are used throughout the oil and gas industry to inject relatively small amounts of chemicals into process streams to enable the production and processing of petroleum products. We continue to explore opportunities to convert our gas-driven chemical injection pumps to electric, which would eliminate gas exhaust. Solar powered electric chemical pumps are included in the U.S. EPA Natural Gas STAR Program\u2019s list of recommended technologies to reduce methane emissions.\n\nOne dual-head electric solar-driven pump replaces two of the pneumatic gas-driven injection pumps used for methanol and chemical injections. Many of the electric solar-driven pumps are dual-head injections, with one solar-charged electrical-driven pump. This eliminates the need for dual pumps and completely eliminates emissions caused by the pneumatic gas-driven diaphragm pumps.\nEnergy Efficiency\n\nWe have integrated various technologies and work practices in the design and operation of our facilities in an attempt to achieve synergistic environmental impact reductions. Below are some of the ways in which we optimize our facilities and practices to be energy efficient.\n\nFractionators\n\nOur fractionators in Mont Belvieu, Texas, are world-class facilities that are designed to be resource efficient and built with state-of-the-art emissions-reduction equipment. As such, the hot oil heaters are equipped with ultra-low nitrogen oxide burners that are outfitted with selective catalytic-reduction emission-control systems which reduce nitrogen oxide emissions.\n\nAdditionally, Mont Belvieu fractionators recover heat from the overhead products and product compression, which decreases the necessary firing rate of our hot oil heaters and reduces potential emissions from combustion. Another added benefit of recovering the heat in the process is the reduction of necessary cooling of the products in the cooling systems. By reducing the amount of cooling, the amount of raw water, water discharge and particulate matter emissions is decreased.\n\nThe product and refrigeration cooling systems at the Mont Belvieu fractionators utilize Wet Surface Air Coolers in lieu of conventional evaporative cooling towers, and their design eliminates volatile organic compound emissions from the cooling tower effluent and further reduces particulate matter emissions, raw water usage and water discharge when compared to conventional evaporative cooling towers. The Wet Surface Air Coolers are equipped with drift eliminators, an emissions-control technology that further reduces particulate matter emissions. The Wet Surface Air Coolers require less air and water flow when compared to conventional evaporative cooling towers, which reduces the amount of horsepower needed to drive the fans and water pumps and results in an overall reduction of the carbon footprints of the systems. Additionally, the Wet Surface Air Cooler water is sourced from a local water conservation and reclamation district.\n\nLiquids Pipeline System Optimization\n\nEnergy Transfer implements a variety of techniques to optimize its operations, reduce power consumption, and reduce indirect emissions across its network of oil pipelines. These techniques include:\n\n- Allocating larger volumes of crude oil to more energy efficient pipelines and ensuring a balance across both heavy and light crude lines.\n- Operating pipelines at consistent flow rates, which leads to more energy efficient operations and less overall power consumption, similar to an automobile having greater fuel efficiency on the highway versus the city.\n- Adding a Drag Reducing Agent to the crude oil to reduce pipeline fluid friction, which causes the oil to flow more efficiently, thereby decreasing the amount of energy needed to move the crude oil through the pipeline and allowing some pump stations to be bypassed.\n- Introducing power limits on some stations to avoid unnecessary spikes in the flow rate.\nNoise Mitigation\n\nDesigning and operating our systems to reduce sound levels is a key consideration in our engineering and construction processes. We carefully analyze anticipated noise levels during the job scoping and planning stages of our projects and incorporate equipment and sound abatement tools in our operations.\n\nIf noise levels are expected to be problematic during construction and/or operation, mitigation measures are addressed during the project scoping, site selection process, and planning stages. Priority is determined based on the location selected and its proximity to high consequence areas (HCAs). We ensure compliance with federal, state and local regulations.\n\nSeveral factors are taken into consideration during this process:\n\n- Location and population density of selected location\n- Equipment or type of facility to be installed\n- Proximity to HCAs\n- Decibel rating on equipment to be installed\n- Decibel rating on construction equipment to be utilized\n\nAll sound mitigation solutions are tailored to match specific noise abatement requirements determined by city, county and state regulations.\n\nWater Management\n\nEnergy Transfer continued to increase the utilization of wastewater oil recovery in 2022. Wastewater from our extensive gas gathering system is collected in produced water tanks located at many of our facilities. We also have trucks that extract small amounts of wastewater from hundreds of pipe risers along our system. These wastewater streams are aggregated at centrally located processing sites that separate the oil and water. Through autonomous gravity separation processes, these recovery systems allow us to recover approximately 95 percent of the oil entrained in the wastewater from our gathering and boosting assets. The remaining water is then sent to third-party skimming processes where additional oil recovery occurs. Energy Transfer recovered over 175,000 barrels of oil and condensate in 2022.\nIndustry Collaborations\n\nEnergy Transfer aligns with organizations that focus on emissions reductions, sharing in best reporting practices, research, and the development of new technology to promote safety and improve environmental performance.\n\nEMERGING FUELS INSTITUTE\nPRCI established the Emerging Fuels Institute (EFI) to help resolve the technical gaps that exist as the industry transitions to low carbon energy solutions using the existing pipeline asset infrastructure. Members execute the research needed to ensure the safe transportation and storage of emerging fuels, such as hydrogen, renewable natural gas, and other potential gas and liquid fuel sources, that will help meet the world\u2019s energy needs while reducing the impact to the environment. Energy Transfer is a \u201cVanguard\u201d member and maintains a leadership position in the EFI.\n\nENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE COUNCIL AND GPA MIDSTREAM\nIn 2022, the Energy Infrastructure Council (EIC) and GPA Midstream released Version 2.0 of the Midstream ESG Reporting Template. The ESG Reporting Template is the product of an extensive review of best practice ESG reporting among member companies and the ESG reporting requirements from numerous critical stakeholders. The collaborative process included members from both EIC and GPA Midstream (including Energy Transfer) and featured significant participation from in-house ESG specialists and professionals with operational and technical expertise.\n\nINTELLIGENT PIPELINE INTEGRITY PROGRAM\nThe Intelligent Pipeline Integrity Program (iPIPE) is an industry-led consortium whose focus is to contribute to the advancement of new and emerging technologies to prevent and detect gathering pipeline leaks. Our participation in iPIPE is a proactive industry effort to evaluate new technologies that can be used for leak detection, leak prevention, change detection and pipeline risk modeling.\n\nPIPELINE RESEARCH COUNCIL INTERNATIONAL\nThe Pipeline Research Council International (PRCI) is an industry research forum for technology developments and projects that assure the safe, reliable, environmentally sound and cost-effective pipeline transportation of energy to consumers worldwide. Energy Transfer participates in a leadership role in PRCI through Board membership and active participation in every technical committee, including the CO\u2082 Task Force. Many of the research projects focus on the development of new technologies that help reduce direct and indirect emissions from pipeline operations.\nConservation & Environmental Stewardship\n\nWe believe in protecting diverse ecosystems across our operational footprint and beyond to protect and preserve our treasured natural resources for future generations. As a good corporate citizen and a responsible operator, we maintain our pipeline rights-of-way in a manner that nurtures native plant growth and fosters natural environments for wildlife habitats. We also partner with wildlife and conservation organizations to extend our efforts when possible to positively impact areas adjoining our rights-of-way and the communities through which our assets pass. Additionally, we take great care to plan new projects in a manner that minimizes our environmental footprint as much as possible and restores the area to its natural beauty when we are done.\n\nFor years, Energy Transfer has proudly shown its commitment to the environment by supporting conservation-focused organizations.\n\nTotal Spent in 2022 on Wetland Mitigation Projects:\n\n$3+ million\nEnvironmental Protection\n\nDuring the planning, construction and operation of new and existing infrastructure projects, we strive to be good stewards of the lands through which we cross. Environmental reviews, using in-house subject matter experts and third-party specialists, are key components for all our projects.\n\nWe do the following during an environmental review to help reduce our footprint and maintain the natural integrity of the area:\n\n- Evaluate the location, scope and timing of new projects, and adjust when possible, to avoid impacts to vulnerable species.\n- Reduce the duration, intensity, extent, and/or likelihood of impacts on the ecosystem when possible.\n- Reestablish an ecosystem\u2019s composition, structure and function to a healthy state.\n- Develop measurable conservation outcomes that can mitigate residual impacts after appropriate avoidance, minimization and restoration measures have been applied.\n- Fully comply with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, standards, and permit conditions intended to protect the ecosystems in which we operate, including the requirements to conduct baseline studies and impact assessments.\n- Work with surface owners in a cooperative fashion to minimize and restore areas disturbed by our construction or operations.\n- Train employees on the importance of environmental protection and ecological preservation, and provide information on the species or habitat sensitivities for the location or project on which they are working.\n- Engage with affected parties on ecological preservation issues pertaining to our development, construction and ongoing operations, including interests specific to affected Indigenous peoples.\n- Collaborate with peers through the sharing of best practices.\n- Report meaningful and relevant progress in accordance with project approvals, when appropriate.\n\nIn addition to the comprehensive environmental review process, we are fully committed to restoring all of our rights-of-way to their original state or better, and partnering with conservation organizations to protect natural resources and wildlife.\nIntegrated Vegetation Management\n\nWe conducted a multi-year study on Integrated Vegetation Management (IVM) within our right-of-way in the Stateline Sand Ponds Natural Area in Clay County, Arkansas. IVM is defined as the practice of promoting desirable, stable, low-growing plant communities that will resist invasion by tall growing tree species through the use of appropriate, environmentally sound, and cost-effective control methods. Tall, woody vegetation is undesirable because it can cause damage to pipelines, block the view of pipeline markers, and create safety issues for employees performing routine inspections. Specifically, our IVM study measured the effectiveness of herbicide treatment on wetland trees while encouraging regrowth of the native leitneria floridana species\u2014a rare shrub commonly known as the corkwood. Prior to our study, the corkwood had diminished to 10 percent of the total plant population. As a result, the corkwood shrub has expanded to occupy 35 percent of the plant community. The team concluded that this form of IVM made a positive impact by controlling the undesired plant species and providing space for the corkwood and native plants to flourish, thereby restoring habitats for pollinators and other wildlife. The positive results have encouraged further implementation of IVM practices along our rights-of-way where appropriate.\n\nConservation\n\nWETLAND CONSERVATION\n\nPipeline developers are required to obtain authorizations from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) as well as other state and federal regulatory agencies prior to constructing certain pipeline segments. The Corps is responsible for authorizing activities that may affect federally regulated waters and wetlands.\n\nDUCKS UNLIMITED\n\nWe\u2019re proud to continue our partnership with Ducks Unlimited (DU) to support key wetland and grassland conservation efforts. In 2022, we donated $250,000 to support wetland conservation efforts on the J.D. Murphree Wildlife Management Area (WMA) in Jefferson County, Texas. This project is particularly important to us because of its proximity to our Nederland Terminal, our largest facility on the Gulf Coast. The donation will help replace existing, deteriorated water control structures, refurbish levees, install a new re-lift pump and remove flotant marsh and sediment. It will help enhance wetland habitat on 1,700 acres of coastal marsh, and once completed, will enhance wildlife habitat, improve water quality and support community resilience.\nWildlife Protection & Habitat Restoration\n\nWe understand the many important benefits of maintaining healthy and diverse ecosystems and strive to minimize our impact on biodiversity in areas where we work and operate. As such, we take a proactive approach to partnering with organizations that help cultivate thriving ecosystems by protecting animals and preserving their habitats. Some examples of these organizations include:\n\n**LESSE R PRAIRIE CHICKEN**\n\nWe participate in the Lesser Prairie Chicken Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances, a collaborative effort of state wildlife agencies to help reduce the threats to at-risk species. Since joining the Conservation Agreement with industry partners, the Lesser Prairie Chicken population has more than doubled from 2014 levels.\n\n**TEXAS HORN SHELL MUSSEL**\n\nSince 2018, Energy Transfer has supported the Texas Hornshell Mussel Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances. The Agreement is a collaborative effort with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to reduce threats to this endangered species.\n\n**NATIONAL WILD TURKEY FEDERATION**\n\nWe support the National Wild Turkey Federation (NWTF) along many of our rights-of-way by planting specialized seeds and implementing an IVM program that promotes desirable, stable, low-growing plants. In 2022, restoration on the Gulf Run Pipeline began using our rights-of-way that were eligible for reseeding by planting native plants in accordance with our agreement with NWTF. Additionally, we are a Diamond Life Sponsor for our work with NWTF in Pennsylvania.\n\n**TRI-STATE BIRD & RESCUE**\n\nWe continue our annual support to Tri-State Bird Rescue & Research, a nonprofit conservation organization in Delaware that supports indigenous wild bird rehabilitation.\n\n**PENNSYLVANIA STATE GAME LANDS**\n\nAs part of our comprehensive right-of-way restoration efforts, we work alongside state and federal agencies to identify and execute a number of long-term habitat improvement projects. In 2022, special pollinator seed mixes were planted and more than 150 bee boxes were installed on state game lands in Cambria, Blair and Huntington counties in Pennsylvania. These projects were aimed at increasing the population of native bees, and it quickly proved successful in attracting not only a variety of native bees, but a high diversity of butterflies and other insects.\n\n**WILDLIFE HABITAT COUNCIL**\n\nWe annually support the Wildlife Habitat Council, a conservation organization that helps preserve and enhance biodiversity on corporate lands by empowering environmental stewardship through partnerships and education.\n\n**PARTNERSHIP FOR THE DELAWARE ESTUARY**\n\nWe continue our annual support of the Partnership for the Delaware Estuary, which leads collaborative, science-based efforts to improve the Delaware River and Bay, covering portions of Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.\n\n**QUAIL FOREVER**\n\nQuail Forever biologists support our IVM program in Arkansas by advising on projects and right-of-way and helping evaluate seed mixes as needed for revegetation.\nClean Air Corporation\n\nEnergy Transfer owns an approximately six percent interest in the Clean Air Action Corporation and holds a seat on the board of directors. For three decades, the Clean Air Action Corporation has improved air quality through its tree planting program while providing income opportunities to farmers in Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya and India. Today, more than 150,000 farmers have planted over 25 million trees that protect against erosion, preserve biodiversity, and restore degraded land.\n\nThe Environmental Partnership\n\nEnergy Transfer is a member of The Environmental Partnership, a coalition of 100 energy companies committed to continuously improving the industry\u2019s environmental performance. The Partnership is focused on continuously improving the industry\u2019s environmental performance by taking action, learning about best practices and technologies, and fostering collaboration to responsibly develop our nation\u2019s essential oil and natural gas resources.\n\nArbor Day Foundation\n\nIn 2022, Energy Transfer partnered with the Arbor Day Foundation to plant 25,000 trees in Texas, Indiana and Michigan, helping to improve wildlife habitats, watershed restoration, disease and invasive species control, and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In total, the project will sequester an estimated 17,367 metric tons of carbon dioxide over a 40-year project lifespan. This is the equivalent of taking 3,775 cars off the road. The tree planting initiative was made possible by a nearly $30,000 donation by Energy Transfer in 2021.\n\nTrees Planted in 2022:\n\n- **25,000**\n  - Across Texas, Indiana and Michigan\n\nCO\u2082 Sequestration:\n\n- **17,367**\n  - Metric Tons Over 40 years\n\n**TEXAS**\n\nPlanted 10,000 longleaf pine trees across several private lands alongside the Longleaf Alliance. Longleaf pine was once the dominant tree species in the southern United States and today covers less than three percent of its original territory. The trees planted as part of our partnership will expand the longleaf pine\u2019s reach, help reduce forest fragmentation and protect multiple wildlife species.\n\n**INDIANA**\n\nPlanted 5,000 trees in Wallier Woods, a 673-acre nature preserve dedicated to wild bat conservation. A mix of tree species, such as white oak, black oak, shagbark hickory, tulip, and American chesnut, are being planted. These trees will help to improve wildlife habitats and other local environmental issues, including watershed restoration, disease and invasive species control.\n\n**MICHIGAN**\n\nPlanted 10,000 Jack Pine trees to rehabilitate public land back to its natural state. This also provides additional benefits like improved carbon sequestration, water filtration, and a variety of habitats for local wildlife like deer, turkey, grouse, and most notably, the Kirtland\u2019s warbler.\nOur Social Responsibility\n\nLifting up the communities in which we operate is fundamental to who we are as a Partnership.

They provide counsel to all levels of Energy Transfer\u2019s organization and support other departments, including Legal, Compliance, and Public Relations, with stakeholder engagement and employee communications activities.\n\nPUBLIC AWARENESS\nEnergy Transfer\u2019s Public Awareness Program is designed to raise awareness of the presence of pipelines and educate the public on how to recognize a leak and who to contact in the event of a pipeline incident. Primary stakeholder groups include affected members of the public, emergency responders, public officials and excavators.\n\nINVESTOR RELATIONS\nOur Investor Relations team serves as the bridge between our management team and our key financial stakeholders. They work to maintain an open dialogue and build strong relationships with all current and potential investors by providing transparent and timely company updates. Resources include press releases, quarterly earnings calls, and regularly posting investor presentations and SEC filings to our corporate website.\n\nPUBLIC RELATIONS & COMMUNICATIONS\nOur Public Relations and Communications team manages strategic communications channels, including the website and social media platforms. They also develop and maintain relationships with the media and partner with project teams to create educational materials for new projects to better inform the public and interested stakeholders.\n\nRespect For All People, Traditions & Cultures\nWe believe that creating healthy, strong communities requires a collective commitment to doing what is right. That includes respecting local cultures, supporting economic development opportunities and engaging with those organizations that care for our communities. We operate our business in a manner that honors and respects all people and the communities in which we do business. We believe in fostering a respectful workplace by sharing our varied backgrounds to make us a stronger, more successful organization.\n\nWe respect the history and culture of indigenous people and recognize their legally protected rights. We maintain multi-year easement agreements with 17 Native American Tribes across seven different states, and we spent $19.4 million on mutually agreed easements in 2022. Additionally, we were pleased to fund more than $37,000 in scholarships to support various Native American schools.\nExtensive Public Awareness\n\nAn important aspect of responsible pipeline operations is ongoing education and communication with those who live and work near pipelines. Developed under the guidance of federal pipeline safety regulations, our comprehensive public awareness program provides critical information regarding pipeline safety, damage prevention and emergency response. Our key stakeholders are anyone who lives or works near our pipelines, including residents, emergency responders, public officials, schools, businesses, places of congregation and excavators. We use a wide-range of communications tactics and platforms, from printed mailings, face-to-face meetings, television, radio, social media, print media and our corporate website. To allow for two-way communication, the Public Awareness team established a non-emergency phone number and email address to engage with stakeholders.\n\nIn 2022, our annual public awareness mailing reached more than 2.3 million stakeholders, a record amount for Energy Transfer. The mailing included:\n\n- 1,893,936 Neighbors, Businesses and Schools\n- 397,784 Excavators\n- 33,669 Emergency Officials\n\n811: PROMOTING SAFE DIGGING\n\nEnergy Transfer regularly promotes safe digging by calling 8-1-1, a nationwide toll-free number. 811 has proven to be the foremost preventive measure in excavation safety and damage prevention. There are two major campaigns, National Safe Digging Month and 811 Day. To celebrate the kick-off of National Safe Digging Month in April, Energy Transfer displayed more than 250 banners at our locations across the country.\n\nPIPELINE LOCATOR\n\nA unique feature, first introduced in 2021, is Energy Transfer\u2019s Pipeline Locator (available on the Energy Transfer website). This user-friendly platform allows anyone to view Energy Transfer\u2019s pipelines within a two-mile radius. It\u2019s accessible 24/7, and our traffic reports indicate an average of 250 users access the free tool every month.\n\nGOOD NEIGHBOR AWARD\n\nThe Good Neighbor program was created in 2008 as a way of recognizing those who help protect our pipeline system. We regularly communicate with our neighbors and encourage them to report suspicious activities near our assets. The program strives to make everyone more aware of at-risk behavior. Previous recipients have included a farmer who stopped a backhoe from damaging the pipeline and a homeowner who reported blowing gas, a result of someone who struck a meter.\n\nCONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT\n\nOur Public Awareness Program is regularly inspected by federal and state regulators, and we work continuously to improve our program. We use three tools to measure the effectiveness of the public awareness program:\n\n1. Annually, we conduct an internal self-assessment to measure program implementation.\n2. We survey our local operations managers annually to determine if additional public awareness outreach is necessary using 9-part criteria outlined by regulations.\n3. We participate in the Public Awareness Program Effectiveness Research Survey (PAPERS), a joint industry research survey facilitated by the American Petroleum Institute and Interstate Natural Gas Association of America. The data shows that our communication efforts are resonating with stakeholder audiences, and we generally fall within or lead our peer group of other large midstream operators.\nBuilding Relationships With Emergency Responders\n\nIntegral to our Public Awareness Program is our partnership with local emergency responders and public officials, which establishes important lines of communication, coordinates resources, and develops a concerted response system for managing pipeline-related incidents. We implement a series of activities to engage with these critical stakeholders, including facilitated liaison meetings, training exercises, personal outreach and targeted communications materials.\n\nIn 2022, we sponsored and participated in 607 liaison meetings across our entire pipeline system and educated 22,422 stakeholders, including 9,258 emergency officials, 2,200 public and school officials, and almost 11,000 excavation professionals.\n\nEMERGENCY MANAGEMENT TRAINING\n\nOur in-house emergency management team conducts annual emergency preparedness exercises in accordance with regulations set forth by the Environmental Protection Agency. These exercises prepare personnel to respond to emergency incidents and events in a coordinated manner alongside regulatory agencies and local responders.\n\nIn 2022, Energy Transfer conducted more emergency response exercises than ever before, including:\n\n- 86 annual OPA 90 emergency response exercises\n- 12 annual CFR 192/195 facilities emergency response exercises\n- 8 annual H\u2082S emergency response exercises\n- 25 geographic response strategies\n- 85 unannounced emergency procedures exercises\n\nIn 2022 alone, we donated more than $150,000 to first responder organizations located in eight different states.\n\nFIRST RESPONDERS SUPPORT\n\nSupporting first responders in the communities where we operate remains a top priority for our company. In 2022 alone, we donated more than $150,000 to first responder organizations located in eight different states. The relationships we build through these efforts establish important lines of communication and collaboration and provide needed support to our neighbors and to our assets.\nDisciplined & Ethical Corporate Governance\n\nEnergy Transfer\u2019s Board of Directors and its leadership team work closely to monitor risks and evaluate opportunities. The ethical standards of our Partnership rest on obeying the law and doing what is right.\n\nEvery Energy Transfer employee must respect and obey the laws of the cities, states and countries where we operate. We believe that strict adherence to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is not only the right thing to do, but it is in the best interest of the Partnership, our unitholders, our customers and the industry in general. Employees who violate these policies will be subject to disciplinary action and/or discharge.\n\nThe Energy Transfer Family\n\nAt Energy Transfer, we believe our dedicated, results-driven employees are our most valued asset. We go to great lengths to recruit and invest in our employees who share our core values and who bring their own unique backgrounds, experiences and perspectives to share in our vision of excellence and growth. To recruit and retain our employees, we strive to offer competitive wages, provide learning and advancement opportunities, and foster an atmosphere where health, safety and wellness are significant factors in how we structure our business. The Energy Transfer family continued to grow in 2022 with close to 1,500 new offers accepted\u2014a 90 percent offer accepted success rate and a count of nearly 11,000 total employees by the end of the year.\n\nEmployee Demographics*\n\n- Female employees: 14%\n- Female employees who are managers and above: 18%\n- Minority employees (EEOC defined): 27%\n- Minority employees who are managers and above: 17%\n- Employees who are managers and above that are below the age 50: 48%\n- Employees who are managers and above and are also below the age of 50 and are considered minority: 20%\n- More than 600 veterans and active service members of the U.S. military\n\nHiring Local\n\nAs a United States-based company, Energy Transfer makes it a priority to keep jobs local, as opposed to outsourcing to other countries. Various corporate services, including our Human Resources, Information Technology and our Accounting and Finance departments, are all based in the United States.\n\nWork life balance is an important part of the Energy Transfer family culture, and we can proudly report that on average 92 percent of our employees are local, residing within 50 miles of their respective offices. This was calculated by looking at our offices across the country that employ 50 employees or more. This dynamic creates more opportunities for our employees to spend time with their families, participate in their perspective communities and append less time commuting to and from the office each day.\n\n*Excludes Sunoco and USAC employees\nEmployee Training & Development\n\nWe believe a company is only as good as its people.\n\nWe invest in the growth of our workforce through training and development opportunities to ensure our employees across the country are prepared and empowered to lead. Excellent training and development, combined with a culture of honesty, trust and respect, results in a company with strong values engrained into its foundation and employees.\n\nOur required employee compliance trainings are a priority of our senior management. A comprehensive training dashboard allows senior management to actively monitor these training activities. Company wide, there are 16 annual compliance trainings, in addition to numerous targeted trainings. In 2022, 100 percent of our employees completed the annual Code of Business Conduct & Ethics training and the Annual Harassment training.\n\nRequired Compliance Trainings for Employees Include:\n\n- Code of Business Conduct and Ethics\n- FCPA/Anti-Corruption\n- FERC Standards of Conduct\n- Conflicts of Interest, Gifts, Insider Trading\n- Sexual Harassment\n\nThe Compliance Training department keeps open lines of communication with the Office of Ethics and Compliance (OEC), Legal, Human Resources and other departments to determine and adjust training materials. The OEC reviews gifts, conflict of interest, due diligence and ethics helpline activity, and provides feedback to the Compliance Training department on necessary changes based on compliance incidents. Each training course provides the participant with the contact information of applicable departments if they need guidance or have any questions or concerns.\n\nEmployees have access to webinars that expand their knowledge of our business and provide ongoing development of interpersonal and business skills. Energy Transfer also offers a series of leadership development courses designed to educate supervisors on how to lead and motivate employees, along with how to effectively engage in performance and development conversations with direct reports. Additionally, all supervisors are required to complete annual performance reviews for each of their direct reports, helping to identify growth and career development opportunities for our employees.\n\nTo promote continuous learning, the Partnership offers year-round courses available to all employees in the following areas:\n\n- DiSC \u2013 Workplace Behavioral Styles\n- Time Management\n- Listening Skills\n- Negotiating Skills\n- Decision Making\n- Your Conflict Approach and When to Use it\n- Personal Skills to Create a Cohesive Team\nAdvanced Leadership Training\n\nIn 2022, Energy Transfer kicked-off its inaugural Advanced Leadership Program. Working with Southern Methodist University\u2019s (SMU) Executive Education Department, the two-part custom program included 25 Directors and Senior Directors across the Partnership from crude trucking, HR, IT, engineering and operations. It was held on the campus of SMU and facilitated by the SMU Cox School of Business Center faculty.\n\nTopics included:\n\n- The Role of Emotional Intelligence in Business\n- Authentic and Intentional Leadership\n- Creating a High Trust Organization\n- Effective Decision Making\n- Time Value of Money and Value Creation\n- Capital Budgeting and Project Analysis\n\nInternship Program\n\nEnergy Transfer offers a unique internship opportunity for college-aged students. The 12-week program provides real-world experience within various departments including tax, accounting, commercial, engineering, marketing, business development, supply chain, alternative energy, and finance, and is combined with thoughtful mentorship opportunities. The program continues to grow, and in 2022, we employed 32 interns across the company.\nEmployee Support & Benefits\n\nAn integral part of recruiting and retaining a leading workforce is our competitive compensation and benefits programs which include, but are not limited to:\n\n**COMPENSATION** We compensate our employees competitively on a total compensation basis. We have four major compensation cycles that give managers a chance to reward employees for their hard work and outstanding performance\u2014bonuses, merit increases, promotions/salary adjustments and long-term incentive awards. The partnership has a professional Compensation Team that routinely evaluates market data and trends to determine if changes are needed to stay competitive with the energy and broader labor markets.\n\n**401K** Employees can participate in our 401K program, and the Partnership will match 100 percent of the first five percent of all eligible base wage contributions. An additional three percent matching contribution is made by the company for those employees who earn under $175,000 on an annual basis.\n\n**HEALTH COVERAGE** Our employee premiums are below industry average. Employees can choose from multiple levels of medical, dental, vision and prescription plans.\n\n**PAID TIME OFF** Eligible employees receive paid vacation, sick time and holidays.\n\n**DISABILITY COVERAGE** We offer access to short-term and long-term disability plans.\n\n**FLEXIBLE WORK SCHEDULE** Energy Transfer has policies which provide for, with appropriate management approval, work from home, part-time employment, and flexible work schedules, including flextime between the hours of 6 a.m. and 7 p.m. and, at some locations, compressed work schedules.\n\n**FLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNT** The Partnership provides two great ways to save pre-tax money to pay for health care and day care \u2014 Health Care and Dependent Care Flexible Spending Accounts.\n\n**HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNT** Employees can elect to utilize a Health Savings Account, and we set aside money in a separate bank account in their name.\n\n**TRAVEL ASSISTANCE** We offer Assist America for travel assistance. When you are traveling 100 miles or more away from home, Assist America can help with emergency medical assistance and evacuation, short-term prescription replacement, personal services, passport replacement and more.\n\n**EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE PLAN** The Partnership is committed to providing employees with a competitive educational assistance plan to encourage professional development. The plan is designed to reimburse eligible employees for many of their tuition expenses, provided the expenses are for eligible classes considered by management to better qualify an employee for their present duties, prepare for advancement opportunities, or be part of the employee\u2019s individual development plan.\n\n**CONTINUING EDUCATION** Certain positions within the Partnership require continuing education to maintain various professional licenses, DOT certifications or technical/professional certifications. The Partnership will consider payment for courses supporting the maintenance of professional licenses and reimbursement for reasonable expenses associated with professional/technical certification. General training programs, seminars and workshops that maintain or improve knowledge and skills can also be eligible for payment.\n\n**EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM** All employees are eligible for the Employee Assistance Program that helps find childcare and elder care resources in the employee\u2019s community, as well as counseling services that can help with family and parenting challenges.\n\n**FAMILY PLANNING** We understand the road to parenthood can be challenging and believe that everyone should have access to the care they need to have the family they deserve. We partner with Progyny to offer comprehensive treatment coverage. We also offer an Adoption Program through Progyny. Once the adoption is finalized, the program will pay a lump-sum reimbursement payment, up to $10,000, for eligible expenses.\n\n**PAID LEAVE PROGRAMS** Maintaining a balance between work and family responsibilities is important. To support our employees, we offer paid leave to full-time employees.\n\n- **Paid Maternity Leave** - We provide employees up to eight consecutive weeks for giving birth and ten consecutive weeks for cesarean birth at 100% of base wages. Additionally, lactation rooms are available at many of our offices.\n- **Parental Leave** - Non-birthing parents welcoming a child through birth or adoption can take up to two weeks of paid parental leave anytime within the first twelve months of the child\u2019s birth or adoption.\n- **Elder Care** - Caring for a parent with a serious illness can be challenging. We support our employees by providing up to one week per calendar year, with a lifetime limit of two weeks, to employees who need to take time away to care for a parent or parent-in-law who needs acute care or has a terminal illness.\nEqual Opportunity & Non-Discrimination\n\nEnergy Transfer is an equal opportunity employer that does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, disability, pregnancy, veteran status, citizenship status, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law (including affiliation with someone in a protected class). This policy covers all employees and applicants of the Company. This policy applies to all employment decisions and terms and conditions of employment, including but not limited to recruitment, hiring, placement, promotion, transfer, training, development, compensation, benefits, demotion, discipline and termination. The Company will not tolerate any discrimination prohibited by this policy by anyone at work or engaged in Company business, which includes work-related activities such as conventions, seminars, or social events. Additionally, the ADA requires we provide reasonable accommodations so an individual with a disability can perform the essential functions of the job, complete the job application process and enjoy equal access to benefits and privileges of employment.\n\nAll employees must comply with this policy and have a responsibility to promptly report any suspected violations of this policy. Any employee who believes this policy has been violated should immediately report it to his/her supervisor, a Human Resources representative, any manager, the Executive Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer or the EthicsPoint Confidential Helpline.\n\nEthics Helpline\n\nEnergy Transfer has an anonymous and confidential third-party administered helpline, EthicsPoint, that is available 24 hours a day. Any person\u2014an employee, former employee, whistleblower or concerned citizen\u2014can report instances of possible non-compliance. There is an established process for appropriately handling reports. All reports are escalated to the Chief Compliance Officer, the Office of Ethics and Compliance, Human Resources and the Internal Audit Group and then investigated and promptly resolved. The Code of Business of Conduct and Ethics is clear that retaliation will never be tolerated for anyone raising a possible compliance issue in good faith. The company does not allow any form of retaliation against employees based upon their use of the helpline or reporting of any violations of the law or company policies.\nEnergy Transfer is committed to disciplined and ethical corporate governance, which promotes the long-term interests of our stakeholders, strengthens Energy Transfer\u2019s Board of Directors (Board) and management accountability, and helps build public trust in our operations. The Board has adopted both the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applicable to our directors, officers and employees, and Corporate Governance Guidelines for the Board.\n\nOur Board is comprised of executive and independent members, 44 percent of the members are considered \u201cindependent\u201d under the NYSE\u2019s corporate governance standards. They have experience, skills and qualifications relevant to the business of Energy Transfer, such as experience in energy or related industries, expertise in natural gas operations or finance, and a history of service in executive leadership positions. They also have significant experience in corporate responsibility-related matters. The Board has two committees:\n\n- **The Audit Committee** has the authority and responsibility to review our external financial reporting, review procedures for internal auditing and the adequacy of our internal accounting controls, and engage and direct our independent accountants. The Audit Committee provides risk oversight through its quarterly meetings, where it receives a report from Energy Transfer\u2019s internal auditor, who reports directly to the Audit Committee, and reviews Energy Transfer\u2019s contingencies with management and our independent auditors. The Audit Committee receives and reviews EH&S compliance audits to monitor the environmental risks.\n\n- **The Compensation Committee** establishes standards and makes recommendations concerning the compensation of our officers and directors. In addition, the Compensation Committee determines and establishes the standards for any awards to our employees and officers under the equity compensation plans, including the performance standards or other restrictions pertaining to the vesting of any such awards.\n\n**Risk Management**\n\nEnergy Transfer\u2019s management team oversees our Enterprise Risk Management program to identify, evaluate and manage risk exposure. Our risk management policies and procedures are instituted at every level by managers and above and are monitored and reviewed for effectiveness through an audit assessment, the results of which are reported to executive management.\n\nA Compliance Risk Assessment is conducted every two years (and more frequently, if necessary, based upon changes to the business environment) by the Office of Ethics and Compliance, which reports to Energy Transfer\u2019s Legal Department. The Internal Audit group prepares an annual audit plan (identifying areas of risk and potential for review) and conducts audits on the effectiveness of policies on a periodic basis. These results are communicated to the executive management team and to the Audit Committee of the Board.\nSupply Chain Management\n\nIn 2022, we managed service agreements with more than 5,000 vendors.\n\nEnergy Transfer utilizes a variety of contractors, suppliers and vendors. We depend on this community to support our day-to-day operations and maintain our status as one of the largest and most diversified energy service companies.\n\nWe place great importance on building and maintaining relationships with contractors, suppliers and vendors. The relationships are rooted in our \u201cWe Believe\u201d Core Values and our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics lays out clear guidelines, including ethical behavior, conflict of interest, and compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. Our procurement-related contracts (and many of our service agreements) require new suppliers to sign off on the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Existing suppliers must sign a Code of Business Conduct Acknowledgement Form.\n\nVendor Vetting\n\nWe maintain stringent vendor vetting procedures that help evaluate vendors for red flags and conflicts of interest. We utilize a third party to help investigate new vendors using comprehensive vendor vetting criteria and scoring methodology.\n\nProcurement Guidelines\n\nWe maintain an Approved Manufacturers List with manufacturers approved to provide Pressure Containing and Motion Restricting (PCMR) materials for natural gas, natural gas liquids and crude oil service. We require that manufacturers are technically capable of producing those materials in accordance with our specifications and are commercially capable of supporting their product. We also require that any PCMR material that the company utilizes provides safe and reliable service and that appropriate efforts have been made to verify the safety and reliability of the material. Audits of manufacturers are conducted on an as-needed basis.\n\nAdapting to Supply Chain Market Conditions\n\nEnergy Transfer continues to mitigate potential impacts to operations or projects and avoid business interruption or project delays due to supply chain market disruptions. There are several strategic efforts to help ensure our complex supply chain remains resilient and prepared for any type of potential disruption. We prioritize supplier transparency and strive to remain in continuous contact with distributors and manufacturers in order to understand their inventory levels. For example, in 2022, with longer than average lead times for materials from industry suppliers, we executed a pipe inventory program with distributors to guarantee pipe availability. The pipe was primarily utilized for our well connect program.\nCybersecurity Programs\n\nProtecting the nation\u2019s energy infrastructure from the real and ever-changing threats from cybercriminals is a critical focus for Energy Transfer.\n\nWe strive to proactively protect the organization\u2019s property, mission, customers, employees, and the public through a robust cybersecurity program modeled after the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework and led by the Information Security Management Office. Through partnerships with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), we follow industry cybersecurity standards and work diligently to protect the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure against cyberattacks from domestic and international threats.\n\nUsing a defense-in-depth approach, layers of technology, policies and training are employed at all levels of the enterprise to keep the company\u2019s IT and SCADA assets secure and operational. We use security threat intelligence, incident response, identity and access management, supply-chain security assessments, endpoint protection, network segmentation, event monitoring and a Security Operations Center (SOC) to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of systems. Our security program is vetted through third-party audits, assessments and penetration tests to validate its effectiveness and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nUnion Relations\n\nEnergy Transfer respects the right of its employees to choose whether to be represented by a union. While most of our employees are not represented by unions, in 2022 we did have less than 10% who were represented by a union. Energy Transfer has a well-established history of positive, cooperative business relationships with the unions representing our employees. We seek to build and strengthen our relationship with labor leadership through two-way, open and honest communication that promotes a greater understanding of Partnership and employees\u2019 needs and fosters opportunities for growth for both.\n\nSubsidiaries & Affiliates\n\nIn addition to our core business segments, we also have stakes in various operations held by multiple subsidiaries and affiliates, which include retail propane, natural gas marketing services, natural resources operations, and natural gas compression services, among others. Subsidiaries and affiliates in these areas include:\n\n- Sunoco LP\n- USA Compression\n- Dual Drive Technologies\n- SEC Energy\n- SemCams Midstream\nIndustry Recognition\n\nThomas Long, Co-CEO of Energy Transfer LP, was named to the Board of Directors of the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM). Long joined the NAM Board to bolster the association\u2019s leadership in policy advocacy, legal action, workforce solutions, operational excellence and news and insights.\n\nThe NAM is the nation\u2019s most influential manufacturing advocate, and its membership includes some of the world\u2019s most iconic brands and many of the small manufacturers that power the U.S. economy. The NAM and its members are at the forefront of every important policy debate, focusing on solutions to help the industry compete in the global economy and help the country address challenges ranging from supply disruptions and inflation to the workforce crisis and energy security.\n\nIndustry Affiliations\n\nEnergy Transfer partners and collaborates with national and state trade and professional associations that represent and support the oil and gas industry.
