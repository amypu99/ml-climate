This document provides an update on our corporate greenhouse gas footprint, our progress in reducing these emissions, and our plan to reach our net zero goals. Highlights include:\n\n- Setting emissions reduction targets that have been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).\n- Achieving 100 percent renewable energy in our global offices.\\(^2\\)\n- Launching a supplier sustainability program to drive scope 3 emissions reductions.\n- Continuing to invest in high quality nature-based solutions to help protect the natural world.\n\n\\(^1\\) Including Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions associated with our corporate operations as outlined in Appendix A.\n\n\\(^2\\) We matched our global corporate electricity use with renewable energy for 2020 and 2021 by purchasing energy attribute certificates (i.e., renewable energy certificates, guarantees of origin, or similar instruments) sufficient to match 100 percent of our global electricity use for our corporate operations for those years. Our 2020 renewable energy purchases are not reflected in our Scope 2 GHG emissions measurement for 2020 because the energy attribute certificates for 2020 had not been delivered at the time we completed our emissions inventory for that year.\nMeasuring our corporate greenhouse gas emissions footprint\n\nAirbnb has measured our greenhouse gas emissions, guided by the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol Accounting and Reporting Standards and working with Watershed, our third-party sustainability partner, starting with 2019 as our baseline year. This measurement helps us understand the sources of our emissions, identify possible ways to reduce them, and monitor our progress over time. Going forward, we plan to measure the GHG footprint for our corporate operations each year, along with the progress toward our reduction targets.\n\nThe following chart outlines our greenhouse gas emissions by scope over the past three years (2019 to 2021).\n\nCorporate GHG Emissions by Scope (2019-2021)\n\n| GHG Emissions | Unit | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|---------------|------|------|------|------|\n| **Scope 1**   |      |      |      |      |\n| Direct emissions from stationary combustion (natural gas) | MTCO2e | 815  | 844  | 807  |\n| **Scope 2**   |      |      |      |      |\n| Indirect emissions from purchased electricity (market-based) | MTCO2e | 6,358 | 5,239 | 0    |\n| **Scope 3**   |      |      |      |      |\n| Indirect emissions that are calculated throughout the upstream and downstream value chain | MTCO2e | 387,785 | 209,926 | 254,867 |\n| **Total**     |      |      |      |      |\n| MTCO2e        |      | 394,958 | 216,009 | 255,674 |\n| **Scope 3 (Emissions Intensity)** | MTCO2e/$1M gross profit | 108  | 84   | 53   |\n\n3 2020 was an anomaly: total emissions were 45.3 percent lower than 2019 as a result of Covid-19-driven reductions such as lower spending with suppliers, employee business travel and commuting.\n\n4 Airbnb\u2019s Scope 3 emissions measurement includes the following categories defined by the GHG Protocol: 3.1 Purchased goods and services, 3.2 Capital goods, 3.3 Fuel- and energy-related activities (not included in Scope 1 and Scope 2), 3.5 Waste generated in operations, 3.6 Business travel, 3.7 Employee commuting, and 3.8 Upstream leased assets.\n\n5 Scope 3 emissions intensity measured using the economic intensity method as set by SBTi\u2019s Greenhouse Gas Emissions per Value Added (GEVA). SBTi provides that the term \u201cvalue added\u201d can be defined as gross profit, operating profit, revenue minus the cost of purchased goods and services, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) plus all personnel costs. \u201cGross profit\u201d for purposes of Airbnb\u2019s emissions intensity measurement is calculated as revenue minus cost of revenue.\nSummary\n\n- Our Scope 1 emissions did not change significantly between 2019 and 2021.\n\n- We reduced our Scope 2 emissions by 100 percent from 2019 due to our purchase of renewable energy to match our global corporate electricity use for 2021.\u00b2\n\n- Our Scope 3 (absolute) emissions declined by 34.3 percent from 2019 to 2021, driven by a mix of overall cost management, pandemic-related reductions in spending, and reduced business travel and employee-related emissions driven by the move to hybrid and remote work. As we work toward our net zero goal, our target for Scope 3 corporate emissions is to reduce our emissions intensity in line with SBTi guidelines.\n\nA detailed view of Airbnb\u2019s emissions breakdown is available in Appendix A.\u2076\n\n---\n\n\u2076 We engaged an external third party to provide limited assurance over certain metrics disclosed. Their report is available here.\nReducing our corporate emissions as part of our net zero goal\n\nWhile we\u2019re proud of the progress we have made to date, we know there is much more work to be done. We have developed GHG emissions reduction targets for all scopes of emissions associated with our global corporate operations. These targets have been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) \u2014 the lead partner of the Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C campaign.7\n\nBy 2030, we are committing to reducing our corporate emissions as follows from our 2019 baseline year:\n\n- Reducing Scope 1 and 2 (absolute) emissions by 78.4 percent.\n- Reducing Scope 3 emissions intensity (MtCO2e/$1M gross profit) by 55 percent.\n\nOur targets help define our emissions reduction efforts on our path to net zero. More information about the steps we are taking toward these targets is below.\n\nScope 1 and 2 emissions\n\nWe are matching our office electricity use with 100 percent renewable energy purchases, allowing us to meet \u2013 and exceed \u2013 our Scope 1 and 2 science based targets. As a member of the RE100, a global corporate renewable energy initiative bringing together businesses committed to 100 percent renewable electricity, we plan to continue sourcing renewable energy according to RE100 standards, and, further, to look for opportunities to transition to more direct sources of renewable energy.8\n\nWe also plan to take additional steps to continue reducing these emissions, including:\n\n- Improving office energy data collection to help our teams identify energy efficiency opportunities.\n- Conducting a detailed building sustainability review for our San Francisco headquarters, beginning this year.\n- Refining our office sustainability guidelines to identify further emissions reduction opportunities in our buildings, and the materials used to create them.\n\n---\n\n7 Airbnb\u2019s emissions reduction targets have been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as consistent with levels required to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. According to SBTi, the targets covering greenhouse gas emissions from Airbnb\u2019s operations (Scopes 1 and 2) are consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5\u00b0C, what the latest climate science has told us is needed to prevent the most damaging effects of climate change. Airbnb\u2019s target for the emissions from our value chain (Scope 3 for corporate operations) meet the SBTi\u2019s criteria for ambitious value chain goals, meaning they are in line with current best practice.\n\n8 As noted in footnote 2, we matched our global corporate electricity use with renewable energy for 2020 and 2021 by purchasing energy attribute certificates (i.e., renewable energy certificates, guarantees of origin, or similar instruments) sufficient to match 100 percent of our global electricity use for our corporate operations for those years. Specifically with regard to the RE100 technical criteria, for 2020, the renewable energy we sourced was approximately 88 percent compliant (as we were unable to source renewable energy locally in certain markets due to lack of availability and low volumes), and for 2021, we sourced renewable energy to be 100 percent compliant with the RE100 technical criteria.\nScope 3 emissions\n\nAs with many companies, the majority of Airbnb\u2019s corporate emissions are Scope 3 and largely attributable to our work with suppliers.\n\nWe are partnering closely with teams across the business and external experts, including the Environmental Defense Fund and Watershed, to identify opportunities to reduce our Scope 3 emissions intensity. Some examples of the steps we have taken, or are taking, include:\n\n- Launched the Airbnb Supplier Sustainability Program. With this program, we\u2019re engaging suppliers to drive down their emissions. The program will ask suppliers, beginning with some of our largest, to commit to measuring and reporting their GHG emissions and implementing or maintaining emissions reduction plans. This will help us address the largest source of our Scope 3 corporate emissions.\n\n- Consolidating our cloud computing footprint towards cloud service providers with stronger environmental performance.\n\n- Launched our new Live and Work Anywhere approach, which we expect to help drive emissions reductions as employees who choose to continue working from home can eliminate their commutes. We also introduced a revamped approach to employee travel, including a new travel policy and travel limits, and we continue exploring ways to further reduce emissions associated with employee business travel.\n\n- Expanded our renewable energy procurement beyond our offices to include estimated work-from-home electricity usage for our global employee base, as many employees now work from home. We are addressing these emissions even though renewable energy purchased for these initiatives is not able to be reflected as Scope 3 emissions reductions under GHG Protocol guidance. In addition, we\u2019re offering renewable energy options to employees in some countries to help them to further reduce their at-home emissions.\nInvesting in natural ecosystems and protecting biodiversity\n\nIn addition to reducing corporate emissions, we also recognize there is an urgent need to protect the natural world and preserve biodiversity. That\u2019s why we are also investing in high quality, nature-based solutions that can help protect ecosystems, wildlife, and indigenous ways of life, while also offsetting our residual emissions. Our work includes:\n\n- Helping to fund the protection of tropical forests around the world through our participation in the Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest finance (LEAF) Coalition. LEAF is an ambitious new public-private initiative that has mobilized $1 billion in corporate and government commitments to fight tropical deforestation.\n\n- We are beginning to purchase third-party reviewed and certified carbon credits to promote nature-based solutions, and plan to increase this investment over time to address the residual emissions that we are unable to reduce.\n  \n  \u25cb We are committed to supporting credible, high-quality projects that are (1) accredited through independent third-party organizations, such as the American Carbon Registry, VERRA, or the Climate Action Registry, and (2) have verified social and environmental benefits, like local employment opportunities and biodiversity protection.\n\n  \u25cb For example, in 2021 we supported a reforestation project in South Asia providing new sources of income for small farmers, a tropical rainforest project in Latin America providing local employment and education opportunities, and a temperate rainforest project in the US Pacific Northwest protecting local biodiversity in cooperation with the Alaska Native Village Corporation.\n\nFocusing beyond our corporate footprint\n\nAirbnb is also working with our global community of Hosts and guests to help reduce emissions for stays and Experiences on our platform. These efforts build on prior work, including piloting ways to help our Hosts switch to renewables through partnerships with organizations including Arcadia in the US and Ovo in UK, helping improve the energy efficiency of Hosts\u2019 homes, creating educational resources to help them host more sustainably, and providing localized tips for being a responsible and sustainable traveler in countries like Mexico and Costa Rica. We look forward to sharing more details in the future.\n\nWhile we have taken significant steps in the first year of our net zero commitment, we must continue taking meaningful actions to help address the climate crisis - and we will do so in collaboration with our employees, our partners, and our community.\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis release contains \u201cforward-looking\u201d statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding Airbnb\u2019s climate-related plans, Net Zero emissions commitments, energy efficiency strategies, and sustainability targets, goals, commitments, and programs.
