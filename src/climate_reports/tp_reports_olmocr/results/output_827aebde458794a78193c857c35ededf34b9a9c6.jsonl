We are in the business of making and keeping long-term promises, and our commitment to protecting families, businesses and communities underpins our purpose: Always with you, building a more confident future.\n\nOur reason for being, who we are, and what we stand for are represented by this purpose, guiding us during times of uncertainty and allowing us to make a greater difference through our sustainability efforts.\n\nOUR SUSTAINABILITY COMMITMENTS\n\nA confident future requires a resilient and thriving environment and a more inclusive and equitable society\u2014and we are determined to be part of the solution.\n\nOur 2030 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Commitments consider how our investments, products and services, supply chain, and volunteer and community efforts address the needs of underserved and underrepresented communities. We are also committed to building on our long-standing history of environmental stewardship for current and future generations.\n\nOur path forward, which we track and report on, is ambitious, and we remain confident in delivering on our long-term sustainability mission through the commitment of our people, and the strength of our products, services, and investments.\n\nOUR PROGRESS\n\nWe bring our purpose to life by creating a virtuous circle of shared value for all our stakeholders\u2014showing that when we deliver for them, we not only benefit our business, but also the world around us. We are constantly adapting to meet the needs and expectations of our stakeholders, and we are strengthening our DEI and environmental commitments to address critical challenges that they face.\n\nFor our colleagues\n\nOur employee value proposition (EVP), \u201cAll Together Possible,\u201d inspires our people to foster a purpose-driven, inclusive culture. We are committed to bringing different perspectives together through DEI, launching programs and initiatives to create a culture of care and inclusion. This work has led us to maintain above-median results on global officer gender diversity and top-quartile results on ethnic and racial diversity for officers in the U.S.\nFor our customers\n\nWe strive to build enduring relationships with our customers to meet their evolving needs and to secure their financial futures through the products and services we offer. Sustainability considerations are integral to our business and lead MetLife to create holistic solutions for our customers\u2019 diverse needs and well-being. One example is 360Health, which helps customers address their mental, physical, financial, and social health. We continued to expand the offering throughout Asia in 2022, with free virtual doctor consultations among the most popular value-added service. The success of 360Health has earned it numerous international awards.\n\nFor our shareholders\n\nBy energizing our people to make progress against our Next Horizon strategy, we deliver more for our customers, and drive long-term value for our shareholders. We have a duty to manage risk effectively and seek out responsible investments that are diverse, stable, secure, and offer competitive, risk-adjusted returns. By year-end 2022, responsible investments managed by MetLife Investment Management totaled over $77 billion, contributing to our strong free cash flow, total shareholder return (TSR) and return on equity (ROE).\n\nFor our communities\n\nAs MetLife\u2019s strength, scale and resilience grow, so too does our role in communities. MetLife Foundation provides support through its Economic Inclusion, Financial Health and Resilient Communities portfolios, and awarded $37.9 million in grants during the past year. And our colleagues offered their time, talent and passion for their communities, dedicating nearly 110,000 hours volunteering where they live and work.\n\nIt\u2019s this progress that shows how MetLife is a force for good in the world. Even during the most challenging times, our virtuous circle remains strong. The COVID-19 pandemic was no exception and, as it persisted in 2022, claims totaled approximately $800 million.\n\nLOOKING TO THE FUTURE\n\nExpectations across our stakeholder groups are rising\u2014and we are raising the bar to meet and even exceed these expectations. We are in a position of strength, and the actions detailed in this year\u2019s report are the foundation we\u2019ll build upon to continue driving meaningful change.\n\nYou will read more about our progress against our commitments, our ongoing efforts to foster a more inclusive and diverse workplace, the innovations we continue to make to our products and services to give customers confidence, and how our work is creating value for our shareholders.\n\nLiving our purpose is how we will fulfill our sustainability commitments, and keep the promises we make to our stakeholders, something that we have always done since selling our first insurance policy in 1868.\n\nMICHEL A.

This ambition is part of our overall business strategy to create long-term value for colleagues, customers, shareholders and the communities where we operate. For MetLife, this means working toward an inclusive, resilient and thriving environment for present and future generations.\n\nAs a purpose-driven company, we continue to adapt to meet the needs of a rapidly changing world. MetLife\u2019s Net Zero commitment builds on our longstanding history of environmental stewardship. This includes addressing climate change and supporting a just transition to a low-carbon economy, which requires collective action from diverse stakeholders. Our commitment is supported by a comprehensive approach, interim targets and key initiatives intended to help improve the environment.\n\nOur Net Zero Approach\n\nMetLife\u2019s approach to Net Zero is guided by four pillars focused on where we are best positioned to support a long-term transition while creating value for our stakeholders:\n\n1.

To support our Net Zero commitment for MetLife\u2019s General Account, we are focused on developing financed emissions disclosures where reliable data and methodologies are available and enhancing its accuracy and completeness over time.\n\nCREATING POSITIVE CLIMATE IMPACT IN AN EVOLVING LANDSCAPE\n\nBeyond our Net Zero commitment and interim emissions reduction targets, our sustainability strategy centers on five of the 17 UN SDGs that are most relevant to our business, including climate action. In addition, we leverage the strength of our people, products, services and investments to make progress in areas such as human health, water stewardship and biodiversity.\n\nWE ARE WORKING TOWARD:\n\nMaintaining carbon neutrality annually for our global offices, vehicle fleets and employee business travel by supporting high-quality carbon offset projects that align with UN SDGs to the extent possible and supporting renewable electricity technologies by purchasing renewable energy credits (RECs).\u2076\n\nPrioritizing green and healthy buildings in our global office portfolio (aiming for at least 40% of our square footage), including healthy and sustainable amenities for our colleagues.\u2077\n\nEngaging colleagues, customers and our other diverse stakeholders on environmental stewardship.\n\nOriginating $25 billion of new General Account green investments and $500 million of impact investments (with 25% allocated to climate change priorities).\u2077\n\nContributing $5 million to drive climate-related partnerships and solutions.\u2077\n\nMetLife Foundation granting $10 million to environmental causes.\u2078\n\nPlanting 5 million trees, prioritizing areas vulnerable to natural disasters, to help improve the health of local ecosystems and communities and preserve biodiversity.\u2077\n\n---\n\n\u00b2 MetLife\u2019s carbon neutrality efforts apply to global owned and leased offices, global vehicle fleets (Scope 1 and 2 emissions) and employee business travel (Scope 3 Category 6).\n\u00b3 MetLife initiative to take place between 2020 and 2030.\n\u2074 MetLife initiative to take place between 2020 and 2030.\n\u2075 MetLife Foundation initiative to take place between 2020 and 2030.\nFor Our Colleagues\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nOUR APPROACH\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nA CULTURE OF TRUST AND INCLUSION\n\nGLOBAL DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION\n\nTALENT AND SKILL DEVELOPMENT\n\nHOLISTIC WELL-BEING\n\nCOMPENSATION\n\nATTRACTING AND RETAINING TALENT\n\nMetLife colleagues enjoy collaborative outdoor spaces at our Cary, North Carolina, campus.\nHighlights\n\nAchieved top-quartile results on ethnically and racially diverse officers (in the U.S.) and increased female representation to 53% of MetLife\u2019s global workforce.\n\nEnhanced \u201cAll Together Possible,\u201d our Employee Value Proposition (EVP) that positions MetLife as an employer of choice.\n\nCertified Great Place to Work\u00ae in 8 markets across the world.\n\nExpanded our internal career mobility platform, MyPath, globally and increased users by 192%, fueling development and unlocking capacity.\n\nLaunched Growing@MetLife campaign to support colleagues\u2019 growth and development.\n\nAchieved highest response rate to date on our annual employee survey, MyVoice.\n\n---\n\n1.

Our commitment begins with maintaining a great workplace and continues through nurturing a trusting, inclusive culture and providing support for a fulfilling, thriving career.\n\nOur Employee Value Proposition (EVP), \u201cAll Together Possible,\u201d outlines how we deliver on our commitment. When our unique backgrounds, skills, perspectives and voices come together, even more is possible. DEI underpins everything we do. See Global Diversity, Equity and Inclusion for more information on MetLife\u2019s DEI strategy. It inspires mutual respect and trust, and we believe the only culture that can deliver on our purpose is one in which trust prevails.\n\nThe sum of our employee offerings is fundamental to our EVP.

They include: Inclusive Environment; Holistic Well-Being; Purpose and Impact; Learning and Development; and Compensation and Benefits.\n\nGovernance\n\nMetLife\u2019s Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) reports directly to the CEO.

This oversight helps maintain accountability and transparency in DEI performance. MetLife\u2019s DEI efforts are led by the Global Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer, who reports directly to the CEO and the CHRO, a reporting structure that underscores the importance of DEI. To promote enterprise-wide collaboration on our DEI commitments and initiatives, we\u2019ve formalized those practices deemed necessary to achieve an equitable, inclusive work environment by establishing guidelines. These include:\n\n- Diversity and Inclusion in MetLife\u2019s Recruitment Processes;\n- MetLife Pay Equity Statement; and\n- MetLife Equal Employment Opportunity and Anti-Harassment Policy.\n\nGLOBAL DEI LEADERSHIP COUNCIL\n\nChaired by MetLife\u2019s CEO Michel Khalaf, our Global DEI Leadership Council is an 18-member senior leadership body focused on achieving our long-term aspiration to be a leading company for DEI with top-quartile performance. The Council drives DEI strategy and execution across businesses, functions and regions, and provides strategic guidance and insight to improve performance, as well as visibly promote and champion DEI internally and externally. Members are selected based on their purpose-driven leadership and commitment to achieving results. Topics the Council has recently addressed include:\n\n- Advocating for colleague professional development and a positive work experience;\n- Ensuring accountability of DEI through quarterly review of progress;\n- External advocacy, including board memberships and increased commitment with nonprofit partners (e.g., Girls Who Code and INROADS);\n- Establishing and strengthening business and functional inclusion councils; and\n- MIM\u2019s DEI initiatives and investments to support diverse partnerships and sponsors.\n\nPlease see Global Diversity, Equity and Inclusion to learn more.\n\nMETLIFE: A CERTIFIED GREAT PLACE TO WORK\u00ae\n\nWe\u2019ve been certified by Great Place to Work\u00ae in Brazil, Chile, China, Cyprus, India (MetLife\u2019s Global Operations Service Center), Mexico, Uruguay and the U.S. The certification process considers a company\u2019s culture, innovation, DEI initiatives and trust between employees and the company, asking and surveying employees about their experiences.\n\n1. MetLife owns two businesses in Chile\u2014ProVida and MetLife Seguros. Our Great Places to Work certification applies only to MetLife Seguros in Chile.\nA Culture of Trust and Inclusion\n\nIn the face of a competitive talent landscape, our culture is a key differentiator. We nurture our culture through initiatives that promote connection, involvement and dialogue.\n\n**INCLUSION NETWORKS: A CONNECTED AND INVOLVED COLLECTIVE**\n\nTo drive greater connectivity, sense of community, and employee engagement, we created MOMENTUM. This global initiative aligns and expands our inclusion networks and focuses on causes most important to our people, such as: wellness, the environment, volunteering, social justice, diversity, women\u2019s advancement, veteran\u2019s transition to corporate life and more.\n\nMetLife\u2019s 10 inclusion networks are pivotal in connecting colleagues and helping grow our sense of inclusiveness and community across the company. Colleagues can join or be an ally to one or multiple networks\u2014including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and other (LGBTQ+) professionals; people with disabilities; veterans; multicultural professionals; rising professionals; professional women; Black professionals; and Asian professionals. The latest network, LatConexi\u00f3n + Latino Executive Leadership Forum, responds to interest from our colleagues for a forum in which Latino colleagues can connect and enhance inclusiveness for that community.\n\n**LISTENING TO COLLEAGUES: ANNUAL EMPLOYEE SURVEY\u2014MYVOICE**\n\nListening to colleagues and gaining their perspective on how we are working together and what we can do differently helps us deliver on our purpose, accelerate an inclusive culture and improve our core operations.\n\nOur 2022 MyVoice survey reveals a colleague base engaged in the collaborative process of continuous improvement. Not only did we receive our highest response rate since the survey launched in 2018, but the proportion of participants providing written comments\u2014valuable insights and feedback to help us grow\u2014also rose from 2021, and we achieved our highest favorability rating to date. We believe these results demonstrate colleagues\u2019 trust in the effectiveness of the feedback system.\n\nEach year, we have engaged teams around the company to implement solutions based on the annual results, and the solutions we\u2019ve implemented are appreciated: Our score on whether colleagues believe \u201cmeaningful action will be taken as a result of the survey\u201d was 12 points over benchmark.\n\nAchieved a very good result of 76% favorability to \u2018feeling a sense of belonging at MetLife\u2019 in the 2022 MyVoice survey.\n2022 MyVoice Employee Survey by the Numbers\n\n- **85%** response rate, the highest response rate to date\n- **~88K** comments, which are all read and discussed with the CEO and CHRO\n- **79%** answered favorably for engagement, the highest rating to date\n- **79%** answered favorably to: \u201cPeople at MetLife make decisions with their impact on the customer in mind\u201d\n- **78%** answered favorably to: \u201cHow happy are you working at MetLife?\u201d\n- **80%** answered favorably to: \u201cMetLife is committed to sustainability\u201d\n\n---\n\n1. \u201cEngagement\u201d is blend of 2 questions: \u201cI would recommend MetLife as a great place to work\u201d (80% Favorability) and \u201cHow happy are you working at MetLife?\u201d (78% Favorability); a result of 75% or higher on the MyVoice survey is considered very good and a result of 66-74% is considered good; answered \u201cFavorably\u201d represents the percentage (%) of respondents who replied with a 4 or 5 on a five-point Likert scale.\nFOSTERING FLEXIBILITY AND EXPERIMENTATION IN THE WORKPLACE\n\nFlexibility is central to the modern workplace and continues to evolve at MetLife. As one example, MetLife\u2019s ways of working provide more flexibility post-COVID-19 to help colleagues with their work-life integration. Colleagues provide feedback on our work practices through our surveys, Let\u2019s Talk Live! Forums (monthly, CEO-led global town halls) and listening sessions with leaders.\n\nWe believe that when colleagues are empowered to bring their whole selves to work, innovation flourishes. To create space for sharing and testing colleagues\u2019 ideas, we introduced a global Experimentation Fund, designed to provide fast approval and funding for low-cost, quick experiments\u2014and to give every colleague around the world the opportunity to submit ideas. We have so far experimented with 101 ideas from 365 submissions across the world.\n\nMetLife\u2019s Annual Employee Recognition Programs\n\n| CENTER STAGE | ABOVE AND BEYOND AWARD | PURPOSE AWARD |\n|--------------|-------------------------|---------------|\n| Provides a platform for sharing continuous recognition, such as anniversaries, milestones and successes. | Recognizes colleagues for their collaboration, experimentation and customer-focused achievements. | Recognizes colleagues who went to extraordinary efforts to bring MetLife\u2019s purpose to life. |\n\n2,385 Above and Beyond Awards\n214 Purpose Awards\nGlobal Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nDEI is a global business, sustainability and workforce imperative.

We measure ourselves against industry benchmarks and are committed to maintaining top-quartile performance across ethnic and racial diversity\u00b9 in the U.S. and achieving top-quartile performance in our female officer\u00b2 population globally. Our workforce data and Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)-1 reporting provide more detail on our top-quartile progress.\n\nMetLife\u2019s comprehensive public-facing DEI commitments are designed to address the needs of underserved and underrepresented communities through a mix of investments, products and services, supply chain, volunteering and community efforts, with financial components of these commitments totaling more than $2.5 billion by 2030. Read more about the progress we\u2019ve made against our commitments since they were launched in 2022: 2030 DEI Commitments.\n\n\u00b9 Diverse categories include Black/African American; Latino/Hispanic; Asian.\n\u00b2 The officer population is a subset of overall management that is a reflection of the leadership of the organization. It is comprised of all MetLife employees at the Vice President level or above.\n\nHuman Resources (HR) colleagues host an event to build family care kits for Triangle Family Services.\nCLOSING THE GENDER EQUITY GAP\n\nMetLife\u2019s culture of equity and inclusion extends to every aspect of our business, including our compensation practices. We regularly review colleagues\u2019 pay and our pay practices to incent the right behaviors and provide equal pay for equal work. As outlined in MetLife\u2019s Pay Equity Statement, we review our pay practices for any potential disparities that are not explainable by objective factors such as performance, experience level, credentials or location, and are committed to correcting any issues and reviewing practices for unintended outcomes.\n\nIn addition to strengthening our talent and development efforts with a view to ethnic and racial diversity, we also continue to focus on gender equity. MetLife\u2019s Gender Equity Initiative provides inclusive leadership development and offers women a variety of career support programs, including peer-mentoring groups and workplace policies and benefits that support flexibility and work-life integration. MetLife sponsors and participates in the Global Summit of Women and is committed to the UN Women\u2019s Empowerment Principles and the UNGC\u2019s gender equality accelerator program, \u201cTarget Gender Equality.\u201d\n\nThrough a range of unique networking events, thought leadership and training, MetLife helps give women tools to grow and be successful in our industry and in business more generally. We hosted a fourth annual Triangle Tech X Conference, bringing together influential newsmakers, inspirational thinkers and leaders to examine barriers and discuss solutions around the topic of increasing the number of women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).\n\nThe free virtual summit is open to the public, and MetLife colleagues are invited and encouraged to extend an invitation to their networks. The conference saw a 40% increase in participation compared to last year, with attendees from over 25 countries.\n\nOur annual Women in Sales summits center on personal and professional development, building communities and connections, and supporting the development of women in sales careers. Our virtual summits have connected over 500 saleswomen across 25 countries and have been translated into 10 different languages.\n\nFor the eighth consecutive year, Bloomberg named MetLife to its 2023 Gender Equality Index, in recognition of our efforts to support gender parity through employee policies, representation and transparency.\nGlobal Workforce Diversity\n\n**GLOBAL FEMALE MANAGEMENT**\n\n| Year | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|------|------|------|------|\n|      | 42.3%| 41.2%| 41.0%|\n\n**GLOBAL FEMALE NONMANAGEMENT**\n\n| Year | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|------|------|------|------|\n|      | 54.3%| 54.2%| 53.6%|\n\n**U.S. ETHNICALLY AND RACIALLY DIVERSE MANAGEMENT**\n\n| Year | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|------|------|------|------|\n|      | 26.6%| 25.2%| 25.5%|\n\n**U.S. ETHNICALLY AND RACIALLY DIVERSE NONMANAGEMENT**\n\n| Year | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|------|------|------|------|\n|      | 36.4%| 35.0%| 33.8%|\n\n**2022 GENDER DIVERSITY FOR OFFICERS (VP+)**\n\n**GLOBAL**\n\n- **METLIFE:** 29.4%\n- \u2191 2.0% since 2020\n- MetLife is above-median against industry benchmarks.\n\n**U.S.**\n\n- **METLIFE:** 26.1%\n- \u2191 1.3% since 2020\n- MetLife is in the top quartile against industry benchmarks.\n\n---\n\n1.

For this reason, we host an external roundtable of experts in racial equity-related business disciplines, academia and philanthropy, designed to help MetLife continue advancing racial equity and inclusion. Named ADVANCE, the roundtable has helped us understand MetLife\u2019s role in closing the racial wealth gap, how Upwise\u2122 can support the financial wellness of underserved groups and the impact of our 2030 DEI commitments.\nHELPING COLLEAGUES TAKE ADVANTAGE OF DEVELOPMENT TOOLS\n\nThrough our annual employee survey, MetLife colleagues delivered a clear message that they wanted more opportunities to develop their skills and grow their careers at MetLife. In response, we launched Growing@MetLife, an enterprise-wide campaign of engaging communications and interactive events that showcased the many tools and resources available to support colleagues\u2019 growth and development. We also experimented with giving colleagues one-on-one career conversations with a member of MetLife\u2019s Executive Leadership Team to drive further engagement in the program.\n\nThe campaign garnered excellent participation from colleagues looking to propel their careers, including:\n\n- 1,000+ colleagues added at least one focus skill to their online learning and development profile, which helps the platform curate more personalized learning opportunities;\n- An additional 1,500+ colleagues completed their profile on our internal talent marketplace, MyPath (see page 25), which helps them receive higher-quality, more relevant project, networking and position matches;\n- 450 colleagues attended the Agile Delivery Model career workshops to learn more about the unique development opportunities Agile roles provide; and\n- Managers from across the enterprise attended a new, interactive career development workshop that provided practical guidance on how to better support career development within their teams.\n\nWe will now host the campaign annually, as we seek to respond to colleagues\u2019 feedback and to empower them to advance their careers at MetLife.\n\nTalent and Skill Development\n\nWe aim to create a culture of continuous learning and development to give every colleague the tools, resources and opportunities they need for growth. We create personalized learning experiences by leveraging a combination of virtual, hybrid and in-person learning and development opportunities, where colleagues can network, collaborate and learn from each other.\n\nENABLING PURPOSEFUL AND PERSONALIZED LEARNING\n\nMetLife\u2019s MyLearning platform provides access to a variety of learning opportunities, along with experiences that allow colleagues to both tailor their learning to achieve their personal career goals and to support the needs of the business. Its key appeal is the thousands of other types of content, including articles, books, videos and webinars, that colleagues can access to tailor their learning to suit their personal career objectives.\n\n67% of colleagues accessed MyLearning, MetLife\u2019s online learning platform\n\n485,346 learning materials were completed\n\n8,304 learners shared materials with peers\n\nMANDATORY TRAINING\n\nWe prioritize learning and provide access to training and educational resources to every colleague. Mandatory training helps colleagues stay up to date with the latest on our regulatory requirements and how they can protect each other, the company and our customers, as well as drive key MetLife priorities.\n\nMetLife took several steps to improve learning efficiency and become more strategic about time spent by colleagues on mandatory training, while still offering the elemental training necessary for colleagues. Please see Responsible Governance for mandatory training data.\nHUMAN-CENTERED, FUTURE-READY LEADERS\n\nMetLife is committed to ensuring that all colleagues have a consistent and high-quality experience with their managers. Our program to develop leaders, Leading the Future, features a variety of learning experiences, including speaker series, on-demand training, peer-to-peer learning networks and live workshops. It supports over 5,500 leaders each year through a variety of learning experiences.\n\nEMPOWERING INTERNAL MOBILITY\n\nNow in its second year, MetLife\u2019s internal mobility platform\u2014MyPath\u2014facilitates internal mobility, enabling colleagues to apply for projects and opportunities based on their skills, experiences and ambitions. It also helps managers source MetLife talent quickly, based on the skills needed to get critical work done, unlocking efficiency in the recruitment process.\n\nWe have expanded MyPath to be available to colleagues globally, adding 39 countries to the platform and vastly increasing its use and the successful placement of colleagues in internal roles.\n\nWorking Toward a More Diverse Group of Future Leaders\n\nWe strive for a group of diverse leaders who evoke inspiration, fuel engagement and spark innovation among their colleagues, and who embody the culture of trust and inclusion which is critical to serving MetLife\u2019s purpose.\n\nEXCELERATE, MetLife\u2019s CEO-driven talent sponsorship program, focuses on nurturing the diversity of our future leadership cohort by accelerating the progression of underrepresented groups as leaders.\n\nThe program has now reached participants across 27 countries and increases visibility, access and engagement with MetLife\u2019s Executive Leadership Team. We continue to see growth among participants, with 34% receiving new or expanded responsibilities or having been promoted in 2022, compared with 22% in 2021.\nENHANCING TEAM INCLUSIVENESS\n\nTeams are powered by diverse perspectives. MetLife\u2019s INDEAVOR Team Experience is an interactive learning opportunity in which participants receive expert coaching and tools to accelerate more inclusive and high-performing interactions. Following a successful first year in 2021, participants reported feeling more comfortable being themselves, asking for help and collaborating with their colleagues. The 2022 cohort comprised 150 people.\n\nINDEAVOR PARTICIPANT OUTCOMES\n\n\u201cI feel comfortable being myself on this team\u201d\n89%\n\n\u201cThis team collaborates well\u201d\n85%\n\n\u201cI feel comfortable asking for help on this team\u201d\n85%\n\nMetLife has joined a consortium of 100+ other corporations launched by Ascend, the largest nonprofit pan-Asian organization for business professionals in North America, to combat all forms of discrimination.\nMETLIFE PROVIDES BENEFITS FOR MANY TYPES OF FAMILIES\n\nThe Families at MetLife inclusion network connects and supports colleagues who are navigating family and career by keeping members apprised of available MetLife resources, organizing learning events and activities, and serving as a voice for caregivers. Please see page 16 to learn more about our inclusion networks. Among a host of others, MetLife\u2019s current family benefits include:\n\n- **Family First** Provides caregivers access to a team of experts who can assist in finding personalized caregiving solutions, as well as addressing mental/behavioral health challenges, special needs and disabilities, substance abuse, chronic conditions, navigating Medicare and more;\n\n- **Milk Stork** Breastfeeding colleagues in the U.S. can take advantage of Milk Stork, a service that makes it easy and convenient for them to ship breast milk home during business travel;\n\n- **Pathways Scholarship Program** MetLife Foundation encourages and supports post-high school education for the children of MetLife colleagues around the world. Since 1990, we have provided 2,145 scholarships worth over $10.6 million.

Competitive paid time off and parental leave programs are provided in all markets. In the U.S., we have increased the minimum protection provided by our company-paid life and retirement plan from $75,000 to $100,000, giving colleagues and their families a more confident foundation.\n\nOver many years, we have focused on enhanced mental health support, addressing access to care through coverage of out-of-network office visits at higher reimbursement levels in the U.S. and adding virtual mental health care options. In Chile, for example, an online service provides colleagues 24/7 access to telemedicine, psychological assistance and more. We have an Employee Assistance Program with access to mental health counseling in 21 countries, and in 2022 we added dedicated mental health specialists for our U.S. call center and claims operations colleagues to reduce barriers to care.\n\nCompensation\n\nMetLife\u2019s compensation is one component of the total value MetLife delivers to colleagues in addition to benefits, services and experiences. Total compensation is assessed annually and may include three primary components: base salary and annual and long-term incentives. We have a pay-for-performance philosophy, which means there is a direct link between a colleague\u2019s compensation, their performance and MetLife\u2019s performance. We provide market-aligned compensation opportunities to attract, motivate, engage and retain talent. Our compensation practices are essential to fostering a diverse and inclusive culture where we value the contributions of all our colleagues. We are committed to continuing to review our practices to ensure fairness and equity.\nAttracting and Retaining Talent\n\nMetLife continuously strives to be an employer of choice, to attract strong, diverse and passionate candidates and retain them over the long term. Since the activation of our EVP, #AllTogetherPossible, in early 2022, there has been a 42% year-over-year increase in U.S. applicant flow.\n\nWe have guidelines around diverse hiring best practices for hiring managers in each round of the recruitment and hiring process. Part of our hiring guidelines include having managers interview qualified diverse candidates. We promote diversity among interviewers for each position, and we train internal and external recruiters and managers to be aware of potential biases in the hiring, review and career development process.\n\nIn addition, we have expanded our partnerships with Girls Who Code and the National African American Insurance Association to help improve the skills of young diverse students, while also creating new relationships with Hiring Our Heroes, Blacks In Technology and Women in Technology International. These partnerships enable career development and training for existing colleagues by giving them more tools, resources and new social networks that expand professional relationships. Ultimately this leads to MetLife\u2019s ability to attract and retain talent.\n\nInnovating Recruitment with Malaysia Hackathon\n\nIn Malaysia, our Asia Technology team\u2019s global virtual hackathon introduced us to the best and brightest technology talent. The weekend coding challenge garnered 200 registrants and 100 participants. We interviewed over 40 candidates for open roles, including software developers, infrastructure engineers, solutions architects and scrum masters and offered over 70% of interviewees a position at MetLife.\nFor Our Customers\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nOUR APPROACH\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nEMPOWERING UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES\n\nSUPPORTING OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 WELLNESS\n\nPROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT THROUGH OUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND OFFERINGS\n\nSHARING INSIGHTS THAT ADDRESS EMPLOYEE WELL-BEING\n\nDELIVERING FOR OUR CUSTOMERS\u2014CUSTOMER SERVICE\n\nAround the world, MetLife works to give customers the confidence to tackle life\u2019s challenges.\nHighlights\n\n~$800M in total COVID-19 claims in 2022\n\nSupported financial health by highlighting federal loan forgiveness programs on Upwise\u2122, MetLife\u2019s free financial health app\n\nExpanded 360Health solutions and services for customers in Asia, including cardio solution in Korea and diabetes risk management in Bangladesh\n\nPublished 21st Annual Employee Benefit Trends Study, providing key insights on industry trends\n\nLaunched primary research for Group Benefits DEI value proposition with employers and brokers\nOur Approach\n\nHigh inflation, financial security and economic well-being have been in focus throughout the past year.

We presented Upwise\u2122 on a broad scale in 2022. In addition, for public service employees using Upwise\u2122, we worked with a company called Savi to provide a digital experience to assist with student loan programs. With Savi and Upwise\u2122, borrowers who work for qualified nonprofit or public service organizations are provided access to tools to evaluate their eligibility and apply for Public Service Loan Forgiveness programs.\n\n>250 enterprise customers have engaged with Upwise\u2122\n\n1.2M customer employees reached\n\nWe have published over 270 articles, including more than 60 related to DEI and seven related to climate change on Upwise\u2122.

PlanSmart\u00ae includes financial tools and financial education workshops offered by MetLife and provided by specially trained third-party financial professionals and administered via webinar or in person.\u00b2\n\nCustomers can schedule the webinars, which target early and mid-career employees and include topics such as the basics of investing, saving for retirement and tax strategies, at their convenience. Many webinars are tailored toward diverse audiences, and we encourage companies to host relevant sessions during DEI celebratory periods, such as \u201cWomen and Investing\u201d during Women\u2019s History Month, \u201cClosing the Gap: Building Wealth in the Black Community\u201d for Black History Month and \u201cPlanning with Pride: Financial Tips for the LGBTQ+ Community\u201d through Pride month.\n\nMexico Private Sector Alliance\n\nNow in its second year, the Mexico Private Sector Alliance to Promote Financial Inclusion is a program co-founded by MetLife Mexico and the UN Development Programme to develop collaborative business models to expand financial health and inclusion for underserved customer segments.\n\nThe alliance has recently focused on ways to boost digitization, partner with small- and medium-sized enterprises, and make financial services more accessible to women and to rural populations, both groups with traditionally less access to financial services. In the next year, it aims to implement at least two pilots to help establish business partnerships among participating companies.\n\nHelping low-income customers manage finances with confidence\n\nMany of our products cater to low- and moderate-income families, helping protect them against death, sickness or disability.\n\nIn Nepal, MetLife began offering Rural Term Insurance plans to customers of local microfinance institutions and financial cooperatives. The plans are a combination of life and accident coverage with limited underwriting. MetLife Bangladesh introduced insurance kiosks across the country to engage customers and explain products and services.\n\nMaking financial planning more accessible\n\nWith one of the world\u2019s fastest-aging populations and a significant unmet demand for elderly care services, people in China are increasingly worried about life after retirement.

We seek to understand the diversity of employees of our enterprise customers, using data to connect products and benefits usage, and offer products and plans to support inclusivity in three ways:\n\nProduct and Pricing\n\nWe have one of the broadest portfolios of products that serve diverse populations and unique employee needs.\n\nAccess\n\nWe are committed to providing product access for all through inclusive benefit solutions and services, including our geographically wide provider networks and benefit price points.\n\nCustomer Experience\n\nWe provide employee care and support to drive a more inclusive experience (language support, digital servicing and accessibility, customized communications).\n\nWe have equipped our sales teams with information about our product capabilities that can help customers navigate the complexities of DEI in the benefits marketplace. For example, to raise awareness about services for LGBTQ+ families in our Legal Plan product, we have spotlighted product features such as domestic partner and same-sex spouse coverage, legal assistance for partner designation and estate planning to recognize same-sex partners.\n\nWe recently completed qualitative research with benefits representatives from 26 employers and nine brokers to obtain feedback on how DEI-specific features of our products are resonating with employers and their employees. Study participants believed the value proposition resonates well, feels relevant to various DEI populations and could be instrumental in enabling employers to achieve their DEI goals. We plan to conduct research among customer employees to augment the findings with insights from diverse employee populations.\nEnhancing offerings for women\n\nMetLife Mexico is developing a web platform that showcases our products with gender-related features. This platform called \u201cTe quiero segura\u201d is being developed with the support of the Financial Consumer Protection Agency (CONDUSEF) and the Women\u2019s Institute (INMUJERES) and is expected to be launched in first-quarter 2023.\n\nMetLife Brazil offers discounted group life insurance to companies with an employee base of at least 40% women and where women have an average salary greater than or equal to 90% of the average salary of men.\n\nConnecting customers with diverse service providers\n\nMetLife Legal Plans provide individuals with information and tools so they have the option to connect with attorneys who share their language, race and background. This helps reduce the psychological barriers to accessing legal support and enables relationships of greater trust between individuals and providers to drive better outcomes, so that our customers can navigate both exciting moments, like buying a home, or challenges, like getting a speeding ticket, with confidence and sound counsel.\n\nMetLife Legal Plans has also introduced comprehensive and personalized caregiving solutions to help employee caregivers be better equipped to tackle burnout. Through a partnership with Family First, MetLife Legal Plans gives plan enrollees and their families ongoing access to expert care teams comprising professionally accredited nurses, Harvard-trained physicians, social workers and mental health professionals, backed by industry-leading artificial intelligence and an expert-authored and curated content library.\nSupporting Our Customers\u2019 Wellness\n\nBuilding a more confident future for customers also means helping reduce stress during difficult times, particularly when the health and wellness of family is at stake. We strive to improve and evolve our products and services based on local market and customer needs.\n\nWith over 750,000 app downloads across four markets in the Asia region, MetLife 360Health provides a unique perspective on helping customers with solutions that address their mental, physical, financial and social health through a comprehensive focus on the five key aspects of managing critical illnesses to improve customers\u2019 health span:\n\n- Prevention\n- Early diagnosis\n- Access to treatment\n- Ongoing care\n- Financial protection\n\nIn Bangladesh alone, more than 450,000 customers have downloaded the 360Health app. Downloads in Korea have reached 299,000, a 63% increase over 2021. The app now allows users to assess their stress levels through facial recognition technology.

The new offering will provide access to exercise physiologists who can develop personalized programs.\n\nIn our Dental and Vision care plans in the U.S., we have improved benefits to encourage preventive care and make it more affordable for low-income populations. The plan rewards employees for positive oral health behavior\u2014such as routine cleanings and exams\u2014by increasing a member\u2019s annual maximum and/or coinsurance percentages, and/or by reducing plan deductibles.\n\nENHANCEMENTS TO PET INSURANCE\n\nPets are an important part of our families and can contribute to individuals\u2019 mental and physical well-being. However, according to MetLife and OnePoll research, pet parents spend more than $4,500 annually on pet care. To help pet owners manage the costs of their pet\u2019s health, MetLife Pet Insurance introduced a new rewards program with LifeBalance, a discount network for employees and health plan members, to provide pet parents access to discounts and offers on pet care essentials.\n\n1. Health span refers to the number of healthy years in an individual\u2019s overall lifespan and the potential to live healthier for longer.\n2. MetLife x OnePoll survey, September 2021.\nProtecting the Environment Through Our Products, Services and Offerings\n\nMetLife\u2019s products and services are an important component of our environmental stewardship. We are connecting climate efforts to our products by tying tree-planting initiatives around the world to customer engagement and sales. MetLife France, for example, planted a tree for every policy sold in 2022. Please see Global Tree-Planting Initiatives to learn more.\n\nLearn more about how our products and services contribute to our environmental stewardship and climate change strategy.\n\nUNIT-LINKED INSURANCE AND SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENTS PRODUCTS\n\nUnder a unit-linked insurance plan, policyholders make regular premium payments for insurance coverage and as an investment. The plan then offers a combination of insurance and investment payouts. A unit-linked insurance plan can be used, for example, to provide life insurance, build wealth, generate retirement income and pay for education.\n\nMetLife offers unit-linked insurance products in more than 20 markets in the U.S., EMEA, Asia and LATAM. In EMEA, a new \u201cArticle 9\u201d fund under the European Union\u2019s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation\u2014or \u201ca fund that has sustainable investment as its objective or a reduction in carbon emissions as its objective\u201d\u2014was developed and will be launched in Central Europe (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Bulgaria) in 2023.\n\nColleagues in Brazil commemorated Tree Day by planting seedlings in support of MetLife\u2019s commitment to plant 5 million trees around the world by 2030, prioritizing areas vulnerable to natural disasters.\nIn India, PNB MetLife launched the **Goal Ensuring Multiplier (GEM) plan**, a unit-linked insurance plan that offers exposure to the new Sustainable Equity Fund, which seeks to generate wealth by investing in companies that are incorporating and exhibiting responsible and sustainable practices by managing a balanced approach toward all stakeholders to ensure sustainability and longevity of business.\n\n**ADDRESSING CLIMATE THROUGH PRODUCTS AND RESOURCES**\n\nMetLife also seeks to support climate resilience wherever we can when our customers are impacted by natural disasters. For example, MetLife Korea deferred premium payments for up to six months for customers who suffered financial losses from flooding in 2022. In addition, we offer free resources through **Upwise\u2122** articles to help customers prepare and financially protect themselves from climate disasters.

Further details supporting our active engagement practices can be found within MIM\u2019s Engagement Policy.\n\nMIM\u2019s public and private fixed income teams have developed proprietary engagement databases designed to be fully integrated into each of their respective research processes.

Please see Our Commitments to learn more.\n\nGovernance\n\nThe MetLife Board of Directors\u2019 Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee oversees our environmental strategy and implementation. This responsibility includes reviewing our climate goals and metrics associated with those goals. MetLife\u2019s Chief Sustainability Officer and other senior leaders report progress on commitments and programs to the Board multiple times per year. Please see Responsible Governance to learn more.\n\nRead MetLife\u2019s Environmental Policy.\n\n1. The Net Zero Commitment applies to GHG emissions from MetLife, Inc.\u2019s global owned and leased offices and vehicle fleets, employee business travel, supply chain and assets in MetLife\u2019s General Account investment portfolio, which includes the general accounts of MetLife, Inc.\u2019s wholly owned insurance company subsidiaries, where reliable data and methodologies are available. While reliable methodologies and data sets pertaining to certain GHG emissions are not available at this time, MetLife is committed to identifying and measuring relevant climate data as methodologies and standards evolve. Emissions are tracked in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, unless otherwise directed by regulators. Additional information about MetLife\u2019s General Account investment portfolio is available here.\nOffices and Operations\n\nMetLife is proud to have been the first U.S.-based insurer to reach carbon neutrality across our global corporate office portfolio, vehicle fleets and employee business travel, and we have maintained this designation for seven consecutive years.\u00b9\n\nGlobally, MetLife\u2019s offices amount to approximately 11.1 million square feet. We are committed to developing programs that improve the financial and environmental performance of building space that we own or operate. This includes a commitment to reducing our consumption of energy, water, plastics, paper and other natural resources, as well as to providing our colleagues with healthy spaces where they can thrive. We prioritize sustainable building materials and design, high levels of indoor air quality, natural light and amenities such as bike storage, healthy dining options and sit-stand desks. Please see ESG Scorecard for information and data regarding our energy, water use and waste diversion.\n\nMetLife\u2019s GHG emissions have decreased 49% since 2019, our baseline year (see ESG Scorecard). Our progress to date positions us well to achieve our 2030 goal, despite an increase in emissions in the past year as colleagues returned to the office environment following the pandemic and business travel resumed. We expect to see further emissions reductions in the coming years as we implement strategies to optimize our office real estate portfolio.\n\nWe have achieved LEED certifications for approximately 40.7 million square feet of real estate\u20143.7 million square feet attributed to the MetLife corporate office network and 37 million square feet of MIM managed real estate properties.\u00b2 In addition to LEED, MetLife prioritizes ENERGY STAR, Fitwel, Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) and other sustainable building certification programs. MetLife and MIM collectively achieved more than 50 ENERGY STAR-certified buildings in 2022, making us an Executive Member of the Environmental Protect Agency\u2019s Certification Nation.\n\nBRINGING BEEHIVES TO ADDITIONAL OFFICES\n\nAccording to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration: \u201cHoney bees are indispensable to U.S. agriculture, yet their future and the future of dependent agricultural economies are perilous.\u201d MetLife is supporting the proliferation of honey bees by introducing beehives to some of our office locations.\n\nFollowing the success of our beehives at our Cary, North Carolina, campus, we have again partnered with Bee Downtown to bring beehives to our Tampa, Florida, campus.\n\nOur bees in North Carolina produced 235 pounds of honey in 2022, flying 12.9 million miles in the process. This yield is 100% higher per hive than North Carolina\u2019s reported state average.\n\n\u00b9 MetLife\u2019s carbon neutrality efforts apply to global owned and leased offices, global vehicle fleets (Scope 1 and 2 emissions) and employee business travel (Scope 3 Category 6).\n\u00b2 2021 figures derived from the Better Buildings Challenge public website. The metric has been updated to reflect the square footage of properties included in MIM\u2019s most recent GHG inventory for assets that are managed by MIM in our clients\u2019 real estate equity portfolios.\nWe also achieved the ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year\u2014Sustained Excellence award, recognizing MetLife and MIM for consecutive years of leadership in energy management.\n\nMetLife recertified three offices in the U.S. to Fitwel, a joint initiative of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the General Services Administration, created to enhance all buildings and communities to strengthen health and well-being. The certifications cover 1.1 million square feet of real estate, including our global headquarters in New York City. MIM has also obtained Fitwel certifications for 30 properties held in its real estate equity investment portfolio as of year end 2022, a significant increase from 17 at the end of 2021.\n\nMetLife Australia has opened our new Sydney office, a six-star Green Star-rated building. The building\u2019s green features include energy efficiency, use of sustainable materials and leading waste management practices.\n\nMetLife prioritizes waste and water reduction at our campuses. In the U.S. we have eliminated plastic bottles, cutlery and other containers across our dining and catering services. In EMEA, we have eliminated approximately 1.5 million pieces of paper through a digital customer communications campaign in 10 countries as we seek to achieve our regional aspiration for zero paper communications internally and 80% digital customer communication by 2025.\n\n42% of our global offices\u2019 square footage is certified to green or healthy building standards, putting us ahead of our target to reach 40% by 2030.\n\n1. Green Star is an environmental rating tool administered by the Green Building Council of Australia.\nInvestments\n\nAs climate change continues to impact our colleagues, customers, shareholders and communities, MetLife is committed to supporting and financing solutions that help drive progress towards a low-carbon economy, manage risk and create sustainable investment returns and outcomes. In support of this commitment, MIM leverages its long history of sourcing investments in companies and projects that are focused on the conservation of natural resources, the production and discovery of alternative energy sources, the implementation of clean air and water projects and other environmentally conscious business practices. See Responsible Investments to learn more about MIM investments that promote environmental and social benefits.\n\nPROMOTING SUSTAINABLE REAL ESTATE THROUGH INVESTMENTS\n\nBoth MetLife and MIM recognize the role buildings and responsible real estate investing can play in improving workplaces and communities, increasing financial performance and reducing risk\u2014all while generating positive environmental impacts. MIM has incorporated environmental sustainability best practices across its real estate equity investment strategy offerings, including benchmarking 100% of properties that are managed in our clients\u2019 real estate equity portfolios in the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager.\n\nFor the past several years, MIM has participated in several programs that have the ultimate goal of promoting sustainable real estate. MIM established MetZero\u2122, through which MIM follows its Carbon Cascade\u2122 approach that seeks to systematically lower carbon emissions in the real estate investment strategies we offer, and the properties in our clients\u2019 investment portfolios. MetZero includes investments in energy efficiency, on-site renewables, offsite renewables, RECs when feasible and carbon offsets.\n\nMIM is also a signatory of the Department of Energy\u2019s Better Buildings Challenge and Better Climate Challenge, and the Urban Land Institute\u2019s Greenprint Net Zero Framework. Through MetZero, MIM has achieved a 9% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions for the MetLife General Account\u2019s Real Estate Equity Investments since 2019\u00b9 and a 13% reduction in portfolio energy intensity, according to the Better Buildings Challenge.\u00b2\n\n\u00b9. Percent by which MIM managed real estate equity investment portfolio properties within MetLife\u2019s General Account reduced Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions, between 2019 and 2021.\n\u00b2. Metric reflects consumption reduction in energy use intensity across all participating MIM client accounts from 2016 to 2021, as reported by Better Buildings Challenge public reporting on May 1, 2023.\nInspiring Colleagues to Make an Impact\n\nEach year, thousands of colleagues participate in our employee engagement program to promote environmental stewardship, called \u201cOur Green Impact.\u201d The program offers colleagues on-site and virtual environmental education, as well as volunteer opportunities. In addition to location-based \u201cgreen teams\u201d that drive initiatives at the office level, every MetLife line of business, function and region has a climate goals champion responsible for helping the enterprise achieve our short- and long-term goals. Over 20 champions gather bimonthly to set objectives for their function, drive action, collect metrics and share progress with their senior leaders and colleagues.\n\nMore than 4,300 colleagues from 40+ markets participated in the 2022 MetLife EcoChallenge, an annual two-week competition to encourage colleagues to adopt green habits. Participation in the challenge has tripled since 2020, making 2022 our most impactful challenge to date.\n\n2022 METLIFE ECOCHALLENGE IMPACT VERSUS 2021\n\n- **Actions completed**\n  - 2022: 147,000\n  - 2021: 215,000\n\n- **Minutes learning about environmental issues**\n  - 2022: 110,000\n  - 2021: 340,000\n\n- **Gallons of water saved**\n  - 2022: 232,000\n  - 2021: 331,000\n\n- **CO2 avoided (lbs)**\n  - 2022: 169,000\n  - 2021: 35,000\n\n1.

The program engaged over 2,700 stakeholders in 35 markets, completing over 4,200 volunteer hours.\n\n2022 METLIFE EXTRAORDINARY LITTER PICKUP BY THE NUMBERS\n\n35 markets\n\n4,200+ volunteer hours globally\n\n~100 events\n\n2,700+ volunteers\n\nMetLife Lebanon and MetLife China were among 35 markets that participated in the MetLife Extraordinary Litter Pickup.\nOur Reforestation Efforts\n\nMetLife\u2019s commitment to plant 5 million trees by 2030 is a contribution to the global effort to reduce carbon emissions in the atmosphere and help reforest areas that have been decimated by natural disasters, including hurricanes, floods and wildfires, as well as deforestation by humans.\n\nWe expect to reach our target through initiatives that include large-scale reforestation programs in national and state forests, distribution of trees to homeowners in communities impacted by disaster and colleague volunteer projects in urban areas around the world. We are engaging stakeholders in this commitment and educating our colleagues, customers and community members about the importance of trees. MetLife is a member of 1t.org, a global leadership platform to mobilize, connect and empower the global reforestation community to conserve, restore and grow 1 trillion trees by 2030.\n\n> MetLife Japan colleagues planted 1,000 trees to help establish the MetLife Foundation Forest in Miyagi prefecture.\nConserving, Restoring and Planting Trees Around the World\n\nGLOBAL TREE-PLANTING INITIATIVES\n\n~800,000 total trees planted since 2020\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n1.

We seek to leverage our resources and network to drive impactful climate action around the world.\n\nMetLife has partnered with the Haas School of Business at University of California, Berkeley, to support the 15-week Cleantech to Market accelerator program, which pairs interdisciplinary teams of Berkeley graduate students with entrepreneurs from across the country to help accelerate commercialization of the most promising climate tech innovations. Each student team spends nearly 1,000 hours of structured research and assessment to investigate market opportunities and pitch business ideas to help elevate participating entrepreneurs and their climate technologies. In addition to providing financial support for the program and the \u201cMetLife Climate Solution Awards\u201d presented at the program\u2019s annual Climate Tech Summit, MetLife colleagues contributed professional expertise to students through a mentorship program comprised of over a dozen MetLife colleagues from across the world.\n\nMetLife provided financial support and mentorship for the Cleantech to Market accelerator program.\nPromoting Supply Chain Sustainability\n\nMetLife\u2019s Supply Chain Sustainability Program incorporates sustainability criteria in our procurement process, including requests for information and within supplier contracts, and incentivizes environmental stewardship to reduce GHG emissions.\n\nWe seek to increase the number of suppliers responding to the CDP Climate Change Questionnaire each year. In 2022, 181 suppliers disclosed climate risks, GHG emissions and other environmental data to us through this program, compared with 123 in 2021. We share a scorecard with these suppliers that identifies areas of strength and opportunities for improvement on climate change management and support them in setting targets to reduce emissions. We achieved our goal to have 100 suppliers set GHG emissions reduction targets by 2025 three years early, with 115 MetLife suppliers having public targets in 2022.\n\nMetLife has a longstanding commitment to purchase products that have a lower environmental impact than others. We prioritize ENERGY STAR-certified IT equipment, sustainably sourced paper and green building materials, among other sustainable products and services.\nFor Our Communities\n\nHIGHLIGHTS: METLIFE FOUNDATION\n\nOUR APPROACH\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nPRIORITIES\n\nSUPPORT FOR UKRAINE\n\nVOLUNTEERING EFFORTS\u2014ENGAGING OUR COLLEAGUES\n\nVOLUNTEERING WITH PURPOSE\n\nGLOBAL SUPPORT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CAUSES\n\nRegional President, U.S. Business, participated in Vision To Learn\u2019s Focus on the Future program.\nHighlights: MetLife Foundation\n\nLaunched new strategy to drive inclusive economic mobility by addressing the needs of underserved and underrepresented communities around the world.\n\n$37.9M in total grants globally in 2022.\n\n109K hours of service across 37 markets in 2022, contributing to MetLife\u2019s DEI Commitment of 800,000 volunteer hours by 2030.\n\nContributed $3.5M in grants since 2020 as part of its 10-year, $10 million commitment to environmental causes.\n\n$60.9M to support underserved and underrepresented communities since 2021, reaching 41% of its $150 million by 2030 Commitment.\n\nRecognized by United Negro College Fund, Ballet Hispanico and YMCA of Greater New York for our commitment to our communities.\n\n1.

An accelerator program supported by MetLife Foundation to identify early-stage innovative solutions for financial health. (U.S. and LATAM.)\nSupport for Ukraine\nCaring for colleagues and customers during the most difficult of times\n\nThe war in Ukraine created a dire humanitarian crisis leading to unprecedented challenges for our colleagues, customers, agents, distribution partners and the people of Ukraine. MetLife and our colleagues around the world have remained committed to supporting those affected by the ongoing crisis, a collective response that has shown MetLife\u2019s purpose in action.\n\nThroughout the worst of the invasion, we remained in daily contact with our team in Ukraine. With safety as our first priority, we closed our MetLife office in Kyiv at the beginning of the war (limited access only for essential work). We separated the MetLife Ukraine IT network from the wider MetLife network early to reduce our cyber exposure. We have since created a dedicated secured network, opened our office to a limited number of critical colleagues and worked with our distribution partners to strengthen our support for our customers.\n\nTwo dedicated support hubs in Poland and Romania enabled us to relocate and establish displaced colleagues and their families, including providing financial support and new school arrangements for colleagues\u2019 children. For all Ukrainian colleagues\u2014whether they left Ukraine or not\u2014we have provided ongoing financial support.\n\nOur support for our 250 agents in Ukraine comprised a lump sum relocation package paid in March 2022 and our service colleagues reassured Ukrainian customers that we would pay claims. Between the start of the war and December 31, 2022, 913 customer claims related to the war totaled approximately $425,000.\n\nMetLife Foundation and MetLife colleagues donated $500,000 to relief efforts to support the people of Ukraine, which includes donations and matching dollars to the UNICEF USA, Ronald McDonald House Charities, the American Red Cross, Razom for Ukraine and Nova Ukraine to provide humanitarian war relief and recovery to address the most urgent needs as they evolve.\n\nMIM has conducted market research to help investors around the world understand the impact of the war and the subsequent economic sanctions on Russia on the global economy.\n\nMetLife will continue to support our Ukrainian colleagues and customers during these challenging times.\nVolunteering Efforts\u2014Engaging Our Colleagues\n\nWe encourage a culture of year-round volunteering in which MetLife colleagues live our purpose by lending their time, talent and passion for their communities to educational, environmental, mentoring, coaching, skills-based and pro-bono initiatives. These efforts support MetLife\u2019s 2030 DEI commitment of 800,000 colleague volunteer hours with a focus on DEI/underserved communities by 2030.\n\n2022 GLOBAL VOLUNTEERING BY THE NUMBERS\n\nNearly 110,000 volunteer hours\n\n33,784 acts of volunteering\n\n37 markets\n\nColleagues in Uruguay joined DESEM Junior Achievement in a volunteering activity called \u201cNuestra Huerta\u201d (\u201cOur Garden\u201d), a project to develop a gardening workshop for fifth- and sixth-grade children from a public school in Montevideo.

These policies and statements include:\n\n- **Code of Business Ethics**\n  (see [Code of Business Ethics](#))\n- **MetLife Equal Employment Opportunity and Anti-Harassment Policy**\n- **MetLife Speak Up Tool**\n- **MetLife Pay Equity Statement**\n- **MetLife Environmental Policy**\n- **Global Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy**\n- **Antitrust Guidelines**\n- **Global Sales Practices Policy**\n- **Global Privacy & Information Security Program (internal)**\n- **Supplier Code of Business Ethics**\n- **MetLife Privacy Policies**\n\nGovernance\n\n**BOARD OF DIRECTORS**\n\nMetLife\u2019s Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the management of the company\u2019s business and advising the company\u2019s executive officers, who conduct the company\u2019s business and affairs. In performing their general oversight responsibility, Directors apply their business judgment to assure that the company\u2019s executive officers manage in the best long-term interests of the company and its shareholders. We maintain a Directors\u2019 Code of Business Ethics, which requires each Director to annually review and sign an acknowledgment of understanding and compliance.\n\nEach of MetLife\u2019s Board Committees (with the exception of the Executive Committee) is chaired by an independent director with demonstrated expertise in the responsibilities of that Committee and strong leadership skills. The Board\u2019s Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee meets at least three times each year and makes regular reports to the Board of Directors about its activities.\nThe Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee is tasked with various responsibilities, including oversight of MetLife\u2019s:\n\n- Process for the Board to review proposed succession plan for the CEO and succession and development plans for other executive officers;\n- Policies and disclosures regarding environmental and social matters of significance to MetLife, including sustainability, human rights, political and charitable contributions and other corporate responsibility issues;\n- Compliance risk management-related activities and annual compliance plan approval;\n- Impact investment program in which loans and other investments are made to support affordable housing, community, business and economic development, and healthcare services for low- and moderate-income communities;\n- Efforts to manage MetLife\u2019s reputation and culture; and\n- Annual Board evaluation.\n\n**BOARD OF DIRECTORS DEMOGRAPHICS**\n\nThe company has nominated 14 highly qualified independent leaders to serve on its Board of Directors.\n\n---\n\n1.

MetLife\u2019s sustainability efforts are integrally tied to our business. MetLife considers a broad array of factors, including those related to sustainability, in evaluating business decisions.\n\nOperationally, MetLife\u2019s Sustainability function is part of MetLife\u2019s Corporate Affairs department and is dedicated to sustainability strategy, management and reporting. The Sustainability function\u2019s efforts are led by the Chief Sustainability Officer and overseen by MetLife\u2019s Executive Vice President, Head of Corporate Affairs, who reports directly to the CEO.\n\nAdditionally, MetLife\u2019s leaders include sustainability in annual performance objectives as part of a shared goal for MetLife\u2019s executive leadership team. MetLife employees are responsible for driving progress toward MetLife\u2019s Next Horizon Strategy, which includes making progress on sustainability commitments. Please see For Our Colleagues to learn more regarding DEI-specific governance.\n\nThe Chief Sustainability Officer coordinates with other senior executives to establish sustainability goals and advance progress across the organization.\n\nMetLife\u2019s Sustainability function has responsibilities relating to, among other things:\n\n- Directing and integrating MetLife\u2019s sustainability strategy, target-setting activities, commitments, policies and key performance indicators across the enterprise;\n- Summarizing MetLife\u2019s sustainability performance and metrics in an annual report;\n- Aligning disclosures to key reporting frameworks, including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), SASB and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD); and\n- Managing and monitoring ESG issues and opportunities relevant to MetLife.\n\nIn addition to day-to-day management of MetLife\u2019s sustainability efforts and overseeing the publication and data governance of MetLife\u2019s Sustainability Report, the Sustainability function regularly reports to MetLife\u2019s Board of Directors and its committees on relevant sustainability issues, the company\u2019s progress toward its goals and sustainability\u2019s impact on the business, and helps advance the Board\u2019s collective knowledge of sustainable development more generally. MetLife\u2019s CEO has final sign-off on the publication of the annual Sustainability Report, and the report is also shared with the Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee of the Board of Directors annually.\n\nIn response to the relevance of sustainability topics and initiatives to MetLife, as well as the evolving regulatory and standard-setting environment, MetLife created an ESG Financial Reporting Controller role focused on guiding the company in accounting for our sustainability commitments and promoting compliance and transparency in regulatory reporting. The ESG Financial Reporting Controller seeks to develop and implement a framework to support regulated and voluntary reporting containing ESG information.\n\nMetLife is a signatory to the UNGC, a voluntary framework for businesses to align their operations and strategies with Ten Principles covering human rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption.\n\nSee MetLife\u2019s Communication on Progress and UNGC profile online.\nRisk Management\n\nMetLife is in the business of mitigating risk and protecting families and their futures. We manage risk so that individuals and communities can realize their full potential. MetLife has a well-established risk management framework that constantly evolves and is designed to address material financial and non-financial risks (including compliance risks) to our business. Our risk and control framework operates under a \u201cThree Lines of Defense\u201d model where each employee is responsible for risk management. The framework helps us identify, measure, monitor, manage and report on risks at the right level, allowing us to deliver on the promises we make to our customers, employees and shareholders. The program is led by an independent Global Risk Management organization headed by our Chief Risk Officer, who reports directly to MetLife\u2019s CEO. The framework flows as follows:\n\nFirst Line\n\nLines of business and corporate functions identify, measure, monitor, manage and report risk.\n\nSecond Line\n\nGlobal Risk Management provides strategic advisory services and effective challenge and oversight to the first line of defense.\n\nThird Line\n\nInternal Audit provides independent assurance and testing over the risk and control environment and related processes and controls.\n\nThe Finance and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors oversees the assessment, management and mitigation of material risks, as well as capital and liquidity management practices. Other Board of Directors committees also have significant risk management oversight responsibilities:\n\n- **Audit** Internal controls, information security and cybersecurity, and relevant legal and regulatory compliance;\n- **Governance and Corporate Responsibility** Compliance risk management activities, compliance plan, management succession and reputation, as well as strategies, activities and initiatives related to environmental and social matters;\n- **Investment** Investment portfolio risks; and\n- **Compensation** Compensation plan risks (e.g., avoiding incentives to take excessive risk).\n\nThe Board and its committees oversee sustainability matters, including the assessment and management of the relevant ESG risks and opportunities in MetLife\u2019s business, operations and policies. MetLife\u2019s management provides regular updates to the full Board and its committees on various sustainability matters. For more information on the Board\u2019s committees and risk management oversight, please refer to Board Committee Information and Board of Directors.\n\nIn addition to oversight by the Board and its committees, MetLife has a management-level risk oversight structure. Material risks, including ESG risks, as appropriate, are within the purview of multiple senior management committees. MetLife\u2019s Enterprise Risk Committee, a senior management level committee, oversees the identification, measurement and management of material risks on an enterprise basis.\nMANAGING CLIMATE RISKS\n\nClimate risks, both physical and transition risks, could impact MetLife\u2019s business operations, investments, customers and supply chain. Climate change may increase the frequency and severity of near- or long-term weather-related disasters, public health incidents and pandemics, and their effects may increase over time. Climate change regulation may impact the value of investments we or our counterparties, including reinsurers, hold or increase our compliance costs. Our regulators may also increasingly focus their examinations on climate-related risks.\n\nMetLife considers how it could be impacted by climate risks across the business, both assets and liabilities, by qualitatively evaluating how risks could manifest across risk types, including: credit, market, insurance, operational, legal and compliance risks.\n\nMetLife continues to build assessment and scenario analysis capabilities to make progress on understanding climate risks and their potential impacts on our business, strategy and financial planning. MetLife also stays up to date on policy trends and evolving regulatory requirements globally, through internal and external resources, engagement and our global Climate Advisory Council.\n\nGLOBAL CLIMATE ADVISORY COUNCIL\n\nIn 2022, MetLife launched a global Climate Advisory Council to enhance the governance of climate risk, which is chaired by MetLife\u2019s Chief Risk Officer and includes the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Investment Officer and General Counsel, among other executives.\nCode of Business Ethics\n\nMetLife\u2019s Code of Business Ethics helps us live our purpose with every customer every day. It helps us navigate an always-changing external environment while meeting the highest professional standards. We regularly update the Code to reflect prevailing norms, updates to internal policies and market conditions, among other issues. In 2022, MetLife published an updated Code to align with changes to internal policies related to speaking up, treating customers fairly, protecting the privacy rights of our customers and employees, and personal trading.\n\nThe Code is the foundation for our Success Principles and represents our core values for conducting business. Our Success Principles articulate the behaviors that MetLife employees are expected to exhibit, and those that help us deliver on our purpose and execute on our strategy. Our Code of Business Ethics is available in 18 languages and applies to all employees. Each year, employees pledge that they commit to and comply with the Code.\n\nIn the Code, we confirm our commitment to conducting business fairly, honestly and openly, and a zero-tolerance policy toward all forms of bribery and corruption that may be committed by MetLife employees or a third party acting for or on behalf of MetLife. We also maintain supplemental codes, including the Financial Management Code of Business Ethics and the Supplier Code of Business Ethics.\n\nCode of Business Ethics training encourages employees to have an ownership mindset, speak up and escalate concerns when they arise. 98% of employees completed the 2022 Code of Business Ethics training.\n\nMandatory Training in 2022\n\nMandatory training topics included anti-money laundering and sanctions, privacy and data protection, fraud prevention, gifts and entertainment, sales practices and ethical business conduct.\n\nTo learn more regarding our restructured mandatory training approach, see page 24.\n\n22 mandatory courses\n12 courses per employee on average\n5 hours of learning per employee on average\n98% completion rate, an increase from 95% in 2021 and above our 90% target\n\n1.

We encourage employees to lead by example, holding themselves and others accountable by raising issues and concerns. Employees can speak up using the channel that is most comfortable for them and can report anonymously, where permissible by law.\n\nReporting channels include:\n\n- **Ethics & Fraud HelpLine**, available globally;\n- Speak Up Tool, a desktop icon available to all employees;\n- Corporate Special Investigations Unit;\n- Local or Regional Compliance Risk Management;\n- Local or Regional Helpline or Whistleblowing Contact;\n- Local or Regional HR or Employee Relations; and\n- Direct supervisor, next-level supervisor and any other level of management.\n\nMetLife takes all reported concerns seriously, and each one is reviewed, investigated and addressed, as appropriate. When warranted, MetLife takes appropriate disciplinary or corrective actions, including termination of employment or contracts with business partners. MetLife prohibits any form of retaliation against an employee for raising a concern in good faith or assisting with an investigation regarding a potential violation of our Code, our policies, laws or regulations.\n\nCustomer and external stakeholder concerns and grievances can be reported through MetLife customer service departments or the stakeholder\u2019s relationship manager. Anyone can report potential ethics, fraud or misconduct concerns through the Ethics & Fraud Helpline (available globally)\u2014either online or by phone. Concerns are escalated, as appropriate, to Legal, Risk, Compliance, the Executive Leadership Team or to MetLife\u2019s Board of Directors.\nCybersecurity and Data Privacy\n\nMetLife\u2019s customers, employees and business partners around the world provide us with their personal information and other confidential information every day. MetLife is committed to protecting, responsibly using and processing such information in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nOur policies and procedures are designed to protect the confidentiality and security of personal information and create effective mechanisms to handle information appropriately worldwide, which includes key areas such as safeguards and risk management, monitoring, data incident response, cybersecurity and e-discovery investigation, and threat intelligence. Our Global Privacy & Information Security Program establishes enterprise-wide principles and global minimum standards, among other things, around the collection and use of personal information in compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations. The objectives of the program are to:\n\n- Protect against known and unknown threats or hazards to the availability, confidentiality and integrity of personal information and other confidential information; and\n- Protect against loss or destruction or unauthorized access to personal information and other confidential information.\n\nDATA PRIVACY COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nMetLife\u2019s Privacy Compliance Group, headed by the Chief Privacy Officer, has oversight of MetLife\u2019s Privacy Compliance Risk Program and is responsible for establishing and maintaining the internal Global Privacy and Data Protection Policy (Global Privacy Policy), overseeing the implementation of and ongoing compliance with the Global Privacy Policy and advising business management on privacy risks.\n\nThe Global Privacy Policy establishes enterprise-wide principles and global minimum standards designated to facilitate compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations in the countries in which MetLife operates.\n\nTwo internal committees, the Business Information Security Officers and the Policy Voting Board, which include members from Technology, Law, Internal Audit, HR, Compliance and other lines of business, oversee our IT security policies, emerging risks and compliance requirements.\n\n1. Please see MetLife\u2019s 2023 Proxy Statement to learn more.\nCYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY TRAINING\n\nEvery year, we conduct mandatory cybersecurity and privacy training for all employees to raise awareness about potential threats and provide clear, actionable guidelines to inform everyday tasks and decision making. Every MetLife employee is required to complete yearly privacy training and comply with applicable privacy laws and regulations when processing personal data held by the company.\n\nMetLife raises awareness about the importance of cybersecurity and provides employees with resources to protect themselves, our customers and MetLife. We participate in industry cybersecurity groups and events, such as Cybersecurity Awareness Month each October, a national campaign sponsored by the Department of Homeland Security that was created to raise awareness about cybersecurity and staying safe. During the 2022 event, we launched our new Report Phishing recognition program to award Center Stage internal recognition badges to employees who report confirmed malicious emails.\n\nWe have established reporting processes and escalation pathways from our businesses and functions to identify, assess and manage potential personal data incidents in a timely manner\u2014including reporting to senior management, as needed.\n\nINFORMATION SECURITY\n\nMetLife\u2019s Information Security (InfoSec) program has a mission to protect our information and technology assets, personal and confidential information, and technology-dependent business processes from known and unknown risks and security threats, and to provide enterprise-wide IT risk identification, prioritization, reporting and mitigation services.\nInfoSec pursues this mission through programs to protect against, monitor and/or report threats to MetLife\u2019s information and technology assets associated with risks of operational disruption and unauthorized or accidental access, modification, destruction, exposure and/or disclosure.\n\nThe authority and responsibility for managing the InfoSec program resides with MetLife\u2019s Enterprise Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). The Enterprise CISO is a senior-level executive responsible for establishing and maintaining the vision, strategy and program so that information and technology assets are protected among all MetLife affiliates and that IT risks are reported, remediated and managed.\n\nSupplier Management\n\nMetLife\u2019s Global Procurement Policy and Procedures help secure the best value from our suppliers across the four major MetLife regions (U.S, EMEA, Asia and LATAM). MetLife\u2019s Supplier Code of Business Ethics articulates our intention to work with suppliers who model MetLife\u2019s principles and standards. This includes our commitment to conduct business ethically and lawfully in countries where we operate across our supply chain, and we expect the same of our suppliers.\n\nWe expect suppliers to operate in line with MetLife\u2019s principles, which prioritize respect for basic human rights within organizations, including rights to health and safety, life and liberty, and equality. Suppliers should also comply with all applicable federal, state and local employment, equal opportunity, labor, immigration, and wage and hour laws.\n\nMetLife asks sustainability questions in requests for information and during onboarding. We encourage suppliers to participate in the MetLife Supply Chain Sustainability program through active engagement (see Promoting Supply Chain Sustainability).\nTHIRD-PARTY RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nThe Supplier Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) program protects sensitive MetLife and customer information. Third parties are required to comply with the MetLife TPRM program, including participation in a risk assessment prior to providing goods or services and in ongoing monitoring of our business relationship.\n\nThrough MetLife\u2019s TPRM program, we evaluate the risk of third-party engagements and suppliers before assigning them a risk rating and managing them accordingly.\n\nFOSTERING SUPPLIER DIVERSITY\n\nThrough MetLife\u2019s Supplier Inclusion and Development program, we aim to develop partnerships with diverse suppliers to promote their economic growth. Supplier Inclusion & Development is integrated within Global Procurement so we can interact with sourcing professionals and business stakeholders to support the inclusion of diverse suppliers in our supply chain.\n\nAs part of our 2030 DEI commitments, MetLife has committed to spending $5 billion with diverse suppliers by 2030 and to annually report the economic impact of our diverse supply chain, which we do through our Economic Impact Report.

The Proxy Policies have been designed to ensure that client securities are voted in the best interests of clients in accordance with applicable rules. The Proxy Policies are based on the guiding principle of maximization of economic value of client holdings. MIM does not permit voting decisions to be influenced in any manner that is contrary to, or dilutive of, this guiding principle. The Proxy Policies are designed to ensure that material conflicts of interest on the part of MIM or its affiliates do not affect voting decisions on behalf of clients.  \n\nBased on the guiding principle that all votes made by MIM on behalf of its clients must be made in the best interest of the clients and with the intent to maximize the economic value of clients\u2019 securities holdings, MIM has adopted proxy voting guidelines (the Guidelines) that set forth how it plans to vote on specific matters presented for shareholder vote. MIM has retained Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) recommended proxy voting Guidelines to monitor and vote proxies. MIM, however, may deviate from the Guidelines with respect to a particular shareholder vote when such action is consistent with the guiding principle of seeking the maximum economic value to clients, taking into consideration all relevant facts and circumstances at the time of the vote. Prior to deviating from the Guidelines, MIM\u2019s Proxy Committee, which is comprised of senior investment personnel, and legal and compliance personnel, must first determine whether there is any material conflict of interest between MIM (or any of its affiliates) and clients.  \n\nISS monitors client accounts and their holdings to be sure that all proxies are received and voted. Should a proxy arise that is not covered by the Guidelines, ISS will be directed to vote in a manner approved by MIM\u2019s Proxy Committee. In addition, MIM\u2019s Proxy Committee regularly monitors matters presented for shareholder vote and tracks the voting of the proxies. |\n\n**Engagement**  \nMIM ESG Engagement Policy\n## SASB Index\n\n### SASB\u2014Sustainability Accounting Standards Board\n\n#### Business Ethics\n\n| Code/Metric | Response/Reference |\n|-------------|--------------------|\n| FN-AC-510a.1, Total amount of monetary losses as a result of legal proceedings associated with fraud, insider trading, anti-trust, anti-competitive behavior, market manipulation, malpractice, or other related financial industry laws or regulations | For MetLife\u2019s disclosure on required legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the 2022 Form 10-K. |\n| FN-AC-510a.2, Description of whistleblower policies and procedures | MetLife has an Ethics and Fraud Helpline and local whistleblowing policies and procedures in certain countries.

The development and review of materials includes legal, product subject matter experts, and compliance, communications and marketing teams to ensure compliance, accuracy and clarity, and following of regulatory filing standards where appropriate and applicable, based upon various regulating agencies and bodies, such as state departments of insurance, and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) guidelines for marketing material and plan filings. Information may include specific product details, features, disclaimers, exclusions and other terms and conditions, as well as general information about MetLife\u2019s brand, corporate functions and financial performance. |\n\n**Custom communication campaigns**<br>MetLife is committed to developing custom Group Benefits communications campaigns tailored for each employer, aimed to drive awareness, education and participation. We recommend an omnichannel communications strategy, increasing focus on digital delivery and using offline channels as an important secondary channel. Integrating messages across these channels creates a \u201csurround-sound\u201d effect that enhances the employee experience. We also have deep experience in building compelling communications for digital channels such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, microsites, online benefits fairs and emails\u2014and we partner with each employer to craft a step-by-step plan to meet employees\u2019 needs and habits.\n\n**Communication tactics**<br>Product enrollment and service communications plans include:<br>\u2022 **Personalized enrollment kits**: Mailed to employees\u2019 homes, in addition to announcement and reminder email communications.<br>\u2022 **Custom Microsite**: Serves as an educational resource center that all employees can access.<br>\u2022 **Employee video(s)**: Highlight the product details, the need for each benefit, plan benefits and enrollment instructions.<br>\u2022 **Benefit Decision Guide**: Helps employees evaluate benefit needs by highlighting the value of each benefit and what employees should consider when evaluating their individual and loved ones\u2019 needs.\n| Code/Metric | Response/Reference |\n|-------------|--------------------|\n| FN-IN-270a.4, Description of approach to informing customers about products (cont.) | In-person and/or virtual benefit support and trainings:  \n- **Benefit Fairs**: Hosted by qualified benefit counselors available through either a platform hosted by the employer, through a Webex or teleconference that MetLife hosts, or in-person at the employer\u2019s site(s).  \n- **Webinars**: Live product presentations to employees with options for Q&A, recording, camera, chat, polls and engagement activities.  \n- **Brainshark Presentations**: Customized presentations with \u201cvoice over\u201d audio that highlight the benefits available.  \n- **Human Resources (HR) Team Training Sessions**: Product training to HR representatives, typically through webcast, focused on our products and highlights of the specific plan design as well as frequently asked questions from employees.  \n\nDuring annual enrollment, MetLife provides real-time support through virtual engagement such as chatting via a webinar, responding to questions submitted through a MetLife microsite or calling during set office hours. We also accommodate requests for print material and giveaways, if needed.  \n- **Social Media**: Custom-designed specifically for employers to drive awareness of the plan, direct employees to educational resources and highlight the need for the plan.  \n- **Coordinator Support**: Custom training, brochures, FAQs, infographics and more.  \n- **New-Hire Communications**: With employers\u2019 approval, MetLife mails all new hires at the time of employment a communication that congratulates them on their new position, provides them with details about each benefit, the plan, and gives them enrollment information and timeline.  \n- **Call Center and Operations**: Inbound calls for specific questions or support and/or confirmation of account changes, such as beneficiaries.  \n\nFrequency of communications depends on the product, employer\u2019s enrollment period, audience and nature of communications.\n## SASB Index\n\n### SASB\u2014Sustainability Accounting Standards Board\n\n**Transparent Information & Fair Advice for Customers (continued)**\n\n| Code/Metric | Response/Reference |\n|-------------|--------------------|\n| FN-IN-270a.4, Description of approach to informing customers about products (cont.) | **Retirement & Income Solutions (RIS)**  \nProduct and service communications occur through five primary channels:  \n- **In-person/Phone, e.g., Sales and Customer Support Teams:** Sales enablement collateral that includes presentation decks and slip sheets.  \n- **Web:** A section for each RIS line of business (LOB) with specific details on products, services, market insights and support materials.  \n- **Conferences/Events and Webinars:** Topically focused and typically delivered via panel discussion, sponsored segment or hosted Webex.  \n- **Digital:** Email, social (primarily LinkedIn) and banner/display covering both direct outreach, such as with email, and targeted communications.  \n- **Call Center and Operations:** Inbound calls for specific questions or support and outbound communications that are primarily direct mail and take the form of regulatory notifications, benefit enrollment kits or confirmation of account changes such as beneficiaries.  \n\nThe frequency of communication depends on the LOB, audience and the nature of communications. RIS is regulated due to the nature of its products and adheres to applicable ERISA requirements for specific product lines (e.g., with Institutional Income Annuities that are within a 401(k)). As such, all communications, regardless of channel or format, are legally reviewed following a defined internal process and strict adherence to regulatory requirements, including risk/legal disclosures and no investment advice. There is also ongoing training and monitoring of communications such as with FINRA registered agents. To the extent available, MetLife also provides real-time support for benefit administration through virtual engagement via a MetLife microsite. |\n## SASB Index\n\n### SASB\u2014Sustainability Accounting Standards Board\n\nTransparent Information & Fair Advice for Customers (continued)\n\n| Code/Metric | Response/Reference |\n|-------------|--------------------|\n| FN-IN-270a.4, Description of approach to informing customers about products (cont.) | MIM |\n\nProduct and service communications occur through five primary channels:\n\n- **Face-to-face, e.g., Sales and Customer Support Teams:** Sales enablement collateral includes presentation decks and slip sheets. There is usually one standard deck per investment capability. With sales taking anywhere from six months to three years on average, the number of meetings held depends on the prospect. However, usually at least three meetings with the sales team and investment team occur in addition to request-for-proposal reviews and final presentation to the investment committee where Sales, Investments, Compliance and Operations present processes and answer questions. These meetings are also forums to discuss potential investment, operational and compliance risks, and how they are monitored. Investment consultants play a big part by acting as intermediaries in 75% of the deals in the U.S. Therefore, MIM follows a path of informing investment consultants about our products, and they assign a buy, hold, sell rating to the products. Prospects who use an investment consultant usually only buy from us if our product is rated a \u201cbuy\u201d by their investment consultant. MIM (through its appropriate legal entities) sells its investment capabilities in the U.S., Canada, EMEA, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and a few other Asian countries.\n\n- **Web (MIM):** Separate sections for each MIM LOB provide details on the value proposition for each product, investment team members and support materials. We also have sections on thought leadership divided by LOB and a section on ESG.\n\n- **Conferences/Events and Webinars:** Topically focused and typically delivered via panel discussion, sponsored keynote address or hosted via ON24 or, if sponsored, via the host\u2019s platform. A key part of the in-person conferences is networking done by our sales team (we refer to them as the Institutional Client Group). At conferences, they learn about the prospect\u2019s asset allocation and which asset classes they are currently looking at. Then, if we have an investment capability that matches their needs, the salesperson will set up a time to meet after the conference to continue the discussion.\n\n- **Digital:** Email, social (LinkedIn only) and banner/display covers both direct outreach, such as email, and targeted communications.\n\n- **Advertising:** In addition to the banner/display digital advertising, we also do some print advertising.\n| Code/Metric | Response/Reference |\n|-------------|--------------------|\n| FN-IN-270a.4, Description of approach to informing customers about products (cont.) | The frequency of communication depends on the LOB, audience and nature of communications. During the sales process, if a client is actively looking to buy investment capabilities in a certain asset class, then the communication could be once every month, whereas if the prospect is just researching and taking their time, then the communication may be once per quarter. Once the prospect is a client, then there is significant communication as they are onboarded and then receive reporting approximately once per month. We are currently implementing a client portal where clients can access all their accounts in one place and have full transparency into their account. We understand that full transparency related to what is happening in the market, what is driving performance and what is occurring in the investment portfolio is key. These communications are typically conducted via reporting on a frequency demanded by the client (weekly, monthly, quarterly). We also work with clients on quarterly portfolio reviews. Additionally, MIM is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and FINRA in the U.S. and by the local regulator in each of the regions it operates. We must have all communications and marketing materials reviewed by the investment compliance team to ensure all information is transparent and not misleading in any way. These materials are reviewed following a defined internal process and strictly adhere to regulatory requirements, including risk/legal disclosures. MIM members undergo ongoing training and monitoring of communications such as with FINRA registered agents. |\n## SASB Index\n\n**SASB\u2014Sustainability Accounting Standards Board**\n\n### Incorporation of Environmental, Social & Governance Factors in Investment Management\n\n| Code/Metric | Response/Reference |\n|-------------|--------------------|\n| FN-IN-410a.1, Total invested assets, by industry and asset class | As of December 31, 2022 ($ in millions) |\n| | Total Invested Assets and Cash\u00b9 |\n| | Fixed maturity securities available for sale (AFS): |\n| | U.S. and foreign corporate | $132,602 |\n| | Foreign government | 46,747 |\n| | U.S. government and agency | 32,229 |\n| | Residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) | 26,165 |\n| | Asset-backed securities (ABS) and Collateralized loan obligations (CLO) | 16,822 |\n| | Municipal | 12,152 |\n| | Commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) | 10,063 |\n| | Fixed maturity securities AFS | 276,780 |\n| | Equity securities: |\n| | Common stock | 1,542 |\n| | Non-redeemable preferred stock | 142 |\n| | Equity securities | 1,684 |\n| | Contractholder-directed equity securities and fair value option securities | 9,668 |\n| | Mortgage loans: |\n| | Commercial mortgage loans | 52,502 |\n| | Agricultural mortgage loans | 19,306 |\n| | Residential mortgage loans | 12,482 |\n| | Valuation allowances | (527) |\n| | Mortgage loans | 83,763 |\n| | Policy loans | 8,874 |\n| | Real estate and real estate joint ventures | 13,137 |\n| | Other limited partnership interests | 14,414 |\n| | Short-term investments | 4,935 |\n| | Other invested assets | 20,038 |\n| | Cash and cash equivalents | 20,195 |\n| | Total Invested Assets & Cash\u00b2 | $453,488 |\n\n1.

The sustainability materiality analysis was based on real-time analytics on strategic, regulatory and reputational risks and opportunities. Implementing the analysis has strengthened our understanding of ESG-related issues and enhanced our in-house capabilities to assess their evolution. In addition, this data-driven process, along with feedback from various key stakeholders and sources (e.g., ESG ratings/rankings, investors, MetLife senior executives, external perspectives, peer benchmarking, etc.), allows us to develop a forward-looking sustainability strategy that helps ensure we can continue to be a force for good in the world, sustaining customers, family and the planet.

MIM may periodically refine or otherwise modify its definition of responsible investments and the components thereof based on data availability or other factors.\n2. Impact Investments are investments made with the intention to generate positive, measurable social and environmental impact alongside a financial return (GIIN\u2014Global Impact Investment Network\u2014definition). This activity includes MetLife\u2019s General Account and a smaller volume of MetLife Foundation assets.\n3. MIM currently defines green investments to include 1) LEED, ENERGY STAR, BREEAM, NGBS, Fitwel-certified real estate equity investments; 2) commercial mortgage loans secured by LEED and/or ENERGY STAR-certified real estate; 3) renewable energy projects, including wind and solar; 4) ESPCs; 5) public and private corporate green bonds; 6) Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) residential and commercial loans; and 7) sustainable agricultural loans.\n4.

We do not guarantee any future performance. Our results could differ materially from those we express or imply in forward-looking statements. The risks, uncertainties and other factors, including those relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, identified in MetLife, Inc.\u2019s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and others, may cause such differences.\n\nThese factors include:\n\n1. economic condition difficulties, including risks relating to public health, interest rates, credit spreads, equity, real estate, obligors and counterparties, government default, currency exchange rates, derivatives, climate change, and terrorism and security;\n2. global capital and credit market adversity;\n3. credit facility inaccessibility;\n4. financial strength or credit ratings downgrades;\n5. unavailability, unaffordability, or inadequate reinsurance, including reinsurance risks that arise from reinsurers\u2019 credit risk, and the potential shortfall or failure of risk mitigants to protect against such risks;\n6. statutory life insurance reserve financing costs or limited market capacity;\n7. legal, regulatory, and supervisory and enforcement policy changes;\n8. changes in tax rates, tax laws or interpretations;\n9. litigation and regulatory investigations;\n10.

Our definitions may differ from those used by other companies.\n\n**Total Assets Under Management**\nTotal AUM is comprised of general account (GA) AUM plus Institutional Client AUM (each, as defined below).\n\n**General Account AUM** (GA AUM) is used by MetLife to describe assets in its GA investment portfolio which are actively managed and stated at estimated fair value. GA AUM is comprised of GA total investments, the portion of the GA investment portfolio classified within assets held-for-sale, and cash and cash equivalents, excluding policy loans, contract-holder-directed equity securities, fair value option securities and certain other invested assets, as substantially all of these assets are not actively managed in MetLife\u2019s GA investment portfolio. Mortgage loans (including commercial, agricultural and residential) and real estate equity (including real estate and real estate joint ventures) included in GA AUM (at net asset value, net of deduction for encumbering debt) have been adjusted from carrying value to estimated fair value. Classification of GA AUM by sector is based on the nature and characteristics of the underlying investments, which can vary from how they are classified under GAAP.\n\nAccordingly, the underlying investments within certain real estate and real estate joint ventures that are primarily commercial mortgage loans (at net asset value, net of deduction for encumbering debt) have been reclassified to exclude them from real estate equity and include them as commercial mortgage loans.\n\n**Institutional Client AUM** is comprised of separate account (SA) AUM plus third-party (TP) AUM (each, as defined below). MetLife Investment Management manages Institutional Client AUM in accordance with client guidelines contained in each investment contract (Mandates).\n\n**Separate Account AUM** (SA AUM) is comprised of separate account investment portfolios of MetLife insurance companies, which are managed by MetLife and included in MetLife, Inc.\u2019s consolidated financial statements at estimated fair value.\n\n**Third-Party AUM** (TP AUM) is comprised of non-proprietary assets managed by MetLife on behalf of unaffiliated/third-party clients, which are stated at estimated fair value. Such non-proprietary assets are owned by unaffiliated/third-party clients and, accordingly, are not included in MetLife, Inc.\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-04-27", "created": "2025-04-27", "metadata": {"Source-File": "climate_reports/tp_reports/metlife_2022.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.1.59", "pdf-total-pages": 152, "total-input-tokens": 331148, "total-output-tokens": 68076, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 27, 1], [27, 27, 2], [27, 580, 3], [580, 2806, 4], [2806, 5607, 5], [5607, 6995, 6], [6995, 7731, 7], [7731, 8158, 8], [8158, 9496, 9], [9496, 10688, 10], [10688, 12464, 11], [12464, 17302, 12], [17302, 20281, 13], [20281, 20602, 14], [20602, 21935, 15], [21935, 23956, 16], [23956, 26470, 17], [26470, 28934, 18], [28934, 29863, 19], [29863, 31277, 20], [31277, 32620, 21], [32620, 34228, 22], [34228, 36657, 23], [36657, 38132, 24], [38132, 38751, 25], [38751, 42008, 26], [42008, 43822, 27], [43822, 44673, 28], [44673, 47027, 29], [47027, 48843, 30], [48843, 50601, 31], [50601, 50995, 32], [50995, 51508, 33], [51508, 52562, 34], [52562, 54913, 35], [54913, 58027, 36], [58027, 59877, 37], [59877, 61516, 38], [61516, 63954, 39], [63954, 65550, 40], [65550, 67298, 41], [67298, 68169, 42], [68169, 69182, 43], [69182, 70108, 44], [70108, 72118, 45], [72118, 72542, 46], [72542, 73833, 47], [73833, 78529, 48], [78529, 79533, 49], [79533, 81538, 50], [81538, 82570, 51], [82570, 84096, 52], [84096, 86736, 53], [86736, 88830, 54], [88830, 90638, 55], [90638, 91524, 56], [91524, 92813, 57], [92813, 94649, 58], [94649, 97328, 59], [97328, 97752, 60], [97752, 98987, 61], [98987, 102033, 62], [102033, 105219, 63], [105219, 106872, 64], [106872, 109536, 65], [109536, 111208, 66], [111208, 111837, 67], [111837, 112864, 68], [112864, 115993, 69], [115993, 117362, 70], [117362, 118524, 71], [118524, 118848, 72], [118848, 119833, 73], [119833, 120992, 74], [120992, 123068, 75], [123068, 126336, 76], [126336, 128617, 77], [128617, 129443, 78], [129443, 130548, 79], [130548, 131467, 80], [131467, 132737, 81], [132737, 133095, 82], [133095, 133763, 83], [133763, 135945, 84], [135945, 137636, 85], [137636, 141082, 86], [141082, 144014, 87], [144014, 145543, 88], [145543, 147789, 89], [147789, 149540, 90], [149540, 151817, 91], [151817, 153447, 92], [153447, 155242, 93], [155242, 157130, 94], [157130, 161544, 95], [161544, 161873, 96], [161873, 166526, 97], [166526, 171686, 98], [171686, 176057, 99], [176057, 181533, 100], [181533, 184503, 101], [184503, 187364, 102], [187364, 190827, 103], [190827, 191688, 104], [191688, 193595, 105], [193595, 195123, 106], [195123, 197606, 107], [197606, 199550, 108], [199550, 202115, 109], [202115, 204971, 110], [204971, 207019, 111], [207019, 209046, 112], [209046, 211788, 113], [211788, 213565, 114], [213565, 215371, 115], [215371, 217732, 116], [217732, 221608, 117], [221608, 224028, 118], [224028, 225585, 119], [225585, 226774, 120], [226774, 228308, 121], [228308, 229572, 122], [229572, 232671, 123], [232671, 236100, 124], [236100, 238679, 125], [238679, 241459, 126], [241459, 243504, 127], [243504, 247036, 128], [247036, 250811, 129], [250811, 254576, 130], [254576, 255924, 131], [255924, 258664, 132], [258664, 261504, 133], [261504, 263577, 134], [263577, 267726, 135], [267726, 272178, 136], [272178, 273148, 137], [273148, 276047, 138], [276047, 277172, 139], [277172, 279395, 140], [279395, 281166, 141], [281166, 283516, 142], [283516, 284662, 143], [284662, 286461, 144], [286461, 289267, 145], [289267, 291360, 146], [291360, 292927, 147], [292927, 294334, 148], [294334, 296629, 149], [296629, 300529, 150], [300529, 303029, 151], [303029, 303029, 152]]}}
