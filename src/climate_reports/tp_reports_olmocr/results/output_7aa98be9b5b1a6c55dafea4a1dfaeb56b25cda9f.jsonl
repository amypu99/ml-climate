All data is current as of December 31, 2022, unless otherwise noted. Information on documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), such as our 2022 Form 10-K and 2023 Proxy Statement, can be found on our corporate website, which is intended only for residents of the U.S. and Canada.\n\nTo align with U.S. government reporting requirements, the data for gender diversity in this report uses the terms men and women. We recognize and embrace the gender spectrum and diversity of our employees, and have internally established voluntary Self-ID options for employees to self-report on their gender identity. The totals in this report may not equal 100 percent due to rounding or employees who have not reported their gender and/or race/ethnicity.\nA letter from our CEO\n\nDear Stakeholders,\n\nThank you for your interest in Merck and our ongoing commitment to operating responsibly and creating value for patients, our stakeholders and our business. We continue to take inspiration from our purpose and our unique opportunity to use the power of leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world.\n\nSustainable value creation is core to how we do business as we work to advance global health, apply innovative science and ultimately protect and improve the health of people and animals through the development and delivery of medicines, vaccines and technology solutions. We are passionate about this work and committed to making a positive difference for patients and the world while driving strong business outcomes. Working globally as One Team, we organize our sustainability efforts across four focus areas to create long-term value: 1) expanding access to health; 2) developing and rewarding a diverse, inclusive and healthy workforce; 3) protecting the environment; and 4) operating with the highest standards of ethics and values.\n\nExpanding access to health\n\nTwo years ago, we set a goal to enable 100 million more people to access our innovative portfolio globally, through access strategies, solutions and partnerships, by 2025. We exceeded this goal already in 2022. As a result, we increased our ambition and more than tripled our original goal. We now aim to enable 350 million more people to access our innovative portfolio by 2025.\n\nWe are eager to reach more people not only now, but in the years to come. To this end, we pursued new scientific discoveries with an investment last year of $13.5 billion in research and development. In total, our products and pipeline seek to address 83 percent of the top 20 global burdens of diseases.\n\nRobert M. Davis | Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nIn 2022, our MECTIZAN\u00ae Donation Program turned 35 years old. The longest-running disease-specific drug donation program of its kind, this successful effort to combat river blindness and lymphatic filariasis reached nearly 360 million people last year. We also invested $38 million to advance health equity through initiatives like Merck for Mothers. These investments support our goal to reach over 30 million people in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and in U.S. underserved populations with our social investments, by 2025. We surpassed this goal as well in 2022. Our new goal is to reach over 50 million people in LMICs, underserved populations in the U.S. and, going forward, underserved populations in other high-income countries, by 2025.\n\nDeveloping and rewarding a diverse, inclusive and healthy workforce\n\nWe are committed to investing in our colleagues and building a strong pipeline of talent as an employer of choice. Across our organization, we value diversity and inclusion as both an ethical and business priority.\n\nWe are becoming even more inclusive in our hiring, working with organizations including OneTen, a business coalition striving to close the opportunity gap for Black workers without\nfour-year college degrees. In order to create more access to meaningful career opportunities for diverse candidates, we posted about 900 job openings not requiring a four-year degree, which was twice as many as the previous year. In addition, in 2022 we hosted 90 student interns through Year Up, a nonprofit serving economically disadvantaged young people. Women represented more than half of our new hires globally, and in the United States, 47 percent of new hires came from underrepresented ethnic groups.\n\nWe have a longstanding commitment to fair and equitable pay for all employees doing similar work. In the U.S., our 2022 study found that we had achieved greater than 99 percent pay equity for female and male employees, as well as non-white (including Black, Hispanic and Asian employees) and white employees. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion also extends to our business partners. Last year, we spent $3.2 billion with diverse Tier 1 and 2 suppliers globally.\n\nProtecting the environment\nOur Company has a long history of environmental stewardship, and we believe a healthy planet is essential to improving health and protecting the sustainability of our business. As part of this work, we have committed to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to set a net-zero target for our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across our global operations (Scopes 1, 2, 3).\n\nWe know that each of our research, production and office facilities plays a role in achieving our goals for energy efficiency, waste reduction and overall sustainability. In 2022, we created a Waste Diversion Playbook to help sites contribute to our goals through local waste-diversion strategies, such as composting and recycling, and environmentally responsible procurement practices.\n\nOperating with the highest standards of ethics and values\nWe operate responsibly every day, holding ourselves to the highest standards of ethics and values. Our code of conduct defines our corporate character and helps us protect our reputation as a trustworthy company. We maintain 100 percent compliance to regulatory requirements for active incident monitoring, risk and harm analysis, and timely notification of data breaches. We also encourage employees to speak up and report potential concerns, ensuring our ethics and values are reflected in all we do.\n\nAs a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), Merck remains committed to improving our communities through our operations, aligning our efforts with the Ten Principles of the UNGC.\n\nIn late 2021, we announced the issuance of our first $1 billion sustainability bond to support initiatives and partnerships contributing to the advancement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Through June 2022, we allocated $760 million of the net proceeds toward social and green projects, in alignment with our sustainability financing framework.\n\nWhile my colleagues and I are pleased by our 2022 progress, we remain committed to doing more to advance and protect the health of our employees, communities and planet. Indeed, I want to thank our colleagues and partners for the passion and expertise brought to this work every day. I am honored to work alongside such a talented and dedicated team.\n\nThank you again for your interest in our Company\u2019s progress and performance. We are excited for our future\u2014and the unique opportunity we have to make a difference through our research, our medicines and vaccines, and our enduring commitment to sustainable innovation and value creation.\n\nVery best regards,\n\nRob Davis\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer\nOur Company\n\nAt Merck, known as MSD outside of the U.S. and Canada, we are unified around our purpose: We use the power of leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world.\n\nFor more than 130 years, we have brought hope to humanity through the development of important medicines and vaccines. We aspire to be the premier, research-intensive biopharmaceutical Company in the world\u2014and today, we are at the forefront of research to deliver innovative health solutions that advance the prevention and treatment of diseases in people and animals.\n\nWe strive to foster a diverse and inclusive global workforce and operate responsibly every day to enable a safe, sustainable and healthy future for all people and communities.\n\nHow we operate\n\nWe manage the Company through two operating segments, Pharmaceutical and Animal Health.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical segment includes human health pharmaceutical and vaccine products. Human health pharmaceutical products consist of therapeutic and preventive agents, generally sold by prescription, for the treatment of human disorders.\n\nThe Company sells these products primarily to drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies and managed health care providers such as health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers and other institutions. Human health vaccine products consist of preventive pediatric, adolescent and adult vaccines, which are sold primarily to physicians, wholesalers, physician distributors and government entities.\n\nThe Animal Health segment discovers, develops, manufactures and markets a wide range of veterinary pharmaceutical and vaccine products, as well as health management solutions and services, for the prevention, treatment and control of disease in all major livestock and companion animal species. The Company also offers an extensive suite of digitally connected identification, traceability and monitoring products. Animal Health products are sold to veterinarians, distributors, animal producers, farmers and pet owners.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 69,000 employees worldwide.\n\nMore than 500M people reached with our innovations in 2022.\n\n2022 annual revenue: $59.3B\n\nR&D spend in 2022: $13.5B\nFor more than 130 years, we've been dedicated to operating responsibly and creating value for society. That commitment is one of our ongoing strengths and core to our business, which is why operating responsibly is part of the foundation of our Strategic Framework, denoting our commitment to enable a safe, sustainable and healthy future for people and communities.\n\nWe believe creating greater accountability for our sustainability strategy will help drive financial results and long-term shareholder value. This is why we added new measures to our 2023 Company Scorecard that link the compensation for a majority of our employees, including our executives, to certain key sustainability metrics in the areas of Access to Health and Employees.\n\nOur strategic framework\n\nOur Priorities\n\n- Invest in, augment, and accelerate our pipeline to deliver life-changing products\n- Demonstrate value to our stakeholders and extend access to solutions that address unmet medical needs\n- Drive innovation, growth and productivity enabled by digital and data\n- Invest in the growth, success, and well-being of our people\n\nOur Ways of Working\n\n- Win as one team\n- Focus on what matters\n- Act with urgency\n- Experiment, learn and adapt\n- Embrace diversity and inclusion\n- Speak up and be open-minded\n\nOur Values\n\n- Patients First\n- Ethics and Integrity\n- Respect for People\n- Innovation and Scientific Excellence\n\nWe operate responsibly every day on behalf of society, shareholders and all our stakeholders to enable a safe, sustainable and healthy future for people and communities everywhere.\nOur sustainability focus areas\n\nOver the past year, we challenged ourselves to innovate and make ambitious commitments within each of our focus areas. Through collaborative partnerships and a holistic approach, we\u2019re creating scalable solutions to major global issues.\n\nAccess to Health\n\nIn collaboration with key stakeholders, we work to ensure our science advances health care, and our products are accessible and affordable to those in need.\n\nEmployees\n\nOur Company\u2019s success is built on a culture that embraces different perspectives and values the contributions of each individual. We recognize that our competitiveness is strengthened by a diverse, skilled and engaged workforce.\n\nEnvironmental Sustainability\n\nA healthy planet is essential to human health and the sustainability of our business, while also providing opportunities for product innovation and reducing cost and risk. Our Company has a long history of environmental stewardship and compliance, and we realize that our strategy and efforts need to continuously evolve in the face of a changing climate.\n\nEthics & Values\n\nWe operate with the highest standards of ethics and integrity. By putting our ethics and values at the foundation of everything we do, we create an accountable culture that betters our Company\u2019s decision-making, adaptability and reliability.\n\nTo learn more, see page 14.\n\nTo learn more, see page 23.\n\nTo learn more, see page 27.\n\nTo learn more, see page 30.\nESG materiality assessment\n\nThere are hundreds of ESG topics a company can focus on at any given moment. An ESG materiality assessment is the process through which our Company gathers information about the external landscape, and our internal priorities, in order to fine-tune this larger list down to the most important strategic topics for our Company to address.\n\nUnderstanding and prioritizing the issues that matter most to our business and stakeholders enables us to focus, act and report on them effectively and transparently. Our ESG materiality assessment process helps us to focus on potential business risks and opportunities that influence our ability to create value. It helps us determine where we should be prioritizing our efforts in order to maximize the benefit for our stakeholders, our Company and the world.\n\nTo learn more about our ESG materiality process, please see page 49.\n\nMaterial topics\n\nIn our 2023 ESG materiality assessment, the following topics emerged as the most critical for our Company to address, and are grouped below by our four focus areas:\n\nAccess to Health\n\n- Access to health care and medicine (pages 54-76)\n- Equity and affordability (pages 64-76)\n- Product safety and quality (pages 54-76, 77-82, 148-155, Clinical trials page)\n- Public health risks (pages 54-76)\n\nEmployees\n\n- Employee diversity and inclusion (pages 134-142)\n- Employee health and safety (pages 119-129)\n- Talent management (pages 39, 47-49, 114-142)\n\nEnvironmental Sustainability\n\n- Climate change risks and management (pages 52-53, 88-91, 101-106)\n\nEthics & Values\n\n- Ethical corporate behavior (pages 44-45, 81-82, 154-155, Code of Conduct & Compliance)\n- Privacy and data security (pages 156-157)\nOur priority UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n\nThe SDGs represent the international community\u2019s plan of action for \u201cpeople, planet and prosperity.\u201d The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for the planet and its people. At its core are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nWe believe we have an important role and a responsibility to help reduce the burden of disease and improve access to medicines and vaccines around the world. That is why SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) is at the heart of our business. It also aligns with our purpose to save and improve lives.\n\nWhile every SDG is essential to fostering sustainable development, we have prioritized eight goals where we believe we can have the biggest impact.\n\nA full SDG index can be found on page 171.\nSustainability Goals & Performance\n\nWe are driving sustainability progress by setting ambitious goals across four focus areas that matter most to our Company and create value for our stakeholders:\n\n### Access to Health\n\n| Goal                                                                 | Progress                                                                 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Further advance health equity by reaching 30 million people in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and in U.S. underserved populations with our social investments, by 2025.\u00b2\u00b3 (number of people in millions) | 15.0 18.6 33.6                                                        |\n| Reach at least 75% of countries around the world annually with our products.\u2074 | 79% 76%                                                                  |\n| Enable 100 million more people to access our innovative portfolio globally, through access strategies, solutions and partnerships, by 2025.\u2075 (number of people in millions) | 66.7 189.2                                                               |\n\n### Employees\n\n| Goal                                                                 | Progress                                                                 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Increase representation in senior management roles,\u2076 by 2024:        |                                                                          |\n| Women globally to 40%, up from 31% in 2020.                           | 36% 34%                                                                  |\n| Black/African Americans in the U.S. to 10%, up from 3% in 2020.      | 7% 6%                                                                    |\n| Hispanics/Latinos in the U.S. to 10%, up from 5% in 2020.             | 6% 8%                                                                    |\n| Maintain or exceed our current inclusion index score, by 2025.\u2077       | On track On track                                                       |\n| Maintain or exceed our current employee engagement index score, by 2025.\u2077 | On track On track                                                       |\nEnvironmental Sustainability\n\nGoal\n\nReduce our operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (i.e., Scopes 1 & 2) 46% by 2030, from a 2019 baseline.\\(^8\\)\n\nAchieve carbon neutrality across our operations by 2025 (Scopes 1 & 2 emissions).\\(^8\\)\n\nSource 100% of our purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2025.\\(^9\\)\n\nReduce our value chain (Scope 3) GHG emissions 30% by 2030, from a 2019 baseline.\\(^10\\)\n\nGoal\n\nFoster a \u201cSpeak Up\u201d culture by maintaining or exceeding our current percentage of employees responding favorably to the \u201cWillingness to report\u201d question in the Pulse survey as an annual average.\\(^11,12\\)\n\nMaintain 100% compliance to regulatory requirements for active incident monitoring, risk/harm analysis and on-time notification of data breaches.\\(^13\\)\n\nProgress\n\n| 2021 | 2022 |\n|------|------|\n| 9% reduction | 9% reduction |\n\nIn progress.

We focus on discovering, developing and delivering innovative products and services that improve health and address unmet needs. We actively work in partnership with a range of stakeholders, including multilateral organizations, NGOs, and governments to strengthen health systems, doing our part to ensure care is affordable, efficient and equitable.\n\nOur guiding principles\n\nOur multi-prong, enterprise-wide approach is anchored in our Access to Health Guiding Principles, which are embedded across our Company, with accountability for progress held at leadership levels. These Principles include leading scientific discovery and invention of medicines and vaccines that address unmet need; ensuring availability and affordability of our innovative portfolio; and addressing barriers to health equity. Our Access to Health goals reflect our commitment to deliver on these Principles for all stakeholders.\n\nGoals\n\n- Further advance health equity by reaching 30 million people in LMICs and in U.S. underserved populations with our social investments, by 2025\n- Reach at least 75% of countries around the world annually with our products\n- Enable 100 million more people to access our innovative portfolio globally, through access strategies, solutions and partnerships, by 2025\n\nMore than 500 million people reached with our innovations\n\nIn 2022, we reached more than 500 million people with our innovations across commercial channels, clinical trials, access strategies like our partnership with Gavi and UNICEF, voluntary licensing of antiviral treatments including our investigational antiviral COVID-19 medicine, and medicine and vaccine donations.\nDiscovery and invention\n\nWe build on our legacy of putting patients first by inventing medicines and vaccines to address unmet medical need, including for conditions with high global burden of disease. As part of our R&D strategy, we evaluate our candidates early for their potential to address significant public health concerns in underserved settings, including LMICs.\n\nOur research pipeline, products which we currently market, and our external collaborations seek to address 83 percent of the world\u2019s top health burdens, including some that primarily affect LMICs. For example, our investigational vaccine for dengue fever is currently in a Phase 2 trial. With approximately half of the world\u2019s population, or four billion people, at risk for dengue disease, dengue is a critical public health challenge. Annually, there are an estimated 105 million dengue infections worldwide; on average, 50-60 million of those cause symptoms. We also have a collaboration with Instituto Butantan to share data and learnings from our dengue vaccine programs.\n\nIn addition, we collaborate with academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, government entities and other biopharmaceutical companies, so we can follow the latest science and bring our medicines and vaccines to patients. In 2022, we entered into 97 significant external licenses, collaborations, and acquisitions with a broad range of partners, from early-stage science to clinical-stage programs. These collaborations are deemed \u201csignificant\u201d because they involve an asset or technology with the potential to make an important enhancement to our R&D capabilities or potential portfolio.\n\nCollaborating to fight infectious disease\n\nWe continue our strong legacy of infectious disease research, including for those diseases with greater impact to LMICs like tuberculosis (TB), HIV and malaria.\n\nIn late 2022, Merck entered into a licensing agreement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute for two preclinical candidates with potential in combination regimens for treating TB, one of the top 10 causes of death in LMICs; one of these compounds advanced to a Phase 1 clinical trial earlier this year. Merck scientists discovered the compounds as part of the TB Drug Accelerator, a collaboration among biopharmaceutical companies, research organizations and universities to accelerate new TB therapies, supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nHIV is a global epidemic that disproportionately affects populations in LMICs in sub-Saharan Africa. In fact, two-thirds of the more than 35 million people living with HIV reside in the region, accounting for about 75 percent of HIV-related deaths, globally. Merck continues its more than 35 years of scientific research to address the HIV epidemic. We have a broad R&D program, including a Phase 3 development program for a new once-daily two-drug regimen and a Phase 2 study evaluating an investigational weekly oral combination treatment of our antiviral islatravir and Gilead Sciences\u2019 lenacapavir, part of an agreement with Gilead to study long-acting HIV treatments. In addition, as part of our ongoing partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, we recently began a Phase 1b study to evaluate potential mechanisms for an oral long-acting HIV prevention option.\n\nWe continue to collaborate on new options for malaria, an infection with rising resistance to existing treatments and which remains one of the largest killers of pregnant women and children under the age of five in most resource-poor countries. A new antimalarial drug candidate, discovered through our longstanding collaboration with the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Australia and with funding from the Wellcome Trust, recently entered Phase 1 clinical testing.\nA legacy of bettering human health\n\nWe strive to discover treatments for diseases that affect people across a breadth of countries globally, such as cardiovascular disease. Merck has a long history of developing treatments for cardiovascular disease. More than 60 years ago, we introduced our first cardiovascular therapy and our scientific efforts to understand and treat cardiovascular-related disorders have continued, including with our investigational, once-daily oral proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor in adults with hypercholesterolemia. Merck plans to start a Phase 3 pivotal study of the potential treatment in the second half of 2023.\n\nDid you know?\n\nAnalysis from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation notes a growing global disease burden from chronic issues like high cholesterol.\n\nImportantly, our discoveries often benefit human health over the long term, like the steroid dexamethasone, HIV treatment raltegravir and antihypertensive losartan, all of which remain on the World Health Organization\u2019s Essential Medicines List decades after their discovery.14\n\nOur R&D expenditure\n\nIn 2022, Merck\u2019s R&D spend was $13.5 billion, making us a leader in funding R&D within the biopharmaceutical industry.\n\nReformulating our products for patient benefit\n\nInnovation goes beyond new treatments. With a focus on improving adherence and enhancing the patient experience, we also strive to provide new options that increase the ease of administration. For example, in HIV, we are researching long-acting medications designed to reduce the frequency of administration.\nIncreasing diversity of patients in clinical trials\n\nClinical trials play a critical role in advancing scientific innovations. Our Company is determined to expand access to trials\u2014including through increased diversity. In 2022, we reached more than 85,000 people through our clinical trials in more than 60 countries worldwide.\n\nIt will take a comprehensive approach to increase the diversity of participants in clinical trials, which is why we are tackling a variety of associated factors, many in partnership with other stakeholders.\n\nOur team of clinical trial operations experts implements best practices in our studies globally. For every late-stage trial, we require plans to recruit patients that appropriately reflect the diversity of the people who will ultimately take the medicines we make. We also prioritize placement of study sites in communities with higher populations of individuals who have historically been underrepresented in clinical trials. In 2022, approximately 50 percent of enrollees were from underrepresented groups.\n\nPartnerships are critical to increasing diversity in clinical trials. In 2022, we joined the Novartis-led collaboration Beacon of Hope, a 10-year program that establishes clinical trial Centers of Excellence at four Historically Black Medical Schools to increase diversity among clinical trial investigators and participants. We are also a contributor to sponsorships to connect with, support and train more clinicians from underrepresented groups.\n\nTo ease logistical barriers that make it difficult for some patients to visit clinical trial sites, we\u2019re working with Greenphire, a provider of global financial lifecycle management solutions for clinical trials. The organization\u2019s ClinCard debit card provides direct stipends and travel reimbursement. In addition, we have developed tools to reach study participants within their communities, including through local pharmacies and mobile study sites.\n\nFor more information, please see the Discovery & Invention section in GRI 203 on pages 54-57.\n\nAvailability\n\nAt Merck, we believe scientific innovation fuels long-term value to society. And to make those innovations as impactful as possible, we must also focus on strong commercialization, quality manufacturing, and operational excellence in our global supply distribution, while reducing our environmental impact.\n\nOur goal to reach at least 75 percent of countries in the world annually with our medicines and vaccines demonstrates our commitment to global product availability. In 2022, we surpassed our goal for the second consecutive year, reaching 76 percent of countries around the world with our products.\n\n76%\n\nof countries reached with our products in 2022\n\nMaintaining a global supply network\n\nThrough our manufacturing and supply division, we strive to maintain a reliable global supply network of the highest quality. Our supply chain is designed to operate a lean and efficient network that produces our medicines and vaccines to the highest quality, safety and environmental standards, in full compliance with regulations and current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs), as well as industry best practices.\n\nThrough digitally enabled \u201cend-to-end supply planning,\u201d we are modernizing our manufacturing operations and conducting efficient and balanced planning to maximize business results and deliver medicines and vaccines to customers, when and where they need them. Our facilities, along with our external suppliers and partners, make up an integrated, interdependent global manufacturing network.\nDeveloping new models and business strategies to expand access\n\nFrom digital upgrades to blockchain technology, integrated access planning early in the product development cycle and planning for new manufacturing models, we are evolving systems to ensure broad availability of our medicines and vaccines to better meet patient needs.\n\nManufacture and supply of vaccines\n\nIn the last few years, countries have introduced new or expanded routine vaccination programs, creating unprecedented increases in the global demand for vaccines. To meet this demand, we have increased our capacity and supply capability across our vaccines portfolio and are committed to continuing to do so.\n\nFor more information, please see the Availability section in GRI 203 on pages 58-63.\n\nAffordability\n\nOur purpose to deliver medicines and vaccines to save and improve lives is not fulfilled if our inventions cannot reach the people who most need them. It\u2019s why we are committed to helping shape the health care ecosystem, ensuring people are empowered with the options to pursue high-quality, affordable medicines and vaccines, in a sustainable way.\n\nExceeding and expanding our goal to enable access to our innovative portfolio\n\nIn 2021, we set a goal to use strategies, solutions and partnerships to enable 100 million more people to access our innovative portfolio globally by 2025. In 2022, we were proud to exceed this goal, having enabled access for more than 189 million people. This is why we are taking our goal further, increasing it to 350 million people by 2025.\n\nWe have made more than $2 billion in capital investments over the last five years to help increase supply and extend access to our HPV vaccines.\n\nBased on our 2022 performance, we are increasing our access to health goal: We will enable 350 million more people to access our innovative portfolio through dedicated access strategies, solutions and partnerships, by 2025.\n\n\u201cWe can never rest until a way has been found to bring our finest achievements to everyone.\u201d\n\nGeorge W. Merck\nHow we enable access\n\nTo advance our goal of enabling more people to access our innovative portfolio, we are focusing on building health care capacity, strengthening channels for care delivery and fostering sustainable financing.\n\nIn building health care capacity, we help to create greater efficiency for patients in the health care system through collaborations with hospitals and health care networks. For example, we work with partners using a data-based approach to understand how a patient\u2019s cancer journey can be optimized from earlier diagnosis through to treatment.\n\nWe also collaborate with different financial institutions and payers, supporting them to expand funding options that help patients and their families cope with potentially high out-of-pocket costs caused by critical illness.\n\nThrough collaborations that reach underserved populations, we are working with health care providers and others in the digital health and financial sectors to develop solutions that enhance disease awareness and health care access.\n\nIn addition, we are committed to engaging with global health organizations to improve the resilience of immunization programs and to advance equitable access to our vaccines, especially in LMICs. For example, through our long-term commitment to Gavi and UNICEF, we broaden access to our vaccines to help prevent HPV-related cancers and diseases in Gavi-supported countries by providing them at an accessible price.\n\nBroadening the reach of our COVID-19 treatments\n\nAccess planning is a key part of our research and development process. One example is our global, multi-faceted strategy to facilitate timely and equitable access to our investigational antiviral COVID-19 medicine. This strategy was particularly important in the face of the global COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOur strategy includes advance purchase and supply agreements with more than 40 countries; and voluntary license agreements with Indian generic manufacturers and the Medicines Patent Pool, enabling availability of generic versions of our investigational antiviral COVID-19 medicine to more than 100 LMICs. In addition, we allocated up to three million courses of therapy to UNICEF for LMICs as a \u201cbridge strategy\u201d until the voluntary licensees were able to produce supply.\n\nThanks to this strategy, more than five million courses of our investigational antiviral COVID-19 medicine have been delivered to over 20 LMICs through 2022. In addition, Merck\u2019s direct supply has treated more than four million patients worldwide through 2022.\n\nFor more information, please see the Affordability section in GRI 203 on pages 64-69.\n\nWe committed to provide over 100 million doses of our HPV vaccine for use in Gavi-supported countries through a long-term agreement with UNICEF from 2021-2025.\nA longstanding commitment to product donations\n\nWhen market-based solutions are inadequate or unavailable, we pursue programs to provide direct access to our medicines and vaccines, including through product donations. One donation program we\u2019re particularly proud of is our longstanding MECTIZAN Donation Program (MDP). For more than 35 years, the MDP has donated our medicine MECTIZAN for the treatment of onchocerciasis (known as river blindness) and, for more than 25 years, also for the treatment of lymphatic filariasis. MDP is the longest-running disease-specific drug donation program and partnership of its kind and is widely regarded as one of the most successful public-private health collaborations in the world.\n\nIn 2022, we reached approximately 359 million people with our MECTIZAN donations\n\nOur Merck Medical Outreach Program (MMOP) is the primary way we donate our medicines and vaccines for global disaster relief and humanitarian assistance in LMICs. In 2022, we reached more than 118,000 people through the MMOP.\n\nFor more information on our product donations, please see GRI 203 on pages 69-72 for more information.\nHealth systems strengthening and addressing health equity\n\nTo save and improve lives with our medicines and vaccines, we recognize we have a role to play to help advance global health, and to reduce barriers for underserved populations so that all patients have access to high-quality health care. Our focus on health equity aligns to our deepest-held Company values.\n\nIn 2022, we invested $38 million in social investments to address health equity. Our social investments help advance health equity around the world by addressing the barriers that many individuals face in seeking and receiving high-quality health care. We provide support in several ways, including through key initiatives like Merck for Mothers, health equity initiatives, and our impact investments. Our Foundation is funded entirely by our Company and is our chief source of financial support for qualified, eligible nonprofit organizations whose programs align with our philanthropic priorities.\n\nIn 2021, we set a goal to reach 30 million people with social investments for health equity in LMICs and underserved populations in the U.S. Through 2022, we exceeded this goal, reaching more than 33 million people, including more than 18 million in 2022 alone.\n\nTo drive continued action, we have increased this health equity goal to now reach 50 million people by 2025. We\u2019re now including underserved populations in high-income countries beyond the U.S. in this goal as our health equity investments evolve to meet the needs of underserved populations everywhere.\n\nMaking pregnancy and childbirth safer\n\nMaternal health outcomes can serve to shine a light on the strength of a health system. In many countries, inequitable maternal health outcomes persist despite having preventable causes. Merck for Mothers is our $650 million global initiative to create a world where no woman has to die while giving life. For more than a decade, the program has brought Merck\u2019s scientific and business expertise to help make maternal health outcomes more equitable and pregnancy and childbirth safer.\n\nFor more information, please visit the Merck for Mothers website.\n\nBased on our 2022 performance, we are increasing our health equity goal: By 2025, we aim to reach 50 million people in LMICs and underserved populations in high-income countries with our social investments.\nAddressing cancer care disparities\n\nOur social investments support multiple programs and partnerships to advance more equitable cancer treatment. In the U.S., we have supported the American Cancer Society\u2019s Get Screened Initiative aimed at reducing disparities in cancer screening. These disparities have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, through the CEO Roundtable on Cancer, we support Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic-Serving Institutions in improving health equity, education, and access in communities disproportionately affected by cancer.\n\nIn addition, through a nearly $2 million grant from our Foundation, we support the American Cancer Society in establishing patient navigation programs in resource-limited settings in sub-Saharan Africa. The output includes a toolkit that can help other countries adopt similar programs.\n\nInvesting for impact\n\nAnother way we advance health equity is through impact investments, which deploy financial resources to generate improved health care access\u2014all while growing a sustainable global health ecosystem and attracting additional capital and partners. For example, we invest in Mamotest, a company in Latin America providing AI-enabled telediagnosis for breast cancer.\n\nLearn more about our impact investments on our corporate site, as well as in GRI 201-1 on page 51.\n\nHarnessing the power of our employees\n\nIn 2022, we launched a $1 million Health Equity Catalyst Fund for employees to empower our teams to develop solutions that promote equitable health outcomes, particularly for underserved populations. The fund currently supports 15 community-level efforts, initiated by employees, in 13 countries. In addition to funding opportunities, we are working across the enterprise to better apply social determinants of health information to business strategies, and track our progress in reducing barriers to access. These efforts serve as a mechanism to engage our employees in innovative thinking that reduces inequities, advances our goals and extends our corporate purpose to save and improve lives.\n\nFor more information, please see the Strengthening health systems and addressing inequity section on pages 73-76.\nFocus area: Employees\n\nOur best-in-class talent share in our purpose to save and improve lives. To hire and retain the best people\u2014those who will invent and deliver medicines and vaccines that change the world\u2014we must be an employer of choice.\n\nFostering a culture that is inclusive and supportive is fundamental to our talent strategy. Our longstanding commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion is based on our belief that unique, passionate perspectives are critical to innovation and in turn, provide a competitive advantage for our Company. We also foster a positive working environment by providing resources designed to improve the well-being of our employees and their families.\n\nIn addition to supporting our talent strategy, we recognize that our culture plays a fundamental role in fulfilling our Company\u2019s purpose. In 2023, we introduced sustainability metrics tied to our Access to Health and Employees focus areas in our Company Scorecard, which include indicators of the overall employee experience.\n\nProgress toward our goals\n\nWe remain on target with our employee-focused goals, including our aim to meet or exceed our inclusion score and our employee engagement index score by 2025. We have demonstrated progress against our baseline diversity measures. We\u2019re delivering on our commitments overall, as well as addressing annual fluctuations in senior management (vice president/senior vice president) representation to ensure we\u2019re well-positioned to meet our multi-year targets.\n\nAlong the way, we are building a strong pipeline of talent: globally, 52 percent of new hires in 2022 were women and in the U.S., 47 percent were members of underrepresented groups. We aid our employees\u2019 growth through broad leadership development programs as well as through affinity-based initiatives that consider our colleagues\u2019 unique backgrounds.\n\nAttracting and retaining the best talent\n\nOne of the primary ways we attract and retain the best talent is through training and development. By investing in our employees, we also invest in their ability to deliver innovative medicines and vaccines for patients.\n\nOur leadership development programs cut across all levels, divisions and geographies of the Company. Some focus on business acumen, others on creating positive change. For example, our General Management Acceleration Program is an application-based, early-talent development initiative that grows participants\u2019 business and financial acumen as well as their critical thinking abilities.\n\nOur affinity-based development programs for female, LGBTQ+, Hispanic/Latino, and Black colleagues build a sense of community and aim to increase the number of diverse leaders ready to progress in their careers while furthering leadership capabilities and business acumen.\n\nGoals\n\n- Increase representation in senior management roles, by 2024:\n  - Women globally to 40%, up from 31% in 2020\n  - Black/African Americans in the U.S. to 10%, up from 3% in 2020\n  - Hispanics/Latinos in the U.S. to 10%, up from 5% in 2020\n- Maintain or exceed our current inclusion index score, by 2025\n- Maintain or exceed our current employee engagement index score, by 2025\nDiversity, equity and inclusion at the center\n\nEnhancing diversity in Merck\u2019s employee population better our understanding of our customers, promotes the inclusion of diverse populations in our clinical trials, and encourages the innovation that drives our business. Put simply, diversity and inclusion is a business imperative.\n\nOur enterprise-wide Global Diversity & Inclusion (GD&I) strategy focuses on the following:\n\n**Our People**\nStrengthen the foundational elements of diversity\n\n**Our Culture**\nEnsure accountability to drive an inclusive culture\n\n**Our Business**\nContinue to leverage diversity and inclusion to ensure business value\n\n**Our World**\nTransform the environment, culture and business landscape\n\nOur GD&I strategy also supports the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to advance gender equality, provide fulfilling work and economic growth, reduce inequalities within and among countries, and strengthen our global partnerships.\n\nOur enterprise-wide strategy demonstrates our commitment to diversity and inclusion as a business priority. It is endorsed at the highest levels of the organization, including by the CEO and Executive Team. Our Board of Directors also has a diversity policy.\n\nWe also have collaborative, cross-functional teams who integrate diversity and inclusion (D&I) capabilities into our operations, and employees are encouraged to link their annual priorities to D&I.\n\nThe power of our employees\n\nOur 10 Employee Business Resource Groups (EBRGs) include almost 20,000 members. For more than 50 years, we have built communities within our Company that foster retention, facilitate growth, provide mentorship and strengthen networks. They also make direct contributions to our business strategy with culturally relevant insights that drive our success and improve our decision-making.\n\nPay equity\n\nWe have had a longstanding commitment to fair and equitable pay for all employees doing similar work. In 2022, our pay equity study achieved nearly worldwide coverage, encompassing approximately 90 percent of our global employee population, or nearly 60,000 employees. In the U.S., our study showed that we have achieved greater than 99 percent pay equity for female and male employees, and that we have achieved greater than 99 percent pay equity for non-white (including Black, Hispanic and Asian employees) and white employees.\n\nRead more about our efforts toward pay equity in GRI 405 on page 134.\n\nDid you know?\n\nIn 2021, we created a global digital accessibility policy to ensure equal access across our digital landscape, for stakeholders both internally and externally. In 2022, we strengthened our support for digital accessibility with a five-year roadmap to ensure we have a universal design standard for our facilities around the world. These guidelines reflect designing for accessibility, usability and inclusion, and go beyond the Americans with Disabilities Act.\nBuilding a pipeline of diverse talent\n\nSkills-first is a paradigm shift happening throughout our Company in how we attract, develop and advance talent. For appropriate roles, the new approach increases the focus on skills instead of a four-year degree, creating equitable access to meaningful career opportunities for diverse candidates.\n\nIn 2022, our Company posted approximately 900 roles without a four-year degree requirement. That\u2019s twice as many as the year before. Key partners in our efforts include:\n\n- OneTen, a coalition of leading companies helping to close the opportunity gap for Black talent in the U.S.\n- Year Up, a nonprofit that offers economically disadvantaged youth six months of training followed by a six-month corporate internship\n\nOur Company was proud to host approximately 90 Year Up interns in 2022, with plans to expand the partnership further for 2023. We also launched our debut Skills-First apprenticeship program with over 30 apprentices in digital marketing, data analytics and information technology.\n\nValuing the well-being of our employees\n\nAs an innovation-based company, the expertise and engagement of our employees is critical to our business. We cannot be successful unless we prioritize employees\u2019 health, well-being and safety. We provide benefits covering employees\u2019 physical and mental health, including a wide range of programs, resources, and tools to help them make healthy choices and live better lives.\n\nWe conduct our Employee Pulse surveys multiple times a year to measure colleagues\u2019 perception on inclusion and other critical workforce issues.\n\nSee our Well-being Report on our corporate website for more on our commitment.\nDedicated to a safe and healthy workplace\n\nWe are focused on providing a safe and healthy workplace. All employees, service providers and Company-managed contractors must follow our safety standards. In addition, we have comprehensive programs focused on reducing risks, work-related injuries and illnesses, and other safety incidents. Our active Employee Safety Committees are an example of how we engage employees in these efforts and partner to proactively maintain a safe and healthy working environment.\n\nFor more information on safety, please see GRI 403 on pages 119-129.\n\nRecognition as a great place to work\n\nWe are proud of the many external awards that recognize our Company as a great place to work, both for employees generally and for specific affinity groups. In 2022, we were recognized as a great place to work for LGBTQ+ employees, women, veterans and Latinos, among others.\n\nExtending our diversity commitment to suppliers\n\nWe are proud to be a leader in supplier diversity, in both their hiring and development.\n\nIn 2022, our spend with minority-, women-, veteran-, LGBTQ+- and disability-owned business enterprises represented 14 percent of our total procurement spend.\n\nWe actively support the small and diverse businesses we work with. Our Advanced Leadership Program for Diverse Suppliers provides development opportunities for business owners of diverse backgrounds with a focus on leadership skills and business acumen. In 2022, we had 15 diverse suppliers graduate from the second cohort of the program.\n\nIn addition to ensuring we have diversity among our suppliers, we also monitor our large Tier 1 suppliers to make certain they, in turn, use diverse suppliers, extending our community impact. In 2022, 21 Tier 1 suppliers participated in our Second Tier program, generating an impact of over $258 million through their inclusion and utilization of diverse suppliers for direct purchases on behalf of our Company.\n\n$3.2 billion\n\nin spending with diverse Tier 1 and 2 suppliers globally\nOur purpose to save and improve lives is inextricably linked to fostering a healthy planet. It\u2019s why our commitment to enabling a safe, sustainable and healthy future is embedded within our strategic framework. And it\u2019s why we continuously build on our long history of environmental stewardship and compliance, evolving our efforts in the face of a changing world.\n\nOur environmental strategy and commitments\n\nOur environmental sustainability strategy has three focus areas:\n\n\u2022 Driving operational efficiency\n\u2022 Designing new products to minimize environmental impact\n\u2022 Reducing any impacts in our upstream and downstream value chain\n\nOur approach to climate change\n\nScientific data supports that climate change is occurring, and we are taking action to reduce the economic and public health risks associated with a changing climate.\n\nWe have adopted a set of climate goals to help position our Company to succeed in an increasingly resource-constrained world. These goals were developed to align with the latest climate science and address the rising expectations of our customers, investors, external stakeholders and employees regarding the environmental impact of our operations and supply chain.\n\nOur Company has also committed to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to set a net-zero target for our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across our global operations (Scopes 1, 2, 3).\n\nEnvironmental, Health and Safety (EHS) governance\n\nWe ensure our ongoing commitment to these areas through thoughtful governance. Our Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Council is a cross-functional body with leadership representation from each area of our business. As sponsors to our sustainability strategy, policy and business risk mitigation controls, the Council monitors performance on our targets, while also increasing visibility and transparency internally to the business, Executive Team and the Board of Directors.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the Environmental Health and Safety Management and Governance document located on the Sustainability Resources page on our corporate website.\n\nGoals\n\n\u2022 Reduce our operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (i.e., Scopes 1 & 2) 46% by 2030, from a 2019 baseline\n\n\u2022 Achieve carbon neutrality across our operations by 2025 (Scopes 1 & 2 emissions)\n\n\u2022 Source 100% of our purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2025\n\n\u2022 Reduce our value chain (Scope 3) GHG emissions 30% by 2030, from a 2019 baseline\nRealizing the benefits of green chemistry\n\nMeeting our environmental sustainability goals is intrinsically linked to the creation of innovative, cost-efficient manufacturing processes with low environmental impact. We see transformative science/engineering and innovation as critical enablers to developing sustainable, low-cost manufacturing processes that provide environmental and economic benefits over the life cycle of our products.\n\nOur aim is to develop the most efficient and sustainable processes at product launch, with the goal of minimizing material use and waste from our commercial manufacturing. Our Company utilizes an innovative \u201cgreen-by-design\u201d development strategy to progress from an initial early clinical supply route to a fully optimized and sustainable commercial manufacturing process.\n\nPlaybooks for a sustainable environment\n\nOur local sites are crucial to achieving our ambitious environmental sustainability goals, and we continue to launch tools to assist them, particularly for our climate and waste targets.\n\nIn 2021, we launched our Low Carbon Transition Playbook (LCTP), a common platform that includes a gap assessment to help our global sites evaluate the maturity of their energy programs and help create short- and long-term plans to reduce sites\u2019 carbon intensity and build toward a low-carbon future. Based on learnings from use, LCTP 2.0 was issued in 2022 with a capability to facilitate knowledge sharing across sites.\n\nThanks to the success of the LCTP, we took a similar approach for waste diversion. In 2022, we created the Waste Diversion Playbook to guide sites on developing a roadmap to our shared 2025 goals, including local waste-diversion strategies and environmentally responsible procurement practices.\n\nThese tools aid in the reporting and tracking of projects that support achievements towards meeting our corporate targets.\n\nFor the third year in a row, we were proud recipients of the Peter J. Dunn Award for Green Chemistry and Engineering Impact, an award given by the American Chemical Society in recognition of outstanding implementation of novel green chemistry in the pharmaceutical industry. The team earning this 2022 award reduced an 11-step synthesis for a product to just two steps, replacing toxic solvents with biorenewable ones.\n\nDid you know?\n\nSince the establishment of the Green Chemistry Challenge Awards by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the American Chemistry Society (ACS) in 1996, we have been recognized with nine Green Chemistry Awards for innovative process improvements, with six of those consecutively since 2017.\nWaste diversion\n\nWe continuously evaluate our sites\u2019 waste disposal methods to gain a better understanding of our network and changes therein, as well as to identify risks and opportunities in our value chain. Based on our evaluation, we implemented programs resulting in diversion of 60 percent of landfill waste from our highest landfill-generating sites.\n\nWe are currently meeting our 2025 public waste diversion goal with 16 percent of total operational waste being sent to landfill or incineration without energy recovery, and we will continue to strive to improve our waste minimization, recycling and diversion efforts.\n\nWater as a shared resource\n\nAccess to clean water is critical for human health. As water is a key input to our manufacturing operations, we assess water risk throughout our network as a standard business practice. Both of our priority water-stress risk sites have conservation plans in place and are actively working on water use reduction and recycling improvement projects.\n\nIn 2022, we achieved a 17 percent reduction in our water use compared to our 2015 baseline. This reduction is consistent with our ongoing commitment to achieving our stated target: by 2025, we will maintain global water use at or below 2015 levels. Our sites are employing various technologies and techniques aimed at reducing our water footprint and improving operational performance.\n\nOur continued endorsement of the UN CEO Water Mandate enables continued alignment of our water program with its principles directly in our operations. We continued to identify partnerships that will help us advance our water stewardship priorities in the areas in which we operate.\nOur stakeholders trust us to do the right thing, and it is imperative we uphold that trust. That means operating responsibly to enable a safe, sustainable and healthy future for people and communities everywhere, and to always put patients first. Our strong commitment to ethics and integrity is the bedrock of our Company and enables us to fulfill our purpose.\n\nOur policies and procedures reinforce that commitment, from how we conduct research and development, to the management of our supply chain, to available and affordable products.\n\nIn addition, our workforce is united by four key values that represent who we are and how we work together as a Company:\n\n- Patients first\n- Respect for people\n- Ethics and integrity\n- Innovation and scientific excellence\n\nFostering a Speak Up culture\n\nOur Company communicates regularly with employees to encourage a speak-up culture and to ensure they understand how to report potential concerns.\n\nWe invest in Our Code of Conduct\u2014available in 21 languages\u2014which outlines our ethical expectations for employees and for our Company. Our Office of Ethics ensures employees understand the Code of Conduct, Our Values and Standards, and corporate policies that address our ethics and compliance. Our Business Partner Code of Conduct reflects similar and consistent principles for our business partners.\n\nThe Office of Ethics oversees our global Speak Up program and the third-party MSDethics.com tool for reporting ethics concerns 24/7. Employees and suppliers can anonymously (where permitted by law) raise concerns or ask questions at MSDethics.com. The reporting tool is available via phone or online, and in employees\u2019 preferred languages.\n\nGoals\n\n- Foster a \u201cSpeak Up\u201d culture by maintaining or exceeding our current percentage of employees responding favorably to the \u201cWillingness to report\u201d question in the Pulse survey as an annual average\\(^1\\),\\(^2\\)\n- Maintain 100% compliance to regulatory requirements for active incident monitoring, risk/harm analysis and on-time notification of data breaches\\(^3\\)\nSustaining trust within our teams\n\nIn 2019, we introduced an industry-leading program to build trust between employees and management and to promote our speak-up culture through the use of listening circles facilitated by regional ethics officers. Today, the Ethics and Integrity Culture Building Assessment and Listening Program continues to empower employees to share their views on the Company\u2019s speak-up culture. Managers gain perspective on the strengths and opportunities for their teams\u2019 cultures, and action plans help to address what\u2019s learned.\n\nIn 2022, the program was rolled out in two markets, Japan and Brazil. It is expanding to additional markets in 2023 as we continue to invest in our ethical culture and our people.\n\nOur commitment to human rights\n\nOur respect for human rights extends to our suppliers, all of whom must follow our Business Partner Code of Conduct. We are also committed to the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI) Principles. In addition, to manage potential risks associated with third-party business relationships, our Global Supplier Management Group (GSMG) uses a third-party risk management committee and program to evaluate risks for Labor and Human Rights (LHR) in our supply chain. Our sourcing professionals also receive appropriate training on evaluating partners for these risks.\n\nWe investigate any concerns quickly, and regularly conduct due diligence on our suppliers, including audits to verify they uphold LHR standards. Where we find issues, they are held accountable for addressing them. We also ask suppliers to support initiatives like the PSCI Human Rights.\n\nLearn more about our approach to human rights in GRI 412 on pages 143-144.\n\nLearn more about our approach to a more ethical supply chain in GRI 414 on pages 145-147.\n\nRecognition for our transparency\n\nThe Company\u2019s integrity extends to our political giving, where we carefully make bipartisan contributions on a case-by-case basis in support of policies that enhance innovation and patient access to health care.\n\nFor the last six years, the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School\u2019s Center for Political Accountability at the Zicklin Center for Business Ethics and Research has named us a \u201cTrendsetter\u201d in their annual CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability report, demonstrating our commitment to transparency around our political giving.\n\nAll of our contributions can be found on the Transparency Disclosures page of our corporate website.\nReferences\n\n1 This people reached metric estimates the number of people who have received a Merck & Co., Inc. product through commercial, clinical trials, voluntary licensing and donations channels. Donations include people reached with products through the MECTIZAN Donation Program, U.S. Patient Assistance Programs, and the Merck Medical Outreach Program. Sources of data are Merck & Co., Inc. and third-party data sets that are tracked within an enterprise-wide internal database. The people reached metric for all sources is calculated as doses sold divided by the average dose schedule for a given market in a given year. People taking multiple products may be counted as multiple people towards the total estimate. In some instances, this estimate may include people enabled to access our products through access strategies, solutions and partnerships, which are calculated as part of our goal to enable access to our innovative portfolio (page 10). The people reached metric does not include people reached through social investments, which are calculated as part of our goal to further advance health equity for underserved populations (page 10).\n\n2 Social investments include our Company\u2019s philanthropic partnerships, programs and impact investments. Underserved populations are defined as those that face health disparities due to disadvantages related to insurance status, social determinants of health, race, ethnicity, gender identity/sexual orientation, age and/or language preference. The goal is cumulative across the reporting period of 2021-2025, and is independent of a baseline period.\n\n3 Third-party reporting is used to calculate the number of people reached through our social investments. In some cases, third-party reports may include cumulative people reached for the reporting period, and/or data that is attributable to other partners as well as our Company\u2019s philanthropic investment.\n\n4 Countries are as defined by the World Bank Country and Lending Groups. Includes only human health products.\n\n5 Metrics contributing to this goal are displayed on an annual basis and provide information on the number of people who now have the option to access medicines and vaccines as a result of our sustainable access strategies, solutions and partnerships, including our commitment to Gavi and UNICEF (rather than doses shipped), collaborations to optimize resources in health systems, expanded financial coverage through insurance, and new community-based channel partnerships in LMICs. \u201cInnovative portfolio\u201d of products refers to our Company\u2019s on-patent products. \u201cEnable more people\u201d is defined as implemented and launched in market and will be in comparison to the baseline (2020) as of 2025. Evidence for metrics are sourced from the best publicly available data and proxy sources by market. While proxies differ by market, all methodologies are evaluated and represent the best estimate of people enabled to access our innovative portfolio through access strategies, solutions and partnerships (see page 19 for additional information). People who were enabled to access innovative medicines and vaccines did not necessarily receive such innovative medicines and vaccines.\n\n6 \u201cSenior management roles\u201d are defined as individuals holding either vice president or senior vice president titles.\n\n7 In 2022, we revised employee survey measurements to align with evolving best practices. In this report, 2022 data is used as the baseline for future comparison.\n\n8 Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are direct emissions from owned or controlled sources such as on-site fuel combustion and fleet vehicles. Scope 2 GHG emissions are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy consumed by the reporting company.\n\n9 We have defined \u201cpurchased electricity\u201d as electricity sourced from external suppliers as well as renewable electricity that was generated and utilized onsite where we retained the renewable attributes or where we have obtained renewable attributes through contract.\n\n10 Scope 3 GHG emissions include all other indirect emissions in a company\u2019s value chain.\n\n11 Favorable response indicates the percentage of respondents who respond \u201cyes\u201d to the question stating, \u201cI am willing to report employee misconduct and potential ethics or compliance issues.\u201d\n\n12 In 2021, we developed the \u201cWillingness to Report\u201d question referenced in footnote 11 to align with evolving best practices. This question was first included in the Pulse survey in March 2022, and 2022 data will be used as the baseline for future comparison.\n\n13 Regulatory requirements differ by region.\n\n14 Products we no longer market are not included in the total number of Global Burdens of Disease we seek to address through our pipeline and products.\nGRI/SASB disclosures\nWe are a global health care company that delivers innovative health solutions through our prescription medicines, including biologic therapies, vaccines and animal health products.

The limited assurance engagement was performed in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements ISAE 3000. We did not obtain external verification for this Impact Report in its entirety.\n\nGRI 2-6  Activities, value chain and other business relationships\n\nOur Company is committed to the highest ethical standards to help maximize the long-term sustainability of our business, and of the communities in which we operate. We strive to conduct business with third parties that share our commitment to high ethical standards and operate in a responsible and ethical manner. The term \u201cthird party\u201d is broadly interpreted to include any individual or entity that provides any type of goods or services in support of our sourcing initiatives.\n\nWe expect all third parties with whom we engage to comply with all applicable regulations, as well as share in our commitment to the principles outlined in our Business Partner Code of Conduct.\n\nWe manufacture, package and distribute products to many markets around the world. We have established business relationships with thousands of suppliers, including direct suppliers (including external manufacturing providers), capital expenditure suppliers, indirect suppliers and research providers. Our direct suppliers provide us with goods such as packaging, components and ingredients. Capital expenditure suppliers provide goods and services such as engineering and construction. Our indirect suppliers include those that provide services such as logistics, travel and meetings, facility management, and marketing. Our research providers include lab supplies and other research and development-related services.\nThird-Party Risk Management team\n\nTo help manage and address potential areas of risk associated with third-party business relationships, we have an established Third-Party Risk Management program and committee chaired by the senior vice president for Global Procurement. The committee establishes, implements and monitors environmentally sustainable, socially responsible and ethical sourcing practices to ensure that performance is aligned with our purpose. In 2022, cross-functional leaders sponsored an enterprise-wide program to streamline our third-party due-diligence process, leveraging one IT platform to launch assessments, and to review and mitigate risks from Compliance, Global Safety and the Environment, Information Technology Risk Management & Security, Pharmacovigilance and Global Security.\n\nSupplier selection and setting expectations\n\nWe select suppliers that share our commitment to our values and principles. We expect appropriate standards of conduct and respect for human rights from our suppliers, contractors, vendors and external partners, consistent with our own. We use our Business Partner Code of Conduct to communicate our expectations for Human Rights, Labor & Employment, Health, Safety & Environment, and Ethical Business Practices. Our Business Partner Code of Conduct, along with our Supplier Performance Expectations, are communicated to existing and potential third parties. They are included in requests for information, proposals and quotes, as well as in our purchase order terms and conditions. We make our Business Partner Code of Conduct available in 26 languages.\n\nOur Business Partner Code of Conduct references the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI) Principles for Responsible Supply Chain Management (the Principles). PSCI is a group of more than 50 pharmaceutical and health care companies which promotes sustainable sourcing and better business conditions across the industry, and the Principles set the standard for human rights, ethics, labor, health and safety, environment and related management systems. We are an active member of PSCI. The member companies share a vision of better social, health, safety and environmental outcomes in the communities where we buy.\n\nOur approach to sustainable sourcing\n\nWe have a sourcing management process in which environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and economic inclusion and supplier diversity principles are integrated in each stage. Throughout the supplier life cycle, our Company establishes expectations, assesses risk, supports supplier development and manages performance.\n\nOur Global Supplier Management Group (GSMG) is responsible for driving our Sustainable Sourcing program and maintaining the associated standards and processes by which suppliers are identified, qualified and managed.\n\nOur Sustainable Sourcing program has the following key elements:\n\n- Integration into our Global Sourcing & Procurement Strategy and processes\n- A cross-functional team that oversees program development and the processes and guidelines to encourage best practices, prevent violations of supply chain standards and limit risk\n- Established sustainability requirements that are communicated to our suppliers and included in supplier selection\n- Review, tracking and communication of supplier sustainability programs\n- Collaboration as we educate and learn from our supply chain, peer companies and best-in-class organizations\nSupplier due diligence assessments\n\nWe have a defined risk-management process, and our supply base is measured against the process criteria. Using a risk-based approach, supplier assessments and audits are conducted based on multiple factors (e.g., risk profile, engagement and activity type, geography). The assessments and audits evaluate a supplier\u2019s ability to meet both industry and our own standards for quality, safety and ethical business practices. Results are reviewed with senior management across the Company.\n\nOur due diligence includes:\n\n- Anti-bribery and corruption\n- Conflict minerals\n- Denied-party screening\n- Ethics and compliance\n- Financial solvency\n- Information security and cybersecurity\n- Intellectual property\n- Labor and human rights\n- Privacy (data protection)\n- Supply-chain security\n\nWhere assessments and audits identify deficiencies or opportunities for improvement, we monitor suppliers to ensure that our concerns are addressed in a responsible and compliant manner. As part of our oversight and monitoring, we have established mechanisms to report, track and monitor supplier plans to address nonconformance and help drive continued improvement. Additional review(s) are performed for external manufacturing suppliers and suppliers that manage personal and private information.\n\nProtecting the privacy of personal information\n\nSome of our suppliers, such as contract research organizations, market research agencies, information technology systems developers, corporate card suppliers, and travel and meeting agencies process personal information in connection with their performance of services for our Company. We require these suppliers to provide appropriate privacy protection for personal information that they handle in accordance with our privacy policies and applicable privacy laws, regulations and guidelines.\n\nSee more about our privacy program in GRI 418 on page 156.\n\nTraining\n\nWe understand the importance of training, and continue to develop numerous training events that are assigned to employees and provided to industry peers and suppliers. Most of our internal classes are assigned through our centralized learning system. In addition to providing training through our internal systems, we also work with PSCI to develop and provide training to our suppliers and peers.\n\nAdditional details regarding our supplier-focused programs can be found in GRI 204 on page 77, GRI 308 on page 112 and GRI 414 on page 145.\n\nAssessing the effectiveness of our program\n\nDuring 2022, we reviewed the following metrics to help us assess the effectiveness of our efforts in our business and supply chain. We use these measures to monitor our performance and identify opportunities to help improve our programs.\n### Supply chain\n\n|                                      | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|--------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Employees trained on updated Business Partner Code of Conduct (Edition II)\\(^1\\) | 148  | 190  | 183  | 137  | 173  |\n| Employees trained on Third-Party Risk Management\\(^1,2\\) | N/A  | N/A  | 185  | 997  | 126  |\n| Supplier Self-Assessments\\(^3\\)     | 595  | 706  | 547  | 127  | 103  |\n| Supplier Labor and Human Rights (LHR) audits conducted\\(^4\\) | 104  | 39   | 47   | 10   | 12   |\n| Supplier Labor and Human Rights (LHR) audit Corrective Actions and Preventive Actions (CAPA) closed\\(^5\\) | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 52%  |\n| Supplier personnel trained in ESG\\(^6\\) | N/A  | N/A  | 1,492| 1,856| 2,471|\n\nN/A: Not available.\n\n\\(^1\\) Primary target: Procurement and business development staff with responsibility for supplier management.\n\n\\(^2\\) Formal training was created and rolled out in late 2020 and is provided to all new relevant hires going forward.

This group of cross-functional senior leaders recommends positions for decision to the Executive Team on critical public policy and sustainability issues, and monitors related performance across regions and functions and resources allocated to meet goals and objectives.\n\nESG Strategy Management Team (ESMT)\n\nWith guidance from the PEC, the ESMT advises, shapes and drives the Company\u2019s long-term sustainability strategy, including providing recommendations regarding risks and opportunities to the Company. The role of ESMT is to create long-term value, differentiate our Company as a leader in sustainability, and answer to stakeholder demands about key issues across our four focus areas: Access to Health, Employees, Environmental Sustainability, and Ethics & Values. The ESMT works to ensure that our sustainability strategy and priorities are aligned with and support our corporate strategic framework, in order to meet the Company\u2019s public commitments and expectations of our stakeholders.\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nOur 2023 proxy statement (pages 8-14, 18-26, 32-39, and 112) includes information on our Board nomination process and the Board\u2019s roles and responsibilities for the management of and reporting on sustainability topics at the Company.\n\nWe are committed to governance policies and practices that serve the interests of the Company and its shareholders. Our governance structure is an integral part of this commitment. Our Executive Team (ET) and senior management are responsible for reviewing, refining and implementing our Company\u2019s long-term sustainability strategy. Through groups such as the Policy and ESG Council, senior leaders from across the Company direct the day-to-day supervision of our efforts supporting this strategy.\n\nOur ET updates the Board on our long-term sustainability strategy and performance as part of the Board\u2019s annual strategic planning meeting. Discussions and updates also occur at the Board and its Committees on specific topics. For example, the Board\u2019s Governance Committee, which monitors and assists the Board in its oversight of sustainability matters, ensures that relevant issues are subject to review by Board committees with relevant areas of competency.\nESG Strategy & Engagement Team\n\nThe team is responsible for raising the visibility of sustainability issues and activities across the Company, and fostering connections across business units and functional areas to assist with the integration of sustainability principles into business policies, strategies and practices.

Conservative assumptions are made when data is limited, and safety factors are added to address uncertainty and variability in our assessments. This type of approach is particularly relevant to our work in toxicology, industrial hygiene, biosafety and environmental protection.\n\nEmployees are encouraged, prepared and empowered to raise their concerns to their management, Human Resources, Legal, Compliance or the Office of Ethics.\n\nThe Office of Ethics maintains a global Speak Up program and the MSDethics.com reporting tool. The reporting tool is operated by an independent third party and is available 24/7. MSDethics.com allows employees and suppliers to raise concerns or ask questions confidentially and anonymously (where permitted by law) in their preferred language via phone or online. The Company communicates regularly with employees to encourage and foster a Speak Up culture and ensure that they understand how they can report potential misconduct or concerns.\n\nIn alignment with our priority to protect and enhance our Company\u2019s reputation through safe, ethical and compliant behaviors, and to foster a strong culture of ethics and compliance, regional ethics officers manage a network of site-based volunteer ethics ambassadors outside of the U.S. These ethics ambassadors are trained to answer employee questions about the Company\u2019s reporting and investigation process and actively support the Speak Up program. We maintain a fulsome process for escalation and investigation of potential compliance-related concerns. The process is designed to ensure that we promptly and discreetly investigate all reports of conduct and/or behavior that could violate our policies, values or standards.\n\nIf allegations of misconduct are substantiated, appropriate remediation and disciplinary actions are taken to ensure that those who were responsible are held accountable and recurrence is prevented. Disciplinary actions can include, but are not limited to, dismissal from the Company, issuance of final written warning letters and/or financial penalties. In addition, we take appropriate steps to address any needed improvements in organizational and process controls.\n\n| Code of Conduct | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|-----------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Employees trained on the Ethics & Compliance training series | 99%  | 99%  | >99% | >99% | >99% |\nSubject to local law, the Company also has the discretion to reduce incentive payments made to employees in certain instances of misconduct. This may apply when employees engage in misconduct that results in a material policy violation. Retaliation against employees who report concerns is a violation of corporate policy and is strictly prohibited.\n\nThe Office of Ethics and the Office of General Counsel are responsible for overseeing investigations into potential ethics and compliance concerns to ensure consistent and timely resolution of potential concerns and implementation of remediation actions.\n\nPlease visit our corporate website for more information on our Code of Conduct.\n\nEthics & Integrity Culture-Building Assessments & Listening Program\n\nAs an example of an industry-leading best practice, our Company developed the Ethics and Integrity Culture-Building Assessment and Listening Program which aims to build and sustain trust between employees and management and to promote and enhance our Speak Up culture.\n\nIn 2022, we brought the program to two markets: Japan, across all divisions; and Brazil, where we focused on an Animal Health manufacturing plant. In both markets, our regional ethics officers partnered with local teams to facilitate a series of listening sessions with management and employees. During the sessions, employees were empowered to share their views on the Company\u2019s culture with respect to speaking up and listening up. At the same time, managers were able to gain valuable insights into the strengths and areas of opportunity for their own teams\u2019 cultures. After the listening sessions were completed, leaders implemented action plans to further strengthen their organization\u2019s Speak Up culture.\n\nThis program supports the Company\u2019s priority to \u201cInvest in the growth, success and well-being\u201d of its people. It also reflects a commitment to two of the Company\u2019s Ways of Working: \u201cSpeak up and be open-minded\u201d and \u201cEmbrace diversity and inclusion.\u201d The program aligns with our sustainability goals by helping to build diverse and inclusive team cultures while enhancing employee engagement.\n\nCompliance with laws and regulations\n\nNotices of violations, fines and settlements\n\nWe report all forms of EHS compliance notices using the term Notices of Violation (NOVs), which includes citations, letters of warning and notices of noncompliance from environmental- and safety-focused regulatory agencies.\n\nIn 2022, we had 196 EHS-related regulatory agency inspections of our facilities around the world. We received 3 safety-related and 11 environmental-related NOVs, and paid $6,693 in fines in 2022. None of the environmental-related NOVs were the result of a significant spill.\n### Notices of violations, citations and fines\n\n|                      | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|----------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| **Notices of violations (NOVs) and citations** |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Environmental        | 6    | 9    | 9    | 16   | 11   |\n| Safety               | 1    | 4    | 3    | 2    | 3    |\n| **Fines**            |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Environmental fines paid | $0  | $17,690 | $21,022 | $191,870 | $6,693 |\n| Number of environmental fines | 0   | 3    | 3    | 4    | 2    |\n| Safety fines paid    | $0   | $0   | $0   | $736 | $0   |\n| Number of safety fines | 0   | 0    | 0    | 1    | 0    |\n\nFor more information regarding compliance-related matters, please see GRI 416 on pages 148-153.\n\n### Membership associations\n\nOur Company is a member of numerous U.S.-based industry and trade groups. We work with these groups because they represent the pharmaceutical industry and business community in debates led by governments and other stakeholders, and because they help the industry reach consensus on policy issues.\n\nOur top three trade associations in 2022:\n- Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA)\n- U.S. Chamber of Commerce\n- Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO)\n\nWhen our trade associations actively lobby on our core business issues, we seek to align their positions with our own. There are times, however, when we may not share the views of our peers or associations\u2014both on issues that are central to our business and on those that, while important, are not directly material to our purpose. With representatives on the boards and committees of industry groups and trade associations, we can voice questions or concerns we may have about policy or related activities. We may even recuse ourselves from related trade association or industry group activities when appropriate.\n\nThe Governance Committee of the Board of Directors has ongoing oversight of our membership in trade associations and grassroots lobbying activities. Each year, the full Board of Directors receives a report that lists for the previous year (a) the U.S. industry and trade groups in which we are a member for which our dues are greater than $25,000 and (b) the amount of our dues that were spent by these groups on lobbying and political activity in the U.S.\n\nPlease see the Transparency Disclosures page on our corporate website for a list of our U.S. industry and trade groups.\nThrough our top three trade associations, we engaged on the following policy issues in 2022:\n\nIn the U.S., the top issues at the federal level for which our Company lobbied were:\n\n- Medicare Part B\n- Medicare Part D\n- Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA)\n\nIn the U.S., we lobbied at the state level to address these key issues:\n\n- Market-based solutions to support patient access to innovative medicines, vaccines and care\n- Regulatory policies to enable a strong business environment for U.S. operations\n- Support for a strong immunization infrastructure\n- Strengthening access to animal health products\n\nIn Europe, the top issues we focused our advocacy on included:\n\n- Addressing the European Commission\u2019s review of incentives for biopharmaceutical products\n- Fostering frameworks for sound pricing and procurement regimes in and across diverse European Union (EU) member state economies\n- Supporting government vaccination, hepatitis and diabetes programs\n- Advancing the dialogue for sustainable models to fund future cancer care\n- Improving standards for health technology assessment and health literacy\n- Ensuring science-based policies for biological medicines\n- Strengthening access to animal health products\n- Science-based trade policy for farm animals and food products derived from farm animals\n- New Veterinary Regulation (NVR)\n- EU Chemicals Sustainability Strategy and the zero pollution initiative\n- Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)\n- Animal Health as a contributor to food sustainability\n- One Health strategy\n- New technological and data developments\n\nIn 2022, we conducted a climate policy alignment assessment of U.S. trade associations in which we were a member in 2021 and for which our dues were greater than $25,000. For this assessment, we determined whether these trade associations had publicly disclosed formal positions on climate change and, if so, we reviewed those positions in the context of our Company\u2019s own position on climate change. This assessment can be found on the Sustainability Resources page on our corporate website.\n\nInformation on our approach to climate change, and related performance data, can be found in GRI 305 on page 101.\n\nApproach to stakeholder engagement\n\nWe engage with a diverse group of stakeholders to gain insights that can inform our efforts and foster our progress toward solutions that benefit society and support our business.\n\nMany of these engagements with partners can be found throughout this report. The groups of stakeholders with which we regularly engage include:\n\nPatients and caregivers\n\nFor patient communities\u2014which includes individual patients, their caregivers and family members, patient advocacy leaders and patient organizations\u2014it is critical that we respect and honor their life experiences to better understand their health care journeys, expected outcomes and decision-making considerations.\n\nFor more information on our work with patient groups, please see our Patients & Caregivers page on our corporate website and our Commitment to Patients document on our corporate website.\nShareholders\n\nThroughout the year, we regularly engage with our shareholders and seek to better understand their perspectives.\n\nWe have established a proactive shareholder engagement program, in which members of Investor Relations, the Office of the Secretary, Human Resources and the ESG Strategy & Engagement Team, as well as other subject-matter experts within the Company, engage with our shareholders to remain well informed regarding their perspectives on current issues and to address any questions or concerns. These teams serve as liaisons between shareholders, members of senior management and the Board.\n\nIn addition, we conduct an extensive shareholder outreach program twice a year focused on governance, executive compensation and sustainability matters. We believe it is most productive to discuss these matters well in advance of the annual meeting. This enables management and the Board to gather information about investor perspectives and make educated and deliberate decisions that are balanced and appropriate for our diverse shareholder base and in the Company\u2019s best interests.\n\nIn 2022, we hosted a virtual investor event with our CEO and other members of his Executive Team to discuss our Company\u2019s sustainability priorities and goals, and how our sustainability strategy is fundamental to our long-term business value and success. A webcast of this event is available on our corporate website.\n\nFor more information on our engagements with shareholders, including topics discussed, please see our 2023 proxy statement (pages 25-26).\n\nEmployees\n\nWe strive to foster a positive and inclusive working environment for our employees by providing resources to improve their health and that of their families, opportunities to further their professional development and ways to get more involved in the communities where they live.\n\nAs part of our efforts to maintain a satisfying and productive work environment, we routinely survey all employees to learn about their perspectives on the business and on how we are responding to the needs of our global workforce. The Employee Pulse Survey, our Company\u2019s all-employee engagement survey, is our flagship employee feedback mechanism and is conducted multiple times a year.\n\nTo learn more about our work with employees, please see GRI 401 to 405 on pages 114-142.\n\nPayers\n\nWe work with payers worldwide to inform their understanding of the relationship between the prices of our products and the true value they deliver to patients and health care systems.\n\nFor more information on our work with payers, please see our 2022 Pricing Action Transparency Report on the Sustainability Resources page of our corporate website.\n\nHealth care professionals\n\nWe are committed to providing appropriate and balanced information to physicians and other health care providers about our medicines, vaccines and ongoing research.\n\nFor more information on our work with health care professionals, please see GRI 203 on pages 54-76, GRI 206 on pages 82-83 and GRI 417 on pages 154-155.\n\nFor our disclosures on payments to health care professionals, visit the Transparency Disclosures page on our corporate website.\n\nGovernments, multilateral organizations and regulators\n\nWe work with policymakers, legislators, multilateral organizations and governments worldwide to ensure that policy and regulatory environments globally, nationally and locally foster patient access to medicines and vaccines, and that these environments are conducive to ethical business practices, science and innovation.\n\nFor more information on these engagements, please see GRI 415 on page 147.\nSuppliers and business partners\n\nWe strive to engage a diverse supplier base and to encourage responsible approaches on the part of suppliers regarding labor, employment, human rights, health and safety, ethics, diversity and protection of the environment.\n\nTo learn more, please see GRI 2-6 on page 35, GRI 204 on page 77, GRI 308 on page 112, GRI 412 on page 143, and GRI 414 on page 145.\n\nTrade and industry associations\n\nWe engage with stakeholders through membership in numerous organizations. Our Company is a member of numerous U.S.-based industry and trade groups. We work with these groups because they represent the pharmaceutical industry and business community in debates led by governments and other stakeholders, and because they help the industry reach consensus on policy issues.\n\nTo learn more about work with membership organizations, please see GRI 2-28 on pages 46-47.\n\nVeterinary professionals and animal caretakers\n\nWe value our partnership with veterinary professionals and animal caretakers to contribute to the health of the animals in their care with innovative products and solutions for farm and companion animal species. We regularly communicate and collaborate with our customers and industry leaders in our shared pursuit of continuously improving the health of animals.\n\nTo learn more about our work with veterinarians and animal caretakers, please visit the Animal Health website.\n\nLocal communities\n\nWe work toward developing culturally-appropriate mechanisms to engage and build relationships with our local community stakeholders and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). We conduct this engagement predominantly through our philanthropic efforts, which can be found on the Philanthropy page on our corporate website.\n\nCollective bargaining agreements\n\nFor information on the number of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, please see our 2022 Form 10-K, page 20. Working conditions and terms of employment for employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements are not determined based on other collective bargaining agreements.\n\nProcess to determine material topics\n\nList of material topics\n\nManagement of material topics\n\nAn ESG materiality assessment helps us to prioritize the environmental, social and governance topics that matter most to our stakeholders, our Company and the world. Our assessment provides insight into future trends and potential business risks and opportunities.\n\nOur priority topics\n\nIn our 2023 ESG materiality assessment, the following topics emerged as the most critical for our Company to address. They are grouped below by our four focus areas.\n\nAccess to Health\n\n- Access to health care and medicine (pages 54-76)\n- Equity and affordability (pages 64-76)\n- Product safety and quality (pages 54-76, 77-82, 148-155, Clinical trials page)\n- Public health risks (pages 54-76)\nEmployees\n- Employee diversity and inclusion (pages 134-142)\n- Employee health and safety (pages 119-129)\n- Talent management (pages 39, 47-49, 114-142)\n\nEnvironmental Sustainability\n- Climate change risks and management (pages 52-53, 89-91, 101-106)\n\nEthics & Values\n- Ethical corporate behavior (pages 44-45, 81-82, 154-155, Code of Conduct & Compliance)\n- Privacy and data security (pages 156-157)\n\nOur approach\nTo conduct the assessment, we partnered with Datamaran, an ESG materiality and risk-management firm, which uses a data-driven process for evaluating the relevance of topics and trends to our business and our stakeholders. We began with a list of material issues for our industry, which is aligned with the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) and applies SASB's accounting metrics.\n\nThese topics included:\n- Access to health care and medicine\n- Air emissions\n- Business model resilience\n- Climate change risks and management\n- Community relations\n- Competitive behavior\n- Customer practices\n- Customer privacy and data security\n- Ecological impacts\n- Employee diversity and inclusion\n- Employee health and safety\n- Energy management\n- Equity and affordability\n- Ethical corporate behavior\n- Ethics in R&D\n- GHG emissions\n- Governance structures and mechanisms\n- Human rights\n- Innovation and technology\n- Labor practices\n- Management of local impacts\n- Management of the legal and regulatory environment\n- Natural capital\n- Physical and sociopolitical risks\n- Product and service safety and quality\n- Product design and lifecycle management\n- Public health risks\n- Responsible consumption and production\n- Selling practices and product labeling\n- Sourcing efficiency and management\n- Talent management\n- Transition to renewables and alternative energies\n- Transparency\n- Waste and hazardous materials management\n- Water and wastewater management\n\nWe used Datamaran's GRI-certified software platform to scan competitor, supplier and customer ESG reports and financial communications, as well as news sources and mandatory and voluntary regulations from around the world. This assessment was coupled with surveys to leaders at the Company as well as investors with whom we engage regularly on sustainability issues.\n\nGRI's management approach disclosures are included in this report for our material ESG topics as well as disclosures for many of the topics above that are relevant for our industry. We have previously conducted these ESG materiality assessments in 2015, 2018 and 2021.\nEconomic performance\n\nGRI 201-1 Direct economic value generated and distributed\n\nFor information about our business and economic performance, please see our 2022 Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, on our corporate website.\n\nFor information on our overall tax strategy, please see our Global Tax Strategy on our corporate website.\n\nIn December 2021, we issued a $1 billion sustainability bond, as part of an $8 billion underwritten bond offering. Our Company is utilizing the net proceeds from the sustainability bond offering to support projects and partnerships in our priority areas and contribute to the advancement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Through June 30, 2022 (the most recent reporting period for the bond), we have allocated $760 million of the net proceeds towards social and green projects in alignment with our sustainability financing framework.\n\nFor more information, please see our 2022 Sustainability Bond Allocation Report on our Investor Relations page of our corporate website.\n\nInformation on our employee compensation can be found on page 52.\n\nFor more information on our benefits, please see GRI 201-3 on page 53.\nImpact investing\n\nImpact investing is one of our core approaches to advancing sustainable global health solutions in line with our Company\u2019s overall objectives. Through impact investing, we deploy financial resources in ways that may generate not only improved access to health care for underserved populations, but also financial returns and strategic opportunities\u2014all while growing a sustainable global health ecosystem and attracting additional capital and partners.\n\nImpact investing is led by our Office of Social Business Innovation with guidance from our Impact Investing Committee. Established in 2019, the Impact Investing Committee is a cross-functional team of senior Company leaders that reviews and approves new investments in line with established policies and guidelines and monitors the financial and social returns of the impact portfolio.\n\nWe are members of several external networks through which we can contribute to and benefit from the growing body of expertise in the impact investing ecosystem.\n\nFor more information on our impact investments, please visit our Impact Investing page on our corporate website.\n\nFinancial implications and other risks and opportunities due to climate change\n\nClimate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. We are exposed to physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels), risks in transitioning to a low-carbon economy (such as additional legal or regulatory requirements, changes in technology, market risk and reputational risk) and social and human effects (such as population dislocations and harm to health and well-being) associated with climate change. These risks can be either acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term).\n\nThe adverse impacts of climate change include increased frequency and severity of natural disasters and extreme weather events such as hurricanes, tornados, wildfires (exacerbated by drought), flooding and extreme heat. Extreme weather and sea-level rise pose physical risks to our facilities as well as those of our suppliers. Such risks include losses incurred as a result of physical damage to facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption caused by such natural disasters and extreme weather events. Other potential physical impacts due to climate change include reduced access to high-quality water in certain regions and the loss of biodiversity, which could impact future product development. These risks could disrupt our operations and our supply chain, which may result in increased costs.\n\nNew legal or regulatory requirements may be enacted to prevent, mitigate or adapt to the implications of a changing climate and its effects on the environment. These regulations, which may differ across jurisdictions, could result in our Company being subject to new or expanded carbon pricing or taxes, increased compliance costs, restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions, investment in new technologies, increased carbon disclosure and transparency, upgrade of facilities to meet new building codes, and the redesign of utility systems which could increase our operating costs, including the cost of electricity and energy we use. Our supply chain would likely be subject to these same transitional risks and would likely look to pass along any increased costs to our Company, all of which may affect our ability to procure raw materials or other supplies at the quantities and levels required for the operation of our business.\nWhile we understand the potential risks to our Company, there is limited data around the potential financial implications of these risks. In 2022, we continued performing a Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) gap analysis. This included a high-level TCFD-aligned qualitative physical and transitional climate risk and opportunity scenario assessment to examine which parts of our business are at highest risk due to climate change, and the associated costs.\n\nThese potential risks are integrated into our business planning, including investment in reducing energy usage, water use and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG).\n\nWe have made it a priority to reduce our demand for energy, and have established internal policies and practices focused on reducing energy use at our sites and minimizing GHG generation throughout the Company. By taking these steps, we are not only minimizing GHG emissions but also reducing operating costs and mitigating the business impacts expected to be associated with future climate change requirements.\n\nOur Sustainability Capital Fund is used exclusively for environmental sustainability projects that bring long-term value to the Company, focusing on carbon footprint, water use and solid waste reduction at our sites around the world. The fund allocates up to $12 million per year, which allows us to adopt low carbon technology, better positions us to respond to climate change and supports a more circular economy. Since 2015, our sites have completed more than 159 projects through the Sustainability Capital Fund, which has avoided the production of an estimated 57,100 metric tons of carbon emissions per year.\n\nManagement does not believe that expenditures related to our environmental sustainability initiatives should have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources for any year.\n\nFor more information, please see GRI 305 on page 101.\n\nOur CDP Climate Change Questionnaire is available on CDP\u2019s website, which CDP has aligned to the TCFD reporting recommendations.\n\nAs defined by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, \u201ca circular economy is based on the principles of designing out waste and pollution, keeping products and materials in use, and regenerating natural systems.\u201d\n\nDefined benefit plan obligations and other retirement plans\n\nWorldwide, we offer core and ancillary financial security and retirement benefits that routinely rank among the most valuable and progressive of other large multinational corporations.\n\nOutside the U.S., we have more than 80 pension plans (including defined benefit, cash balance and defined contribution plans) in over 40 countries. These plans often supplement government-sponsored social security pension benefits to improve employees\u2019 financial security through added retirement income.\n\nIn the U.S., we offer a defined benefit pension plan as well as a 401(k) plan with matching contributions. The average employee contribution rate of pay into the 401(k) plan is approximately 10 percent. Approximately 97 percent of U.S.-based employees participate in the 401(k) plan, and 100 percent participate in the pension plan. Additionally, U.S.-based employees who are at least age 55 and those who have at least 10 years of service after age 40 are eligible for subsidized medical benefits at retirement.\n\nBenefits vary based on region and country, employee group and status, collective bargaining agreements and local legal requirements.\n\nFor information on our other benefits, please see our Well-being Report on our corporate website.\nIndirect economic impacts\n\n| GRI 203 | Management approach |\n|---------|---------------------|\n| SASB 240a.1 | Access to health care for priority diseases and in priority countries |\n| SASB 240a.2 | Products on WHO\u2019s List of Prequalified Medicinal Products |\n| SASB 240b.2 | Percentage change in: (1) average list price and (2) average net price across U.S. product portfolio compared to previous year |\n| SASB 240b.3 | Percentage change in: (1) list price and (2) net price of product with largest increase compared to previous year |\n\nAs we pursue our core purpose to use the power of leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world, we also work with key stakeholders to help ensure that our science advances health care and that our products are accessible and affordable to those in need. We do this in several ways, including:\n\n- **Discovering and inventing** medicines and vaccines that address vital global health needs where we can have the greatest impact, now and in the future\n- Making **available** a reliable, safe global supply of quality medicines and vaccines, and investing in solutions to enable timely access to our products in a responsible and sustainable manner\n- Developing, testing and implementing innovative solutions that address barriers to access and **affordability** of our medicines and vaccines\n- Through partnerships, investment and innovation, applying our expertise and investing our human and financial resources to address systemic barriers to access to health and **health equity**\n\nOur multi-pronged, enterprise-wide approach to access is guided by our **Access to Health Guiding Principles**, and is responsive to internationally-recognized standards and priorities. We embed strategies and actions across the Company to enable access.\n\nDiscovery and invention\n\nFor more than a century, we have been inventing medicines and vaccines for many of the world\u2019s most challenging diseases. We are committed to addressing unmet medical needs through innovative research and development (R&D). Our R&D expenses of $13.5 billion in 2022 reflected robust clinical development spending as well as increased investment in discovery research and early drug development from 2021.\n\nGlobal burden of disease\n\nAs defined by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) visualization tools developed by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), the diseases that our products address rank high on the list of worldwide causes of illness, disability, and death. Our research into vaccines and infectious diseases seeks to address major burdens of disease that are prevalent in all countries. We believe that the resulting vaccines and treatments can have the greatest impact in lower-income countries where drug donation and immunization programs have been shown to save lives and prevent disease and disabilities, reducing the risk of extreme poverty and economic instability.\n\nConsidering our pipeline, the list of products we currently market, and our external collaborations, we estimate that our Company is seeking to address 83 percent of the top 20 global burdens of disease as defined by the IHME. This is higher than the 71 percent reported in 2021 due to the inclusion of external malaria and maternal health partnerships, which were not accounted for in prior years.\n### Research and development\n\n| Research and development expenses (in billions)\\(^1\\)\\(^2\\) | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Top 20 global burdens of diseases addressed by our products and pipeline\\(^3\\)\\(^4\\) | 88%  | 100% | 88%  | 71%  | 83%  |\n| Established significant external licenses and collaborations\\(^5\\) | 64   | 78   | 123  | 92   | 97   |\n\n\\(^1\\) R&D expenses include a $2.7 billion charge in 2020 related to the acquisition of VelosBio, Inc., a $1.7 billion charge in 2021 for the acquisition of Pandion Therapeutics, Inc. and $1.7 billion of intangible asset impairment charges in 2022.\n\n\\(^2\\) The historical results of the businesses that were contributed to Organon & Co. in the 2021 spin-off have been reflected as discontinued operations in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements through the date of the spin-off and therefore are excluded from the 2019, 2020 and 2021 figures presented. Recast figures for 2018 are not available.\n\n\\(^3\\) Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) using GBD 2019 data. We exclude road injuries and age-related hearing loss from our GBD accounting, as they are not subject to pharmaceutical intervention.\n\n\\(^4\\) All calculations for our Company\u2019s GBD impact are based on the latest IHME report available, from 2019. As such, impact from more recent diseases like COVID-19 is not accounted for. We also do not include road injuries or age-related hearing loss in our GBD accounting since they are not subject to pharmaceutical intervention.\n\n\\(^5\\) These partnerships are deemed \u2018significant\u2019 because they involve an asset or technology with the potential to make an important enhancement to our R&D capabilities.\n\n### Systematic evaluation to inform product access strategies\n\nEmbedded within our development R&D process, we systematically evaluate our candidates to identify the potential to address significant public health burden and unmet medical needs in underserved health care settings. This evaluation process informs our product access strategies, with the goal of making our medicines and vaccines available to as many people as possible through sustainable solutions.\n\nTo facilitate access, we undertake a systematic evaluation at the onset of Phase 2 clinical studies to determine a candidate\u2019s potential to address unmet medical needs in LMICs. Our approach involves evaluating the level of disease burden that exists, the availability of alternative medications, and the appropriateness of our pipeline candidates to improve public health. For candidates with significant potential in underserved settings, access planning may start in the pre-clinical phase. Additionally, understanding where health system infrastructure and funding mechanisms are in place is an important component of enabling safe and effective usage, which ultimately facilitates meaningful patient access.\n\nOur R&D Governance Committee is accountable for the evaluation process, and all recommendations are reviewed by our Policy and ESG Council (PEC), an internal cross-divisional forum of senior leaders. When a drug or vaccine candidate with the potential to address significant public health burden in underserved health care settings is identified, the access planning process includes engaging all parts of our enterprise, as well as external stakeholders, to identify the optimal solution.\n\nOnce approved, we commit to making the product available in all countries where clinical trials have been conducted. Products continue to be evaluated for their potential to address disease burden throughout their life cycle to account for changes in the external environment.\n\nSometimes the evaluation of a candidate during the R&D process reveals barriers to access in low-income countries or underserved settings. In these situations, the evaluation process can inform our approach to strengthening health systems and improving health equity. We recognize that addressing the complex and multi-faceted challenges to accessing health care in LMICs requires the collaboration of multiple stakeholders. We actively seek partnerships to achieve solutions that enable access.\n\nOne example of our approach to early access planning in the clinical trial process is our global access strategy for our investigational antiviral COVID-19 medicine. This strategy aims to ensure timely and widespread access in the context of a pandemic. For details on our work to accelerate broadening the reach of this medicine, please visit the Affordability and Sustainable Access section on page 69.\nClinical research\n\nOur Global Clinical Development organization is responsible for conducting clinical trials worldwide to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our pipeline candidates. In accordance with our Public Policy Position Statement on Clinical Trial Ethics, all investigational studies in human subjects are conducted in a manner consistent with laws, regulations and guidelines for the protection of human subjects, including those issued by the International Council for Harmonisation: Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP). However, individual country regulations and guidelines remain the primary determinant of specific requirements for the conduct of medical research.\n\nWe are committed to the study of appropriately diverse patient populations\u2014including groups that have been previously underrepresented in clinical trials: women and children, people of varying ages, sexual orientation and gender identities, various socioeconomic backgrounds and other characteristics\u2014in our clinical trials. Currently, we conduct our trials in more than 60 countries worldwide. In support of this commitment, we have implemented a number of programs and processes over the past several years.\n\nInternally, we have a team of clinical trial operations experts focused on ensuring our clinical trials reflect the broad diversity of the populations we serve, and on implementing best practices in the conduct of clinical trials globally. This begins with the selection of clinical trial sites in communities serving historically underrepresented ethnic groups. We also provide resources and training to increase awareness and best practices for improving diversity in clinical research. Clinical research studies sponsored by our Company are also planned and conducted to incorporate enrollment and other goals focused on increasing diversity.\n\nExternally, our Company continues to be an active contributor and participant in various collaborations intended to connect with, support and train more U.S.-based clinicians from underrepresented groups. The aim is to help drive equitable access to clinical research at the community level. We also co-sponsor the Improving Patient Access to Clinical Trials (IMPACT) study at the Lazarex Cancer Foundation.\n\nIMPACT is a three-year pilot program that strives to increase the diversity of patients enrolled in clinical trials, as well as improve retention and equitable access in oncology trials. We have also implemented novel tools and approaches to build relationships and reach potential study participants within their own communities (e.g., partnerships with local pharmacies and mobile study sites). Consistent with ICH-GCP requirements, as part of the informed consent process clinical trial participants are made aware of the compensation or treatment available to them and whom to contact in the event of a treatment-related injury. In addition, we maintain procedures that address the costs of treatment in the event of trial-related injuries, in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.\nCompliance\n\nCompliance in our research laboratories is focused not only on the conduct of clinical trials, but also on helping ensure robust oversight of effective policies and procedures, training, auditing and risk management, as well as sponsoring risk identification, prioritization and mitigation for our Merck Research Laboratories (MRL).\n\nWe have a Compliance Committee within MRL, with the objective of ensuring ongoing compliance through appropriate management structure, processes and training.\n\nThe Compliance Committee comprises members of the Research Leadership Team (RLT). Including the RLT in the Compliance Committee ensures cross-functional awareness and ownership of ethics and compliance at the senior-management level.\n\nThe Compliance Committee promotes ethical science and provides guidance to our employees within the research organization on our Company\u2019s standards and corporate policies, as well as necessary education related to specific requirements applicable to the research community.\n\nGenetic research\n\nThe rapid development of new technologies that interrogate variability in human DNA and RNA, combined with powerful computing hardware and software, has made it practical to investigate genetic and genomic determinants for risk of human disease or predictors of human response to drugs.\n\nWe conduct genetic and genomic research within our clinical trials and in collaboration with external organizations that have collected human genetic and genomic samples and health data. We also conduct genetic and genomic analysis of our clinical trial samples, primarily to understand how genetic and genomic variation impact patient responses to medicines. This enables us to communicate information to regulatory authorities and prescribers that will improve the use of our medicines and the understanding of how genetics contribute to the underlying disease, which has the potential to identify new drug targets.\n\nWe obtain subject consent for use of genetic and genomic samples in accordance with ethical principles of human-subjects research, which include respect for persons/autonomy, beneficence and justice, consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki, U.S. FDA requirements, ICH E6 Good Clinical Practices guidelines and the 1997 UNESCO Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights. When collaborating with external organizations, we also ensure they\u2019ve obtained consent from individuals who have contributed DNA, RNA and/or health-related data.\n\nUse of stem cells\n\nTogether with the scientific community, we believe that research using stem cells has the potential to help identify medicines, therapies and vaccines to help treat, cure or prevent disease. Many of the most advanced scientific technologies in regenerative medicine involve animal or human embryonic stem cells.\n\nFor more than a decade, we\u2019ve applied advances in stem-cell technologies to support our research and development. The capacity of stem cells to differentiate into specific cell types underscores their versatility and utility, from early target validation and identification, to the screening and testing of potential new therapeutics, disease-modeling and pre-clinical proof of concept.\n\nWe conduct research using stem cells in full accordance with all applicable laws and regulations, and our own internal research policies. Our research policy involving stem cells adheres to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences guidelines as well as those of the International Society for Stem Cell Research.\n\nOur Regenerative Medicine Oversight Committee, which comprises both internal and external experts, oversees Company-sponsored research involving stem cells, including highly-targeted research using human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells. The committee is responsible for ensuring that all projects involving stem cells adhere to our policies.\n\nFor more information on our R&D efforts, please visit the Research & Products page on our corporate website.\nAvailability\n\nScientific innovation relies on excellent manufacturing and commercialization execution to support broad access across the world, enabling our inventions to reach all patients in need while reducing our environmental impacts.\n\nOur supply chain is designed to ensure we operate a lean and efficient network that produces our medicines and vaccines to the highest quality, safety and environmental standards, in full compliance with regulations and current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs), and industry best practices.\n\nRapidly evolving external landscape\n\nOur Company is adapting, innovating and planning for a dynamic, evolving landscape so we can continue to expand availability of lifesaving medicines and vaccines. Some of this evolving landscape includes significant global economic pressures, including rising inflation, geopolitical insecurity and climate-related disasters.\n\nWe continue making investments and driving innovations in our supply chain, with a focus on both the short- and long-term horizon. Examples include:\n\n- Adaptations in manufacturing and supply that support greater complexity of oncology and vaccine value chains, driven by new product modalities, new delivery mechanisms, and evolving regulatory requirements\n- Planning for increased demand for several new indication approvals in oncology, in addition to multiple new medicines launching in multiple countries over the short- and long-term\n- Supporting channel expansion for vaccines, including through new public tenders\n- Responding to an expanding base of customer decision-makers and expanding our distribution models to address increasing shifts in private and public channel mix, including government distributors handling a greater proportion of our products\n\nStrong supply chain systems, made more robust with innovations for efficiency and distribution to under-resourced and remote locations, will be the engine that helps us navigate these challenges. These innovations are also driving our focus to address key supply chain constraints, while delivering on our Company\u2019s goals for environmental sustainability.\n\nInnovations in manufacturing and supply chain\n\nOur Company has made significant inroads in digital capabilities across supply chain processes to respond in real time to the evolving health care ecosystem. The most notable digital capabilities impacting availability include orchestrating the supply chain ecosystem, supply chain planning, strengthening logistics capabilities and connecting distribution channels.\n\nOrchestration: Integrating data and decision-making across the supply chain\n\nWe are improving the quality and agility of strategic and integrated decision-making across a supply chain ecosystem. Our objective is to connect manufacturers, transporters, third-party providers, suppliers and partners with real-time data. These improvements have shortened sales and operations planning cycle time from seven weeks to four weeks, increasing our ability to respond to customer opportunities and to meet patient needs.\n\nSupply chain planning\n\nThroughout 2022, we worked to improve real-time supply chain analytics and execution, increasing resiliency and adaptability to future supply chain disruptions and customer opportunities. In addition, we have established automated data governance with centralized resources for master data, which has allowed for demand forecast automation and significantly improved forecast accuracy. This planning enables us to continue to surpass our target of 95 percent of orders shipped on time and in full, with an achievement of 98.2 percent in 2022 (see Availability table on page 60).\nLogistics\n\nWe are building digital capabilities and enhancing business processes to create a more agile, efficient and sustainable distribution and logistics infrastructure. These enhancements give us visibility into shipments in transit through digital logistics, enable interventions to prevent loss of product, and ensure reliable product delivery. We also maintain our commitment to logistics security, including our track record of 100 percent of logistics partners completing security assessments (see Availability table on page 60).\n\nConnected channels\n\nWe are using blockchain and advanced technologies to improve the end-to-end, secured flow of information with trading partners, industry peers, regulators, health care professionals and patients. In addition, we\u2019re collaborating on the development of an industry technology platform, PharmaLedger, to enable e-leaflet capabilities at scale. Our goal is to provide patients and health care professionals a streamlined access to the latest product information approved by health authorities and to enhance safety and adherence to treatment. As we onboard an increasing number of markets, we are committed to significantly reducing the number of paper inserts while improving regulatory compliance.\n\nImperatives in manufacturing and supply chain to advance access\n\nInnovations across our supply chain digital strategy support our strategic intent, focused on the following imperatives:\n\n- **Protect affordability**: innovating supply chain designs enabling affordable, compliant and reliable access to our innovative medicines\n- **Flex operations**: plan for supply disruptions with improved risk management and business continuity planning, including flexible manufacturing, to enable accelerated pharmaceutical formulation and process development. Modular and podular laboratory and manufacturing allows for rapid reconfiguration to implement new process capabilities for innovative drug delivery technologies\n- **Adapt to exceed customer expectations**: agile supply chains can pivot when the unexpected happens, improving strategic and integrated decision-making to rapidly react to patient and customer opportunities and increase the reach of new medicines\n- **Reduce environmental impact**: lower our carbon footprint and increase the sustainability of our supply chains\n\nIntegrating access planning in business strategies\n\nOur enterprise-wide business strategy brings access planning early into our product development cycle and balances two objectives:\n\n- Appropriately ensure people with unmet medical needs have access to our innovative, high-quality products\n- Maintain and grow a responsible and sustainable business\n\nFor our manufacturing efforts, this means we are balancing internal and external licensing opportunities, including assessing new voluntary licensing and technology transfer strategies and expanding our network for supply chain design.\n\nThis business strategy enables enterprise-level strategic segmentation, highlighting the specific access gaps in markets and guiding us to commercially sustainable solutions, including new archetypes for manufacturing and supply execution.\n\nAs part of the enterprise-wide strategy, our manufacturing division will engage early in the life cycle of a program through a new product development and commercialization process to understand and facilitate future manufacturing, supply chain and network needs. While not all elements will be known, an early concept of the supply and manufacturing strategy will be critical to preserve future options. This means we start supply chain design early in Phase 1 of development.\nAvailability\n\n| Availability                                                                 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Logistics partners with security risk assessment completed, annually (Target: 100%) | 100% | 100% | 100% |\n| Reach at least 75% of countries around the world annually with our products (Target: 75%) | 78%  | 79%  | 76%  |\n| Orders shipped on time and in full (Target: 95%)                              | 98.3%| 98.3%| 98.2%|\n\n1 Reporting on KPIs started with 2020 performance data.\n2 As defined by the World Bank Country and Lending Groups. Includes only human health products.\n\nCOVID-19 antiviral medicine\u2014manufacturing and supply\n\nTo accelerate broad global access, our comprehensive supply and access approach includes producing millions of courses of our investigational antiviral COVID-19 medicine through our global network, which includes manufacturing sites in nine countries across three continents.\n\nRead more about our approach on pages 65-66.\n\nGoing above and beyond\u2014emergency drone delivery experiment combines supply chain innovation and corporate responsibility\n\nCurrently, more than 20 percent of the world\u2019s population cannot be reached through health care delivery systems. No one in need should be denied access to lifesaving medicines due to lack of infrastructure or transportation.\n\nOur Company\u2019s vision to increase access to our medicines and vaccines across the globe includes exploring the delivery of our products by drones in rural areas. Drone delivery helps us serve low-resource settings with limited logistical capabilities. It also helps us provide medical supplies during and after acute events like natural disasters or pandemics.\n\nWe started exploring the use of drone delivery after Hurricane Maria isolated many people in Puerto Rico. The use of drones can be a safe, compliant and reliable method of delivering cold chain-dependent products when patients are isolated. We have also developed a proof-of-concept drone delivery with a validated thermal protection system for isolated Native American communities in rural Alaska and in North Dakota. The proof of concept showed we can create access to our patients and customers despite logistical challenges.\nVaccines\u2014manufacturing and supply\n\nIn the last few years, various countries have introduced new or expanded routine vaccination programs creating unprecedented increases in global demand for vaccines. To meet this demand, we will continue to increase our capacity and our supply capability across our vaccine portfolio.\n\nOur Company plans to invest approximately $20 billion in capital projects from 2021-2025, with a portion dedicated to vaccines. We continue to invest in manufacturing and end-to-end supply improvements in both capability and capacity to help ensure a sustainable, reliable supply of quality and affordable vaccines to serve global needs. Our manufacturing division continuously works to improve manufacturing processes and reduce operating costs by increasing efficiency, minimizing procurement spending and improving supply performance.\n\nMaintaining product quality is paramount. To provide high-quality vaccines to people who need them, we manage our supply chain through policies and procedures designed to keep the distribution system secure. We also continue to explore potential strategic partnerships with other manufacturers to increase supply and promote greater access in local markets.\n\nVaccines\u2014key accomplishments and milestones\n\nThe global reach of our vaccines has increased significantly. Ex-U.S. distribution of our vaccines was 78 percent in 2022, up from 34 percent in 2013. This represents important progress toward ensuring that these vaccines reach people around the world, including in LMICs, who are at high risk for certain vaccine-preventable illnesses. For example, we have committed over 100 million doses of our HPV vaccine for use in Gavi-supported countries from 2021-2025.\n\nERVEBO\u00ae (Ebola Zaire Vaccine, Live) is the world\u2019s first FDA-approved, WHO-prequalified vaccine for the prevention of Ebola virus disease. Through our agreement with UNICEF, we have built a 500,000 dose ERVEBO\u00ae stockpile, and continue delivering licensed doses to maintain the stockpile. As of March 2023, the vaccine has been approved in ten African countries.\n\nAdditionally, in response to the health and humanitarian crisis of the Sudan ebolavirus outbreak in Uganda in 2022, our Company collaborated with IAVI, a global nonprofit scientific research organization, to produce and donate vials of investigational candidate Sudan ebolavirus vaccine for use in IAVI\u2019s Sudan ebolavirus vaccine development program. The vials were produced from existing investigational bulk drug substance previously manufactured by our Company.\n\nProduct registration and prequalification\n\nWe seek to ensure global access to our medicines and vaccines by obtaining and maintaining up-to-date product registrations around the globe. In order to make our products available to the people who need them throughout the world, we registered 156 products and devices in 2022.\n\nThe majority of these products were registered in LMICs in the Asia-Pacific, Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, and Americas regions. In addition to having our medicines and vaccines approved by regulatory authorities, when relevant to enhancing access in LMICs, we also work to have certain medicines and vaccines prequalified through the WHO prequalification process so that our products may be easily procured by and distributed to these LMIC populations. The table on the following page summarizes the registration and WHO prequalification status of a select list of our vaccines.\n\nWHO prequalification facilitates product procurement by United Nations agencies in many LMICs. In the absence of stringent national medicine authorities, it serves to certify products meet required quality, safety and efficacy standards. WHO\u2019s prequalification program covers routine vaccines and medicines for HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis (TB), hepatitis, diarrhoeal diseases and select neglected tropical diseases.\n\nWe have made efforts to address the unique needs of LMICs where the infrastructure and personnel to deliver immunization services can be severely limited. Specifically, we have focused on product improvements such as the introduction of vaccine vial monitors (VVMs) for use to assess controlled-temperature-chain conditions. In May 2022, we obtained WHO approval for our Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines\u2019 compatibility for use outside the cold chain for up to four days. This helps enhance accessibility for hard-to-reach populations.\n| Products prequalified by WHO | International Nonproprietary Name (INN) | Date of prequalification | Number of countries pre-qualified |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| **Vaccines**                |                                          |                          |                                  |\n| MMR-II\u00ae                     | Measles, Mumps, Rubella Virus Vaccine Live | January 2009             | 77                               |\n| ROTATEQ\u00ae                    | Rotavirus Vaccine, Live, Oral, Pentavalent | October 2008             | 124                              |\n| GARDASIL\u00ae                   | Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16, 18) Vaccine, Recombinant | May 2009                 | 129                              |\n| GARDASIL\u00ae 9                 | Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16, 18) Vaccine, Recombinant (including a two-dose-regimen variation)\u00b9 | February 2018            | 85                               |\n| VARIVAX\u00ae                    | Varicella Virus Vaccine Live (first varicella vaccine to receive WHO prequalification) | February 2018            | 87                               |\n| ERVEBO\u00ae                     | Ebola Zaire Vaccine, Live                | November 2019            | 45                               |\n| **HIV/AIDS treatments**     |                                          |                          |                                  |\n| STOCRIN\u00ae                    | Efavirenz (600mg tablet, Oral Solution 30mg) | May 2006                 | 54                               |\n|                             | Efavirenz (50mg tablet, 200mg tablet)    | May 2008                 |                                  |\n\n\u00b9Not currently available through UNICEF procurement; awaiting Vaccine Vial Monitor (VVM).\n| Product registration                                      | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| New product and device registrations (annual)\\(^1,2\\)    | 124  | 97   | 79   | 141  | 156  |\n| Products submitted that have achieved WHO prequalification (cumulative)\\(^3,4,5\\) | 13   | 13   | 13   | 7    | 7    |\n| Number of patent applications filed in low-income countries\\(^6\\) | NR   | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0    |\n\nNR: Not reported\n\n\\(^1\\) Data include new products and new indications.\n\n\\(^2\\) Data for all years have been updated based on a tracking system upgrade that corrected miscounts in prior years.\n\n\\(^3\\) Three products previously reported are no longer part of the Company\u2019s product portfolio due to the Organon & Co. spin-off in 2021.\n\n\\(^4\\) The three GARDASIL\\(^\\text{\u00ae}\\) (HPV 9-valent Vaccine, Recombinant) products that had been previously reported separately are reported as one product starting in 2021.\n\n\\(^5\\) CRIXIVAN\\(^\\text{\u00ae}\\) (indinavir sulfate) was removed from our product list in 2019 and is no longer included in the total number of products that have achieved WHO prequalification.\n\n\\(^6\\) Countries classified as low-income countries in the 2019 World Bank Country and Lending Group classifications.\nAffordability\n\nWorking to solve affordability challenges to broaden reach of our innovative portfolio\n\nInspired by our former chairman, George W. Merck, who once said \u201cWe can never rest until a way has been found to bring our finest achievements to everyone,\u201d we are working towards a world where everyone, everywhere has the option to receive the right medicines or vaccines when they need them. We strive to do this in a way that creates sustainable access to innovative medicines and vaccines, creating long-term value for patients, health systems and our Company.\n\nWe seek to understand the barriers that stand in the way of people receiving the right medicines and vaccines when they need them. The underlying challenges that constrain patient access range from adequate capacity and channels for care delivery to sustainable financing.\n\nWithin a wider ecosystem, different stakeholders\u2014including private, governmental, multilateral and nonprofit organizations\u2014have a unique role in reducing barriers and expanding sustainable access to health. Our approach is predicated on the belief that broadening access to medicines and vaccines is best achieved through collaborating with multiple stakeholders to enable solutions that solve the needs of people today and for generations to come.\n\nPolicy environment\n\nWe recognize that an enabling policy environment is critical to solving access and affordability challenges. Therefore, we engage with governments, industry associations, trade and economic forums, think tanks and academia to advocate for evidence-based policy solutions.\n\nFor example, we are actively involved in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation\u2019s (APEC) Health Care Financing initiatives. Through this effort, we are creating a roadmap that outlines priorities, objectives and targets for strengthening health care financing, sharing best practices from APEC economies, and strengthening the dialogue across industry, governments and academia to diagnose and solve pressing affordability challenges.\n\nWe also participated in dialogue at the Health20 (H20), Business20 (B20) side-event, with the Atlantic Council, the World Cancer Congress, and alongside the UN General Assembly to promote evidence-based policies that can improve investment in health.\n\nTo achieve sustainable access, health care resources must be used in a more efficient and equitable way. This transformation can only be achieved by learning and progressing together with cross-industry partners. The Global Coalition for Value in Healthcare was launched at the World Economic Forum in 2019, and aims to accelerate the development of value-based healthcare around the world. We are also contributing to the Global Innovation Hub Expert Review Committee by acting as advisor to the group.\n\nBy supporting early adopters in value-based health care and spreading the learnings, we are working to inspire other health systems around the globe to embrace and implement value-oriented health care strategies and models, which would contribute to achieving sustainable access.\n\nSimilarly, we work with organizations like ThinkWell to study and promote policies for sustainable financing for immunizations and comprehensive cancer prevention and care.\nOur Company goal to enable more people to access our innovative portfolio\n\nThrough collaborating with multiple stakeholders to address access to health challenges, we believe that more patients would benefit from a broad range of innovative medicines and vaccines, including ours. We work in partnership to develop and deliver solutions that enable more people to have sustainable access to medicines and vaccines.\n\nIn 2021, we set a goal to enable 100 million more people globally to access our innovative portfolio\u2014through access strategies, solutions and partnerships\u2014by 2025, relative to a 2020 baseline. In 2022, we exceeded this goal and enabled access for 189.2 million people (see table below). We are committed to continue driving our aspiration and therefore increased this goal from 100 million to 350 million more people enabled to access to our innovative portfolio by 2025.\n\nWe continue expanding the reach of our innovative portfolio through developing therapy-specific access strategies, solutions and partnerships.\n\n### Sustainable access strategies, solutions and partnerships\n\nWe operate as an integrated Company across global, regional and market teams to address access challenges through multiple initiatives. We have established a systematic framework, which is available to all our markets, for diagnosing barriers to access, designing and delivering practical solutions that can help solve access challenges. We have also established a dedicated internal unit to systematically accelerate innovation, continuously evolve the relevant capabilities and capture learnings across various countries. Through this approach we have been able to accelerate the development of innovation in patient access models and solutions to expand the accessible population across the globe.\n\nIn collaboration with Financial Times Longitude, we launched the Sustainable Access website to advocate for greater collaborations among various stakeholders to develop, test and scale solutions that help expand sustainable access to innovative treatments and vaccines.\n\n### Enabling access to our medicines and vaccines\n\n|                                | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|--------------------------------|------|------|------|------|\n| Number of countries where dedicated affordability solutions have been initiated | 40   | 40   | NR   | NR   |\n| Total number of people enabled to access our innovative portfolio through access strategies, solutions and partnerships (in millions)\u00b9 | NR   | NR   | 66.7 | 189.2 |\n| People reached globally through product donation and patient assistance programs and partnerships (estimate in millions)\u00b2 (including MECTIZAN) | 403.7| 268.3| 197.3| 359.2|\n\nNR: Not reported.\n\n\u00b9 Metrics contributing to this goal are displayed on an annual basis and provide information on the number of people who now have the option to access medicines and vaccines as a result of our sustainable access strategies, solutions and partnerships, including our commitment to Gavi and UNICEF (rather than doses shipped), collaborations to optimize resources in health systems, expanded financial coverage through insurance, and new community-based channel partnerships in LMICs. \u201cInnovative portfolio\u201d of products refers to our Company\u2019s on-patent products. Enable more people is defined as implemented and launched in market and will be in comparison to the baseline (2020) as of 2025. Evidence for metrics are sourced from the best publicly available data and proxy sources by market. While proxies differ by market, all methodologies are evaluated and represent the best estimate of people enabled to access innovative medicines and vaccines. People who were enabled to access innovative medicines and vaccines did not necessarily receive such innovative medicines and vaccines.\n\n\u00b2 Includes people reached through the MECTIZAN Donation Program, the Merck Medical Outreach Program, and the U.S. Patient Assistance Program. Total people reached with the MECTIZAN Donation Program increased in 2022 as partner countries resumed additional MECTIZAN distribution following disruptions due to the pandemic. For more information on the details related to the people reached through donations, please see page 70.\nWe have been building capabilities to support a portfolio of initiatives aimed at advancing sustainable access globally. These include enabling health care systems to better serve those in need through customer collaborations, health care financing, employer benefit design, and new delivery channels in LMICs.\n\nEnabling health care systems to better serve those in need through customer collaborations\n\nWe recognize that in some environments, the challenge lies in having resilient health care systems that can reach patients at the right time with the right intervention. That is why we collaborate with health care and service providers in the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Brazil and Colombia to understand challenges across the care pathway and help advance solutions that can strengthen health care systems.\n\nLeveraging our clinical expertise, particularly in oncology, and our deep understanding of the health care ecosystem, we partner with the health care systems to better understand cancer patient pathway constraints and identify solutions that enable access and the optimal use of resources.\n\nOne such approach is in the United Kingdom. We convened a broad coalition of eight National Health Services (NHS) Cancer Alliances and five national representative organizations to create the Do It For Yourself Campaign. This campaign raises awareness of distinguishing symptoms of lung cancer from those of COVID-19, and encourages people living in areas with high incidence to seek advice from their doctors if they have concerns about such symptoms.\n\nWe also partner with more than 20 NHS Trust and Cancer Alliances to leverage data and analytical tools to help them better understand oncology treatment capacity constraints and explore opportunities to optimize their existing capacity.\n\nIn Colombia, we have been working with multiple health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and oncology health care providers (HCPs) to identify inefficiencies and pain points in diagnosis pathways in lung and breast cancers to reduce the time to diagnosis.\n\nEnabling multiple sources of financing health care\n\nOne of the recurring access challenges in LMICs is the potentially high out-of-pocket costs for critical illness treatments. Recognizing this issue, we have continued collaboration with reinsurers and insurance companies in, among others, South Africa, Thailand and Indonesia to develop affordable health insurance products for the population, including covering innovative cancer therapies.\n\nWe are also actively collaborating with public health authorities to provide access to immunotherapy financing through supplemental medical insurance in China, providing options for the population and driving greater health care inclusion.\n\nWe believe that expanding the reach of insurance products will help solve major access hurdles and, in turn, help increase access to innovative cancer therapies for patients. This collaborative approach to addressing access challenges reinforces our commitment to being part of a wider ecosystem, collaborating with others with complementary capabilities to tackle these access challenges.\nEmployers' role in benefit design\n\nIn the U.S., employers play an important role in the health care system through their employee health plans. In recent years, many organizations have faced spiraling costs\u2014especially related to cancer care and treatment. The principles of value-based insurance design (V-BID) focuses on structuring health plans so that they incentivize high-value interventions and disincentivize low-value care. This aims to achieve two outcomes: improve patient outcomes and manage costs, which allows funding to be reallocated to support innovative new treatments.\n\nWe have evaluated a V-BID Oncology Pilot that pioneered the use of V-BID principles in corporate cancer coverage for our employees in the U.S. We are leveraging data to better understand our employees' health risks and our cancer care expenditure in order to:\n\n- Identify opportunities to move from low-value to high-value care\n- Use data continuously to refine and evolve the plan\n\nWe have been sharing the lessons that we have drawn from this pilot with various stakeholders and other employers. By sharing our experience, we hope that this will help other employers to develop their own innovations to improve their employee health care plans and widen access to quality care.\n\nNew access channels in low-and middle-income countries\n\nMany underserved populations around the world rely heavily on the private sector for accessing health care. This is exacerbated in LMICs, where supply chain and distribution in these markets are often highly fragmented and multi-layered. To address these challenges, we are supporting local networks and leveraging technology solutions that optimize supply chains in resource constrained settings. For example, we are one of the sponsors of the Investing in Innovation (i3) initiative, a global network of industry players, donors and international organizations that seeks high-potential startups who aspire to transform the availability, accessibility, affordability, quality and visibility of health products at scale across Africa.\n\nAnother example is our collaboration with a health care provider with a presence in 12 African countries. Through this partnership, we seek to reimagine the prevention, screening and treatment of cervical cancer across Africa. We are committed to working with the health care providers on disease awareness and in designing innovative access solutions to our medicines and vaccines by increasing affordability for more people.\n\nAdditional information on sustainable access strategies, solutions and partnerships can be found on the Sustainable Access website.\nPartnerships and collaborations to advance vaccination equity\n\nInequitable access to vaccines and vaccination services threaten to stall and even reverse progress made in combating the spread of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). Every year, 1.5 million deaths occur due to VPDs, particularly among historically marginalized groups and populations. We are committed to expanding access to our vaccines for people and communities around the globe. Among the specific actions we have taken with our vaccines are:\n\n- Collaborating with Gavi and UNICEF to expand global access to our vaccines\n- Obtaining approval in May 2022 from WHO for our HPV vaccines to be used outside the cold chain for up to four days, helping to enhance accessibility for hard-to-reach populations\n- Establishing a research and development collaboration with Hilleman Laboratories to bring forward a more thermostable, second-generation Zaire Ebolavirus vaccine candidate\n- Developing an investigational vaccine for the prevention of dengue fever in collaboration with Instituto Butantan (IB). Under the agreement announced in December 2018, we and IB are sharing clinical data and other learnings from their respective dengue vaccine development programs\n\nCollaboration with Gavi/UNICEF\n\nGavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi) is a public-private partnership that helps vaccinate half the world\u2019s children against some of our planet\u2019s deadliest diseases. According to its Annual Progress Report, since its inception in 2000 Gavi has helped to immunize a whole generation\u2014reaching one billion children\u2014and prevented more than 16.2 million future deaths. Gavi\u2019s work has cut child mortality in half in 73 lower-income countries.\n\nGavi also plays a key role in improving global health security by supporting health systems and funding global stockpiles for Ebola, cholera, meningococcal and yellow fever vaccines. As a permanent member of Gavi\u2019s board, and the world\u2019s biggest buyer and supplier of vaccines for developing countries, UNICEF has a pivotal role in implementing immunization programs in Gavi-supported countries and in shaping the Vaccine Alliance\u2019s policies. UNICEF\u2019s Supply Division procures the majority of Gavi-funded vaccines.\n\nIt helps countries analyze and overcome obstacles to improving immunization coverage and equity, and works with WHO to support countries applying for and implementing health-system-strengthening grants.\n\nOur commitment to helping protect global health by improving the resilience of immunization programs and broadening access to our vaccines around the world is fundamental to our mission and highlighted through our long-term commitment to Gavi and UNICEF. To broaden access to our Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, which is indicated to help prevent HPV-related cancers and diseases, our Company provides this vaccine to the public sectors of countries that are eligible for support from Gavi at an access price that is significantly less than the value-based price in other countries.\n\nThrough a long-term agreement with UNICEF, we committed to provide over 100 million doses of our HPV vaccine for use in Gavi-supported countries, from 2021-2025. In addition, through our agreement with UNICEF, we have built a 500,000 dose ERVEBO\u00ae stockpile, and continue delivering licensed doses to maintain the stockpile. As of March 2023, the vaccine has been approved in ten African countries.\n\nFinally, for 2021-2025, we committed to extend our current Gavi prices for our HPV vaccine to Gavi-graduated countries with a per-capita gross national income (GNI) not exceeding $3,200. This greatly assists in expanding and sustaining access in countries that have transitioned out of Gavi support.\n\nWe believe that our pricing approach\u2014in conjunction with our commitment to partner with stakeholders to strengthen resilience of immunization programs\u2014contributes to broader access to our vaccines worldwide.\n\nExpanding the reach of our innovations\n\nWe expand reach of our innovations to at-need population and patients\u2014including those in LMICs\u2014through our access strategies and planning as well as programs and partnerships, taking into consideration unmet public health need, economic conditions and health care infrastructure.\nOur pricing approach\n\nWe have a long history of making our medicines and vaccines accessible and affordable through responsible pricing practices and industry-leading patient-access programs.\n\nWe are working to bring our medicines and vaccines to more people around the world in ways that are as accessible and affordable as possible for the patients who need them.\n\nWhile each individual situation varies based on factual circumstances and market dynamics, generally we consider:\n\n- Value provided to patients\n- Value provided to health care systems\n- Unmet need\n- Access\n- R&D sustainability\n- Competition\n\nU.S. product pricing\n\nIn 2017, we began disclosing information about the price of our medicines in the U.S. Our 2022 U.S. Pricing Transparency Report shows an average annual net price increase of 4.3 percent in 2022. The average annual list price across our portfolio increased by 4.4 percent in 2022. The Company\u2019s gross U.S. sales were reduced by 39.7 percent in 2022 as a result of rebates, discounts and returns.\n\nFor more information on our approach to pricing, please see our U.S. Pricing Transparency Report which is available on the Transparency Disclosures page of our corporate website.\n\nVoluntary licensing\n\nIn the face of the global COVID-19 pandemic, and realizing our opportunity to help meet a significant unmet medical need globally, including in under-resourced settings, we implemented a multi-faceted strategy to facilitate timely access to our investigational antiviral COVID-19 medicine through our comprehensive supply and access approach that includes:\n\n- We entered into advance purchase and supply agreements with the governments of more than 40 countries, and are currently in discussions with additional governments, implementing a tiered-pricing approach based on World Bank country income criteria to reflect countries\u2019 relative ability to finance their health response to the pandemic\n- We signed voluntary license agreements early on during the clinical development process, with multiple established Indian generic manufacturers and the Medicines Patent Pool to facilitate the availability of generic versions of our medicine to more than 100 low- and middle-income countries\n- We allocated up to three million courses of therapy to UNICEF for low- and-middle-income countries as a \u201cbridge strategy\u201d until the voluntary licensees were able to supply\n\nThis strategy has been successful to minimize the gap between the supply to high income counties and the supply to LMICs.\n\nWe welcomed the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\u2019s commitment of $120 million to accelerate access to generic versions of our medicine. This commitment complements our voluntary license agreements with generic manufacturers and highlights the importance of actions from multiple stakeholders to effectively increase timely access to medicines for patients globally.\n\nThrough our licensing agreements with generics manufacturers and the Medicines Patent Pool, more than five million courses of generic therapy have been delivered to more than 20 low-and-middle-income countries included in the licenses from 2021-2022.\n\nDonating medicines and vaccines when and where it\u2019s needed\n\nWhen market-based solutions are inadequate or unavailable, we pursue programs to provide direct access to our medicines and vaccines, including product donations and patient assistance programs. In 2022, we reached over 359 million people with product donations through the MECTIZAN Donation Program, the U.S. Patient Assistance Program, and the Merck Medical Outreach Program (MMOP) for disaster relief and humanitarian aid.\n### People reached through donation programs\n\n|                                | 2018  | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  | 2022  |\n|--------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Total estimated number of people reached through donation programs (millions)\\(^1\\) (including MECTIZAN) | 403.6 | 403.7 | 268.3 | 197.3 | 359.2 |\n| Estimated number of people reached through the MECTIZAN Donation Program (millions) | 403.0 | 403.0 | 267.8 | 197.0 | 358.9 |\n| Patients utilizing our U.S. Patient Assistance Program (millions)\\(^2\\) | 0.233 | 0.239 | 0.190 | 0.130 | 0.113 |\n| Estimated number of people reached through the Merck Medical Outreach Program (millions)\\(^3,4\\) | 0.349 | 0.458 | 0.283 | 0.139 | 0.119 |\n\n\\(^1\\) People reached is defined as people who received a medicine or vaccine through the MECTIZAN Donation Program, U.S. Patient Assistance Program, or the Merck Medical Outreach Program.

Conversion factors for this estimate were developed using a combination of IQVIA SMART Data and U.S. product information found on our product website.\n\n\\(^4\\) Decline in patients reached in 2021 and 2022 relative to 2020 and prior years is primarily due to the decreased availability of certain products offered for donation because they moved to Organon & Co. in the 2021 spin-off.\n\n### Product donations\n\n|                                | 2018  | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  | 2022  |\n|--------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Product donations through U.S. Patient Assistance Program (in millions)\\(^1\\) | $1,242 | $1,460 | $1,603 | $1,455 | $1,685 |\n| Product donations for ex-U.S. programs and U.S. disaster relief (in millions)\\(^2,3,4\\) | $1,464 | $1,550 | $1,280 | $284 | $97 |\n\n\\(^1\\) Total contributions for 2021 include approximately $4.9 million for in-kind donations of PPE and other equipment in response to COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\\(^2\\) In 2021, we stopped reporting on the market value of donated MECTIZAN, leading in large part to a decrease in our overall reporting of the value of product donations for ex-U.S. programs.\n\n\\(^3\\) Includes our Medical Outreach Program (including U.S. disaster relief), the MECTIZAN Donation Program and Merck division and subsidiary donations.\n\n\\(^4\\) In 2022, OSBI donated products through MMOP to our NGO partners was valued at $66.2 million in support of the Ukraine crisis specifically and another $26.9 million was donated to other countries outside of the U.S. via our MMOP partnering NGOs.\n\n---\n\n**The MECTIZAN Donation Program**\n\nOur Company has committed to providing as much MECTIZAN as needed for as long as needed to treat river blindness through the MECTIZAN Donation Program (MDP) globally. The 35-year, global program is the longest-running disease-specific drug donation effort of its kind. Our donation commitment has expanded over the years to include the treatment of lymphatic filariasis. Since the program\u2019s inception, our Company has donated nearly five billion MECTIZAN treatments and has made significant impacts on health systems in some of the hardest-to-reach communities around the world. The MDP is one of the most successful public-private health partnerships of its kind.\n\n---\n\nFor more information, please see the [MECTIZAN story](#) on our corporate website.\n### MECTIZAN Donation Program\n\n|                                | 2018  | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  | 2022  |\n|--------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Direct financial investment in the program (in millions)\\(^1\\)\\(^2\\) | $2.20 | $3.10 | $2.74 | $1.88 | $2.12 |\n| Total treatments approved (in millions)                          | 346   | 403   | 417   | 364   | 378   |\n| Treatments approved for river blindness (in millions)            | 111   | 131   | 139   | 105   | 213   |\n| Treatments approved for lymphatic filariasis (LF) in river blindness endemic countries (in millions) | 140   | 141   | 141   | 95    | 64    |\n| Treatments approved for joint river blindness and LF programs (in millions) | 83    | 71    | 75    | 101   | 39    |\n| Treatments approved for lymphatic filariasis (LF) in countries not endemic for river blindness\\(^2\\) | 12    | 60    | 62    | 63    | 62    |\n| River blindness endemic countries where elimination of LF has been validated by the World Health Organization (Target: 30) | 1     | 2     | 3     | 3     | 3     |\n| Latin American countries where the elimination of river blindness has been verified by the World Health Organization (Target: 6) | 4     | 4     | 4     | 4     | 4     |\n\nN/A: Not available.\n\n\\(^1\\) Direct investment includes operational support and grants.\n\n\\(^2\\) Following our Company\u2019s commitment in 2017 to expand the donation of MECTIZAN to support the implementation of triple-therapy for the elimination of LF in certain settings, the MECTIZAN Donation Program expanded in 2018 to include donations for LF elimination in countries not endemic for river blindness.\n\n### Disaster relief\n\nWe are committed to supporting communities around the world that are affected by natural disasters and humanitarian crises. We look to local authorities and humanitarian relief agencies to first assess need and then respond in a timely, coordinated manner. We provide aid through financial and product donations to meet the immediate needs of affected communities.\nDisaster relief\n\n| Year | Total giving value of disaster relief contributions (cash and products, in millions) |\n|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2018 | $10.2                                                                            |\n| 2019 | $16.7                                                                            |\n| 2020 | $20.3                                                                            |\n| 2021 | $9.0                                                                             |\n| 2022 | $100.3                                                                           |\n\n1 Value includes donations made through the Office of Social Business Innovation (OSBI) as well as our Company\u2019s local regions.\n2 We set the value of our product donations based on the U.S. wholesale acquisition cost.\n3 2022 shows a significant increase over prior years due to product and cash donations to the Ukraine crisis.

The MMOP helps expand access to our products, particularly in developing countries, by donating pharmaceuticals and vaccines to a limited number of qualified, U.S.-based NGO partners. The scope and reach of the MMOP varies from year to year and is influenced by changing medical needs in developing countries, the quantity of our medicines available for donation and the unpredictable nature of emergencies or disasters.\n\nAs the war in Ukraine continues, we\u2019re committed to getting life-saving support, medicines, vaccines and supplies to those who need them most. In 2022, we committed donations of more than $100 million in essential products and funds to various organizations, working in tandem with our own subsidiary in the region to ensure that refugees and those who remain inside the country have access to health care.\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continued through 2022, our Company donated 100,000 courses of our investigational antiviral COVID-19 medicine to Direct Relief, a global humanitarian aid organization, for distribution to refugees, including 50,000 courses for people affected by the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nFor more information, please visit the MMOP page on our corporate website.\n\nMedicine Assistance Tool (MAT)\n\nAs a demonstration of our commitment to helping low-income, uninsured patients gain access to Merck medicines and adult vaccines, we participate in the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America\u2019s Medicine Assistance Tool (MAT). MAT is a free search engine designed to help patients, loved ones and health care providers access hundreds of public and private assistance programs. To date, this tool has helped millions of Americans in financial need get free or reduced-cost prescription medicines.\nStrengthening health systems and addressing inequity\n\nIn 2022, we invested $38 million in partnerships, programs and impact investments that support health care capacity building and address underlying barriers to access to health. These social investments accelerate our Company\u2019s purpose of saving and improving lives by advancing global health equity, deploying our resources where and when needed, and creating long-term value for society and our business. We are improving cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment; strengthening the vaccination ecosystem; advancing maternal health and strengthening health systems to advance equitable health outcomes for all patients.\n\nWe provide this support in several ways, including through philanthropic social investments, key initiatives and impact investing. To be most effective, where appropriate we align our investments with country and community-led priorities and partner with governmental, multilateral and nonprofit organizations.\n\nWe reached more than 18 million people in LMICs and underserved populations in the U.S. in 2022 with our social investments, bringing our two-year total (2021-2022) to more than 33 million people, beyond our initial five-year goal of reaching 30 million people. We are further strengthening our longstanding commitment to advancing health equity by setting a more ambitious goal to reach 50 million people by 2025.\n\nIn addition to the people we reach through our social investments, we also track health care workers trained through the initiatives we support\u2014extending impact for years to come. In 2022, our partners trained an estimated 316,000 health workers. This result includes a significant increase in health workers trained through our Merck for Mothers program as we continue to scale those efforts.\n\n### Addressing barriers to health\n\n|                                | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|--------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Further advance health equity by reaching 30 million people in LMICs and underserved populations in the U.S. with our social investments, by 2025 (in millions) | N/A  | N/A  | N/A  | 15   | 18.6 |\n| Health care workers trained through major programs and partnerships (estimated in millions) | 0.067 | 0.068 | 0.078 | 0.099 | 0.316 |\n| Annual investment in partnerships, programs and impact investments that support health care capacity building and address underlying barriers to access to health (in millions) | $37  | $63  | $49  | $36  | $38  |\n| People reached through investment in partnerships, programs and impact investment that support health care capacity building and address underlying barriers to access to health (estimate in millions) | 357  | 422  | 285  | 212  | 378  |\n\n1 Social investments include our Company\u2019s philanthropic partnerships, programs and impact investments. Underserved populations are defined as those that face health disparities due to disadvantages related to insurance status, social determinants of health, race, ethnicity, gender identity/sexual orientation, age and/or language preference. The goal is cumulative across the reporting period of 2021-2025, and is independent of a baseline period.\n\n2 Third-party reporting is used to calculate the number of people reached through social investments. In some cases, third-party reports may include cumulative people reached for the reporting period, and/or data that is attributable to other partners as well as our Company\u2019s philanthropic investment.\n\n3 Represents investments made by our Office of Social Business Innovation.\n\n4 Increase in 2022 driven by Merck for Mothers training programs scaled through digital delivery and with integration into national training campaigns.\nPhilanthropy and health equity\n\nOur philanthropic investments help advance health equity around the world by addressing the barriers that many individuals face in seeking and receiving high-quality health care.\n\nOur approach to these investments is guided by these key principles:\n\n\u2022 Meeting critical global health needs where we can have a meaningful impact\n\u2022 Promoting health equity by helping to reduce health disparities in underserved communities\n\u2022 Collaborating with diverse partners across sectors to build healthier, stronger communities\n\u2022 Leveraging our range of resources (financial, product and expertise) to improve population health outcomes\n\nEstablished in 1957, our Foundation is funded entirely by our Company and is our chief source of financial support for qualified, eligible nonprofit organizations whose programs align with our philanthropic priorities. Since its inception, our Company and Foundation have supported innovative programs and partnerships to improve the health and well-being of people around the world. Through these programs, we believe that by working closely with others\u2014governments, donors, patient groups, health care professionals, nonprofit organizations, academic institutions, multilateral agencies and the private sector\u2014we can help build stronger health systems that provide better and more equitable care.\n\nOur Foundation has invested in programs that help people living with chronic conditions, including cancer, to receive high-quality health care. Over the past five years, we have supported efforts to increase timely access to patient-centered care and reduce disparities in cancer care across the U.S. through the Alliance to Advance Patient-Centered Cancer Care. This $15 million initiative supports evidence-informed, multi-faceted programs to enhance the delivery of equitable cancer care in underserved communities across six U.S. cities.\n\nBuilding on the successes of the Alliance to Advance Patient-Centered Cancer Care, the Foundation launched a new U.S.-based initiative in 2022\u2014the Alliance for Equity in Cancer Care\u2014to address persistent disparities across the cancer care continuum and improve the delivery of high-quality, culturally-responsive care in underserved communities in the U.S. With a $20 million commitment over five years, the Foundation will support the development and implementation of innovative, comprehensive cancer care programs that can improve patient outcomes and help ensure equitable care by addressing access barriers related to social determinants of health.\n\nThe Foundation also supports programs that aim to improve the delivery of cancer care in low- and middle-income countries. Through a grant of nearly $2 million over five years, the Foundation is supporting the American Cancer Society to establish patient navigation programs in resource-limited settings in sub-Saharan Africa and develop a toolkit to help other countries adopt navigation programs as part of delivering comprehensive cancer care.\n\nFor more information on our philanthropy programs, please visit the Philanthropy page on our corporate website.\n\nOur social investments are guided and approved by internal and external expert advisory bodies, including an internal advisory board for our Foundation, an internal Impact Investing Council, an internal Economic Inclusion, Workforce Development and Health Equity Council and external expert advisory committees for the MECTIZAN Donation Program and Merck for Mothers.\nCommunity engagement\n\nWe also recognize that our success depends in large part on our relationships and interactions with local communities, including patients, community leaders, nonprofit organizations, local businesses, schools, elected officials and local media. The communities where we operate are home not only to our customers but also to our workforce and many of our suppliers. It is critical to understand the concerns and needs of our communities and address local challenges so that we can help build stronger communities and support the sustainability of our business.\n\nWe contribute to the economy of local communities directly and indirectly through employment, training, support of local suppliers, local R&D and paying taxes. We also strive to have a positive impact on communities by protecting the environment, maintaining safe operations and respecting human rights.\n\nOur community engagement programs aim to strengthen communities where our employees live and work by helping address critical health and social needs. The Solutions for Healthy Communities program\u2014formerly known as the Neighbor of Choice program\u2014seeks to catalyze innovation in community solutions that facilitate access to quality health care for underserved populations. This program invests in NGOs that are addressing cross-cutting barriers to health care access in the global communities where we operate.\n\nImproving maternal health\n\nMaternal health outcomes highlight the strength of a health system. In many countries, unacceptable and inequitable maternal health outcomes persist. Merck for Mothers is our $650 million global initiative to help create a world where no woman has to die while giving life. For a decade and counting, we have brought Merck\u2019s scientific and business expertise to help carve a path to a better world where maternal health outcomes are more equitable, and pregnancy and childbirth are safer.\n\nOur efforts are focused on bringing fresh thinking and infusing new approaches to help end the longstanding challenge of maternal mortality. We focus on strengthening health systems to sustain the delivery of high-quality maternity care services that benefit women and their communities. With our grantees and collaborators, we are improving health systems for women today and for the long term by advancing quality standards, catalyzing solutions that respond to community needs and harnessing private sector innovations for maternal health.\n\nFor more information, please visit the Merck for Mothers website.\n\nAddressing cancer disparity\n\nIn addition to the philanthropic investments mentioned above, we are building a range of partnerships to strengthen cancer prevention, care and support systems to help improve health equity in underserved communities. In the U.S., we have supported the American Cancer Society\u2019s Get Screened campaign, aimed at reducing existing disparities in cancer screening that have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThrough the CEO Roundtable on Cancer, we support Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) in \u201cGoing for Gold\u201d to help improve health equity, education, navigation and access in communities disproportionately affected by cancer.\n\nGlobally, we collaborate with City Cancer Challenge Foundation to improve equitable access to quality cancer care in nine cities around the world by strengthening patient navigation, care coordination and data capacity through the integration of digital platforms in health systems.\n\nIn working with Go Further, we have created a partnership that aims to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer in women living with HIV who reside in one of 12 African countries, which have some of the highest rates of HIV prevalence and cervical cancer incidence in the world.\nImpact investing and health equity\n\nImpact investing is one of our core approaches to advancing sustainable global health solutions and health equity in line with our Company\u2019s overall objectives. Through impact investing, we deploy financial resources in ways that may generate not only improved access to health care for underserved populations, but also financial returns and strategic opportunities\u2014all while growing a sustainable global health ecosystem and attracting additional capital and partners. In addition, to support the sustainability of our work, we intend to direct any financial returns from our impact investing into new investments to grow our portfolio.\n\nFor example, our Company is an investor in Mamotest, a company providing AI-enabled telediagnosis for breast cancer and digital solutions for oncology patient support for women in Latin America.\n\nFor more information, please visit our Impact Investing page on our corporate website, as well as GRI 201-1 on page 51.\n\nEmbedding health equity capabilities across our Company\n\nOur approach to health equity is key to our Sustainability and Global Diversity & Inclusion (GD&I) commitments, and is reflected in how business units across the enterprise are integrating health equity goals and capabilities in their business strategies and performance objectives.\n\nThese efforts are guided by an enterprise Health Equity Strategic Framework that lays out clear goals, and a roadmap with an implementation plan to guide how we integrate health equity across our core business functions and practices. In 2022, we launched a $1 million Health Equity Catalyst Fund to empower teams at the local and regional levels to create solutions that promote more equitable health outcomes and care experiences, particularly for populations who are underserved. The Health Equity Catalyst Fund is supporting 15 community-level efforts in 13 countries to remove barriers to care and/or strengthen health systems to deliver on high-quality and accountable care.\n\nWe are also investing in strengthening internal data capabilities so that we can apply social determinants of health data to support the design and rollout of effective solutions and partnerships, as well as track key metrics that help us to better understand the impact of our social investments. We support our employees so that they have the latest knowledge and data through the development of training resources, guidelines, tools and a collaborative health equity learning network.\nGlobal Economic Inclusion & Supplier Diversity\n\nGlobal Economic Inclusion & Supplier Diversity (EI&SD) is integrated into our overall Global Diversity & Inclusion (GD&I) strategy, and supports our corporate aspiration. Global Economic Inclusion and Supplier Diversity is a key priority of the GD&I Business Consortium (for more information, see GRI 405 on page 134).\n\nThe EI&SD Center of Excellence (CoE) is the epicenter of our Company\u2019s diverse and inclusive procurement practices. We create economic opportunities for underrepresented communities by procuring products and services from minority-, women-, veteran-, LGBTQ+- and disability-owned enterprises.\n\nOur goals go beyond the amount of money we spend with small and diverse-owned businesses, as we focus on the growth and development of our suppliers to drive economic impact and value delivery to our Company. We are committed to supporting the small and diverse businesses that are the economic engine of growth around the world through global economic inclusion.\n\nAdvanced Leadership Program for Diverse Suppliers\n\nHigh-performing businesses not only build diverse workforces, but also effectively leverage talent to fully realize diverse perspectives. Part of leveraging diverse talent involves partnering with suppliers that understand how to lead and motivate others to achieve common goals, communicate strategies effectively and make sound financial decisions. The Advanced Leadership Program (ALP) for Diverse Suppliers provides an executive development opportunity for diverse business owners to enhance their leadership and business acumen to strengthen and grow their business.\n\nDesigned in collaboration with Drexel University and Diversity Alliance for Science (DA4S), this experiential development program focuses on application and is supported by evidenced-based research and practitioner-industry experience. Participants have an opportunity to engage with Drexel University faculty, their peers, and organizational leaders from our Company in thought-provoking, facilitated discussions that enhance self-reflection and personal development while building relationships across the broader community network.\n\nThe ALP integrated-program modules support an overarching theme of growing and scaling small and/or diverse businesses by building the leadership abilities and business acumen of diverse business owners. Led by an interdisciplinary faculty and subject-matter-expert team, each module provides an experiential and applied approach to executive development. In addition, participants complete a Request for Proposal (RFP) Capstone Challenge that offers an invaluable experience through the coaching and feedback they receive on their presentations and overall performance.\n\nTopic areas include:\n- Leadership, Communication and Teams\n- Building Personal Brand and Storytelling\n- Strategic Networking\n- Digital Presence and Strategy\n- Customer Digital Journey\n- Digital Media Metrics and Measurement\n- Financial Reporting, Planning and Budgeting\n- Short-term and Long-term Business Decisions\n- Intersecting Finance and Operations\n- Operations and Production Planning\n- Purchasing and Contract Management\n\nIn 2022, we had 15 diverse suppliers graduate from our second cohort. We are proud to continue with this program in 2023.\nPerformance\n\nIn 2022, our spend with minority-, women-, veteran-, LGBTQ+- and disability-owned business enterprises represented 14 percent of our total procurement spend.\n\n$3.2 billion\nin spending with diverse Tier 1 and 2 suppliers globally\n\n| Supplier diversity\u2014Tier 1 (in millions)\u00b9 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|----------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Diverse-supplier spend: Global\u00b2        | N/A  | N/A  | N/A  | $2,858 | $2,964 |\n| Diverse-supplier spend: U.S.           | $2,111 | $2,433 | $2,270 | $2,374 | $2,269 |\n| Small-business spend: U.S.            | $973  | $979  | $775  | $1,027 | $1,088 |\n\nN/A: Not available.\n\n\u00b9Status as a diverse-supplier or a small-business supplier is validated at the time of spend with such supplier using applicable criteria.\n\n\u00b2Starting in 2021, our reports include global spend data.\nSecond Tier Diverse Supplier Program\n\nWe have expanded our supplier diversity program through our Second Tier Diverse Supplier Program. In addition to monitoring our own purchases to ensure we have diverse suppliers providing quality goods and services, we also monitor our large Tier 1 suppliers to ensure the inclusion of diverse suppliers within their own supply chain as well.\n\nThe overall objective is to encourage the development of sustainable opportunities for diverse suppliers to participate in the procurement process. The Second Tier Diverse Supplier Program serves as an enhancement to, and not as a replacement for, existing efforts aimed at increasing meaningful opportunities for diverse suppliers to participate at the Tier 1 level.\n\nIn 2022, 21 Tier 1 suppliers participated in our Second Tier Diverse Supplier Program, generating an impact of over $258 million through their inclusion and utilization of diverse suppliers for direct purchases on behalf of our Company.\n\n### Supplier Diversity\u2014Tier 2 (in millions)\n\n|                | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|----------------|------|------|------|\n| Second Tier    | $54  | $115 | $258 |\n\n### Impact spend in the U.S.\\(^1,2\\)\n\n- **$2.269 billion** spending with diverse suppliers\n- **30,405** jobs supported through small and diverse suppliers\n- **$4.8 billion** economic impact through supplier diversity\n- **$1.3 billion** earnings through jobs created/sustained\n\n\\(^1\\) Based on 2022 data.\n\\(^2\\) Billion Dollar Roundtable Economic Impact Study. University of Washington, Foster School of Business.\n\n### Billion Dollar Roundtable\n\nOur ongoing economic inclusion and supplier diversity efforts will enable us to continue our membership in the Billion Dollar Roundtable (BDR), an exclusive industry organization that recognizes and celebrates corporations that achieve spending of at least $1 billion with minority-, women-, veteran-, LGBTQ+- and disability-owned enterprises headquartered in the U.S. and globally.\n\nOur membership in the BDR allows us to share and access best practices in supply chain diversity excellence with other organizations that have also achieved this status. As part of our 35 years of inclusion and impact, we hosted the 2022 Billion Dollar Roundtable Summit with the theme, \u201cThe Future is Now: Supplier Diversity as a Force of Sustainability, Economic Equality and Societal Impact.\u201d\nThe Summit provided another opportunity to chart a course for the bold and transformative steps that are urgently needed to ensure we are optimizing positive economic impact to some of our most distressed areas, sharing best practices and encouraging global partners to continue to deliver on our purpose.\n\nTo learn more about our involvement with BDR, please visit our corporate website.\n\nIn addition to the Billion Dollar Roundtable, we work in partnership with others, including:\n\n- Canadian Aboriginal and Minority Supplier Development Council (CAMSDC)\n- Disability:IN\n- European LGBTIQ Chamber of Commerce (EGLCC)\n- Integrare\u2014Integrare Centro de Integra\u00e7\u00e3o de Neg\u00f3cios (Brazil)\n- LGBT-owned Business Certification in Canada (CGLCC)\n- Minority-owned Business Certification in Canada (CAMSC)\n- Minority Supplier Development Council UK (MSDUK)\n- National LGBT Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC)\n- National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC)\n- National Veterans Business Development Council (NVBDC)\n- South Africa Supplier Diversity Council (SASDC)\n- SupplyNation (Australia)\n- United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce (USHCC)\n- United States Pan Asian American Chamber of Commerce (USPAACC)\n- WBE Canada\n- WeConnect International\n- Women Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC)\n\nGlobal Economic inclusion in South Africa\n\nFor more than 10 years, we have pursued economic inclusion and supplier diversity efforts outside of the U.S. as well. We believe that global supplier diversity can help foster inclusivity, drive innovation, expand market reach, reduce risks, comply with regulations and build a positive reputation. One example of our efforts outside of the U.S. is in South Africa, where we are proud to be creating a more sustainable and resilient supply chain while making a positive economic impact.\n\nDespite the right to equality, not all people in South Africa are born into equal circumstances. The history of South Africa has resulted in an economic and opportunities disparity based on race, and has resulted in many Black people in South Africa continuing to experience economic marginalization in one of the world\u2019s most unequal societies. Broad-Based, Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) is a government policy to advance economic transformation and enhance the economic participation of Black people in the South African economy.\n\nB-BBEE related strategies that we establish help achieve this goal and ensure that our South African subsidiary is compliant with the government\u2019s B-BBEE regulations while helping to transform South Africa. The B-BBEE program is also an important strategic enabler to our Company\u2019s growth strategy in the region and key to addressing the significant unmet health needs of patients. Our efforts include a $756,000 grant through MSD for Mothers to Unjani Clinics. This clinic is a South African-based, low-fee primary health care organization that services patients in disadvantaged communities who cannot afford private health insurance, so that they can access basic services such as maternal health. As part of this grant, we supported the ACFS-Feeding Scheme, a nonprofit organization that provides meals, school materials, clothing and toiletries to 1,000 children from child-headed households. These households are led by children largely due to the continuing challenges linked with HIV/AIDS.\n\nFurthermore, to address youth unemployment, which sits at a staggering 59 percent in South Africa, we are a proud participant in the Youth Employment Service (YES) Initiative. This program seeks to connect talented and engaged young work seekers to various opportunities, and hosts its own biennial graduate development program, which has provided jobs to 30 youth since its inception in 2021.\n\nFor more information on our procurement practices and supplier diversity, please also see GRI 2-6 on page 35, GRI 308 on page 112, GRI 405 on page 134 and GRI 414 on page 145.\nAnti-corruption\n\nGRI 205  Management approach\n\nOur Company is built on its reputation for ethics and integrity forged with health care professionals (HCPs), patients and other stakeholders. Bribery and corruption are illegal, tarnish a company\u2019s reputation, and undermine public trust. Offering or paying bribes or kickbacks is against the laws of the markets where we do business.\n\nWe are committed to observing the laws and regulations that govern our operations and activities wherever we do business. To that end, we maintain policies, procedures and processes that apply to Company activities involving transfer of value (TOV), including TOV to HCPs and third-party intermediaries that perform agreed-to services on our behalf.\n\nWe have a well-established global ethics and compliance program that is consistent with the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA) Code of Practice requirements, as well as with other applicable regional or country industry codes of conduct, including those issued by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA).\n\nOur Board of Directors and senior management, including our chief ethics and compliance officer, provide the foundational elements of leadership, accountability and structure to oversee the Company\u2019s global ethics and compliance program. Our chief ethics and compliance officer reports directly to our CEO, and provides regular updates to senior leaders and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on key indicators of ethical culture and compliance and risk trends. This reporting structure supports transparent and independent communication of relevant risk information relating to ethics and compliance issues.\n\nOur Company\u2019s anti-bribery/anti-corruption program and policies give employees (and third parties with whom we engage) the awareness, knowledge and resources to operate with integrity and comply with applicable laws and regulations, and to understand that we will not tolerate any act, or even the appearance, of impropriety.\n\nGRI 205-2  Communications and training on anti-corruption\n\nAnnual ethics and policy certification\n\nAn important component of our corporate ethics and compliance program is our annual ethics and policy certification. The annual review process requires selected employees to certify adherence to the Code of Conduct and corporate policies on preventing bribery and corruption, antitrust-law compliance, conflict of interest and insider trading. These employees are also expected to regulate their outside activities to avoid any conflicts of interest and to certify, in writing, whether actual or potential conflicts of interest exist. Where potential conflicts are identified, the Office of Ethics will work with management to take actions to mitigate the potential conflict.\n\nIn addition, U.S.-based (including Puerto Rico) employees must certify compliance with our policy on the effects of exclusions, debarments, suspensions and health care-related criminal convictions, reporting and screening. The annual compliance certification process is supplemented by periodic market and regional risk-based discussions and ongoing risk data monitoring.\nTraining is an important part of creating a strong ethics and compliance culture. To ensure that all employees understand our ethical expectations and principles, we provide an annual ethics and compliance training series that includes relevant content to enable employees to perform with integrity and to make appropriate value-based decisions in the course of their work.\n\nIn 2022, more than 99 percent of our employees completed assigned training on anti-bribery and anti-corruption. Supplemental training on anti-bribery and anti-corruption is provided for employees who engage with non-U.S. government officials. As our Company is headquartered in the U.S., with a global footprint, our employees in the Human Health Division outside of the U.S. are made aware of the implication of statutes like the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\n\nEmployees in the Human Health Division in the U.S. are also required to understand, among other things, their responsibilities under the Anti-Kickback Statute, the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act and applicable FDA promotional regulations.\n\n>99% employees trained on anti-bribery and anti-corruption\n\nAnti-competitive behavior\n\nOur Company believes that our customers\u2014and society as a whole\u2014benefit from fair, free and open markets. While ours is a competitive industry where it is important that we compete aggressively, it is equally important that we do so fairly, legally and based on the merits of our products and services.\n\nOur interactions with customers, suppliers and competitors are governed by antitrust and competition laws, as well as corporate policies. We enforce these external and internal standards through our ethics and compliance program.\n\nWe recognize that our reputation for integrity, trust, honesty and fair dealing continues to be dependent on our ethical practices. Consequently, we want to make certain that the ways in which we promote customer choice, business relationships and business practices are positive and fair. Our professional sales representatives are guided by our policies to recognize that competitive advantage is gained through the merits of our products and services, never through unethical or illegal business practices.\nFostering pro-competition practices\n\nWe believe that our marketing, sales and advertising activities make an important contribution to medicine by informing our customers of treatment options based on the most recent scientific information and findings from rigorous clinical studies.\n\nOur sales and marketing practices are governed by external laws and regulations and industry codes of conduct, our own global Code of Conduct, our corporate policies and procedures, and our ethics and compliance program.\n\nOur ethics and compliance program addresses and seeks to prevent inappropriate practices, and we evaluate our policies and procedures as appropriate. Our practices are monitored and compliance is enforced, to ensure that our interactions with customers and consumers do not include making unsubstantiated competitive claims. Also, a part of the business requires the Company to communicate with policymakers and other stakeholders to address certain gaps in a market and promote patient access. In such interactions, we are careful not to develop tactics aimed at preventing or delaying access of generic products into the market, and such communications are governed by our marketing communications principles.\n\nThe first option is to talk with their manager. If they do not feel comfortable with that course of action, the other resources they may contact are:\n\n- Divisional Compliance Departments\n- Office of Ethics\n- Privacy Office\n- Office of General Counsel\n- Human Resources Department\n- MSDethics.com\n\nIn addition to mandatory training on our Code of Conduct, employees receive training on other levels of business practice and compliance according to their roles and responsibilities. We evaluate and update the content for all marketing and sales training periodically to ensure that it remains relevant and current.\n\nWhile antitrust and competition laws may differ in the countries where our Company operates, the fundamental principles remain the same. From a broad perspective, antitrust and competition laws are legislated to promote competitive markets with the notion that when competitors and sellers can compete effectively against each other, customers will be the ultimate beneficiary. All employees are educated on the overall principles and, with the help of the relevant legal and compliance functions, they are expected to carry out their duties in a pro-competitive manner while safeguarding and advancing the Company\u2019s interests.\n\nAll new employees receive training and testing, and must be certified on relevant policies and our Company\u2019s ethical operating standards. Although many of our employees who market and sell our medicines and vaccines have advanced scientific or medical degrees and backgrounds, all of our sales representatives must complete general sales and product training. Training is specific to the country where an employee is based and covers the scope of the employee\u2019s responsibilities in ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We stress that if our employees are unsure about the appropriateness of the conduct that they ask for help. There are several places where employees can turn for assistance.\n\nTax\n\nFor information on our tax strategy, the responsible party within our Company and our approach to compliance, please see our Global Tax Strategy on our corporate website.\nEnvironmental\n\nMaterials\n\nGRI 301 Management approach\n\nBy using more efficient and innovative processing methods and technologies, we are reducing the amount of energy, water and raw materials we use to make our products, thereby minimizing the amount of waste we generate. We go to great lengths to ensure that our products are designed and made in a safe, effective and environmentally sound manner.\n\nWe deliver on this commitment by maintaining a highly trained and capable scientific staff, and by actively pursuing manufacturing process improvements that minimize environmental impacts. We have set environmental sustainability goals with concrete targets and timelines to demonstrate this commitment. To ensure that our knowledge stays current with that of thought leaders and experts in the industry, we also collaborate with external resources and industry groups, such as the American Chemical Society (ACS), the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) and Animal Health Europe (AHE).\n\nProducts\n\nWe conduct extensive testing of our products to identify and understand any potential safety, health and environmental hazards. We manage and communicate information about hazardous materials to keep our employees, contractors, transporters and other partners safe.\n\nWe are actively engaged in conversations on product stewardship to understand and act on the issues specific to our industry worldwide. We share best practices within the industry via our membership in the Conference Board Product Stewardship Council, the American Chemistry Council\u2019s (ACC) Green Chemistry Initiative, the EFPIA, the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA) and the ACS Green Chemistry Institute Pharmaceutical Roundtable (ACS GCIPR). Our objective is to maintain compliance and assure supply of lifesaving medicines as we look to further minimize our future environmental footprint.\nOur Company also supports the development of science-based, cost-effective and environmentally sound programs that promote the proper disposal of unused medicines and their packaging in accordance with regional requirements.\n\nFor more information, see our position statement on the responsible disposal of medicines, which can be found on our corporate website.\n\nGovernance\n\nOur efforts in this area are overseen by our Green & Sustainable Science Steering Committee and our Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Council.\n\nPrograms and initiatives\n\nOur chemists and engineers are trained in green design principles and are provided with tools and resources to help them develop manufacturing processes that use safer chemicals and reduced quantities of raw materials. We use innovations like nanotechnology to make our products more effective, while ensuring that product safety always remains of utmost importance.\n\nComplying with chemical substance and product requirements is a top priority for us. We track numerous existing and emerging chemical control regulations that require us to register specific types of chemicals with the proper authorities. To meet these requirements, our scientists complete assessments of the environmental and human health risks of the substances with which we work and submit the required regulatory notifications. Additionally, we provide details on product use and risk-based control measures in accordance with applicable regulations.\n\nPackaging\n\nOur product stewardship program extends to our customers and patients through the design of effective, low-impact product packaging.\n\nThese packaging materials serve a range of important purposes; the foremost is to protect the purity, efficacy and physical integrity of the products that reach our patients.\n\nPackaging also helps ensure our products are used safely, conveniently and with adherence. Prescribing and educational information is conveyed at the point of purchase and packaging can include child-resistant access, tamper-evident features and anti-counterfeiting features.\n\nIn addition to these critical packaging functions, we recognize the environmental impact of our packaging. After it has served its critical functions, packaging becomes our patient or caregiver\u2019s waste and therefore must be accounted for.\n\nWe are actively re-imagining our approach to reducing the environmental impact of our packaging. We have developed a long-term roadmap to fundamentally change our business processes, including better prediction, quantification and verification of impact to drive changes in product, packaging and supply chain designs. We intend to integrate this roadmap into our ways of working, and ultimately use it to reduce our environmental impact.\n\nA foundational part of our path forward includes evolving how we measure and maintain packaging data to enable transparent, data-driven decision making. This includes:\n\n- Reduction of packaging material mass\n- Minimization or elimination of materials of concern\n- New materials research\n- Introducing more recycled content into our packaging\n- Increasing the recyclability of our packaging systems\n\nWe continue to use a simplified life cycle analysis tool as a standard business practice. All new human health packaging designs are reviewed in the development process to understand and minimize environmental impacts as much as possible, while still providing adequate protection for our products.\n\nWe continue to monitor global trends around packaging and packaging materials, and work to incorporate circular economy concepts into the critical functions of packaging for pharmaceuticals.\nGovernance\n\nEnvironmental packaging is managed by the Global Pharmaceutical Commercialization and Global Pharmaceutical Operations areas of the Company with oversight from our Environmental Health and Safety Council.\n\nIn 2022, we responded to the CDP forest questionnaire for timber products, specifically for paper and secondary and tertiary packaging. CDP graded our disclosure with a C- \u201cAwareness\u201d rating, indicating that we have \u201cKnowledge of impacts on, and of, forests issues\u201d. According to CDP, our Company is among 57 percent of companies that reached \u201cAwareness\u201d level in our Activity Group (Biotech and pharma) for timber. We performed a gap assessment of our questionnaire response and developed a roadmap for improvements in this area over the next several years. We are in the early stages of our program development and are in the process of assessing the impact of other forest risk commodities.\n\nSolvent use\n\nSolvents play a key role in the research and manufacturing of our products, as well as in equipment cleaning. Because of their significance to our business and the life cycle impact they represent, we focus on designing our processes to minimize or avoid their use where practical. Where we do use solvents, we maximize efficiency and control them in our emissions, effluents and waste.\n\nWe have an active Green and Sustainable Science program (see page 28) to design our new processes using fewer, less toxic solvents and other hazardous materials, and to reuse and recycle more of the solvents we do use.\n\nFor cleaning our manufacturing equipment, we use water-based methods where they are as effective as solvents. At each of our manufacturing sites, we have engineers who are responsible for identifying and driving process improvement projects. When it is not practical to reuse regenerated solvents in our own production processes, we work with suppliers who recover the spent solvents for resale to other industries or safely burn them as a source of energy, where feasible. Any used solvents that leave our site as hazardous waste are managed at off-site facilities that are on our list of approved waste management sites.\n\nChemical management\n\nA comprehensive and effective chemical management program is critical to the safety and protection of our employees, the communities in which we operate, and the environment.\n\nWe have put in place procedures, systems and processes to manage the approval, procurement, inventory, receipt, transfer, storage, use and disposal of chemicals at all of our sites. We provide our employees and others with information about the identities and potential hazards of the chemicals in our operations and final products through proper labeling of chemicals and the creation of safety data sheets.\n\nGreen and sustainable science\n\nGreen and sustainable science is the development and application of green chemistry principles and quantitative sustainability metrics and goals to the process of scientific inquiry. Our Company employs this framework because we recognize that our ability to meet our environmental sustainability goals is intrinsically linked to the creation of innovative and cost-efficient manufacturing processes with low environmental impact. Green and sustainable commercial chemical route development also helps to mitigate potential issues in the supply chain of tomorrow by reducing our raw material requirements today. Our Company\u2019s objective in this space is to be the industry leader for the development of innovative, efficient, green and sustainable commercial syntheses of our small molecule active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) from sustainable commodity raw materials. We are also exploring ways to reduce the environmental impact of biologics and vaccine manufacturing.\n\nStrategy\n\nOur integrated strategy involves several stages and aims to provide innovative solutions rather than incremental improvements to historical practices. We see transformative science/engineering and innovation as critical enablers to developing sustainable, low-cost manufacturing processes that provide both environmental and economic benefits over the life cycle of\nour products. We aim to develop the most efficient and sustainable processes at product launch, with the goal of minimizing material use and waste from our commercial manufacturing. Our Company utilizes an innovative \u201cgreen-by-design\u201d development strategy to progress from an initial early clinical supply route to a fully optimized and sustainable commercial manufacturing process.\n\nPrograms and initiatives\nAs part of our Green & Sustainable Science program, we calculate the process mass intensity (PMI) of our small molecule human health products. PMI represents the number of kilograms of raw materials (including water) used to produce one kilogram of an API, and indicates the efficiency by which we convert raw materials into final products. We use this metric internally to compare different manufacturing methods, identify process improvement opportunities and track our progress.\n\nWe have developed a SMART (in-Silico MSD Aspirational Research Tool) PMI tool which provides ambitious, molecule-aware PMI targets for our API manufacturing processes. We routinely evaluate PMI at every stage to drive the development of all our new small molecule processes to achieve our aspirational goals for green and sustainable processes. For our large-molecule processes, we are pioneering new modality-appropriate metrics which outperform PMI in their ability to recommend ways of reducing the environmental impact of biologics and vaccine manufacturing. We are also using streamlined life cycle analysis tools to further evaluate the environmental impacts of our processes.\n\nAmerican Chemical Society's Green Chemistry Institute\nWe are a founding member of the American Chemical Society's (ACS) Green Chemistry Institute\u00ae (GCI) Pharmaceutical Roundtable, a partnership between the ACS GCI and member pharmaceutical companies. The Roundtable drives the advancement of education and research on new ways to apply green and sustainable science to pharmaceutical discovery and manufacturing. This is done through the development of industry-wide sustainability metrics, tools and technologies.\n\nAwards and recognition in green chemistry\nSince the establishment of the Green Chemistry Challenge Awards by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the American Chemistry Society (ACS) in 1996, we have been recognized with nine Green Chemistry Awards for innovative process improvements with six of those consecutively since 2017. The Green Chemistry Challenge Awards have been sponsored by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and/or ACS, and we are proud to have been recognized. In 2022, we were recognized for developing a greener process to manufacture our investigational antiviral COVID-19 medicine. Lastly, our Company has been honored by ACS as the winner of the Peter J. Dunn Award for Green Chemistry & Engineering Impact in the Pharmaceutical Industry for the last three years.\n\nLearn more about the Green Chemistry Awards and how we are safeguarding the environment through green chemistry on our corporate website.\nEnergy\n\nGRI 302 Management approach\n\nWe recognize the important role we play in identifying, adapting and responding to the public health risks associated with climate change, such as threats to clean air and water, insufficient food supplies and the spread of disease. Our longstanding support of stronger health systems in underserved areas is even more important given the evidence that certain disease patterns are associated with changing climate conditions.\n\nEnergy-demand reduction and the utilization of renewable energy are an essential part of our climate mitigation strategy, as it positively impacts our efforts to reduce our direct GHG emissions.\n\nPrograms and initiatives\n\nWe have established internal policies and practices focused on reducing energy use at our sites. We will achieve this by optimizing systems and equipment, consolidating excess facility space when possible and designing with the environment in mind. In addition, we have launched initiatives to understand and reduce our supply-chain-related impacts. By taking these steps, we are not only minimizing GHG emissions but also reducing our operating costs and mitigating the business impacts associated with climate change.\n\nOur manufacturing facilities, warehouses, laboratories, offices and vehicle fleet are the primary targets of our energy-demand-reduction programs, as they represent the majority of our energy consumption. Our Global Energy & Sustainability Center of Excellence (CoE) supports sites by providing them with tools, best practices and access to funding for energy saving projects.\n\nFor further information on our Sustainability Capital Fund, please see GRI 201-2 on page 52.\nRenewable energy\n\nWe have committed to sourcing 100 percent of our purchased electricity from renewable energy by 2025. Photovoltaic (PV) arrays, wind turbines and other renewable-energy installations avoid emissions, help reduce energy demand peaks and postpone or preclude adding new power plants. We continually look for opportunities for new on-site installations, vendor-supplied renewable energy through the electrical grid and virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA) and power purchase agreement (PPA) projects.\n\nAs of early 2023, our continued efforts at renewable energy procurement since 2019 have resulted in a total of 208 MW of VPPA and PPA commitments. The regional breakdown of these commitments is as follows:\n\n- North America: 118 MW\n- Europe: 85 MW\n- Asia Pacific: 4.6 MW\n\nIn addition to these commitments, a 7.3 MW solar PV array installation was completed at a site in Ireland in 2022. This array is providing 20.6 percent of the total site demand.\n\nVehicle fleet\n\nApproximately seven percent of our total energy use is associated with our vehicle fleet. We have a roadmap to transition to a full battery electric vehicle (BEV) fleet. The implementation depends on the availability of like-for-like electric vehicles (EV) and the development of public charging infrastructure. Our current emphasis includes introducing hybrid vehicles as a bridge in Latin America and Asia Pacific/Japan (APJ), deploying EVs in mature European, Middle Eastern and African (EMEA) markets, and starting EV pilots in North America. Currently, these vehicles account for 18 percent of our fleet in EMEA; 59 percent in APJ; and 1 percent in Latin America and North America. However, the worldwide vehicle supply shortage has slowed our transition.\n### Total energy use\n\n| Year | 2018       | 2019       | 2020       | 2021       | 2022       |\n|------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Total energy use (GJ) | 18,274,900 | 17,710,000 | 17,182,600 | 17,224,600 | 17,516,000 |\n\n### Scope 1 and location-based Scope 2 energy use (% of total)\n\n| Source of Energy | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Natural gas (Scope 1) | 62%  | 62%  | 64%  | 62%  | 63%  |\n| Renewable energy generated and used on site (Scope 1) | 0.06% | 0.07% | 0.06% | 0.06% | 0.09% |\n| Fleet fuel (Scope 1) | 10%  | 9%   | 7%   | 7%   | 7%   |\n| Fuel oil (Scope 1) | 2%   | 2%   | 2%   | 2%   | 2%   |\n| Biofuel (Scope 1) | 0.7% | 0.6% | 0.7% | 0.8% | 0.2% |\n| Spent solvents (Scope 1) | 0%   | 0%   | 0%   | 0%   | 0%   |\n| Coal (Scope 1) | 0%   | 0%   | 0%   | 0%   | 0%   |\n| Purchased electricity (Scope 2) | 22%  | 23%  | 23%  | 25%  | 24%  |\n| Purchased steam (Scope 2) | 3%   | 3%   | 3%   | 3%   | 3%   |\n\nNote: We have defined \u201cpurchased electricity\u201d as electricity sourced from external suppliers as well as renewable electricity that was generated and utilized on site where we retained the renewable attributes or where we have obtained renewable attributes through contract.\n\n1 May not add to 100 percent due to rounding.\n\n2 Includes solar, wind and other renewables generated on site where renewable energy credits or guarantees of origin have been retained or retired.\n\n3 Reported using Scope 2 location-based value in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.\n\n4 Includes solar, wind and other renewables generated on site where renewable energy credits (RECs) have been sold.\n### Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 energy use (% of total)\n\n| Source of Energy                        | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|----------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Natural gas (Scope 1)                  | 62%  | 62%  | 64%  | 62%  | 63%  |\n| Renewable energy generated and used on site or purchased (Scope 1) | 2%   | 6%   | 9%   | 10%  | 10%  |\n| Fleet fuel (Scope 1)                   | 10%  | 9%   | 7%   | 7%   | 7%   |\n| Fuel oil (Scope 1)                     | 2%   | 2%   | 2%   | 2%   | 2%   |\n| Biofuel (Scope 1)                      | 0.7% | 0.6% | 0.7% | 0.8% | 0.2% |\n| Spent solvents (Scope 1)               | 0%   | 0%   | 0%   | 0%   | 0%   |\n| Coal (Scope 1)                         | 0%   | 0%   | 0%   | 0%   | 0%   |\n| Purchased electricity (Scope 2)        | 20%  | 17%  | 14%  | 15%  | 15%  |\n| Purchased steam (Scope 2)              | 3%   | 3%   | 3%   | 3%   | 3%   |\n\n1.

Our CDP Climate Change Questionnaire is available on CDP\u2019s website.\nWater and effluents\n\nGRI 303 Management approach\n\nAs we strive to meet the health needs of our patients, we understand that we may encounter water risks in the areas in which we operate. Our global water strategy aims to achieve sustainable water management within our operations and our supply chain, which supports UN SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation.\n\nTo achieve these strategic objectives, we are focusing on the following commitments:\n\n- Ensuring that our wastewater discharges comply with local and national standards, as well as internal requirements\n- Understanding and controlling our operational water footprint\n- Managing water risk at our facilities and in our supply chain\n- Reporting publicly on our water use and goals\n\nIn our Business Partner Code of Conduct, we request that suppliers conserve natural resources and engage in activities aimed at reducing water usage. We also ask that they have systems in place to quantify the amount of water used.\n\nGovernance\n\nEach site is responsible for management of water resources. Water management is overseen globally by the Water Center of Excellence (CoE). This CoE reviews water data to monitor sites\u2019 progress and provides assistance as needed to support sites\u2019 work towards meeting our goals.\n\nThe Environmental Review Committee provides oversight in establishing our internal Environmental Quality Criteria (EQC) standards.\n\nFor more detailed information on our environmental management and governance, please see the Environmental Health and Safety Management and Governance document on the Sustainability Resources page on our corporate website.\n\nWe have established water goals to help us manage water-related risks in our operations.\n\nWater goal\n\n| Goal | Performance in 2022 |\n|------|---------------------|\n| We will maintain global water use at or below 2015 levels. | 3.9 million m\u00b3 reduction (17% below 2015 levels) |\n| Target Year: 2025 |\n\nStewardship\n\nWe have endorsed the UN CEO Water Mandate, a public commitment to adopt and implement a comprehensive approach to water management, and we have aligned our water program with its principles. CEO Water Mandate endorsers have a responsibility to make water resource management a priority and to work with governments, UN agencies, NGOs, local communities and other interested parties to address global water challenges. We continue to work to identify partnerships that will help us advance our water stewardship priorities in the areas in which we operate. These projects also support the goals of SDG 15, which strives to \u201cprotect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems.\u201d We report our water security annually through CDP. In 2022, CDP graded our disclosure with a B- \u201cmanagement\u201d rating, indicating that we \u201cprovide evidence of actions associated with good environmental management\u201d and are \u201ctaking coordinated action on water security.\u201d\nIn 2022, through The Nature Conservancy (TNC) we supported the implementation of green stormwater infrastructure projects in the Delaware River watershed. This was done in collaboration with private, community-based landowners such as affordable housing providers, schools and social service institutions, along with the Philadelphia Water Department. The project aims to reduce stormwater runoff and improve water quality to help make the Delaware River and its tributaries more swimmable, fishable and drinkable for millions of residents in the region.\n\nGreen stormwater infrastructure presents an attractive and effective water quality solution using tangible, on-the-ground, nature-based projects\u2014rain gardens, permeable pavements, green roofs, pocket parks, planters and other water-slowing, natural solutions\u2014to keep stormwater runoff out of sewer systems, rivers and streams while adding safe, beautiful, green spaces to communities.\n\nThe contribution to TNC will support the design and implementation of projects across multiple blocks in the city that will filter stormwater pollution, restore urban habitat, create new green spaces, and provide many other layered benefits to residents. Our West Point, Pennsylvania facility is located within the Delaware River watershed and this project demonstrates our commitment to collective action in the catchments where our manufacturing sites operate. As a result of COVID-related delays, the project is taking place in 2023.\n\nIn 2021, through TNC, we supported a watershed conservation project in Montes Claros, Minas Gerais, Brazil with a $100,000 contribution to the Belo Horizonte Water fund, led by the Agencia Peixe Vivo. As a result of COVID-related delays, the project was completed in 2022. This TNC-sponsored project promotes governance strengthening of local partners to enable the restoration of native forest, implement soil conservation techniques, make improvements to dirt roads and conserve existing forests in the Juramento River watershed. The Juramento River is a source of potable water for the City of Montes Claros, and the water security at our manufacturing operations in Montes Claros is directly impacted by this project.\n\nTNC and partners expect that this project will improve water security in the city of Montes Claros through:\n\n- Increasing rainwater infiltration\n- Creating a more stable outflow of water over the course of the year\n- Reducing erosion and sedimentation\nAccess to clean water is critical for human health and is a key input to our manufacturing operations. We assess water risk throughout our network as a standard business practice.\n\nOur process is as follows:\n\n1. The World Resource Institute\u2019s (WRI) Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas tool is used as an initial step to map water risk. Sites are categorized annually using the \u201cBaseline Water Stress\u201d indicator, which is the ratio of total annual water withdrawals to total annual renewable supply and accounts for upstream consumptive use. Higher stress values indicate more competition among water users.\n\n2. Sites that are identified as high risk are further assessed utilizing a catchment-specific approach to confirm that the catchments are experiencing high water stress.\n\n3. Sites that are known to experience water risk, regardless of the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas tool assessment, are included as high-risk sites.\n\n4. Water conservation plans are put in place at high-risk sites that use more than 100,000 m$^3$ of water per year. We work with a third-party water use expert to evaluate opportunities for water use reductions at these sites, resulting in site-specific water conservation plans.\n\n5. Sites that do not meet the water use threshold will continue to be monitored for operational risk and conservation plans will be put in place as needed.\n\nPerforming this assessment ensures that we can adapt our strategy to changing stressors in each catchment. It enables us to better prioritize facilities and catchments for water stewardship activities and lays the foundation for potential future water targets in priority locations.\n\nIn 2022, the WRI tool identified four of our manufacturing and/or research facilities as being in areas with \u201cextremely high\u201d Baseline Water Stress, and 12 as being in areas with \u201chigh\u201d Baseline Water Stress. In 2022, there were two more sites in areas of \u201cextremely high\u201d and four more sites in \u201chigh\u201d risk than in 2021 due to sites coming in and out of the network. As a result of the above methodology, we continue to have two sites that have water conservation plans in place.\n\nThe sites that use the most water in our network are located in the U.S. Of these, two are in areas of \u201chigh\u201d Baseline Water Stress according to the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas tool but, through the assessment process described above, are considered medium risk.\n\nWe conduct environmental risk assessments on our products (small molecules, biologics and vaccines) from the development phase through product launch, to understand and manage product impacts both from manufacturing and patient use. We assess products in a manner consistent with the most stringent applicable global regulations, including the regulatory review processes of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. Product environmental safety profiles are reassessed during periodic renewals of product filings, and risk-mitigation actions are implemented when needed.\n\nWe use the information from our risk assessments to establish or update our internal, compound-specific EQCs, which are used to confirm that wastewater discharged from our facilities does not contain levels of residual products that present a risk to human health or the environment. Our manufacturing facilities are required to use these EQCs, along with industry-accepted risk assessment methods, to establish procedures for managing and controlling active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in their wastewater.\n\nEach facility uses the internal EQC standards to:\n\n- Assess the potential risk from its operations using science-based and industry-accepted risk assessment methods\n- Minimize environmental impacts from wastewater discharges in the local watershed\n- Establish procedures for managing, treating or controlling APIs in wastewater prior to discharge where needed\nOur facilities have, or will be provided with, API-treatment technology such as advanced oxidation where needed, so that our wastewater discharges meet both regulatory requirements and these internal standards.\n\nWe also provide wastewater discharge criteria to suppliers that manufacture pharmaceutical compounds for us and have initiated detailed assessments of our suppliers to better understand and address potential impacts.\n\nAs a member of the Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Alliance and signatory to the Industry Roadmap for Progress on Combating AMR, we are working to deliver on our commitments to reduce the environmental impacts from antibiotic residues in wastewater through implementation of the AMR Alliance Common Antibiotic Manufacturing Framework. We have reviewed the operations of our human health antibiotic manufacturing facilities and third-party human health antibiotic suppliers to assess their wastewater treatment controls. We have developed a mechanism for transparently demonstrating that our supply chain meets the standards in this framework, which was presented in the AMR Industry Alliance Progress Report.\n\nWe participate in efforts to address water-discharge-related impacts with various organizations, including the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA). The EFPIA, Medicines for Europe and the Association of the European Self-Medication Industry (AESGP) have worked together to develop the Eco-Pharmaco-Stewardship (EPS) initiative. The EPS initiative considers the environmental impacts of a medicine throughout its entire life cycle, and addresses the roles and responsibilities of all parties in managing those impacts. This includes public services, the pharmaceutical industry, environmental experts, doctors, pharmacists and patients.\n\nFor more information on our supply chain, please see section GRI 2-6 on page 35.\n\nPlease refer to the following resources for additional information related to water stewardship and related discharge impacts on our corporate website:\n\n- Public policy statement: Water Stewardship\n- Public policy statement: Pharmaceuticals in the Environment\n- Global Antimicrobial Resistance Action Plan\n- CDP Water Security\n- Business Partner Code of Conduct\n\n### Water use by source (million m\u00b3)\u00b9\n\n| Source            | 2015 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|-------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Groundwater       | 12.0 | 10.3 | 10.2 | 10.1 | 9.7  | 10.1\u00b2|\n| Third-party water | 7.1  | 7.2  | 6.9  | 7.0  | 7.1  | 7.1\u00b2 |\n| Total surface water | 3.9  | 2.3  | 2.6  | 2.9  | 2.6  | 2.0\u00b2 |\n| Total             | 23.0 | 19.8 | 19.7 | 20.0 | 19.3 | 19.1\u00b2|\n\nERM CVS provided limited assurance of select 2022 greenhouse gas and water data included in this report and submitted to CDP.

Water withdrawal is variable based on manufacturing and research activities year to year.\n\nApproximately 10 percent of the total water we used in 2022 was supplied from surface water sources, and 53 percent was supplied by groundwater water sources, with the balance sourced from third-party water supplies. Our sites employ a variety of technologies and techniques aimed at reducing our water footprint and improving operational performance.\n\nClosed-loop cooling systems, which reduce freshwater use, are employed at many of our facilities worldwide. Reverse osmosis (RO) \u201creject water\u201d is reused for non-potable and non-process applications such as cooling tower feed water. In all, 1.0 million cubic meters of water was recovered, reused or recycled at our facilities in 2022, which is equivalent to five percent of our total water use.\n\nOur water use reduction initiatives include:\n- Consideration of water use in process design\n- Cooling system optimization\n- Prompt repairs and maintenance of steam distribution systems and traps\n- Recovery and reuse of steam condensate and \u201creject water\u201d\n- Process water purification system optimization\n- Avoiding the use of water in mechanical seals, such as those in pumps\n\nAn innovative project was completed in 2022 to reduce water consumption from cooling towers at our Singapore West manufacturing facility. The project involved utilizing air conditioning condensate as make-up water for cooling towers to reduce third-party water usage. To mitigate the potential for corrosion and bacterial growth, a new water chemistry control skid was installed to ensure there was no impact to the cooling water chemistry. With the completion of this project, the site, which is located in a water stressed area, surpassed its water reduction target for 2022 and is currently projected to meet the site\u2019s 2025 goal as well. This project was recognized internally for its innovation and collaboration.\n\nFor information on the specific water sources affected in areas experiencing high and extremely-high water risk, please see our CDP Water Security response.

On-site wastewater treatment facilities are operated at many of our production and research facilities.\n\nWhere on-site treatment is not provided, wastewater is discharged to external wastewater treatment facilities that have the technology and capacity to treat our wastewater. As described in GRI 303-2 on page 94, many of our production facilities are equipped with advanced wastewater treatment technologies to ensure that our facilities meet both regulatory requirements and the internal standards required by our EQC Program.\nBiodiversity\n\nGRI 304-2 Significant impacts of activities, products, and services on biodiversity\n\nWe recognize that protecting biodiversity is important to the planet and our Company\u2019s growth. At present, we have not measured the impacts we have on biodiversity either directly or indirectly through our products. We do, however, have a long history of responsibly managing pharmaceuticals in the environment in an effort to prevent and reduce pollution in the areas in which we operate, protecting species and ecosystems from harm. Please see policies related to Pharmaceuticals in the Environment and Water Stewardship on our corporate website.\n\nWe are developing a strategy to better understand if the sourcing of certain inputs to our products potentially contribute to global deforestation. This assessment is in support of our CDP Forest response, which includes high-risk deforestation commodities such as timber, palm oil derivatives, soy, cattle by-products and rubber. The results of this assessment will be incorporated into our responsible sourcing strategy.\n\nEach of our sites in Ireland has developed a biodiversity team to perform biodiversity assessments. These sites worked with external biodiversity professionals to identify areas that could be improved from a biodiversity perspective, with particular emphasis on pollinators such as wild bees and butterflies. As a result of our commitment to these actions, we are delighted to announce that all five of our Ireland sites are business members to the All-Ireland Pollinator Plan (AIPP).\n\nThe AIPP is run by the National Biodiversity Data Centre and aims to reverse the dramatic downward trend in the number of pollinators in Ireland over the past decade by supporting businesses, communities and individuals to take small actions to help Ireland\u2019s native pollinators. A number of actions have taken place at our Ireland sites to support AIPP, which include planting pollinator-friendly gardens, installing a bug hotel and bee hives, reducing cuttings, and restoring and/or protecting native ecosystems on site.\n\nAnimal Health and biodiversity\n\nOur Animal Health business supports environmental sustainability by advancing the health of animals. Healthy animals use natural resources more productively. The business also supports biodiversity and conservation across both aquatic and terrestrial landscapes by:\n\n- Monitoring numerous aquatic species by utilizing passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags\n- Allowing accurate estimations of wild populations, survival rates and migration patterns\n- Tracking invasive species by helping researchers assess how these animals distribute throughout the environment and interact with native flora and fauna\n- Providing solutions as tools in recovery and conservation of aquatic species such as salmon, steelhead/rainbow trout, and freshwater fish populations\n- Collecting and providing key information in research of sea turtles, salamanders, abalone, penguins and bats\n\nSee our story on biodiversity on our corporate website for more information.\n\nGRI 304-3 Habitats protected or restored\n\nSince 2016, as part of our UN CEO Water Mandate commitment, we have invested annually in habitat restoration and/or reforestation projects that improve water quality, restore biodiversity and remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Working with organizations such as The Nature Conservancy and One Tree Planted, we have identified projects near our sites in which to invest. By investing in watershed management with these collective-action projects, we have also been able to integrate community mobilization by facilitating volunteer opportunities for our employees that live near our sites and for the communities in which they reside.\n\nFor more information on our water-related projects, please see GRI 303 on page 92.\nEmissions\n\nGRI 305 Management approach\n\nScientific data supports that climate change is occurring, and we are taking action to help reduce the economic and public health risks associated with a changing climate.\n\nWe have adopted a set of climate goals to help position our Company to succeed in an increasingly resource-constrained world. These goals were developed to align with the latest climate science and address the rising expectations of our customers, investors, external stakeholders and employees regarding the environmental impact of our operations and supply chain.\n\nGHG emissions goals\n\nGoal\n\nReduce our operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (i.e., Scopes 1 & 2) 46% by 2030 from a 2019 baseline.\n\nReduce our value chain (Scope 3) GHG emissions 30% by 2030 from a 2019 baseline.\n\nAchieve carbon neutrality across our operations by 2025 (Scopes 1 & 2 emissions).\n\nProgress\n\n9% reduction in Scope 1 & 2 emissions from 2019 baseline.\n\n6% increase in Scope 3 emissions from 2019 baseline.\n\nIn progress. Any remaining emissions will be offset with high-quality offsets in 2025.\n\nRenewable energy goal\n\nGoal\n\nSource 100% of our purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2025.\n\nProgress\n\n45% of purchased electricity from renewable sources in 2022.\n\nWe have committed to sourcing 100 percent of our purchased electricity from renewable energy by 2025. This target will help us reduce our Scope 2 emissions and meet our Scopes 1 & 2 reduction goal.\n\nIn March 2023, in alignment with the Paris Agreement on climate change and in accordance with our commitment to operating responsibly, we committed to the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) to set a net-zero target for greenhouse gas emissions across our global operations (Scopes 1, 2 and 3).\n\nWe have committed to becoming carbon neutral across our operations (Scopes 1 & 2 GHG emissions) by 2025, to reduce our Scopes 1 & 2 GHG emissions 46 percent by 2030 from a 2019 baseline (including biogenic emissions and removals from bioenergy feedstocks), and to reduce our value chain (Scope 3 GHG emissions) 30 percent by 2030, also from a 2019 baseline. These reduction targets have been verified by the SBTi.\n\nWe seek to achieve carbon neutrality in our operations with ongoing innovation to increase energy efficiency, applying sustainable building standards and continuing to transition away from fossil fuel use. Remaining Scope 1 emissions will be balanced each year by investing in high-quality carbon offsets, including carbon removal offsets.\n\nWe continue to find ways to decrease energy demand and have increased the amount of renewable energy we purchase. Our procurement team is engaging our strategic suppliers in our efforts to reduce the environmental impacts within our supply chain. In our Business Partner Code of Conduct, we request that suppliers conserve energy and engage in activities aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\nGovernance\n\nWe ensure our ongoing commitment to these areas through thoughtful governance. The Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Council, which comprises top-level executives from throughout the Company, provides enterprise leadership and sponsorship for our environmental sustainability strategy. The EHS Council monitors progress towards our public targets, influences decisions for environmental sustainability strategy implementation, and also increases visibility and transparency internally to the business, Executive Team and the Board of Directors. Our internal Environmental Sustainability Implementation Steering Committee also comprises top-level executives from throughout the Company, oversees progress of initiatives at the enterprise level, and provides support and guidance on the implementation plans and resourcing of our environmental sustainability strategy globally. This steering committee is informed by leaders from the Environmental Sustainability Center of Excellence (CoE), Global Energy & Sustainability CoE and Energy Procurement CoE, who develop our goals in alignment with stakeholder expectations, track their progress, and develop and provide continuous improvement on plans to achieve and sustain our public commitments.\n\nEach site is responsible for the management of its energy use. In many cases, we also partner with our third-party Integrated Facility Management (IFM) providers to manage energy use and work toward achieving the corporate goals.\n\nIn 2022, we conducted a climate policy alignment assessment of the trade associations referenced in GRI 2-23 on page 42 by determining whether they had publicly disclosed formal positions on climate change and, if so, reviewing those positions in the context of our Company\u2019s own position on climate change.\n\nThis assessment can be found on the Sustainability Resources page on our corporate website.\n\nOur Company is performing a high-level qualitative physical and transitional climate risk and opportunity scenario assessment aligned with the framework created by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\nFor more information regarding TCFD, please see GRI 201-2 on page 52.\n### GHG Emissions (2022)\n\n| Scope                  | 2018     | 2019     | 2020     | 2021     | 2022     |\n|------------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Scope 1:               | 769,200  | 728,600  | 710,900  | 689,900  | 712,400  |\n| Scope 2 (market-based) | 402,400  | 387,700  | 370,700  | 378,100  | 352,000  |\n| Scope 3:               | 370,000  | 294,600  | 236,500  | 234,900  | 218,800  |\n| Total Scopes 1 & 2 GHGs (market-based) | 1,139,200 | 1,023,200 | 947,400  | 924,800  | 931,200  |\n| Scope 3 GHGs           | 5,668,400| 6,380,500| 6,457,800| 6,958,500| 6,787,100|\n| GHG intensity (Scopes 1 & 2\u2014market-based) | 18.49    | 16.61    | 14.90    | 13.89    | 13.69    |\n\n**Total GHGs (MT CO\u2082e)**\n\n| Year | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Scope 1 | 769,200 | 728,600 | 710,900 | 689,900 | 712,400 |\n| Scope 2 location-based | 402,400 | 387,700 | 370,700 | 378,100 | 352,000 |\n| Scope 2 market-based | 370,000 | 294,600 | 236,500 | 234,900 | 218,800 |\n| Total Scopes 1 & 2 GHGs (market-based) | 1,139,200 | 1,023,200 | 947,400 | 924,800 | 931,200 |\n| Scope 3 GHGs | 5,668,400 | 6,380,500 | 6,457,800 | 6,958,500 | 6,787,100 |\n| GHG intensity (Scopes 1 & 2\u2014market-based) | 18.49 | 16.61 | 14.90 | 13.89 | 13.69 |\n\nERM CVS provided limited assurance of select 2022 greenhouse gas and water data included in this report and submitted to CDP.

Adjustments also reflect changes in methodology to ensure consistency from year to year, including Scope 2 emission factor updates (E-GRID (2022), IEA (2022), EU Residual (2022), UK Defra (2022) & Inventarios Corporativos (2022)) and Scope 1 & 3 emission factor updates (EPA Climate Leaders (2022)). The World Resource Institute\u2019s Greenhouse Gas Protocol defines Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as direct emissions from owned or controlled sources such as on-site fuel combustion and fleet vehicles. Scope 2 GHG emissions are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy consumed by the reporting company. Scope 3 GHG emissions include all other indirect emissions in a company\u2019s value chain.\n4 The operational control approach is used to account for GHG emissions for Company facilities globally.

In 2022, our Scope 3 GHG emissions decreased as compared to 2021. While performance was mixed across our reported categories, a decrease in our largest category, Purchased Goods and Services, led to an overall decrease from 2021.\n\nOur analysis shows that our Scope 3 GHG emissions impacts are nearly seven times greater than our combined Scopes 1 & 2 emissions. We are working to reduce those impacts through activities such as reducing waste in our operations, creating more sustainable packaging, and changing the way we commute to work and travel for business. We are also engaging with our strategic suppliers to identify ways to reduce GHG emissions in our supply chain. These actions not only reduce our environmental impact, but also benefit the business by reducing costs.\n\nWe report our GHG emissions as required by regulations in certain countries and annually through CDP Climate. In 2022, CDP graded our disclosure as a \u201cB\u201d or a rating of \u201cmanagement,\u201d indicating that we are \u201ctaking coordinated action on climate issues.\u201d\n\nOur CDP Climate Change Questionnaire is available on CDP\u2019s website.\n\nFor more information on our initiatives, policies and accomplishments, please see GRI 302 on page 88, and the following resources on our corporate website:\n\n- Corporate policy: Respect for Environmental Health and Safety\n- Public policy position statement: Climate Change\n- Business Partner Code of Conduct\n\nWe are committed to controlling air emissions from our facilities to reduce local, regional and global environmental impacts. Air emissions are generated by our manufacturing and research operations, as well as by burning fuel in on-site equipment and fleet vehicles. Our Air Management Standard requires our facilities to quantify and control air emissions to comply with both applicable regulations and emission standards. Where regulations do not mandate emission quantification, our facilities are required to use guidelines and tools associated with Air Management Standard to estimate emissions. These guidelines and tools were developed using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) emission calculation methodologies.\n\nAny increase in production can negatively impact our emissions trends. While there are efforts to minimize solvent use in production, solvents are needed for cleaning and disinfecting purposes. As we transform from manufacturing of pharmaceuticals to biopharmaceuticals, mandatory cleaning and disinfection protocols associated with biologics and vaccines are increasing solvent-based emissions. The Montreal Protocol mandates phase-out of refrigerants that are ozone-depleting substances (ODS) per schedules approved for individual countries. Our facilities strive to maintain compliance with applicable regulatory requirements that have been established in accordance with each country\u2019s commitments.\n\nOur Air Center of Excellence (CoE) provides assistance as needed to our facilities to obtain appropriate environmental permits, and to quantify and control air emissions to comply with applicable regulations and emission standards.\nProduction and research emissions\n\nMany of our pharmaceutical manufacturing processes, cleaning/disinfection operations and research laboratories require the use of solvents. Evaporation of solvents into the air is our primary source of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. In an effort to reduce VOCs, reductions in solvent usage has been incorporated as an element of our Green & Sustainable Science program.\n\nKey elements of the program include designing efficient processes that use fewer and less-hazardous organic solvents, and using water-based methods for cleaning our process equipment where they are equally effective as solvent-based methods. To reduce emissions from processes where organic solvents are used, we use pollution-control technologies such as conservation vents, carbon filters, thermal oxidizers, condensers and scrubbers.\n\nFor more information on this program, please see GRI 301 on page 84.\n\nFossil fuel combustion emissions\n\nAir emissions are also generated by burning fuel in our boilers and power-generation turbines (for heat and energy), and by other combustion processes such as thermal oxidizers (for treating air emissions) and incinerators (for destroying waste). Our fleet vehicles and aircraft also burn fuel and generate air emissions. These combustion processes result in emissions of carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx) and VOCs.\n\nWe strive to make our facilities more energy efficient through our energy-management programs and to improve the fuel efficiency of our fleet vehicles. Our company\u2019s actions to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions to meet our public climate commitments will also result in a reduction of NOx, SOx and VOC emissions.\n\nThe increase in NOx and SOx emissions from 2021 to 2022 is a result of the combination of multiple factors, including an increase in the use of jets compared to pre-pandemic levels, an increase in the combustion of diesel fuel at a couple of our facilities (addressing a power failure due to a hurricane and a natural gas curtailment during winter), more accurate emission-tracking methods and variations in energy needs at multiple facilities.\n\nVOC emissions decreased from 2021 to 2022 due to variations in production, replacement of solvent-based cleaning with water-based cleaning at one of our facilities, and data collection improvements with the adoption of more accurate emission tracking methods. Emissions of ozone-depleting substances are the result of non-routine releases from temperature control and fire suppression systems and can vary from year to year.\n\n| Air pollutant emissions by type (MT)\u00b9 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|-------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Nitrogen oxides (NOx)               | 490  | 392  | 388  | 350  | 358  |\n| Sulfur oxides (SOx)                 | 29   | 27   | 22   | 24   | 29   |\n| Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)  | 402  | 388  | 382  | 342  | 331  |\n| Ozone-depleting substances (ODS)    | 0.3  | 0.6  | 0.3  | 0.3  | 0.7  |\n\nNote: Previously reported data have been restated per our methodology, which includes adding facilities that have been acquired and removing facilities that have been sold or spun-off.\n\n\u00b9 Data are estimated using conservative assumptions and factors, not measured or weighed.\nWaste\n\nManagement approach\n\nThe proper management of waste from our facilities is important to the communities in which we operate and is a focus of our environmental permits and other regulatory requirements.\n\nOur waste management standard requires our facilities to comply with applicable generation, management and disposal regulations and standards. To minimize our environmental footprint and align with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, we look for opportunities to avoid the use of hazardous materials, to reuse or recycle materials and to prevent the generation of waste. When prevention, reuse and recycling are not practical or feasible, we apply controls and treatment technologies to prevent human health impacts and minimize environmental impacts.\n\nGovernance\n\nWaste management is overseen globally by our Waste and Dangerous Goods Center of Excellence (CoE). Each site is responsible for the management of its waste. In many cases, we partner with our third-party Integrated Facility Management (IFM) partners to manage site waste and work toward realizing the waste goals.\n\nOperational waste\n\nThe amount of waste we generate reflects the efficiency of our manufacturing processes.\n\nOperational waste is primarily generated from the following activities:\n- Manufacturing\n- Packaging\n- On-site wastewater treatment\n- Research\n\nWaste minimization begins with the evaluation of our product designs and manufacturing processes. Through our Green & Sustainable Science program (see GRI 301 on page 84), we design processes that use safer chemicals, consume less energy, use less water and other resources, and generate less waste. Our process development biologists, chemists and engineers have the expertise to create more sustainable ways to make our products.\n\nWe continuously strive to reduce the amount of operational waste we generate and to maximize the use of environmentally beneficial disposal methods such as recycling, composting and waste-to-energy. To ensure our waste is managed in an environmentally responsible manner, we use only approved waste disposal facilities. Approved facilities demonstrate that they have the systems, technologies and practices to manage our waste streams responsibly and in compliance with all applicable requirements. We routinely audit these facilities to verify the acceptability of their systems and practices.\n\nWaste types are defined differently in various parts of the world. For this report, we have divided our operational waste into two categories:\n- Hazardous waste: Highly regulated or high-risk waste streams that need to be neutralized, treated or destroyed to address a particular hazard such as toxicity, flammability, corrosivity, radioactivity, pharmaceutically active or infectious\n- Non-hazardous waste: Includes all other operational waste\n\nThe amount of construction-project-related waste can vary significantly from year to year based on the number and size of projects. Therefore, our definition of operational waste does not include construction or demolition waste from construction projects.\n\nOver the past few years, a number of countries in Asia have enacted legislation restricting the acceptance of solid waste from other countries. Historically, a large percentage of recyclable waste collected in the U.S. has been shipped to Asia for recycling, so this change had and continues to have the potential to affect the percentage of our non-hazardous waste sent for recycling. However, this change had minimal impact on our recycling rates.\nin the past year. The amount of our non-hazardous waste sent for recycling decreased by three percentage points from 2021 to 2022.\n\nIn 2022, two of the Company\u2019s largest sites sending non-hazardous waste to landfills implemented diversion strategies to reduce the volume of waste going to landfill by 60 percent. We also allocated approximately $142,000 to additional waste projects through the Sustainability Capital Fund. The majority of this funding supported the installation at one facility of a biodigester that uses bacteria to break down organic waste matter. The remainder was used to support water diversion awareness with AI-sorting technology.\n\nValue chain waste\n\nPotential waste-related impacts are also associated with upstream activities such as external manufacturing of active ingredients, the purchase of raw materials and goods, and the return of off-spec product. Similarly, the impacts downstream of the packaging and waste generated from the use of our products is estimated in our Scope 3 GHG emissions.\n\nFor more information on our GHG emissions, please refer to section GRI 305 on page 101.\n\nWhile we may not be in full control of the waste generated in our value chain, we pursue various initiatives to reduce the impact through our product and material choices. Some of these waste reduction initiatives across our value chain include:\n\n- Eliminating substances of concern from packaging\n- Solvent recovery and beneficial reuse\n- Packaging design efficiency\n- Re-usable shippers (in product distribution)\n\nAccording to our Business Partner Code of Conduct, partners shall operate in an environmentally responsible and efficient manner to minimize adverse impacts on the environment. Partners are encouraged to conserve natural resources, to avoid the use of hazardous materials where possible and to engage in activities that reuse and recycle.\n\nFor more information on our environmental management with suppliers, please see GRI 308 on page 112.\n\nWaste management goals\n\n| Goal | Progress |\n|------|----------|\n| By 2025, no more than 20% of our global operational waste will be sent to landfills and incinerators (without energy recovery). | 16% of operational waste was sent to landfill and incinerators (without energy recovery). |\n| By 2025, at least 50% of our sites will send zero waste to landfills. | 49% of sites sent zero waste to landfill. |\n### Global operational waste (% of total waste)\\(^1,2\\)\n\n|                      | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|----------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Incinerated (without energy recovery) | 24%  | 19%  | 23%  | 28%  | 12%  |\n| Landfilled           | 9%   | 7%   | 5%   | 5%   | 4%   |\n| Total (2025 Goal <20%) | 33%  | 26%  | 28%  | 33%  | 16%  |\n\n\\(^1\\) The initial waste treatment facility is defined as the generator of record for the waste generated from the treatment of an operational waste stream shipped from a company.

Reporting for the years prior to 2022 with this reclassification will be included in the 2023/2024 Impact Report.\nApproximately 14 percent of our hazardous waste was sent offsite for recycling and was either returned to us for reuse or sold to other industries. This is a decrease from the 19 percent that was recycled Company-wide in 2021, and is attributed to reduced production at one of our manufacturing facilities that is in the process of being closed. Another 60 percent was burned to generate power, up from 28 percent in 2021. About 19 percent of the total hazardous waste generated was incinerated without energy recovery, down from 44 percent in 2021 due to a reclassification based on new information as explained in footnote 2 on the previous page.

The waste directed to this disposal technology was previously classified as incineration without energy recovery, but with this updated information it has been reclassified incineration with energy recovery as per our internal definitions. Only the 2022 reporting year reflects this reclassification in this Impact Report. Reporting for the years prior to 2022 with this reclassification will be included in the 2023/2024 Impact Report.\nIn 2022, we managed 83,333 metric tons of waste from our operations, a two percent increase from 2021. Of this total, 48,540 metric tons were hazardous waste.\n\nOf the hazardous waste we generated in 2022, 75 percent was beneficially reused (reused, recycled, composted or sent for energy recovery), up from 50 percent in 2021 (see footnote 2 of the table above for explanation of these changes).\n\nWe beneficially reused 87 percent of the 34,793 metric tons of nonhazardous waste we generated in 2022. We are evaluating and refining the programs currently in place at our manufacturing, research and office sites to reduce waste generation and increase recycling.\n\nApproximately 49 percent of our facilities sent zero operational waste to landfill in 2022, down from 52 percent in 2021. The decrease was due to additional sites coming into the network. Year over year, there was no net change in the number of sites that sent zero operational waste to landfill.\n\nThe overall percentage of waste sent to landfill decreased from five percent in 2021 to four percent in 2022. We continue to work to identify alternate methods of waste management that will reduce the amount of waste sent to incinerators (without energy recovery) and landfills.\n\nWe do not collect data on the amount of product accepted for takeback, reuse or disposal.\n\nFor additional information on this topic, please review the following documents located on our corporate website:\n\n- Corporate policy: Respect for Environmental Health and Safety\n- Public policy position statement: Responsible Disposal of Medicines\n- Sharps Management Plan-CalRecycle\n\nSupplier environmental assessment\n\nGRI 308 Management approach\n\nEnvironmental sustainability principles are integrated into each stage of our supplier management program. Our Global Supplier Management Group (GSMG) drives the program and maintains the associated standards and processes by which suppliers are identified, qualified and managed. The environmental sustainability program is an essential element of supplier management along with social responsibility, economic inclusion and supplier diversity (EI&SD).\n\nPlease visit GRI 2-6 on page 35, GRI 204 on page 77 and GRI 414 on page 145 for additional information regarding our integrated approach with our suppliers.\n\nExternal Manufacturing\n\nExternal manufacturers of active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished products are screened for environmental health and safety (EHS) compliance, in addition to quality, supply and technical competence requirements. The EHS screening and on-site assessment is led by GSMG and Global Safety and the Environment (GSE), and includes a survey covering such topics as regulatory compliance, fatalities and major incidents.\n\nBased on the screening results and activities undertaken by the supplier, certain external manufacturers are subject to a more detailed on-site assessment conducted by a multidisciplinary team, which may include our Quality, GSE, Global Technical Operations and GSMG representatives. The external manufacturers with whom we contract are periodically reassessed using a risk-based approach; higher-risk external manufacturers are subject to more frequent on-site assessments. We expect that observations made during the EHS assessment process will be remediated by our external manufacturers, and we monitor and track corrective and preventative actions (CAPAs) through completion.\nSince 2020, the EHS assessment schedule has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning in Q2 2022, EHS assessments have been primarily completed in person. However, some assessments were completely virtual or a combination thereof.\n\n### External manufacturing EHS assessments\n\n|                      | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|----------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Prospective external manufacturers | 65   | 43   | 50   | 42   | 27   |\n| Current external manufacturers     | 61   | 48   | 27   | 54   | 51   |\n| Total                  | 126  | 91   | 77   | 96   | 78   |\n\n**Going forward**\n\nWhile introductory goals were established in 2017, our Company continues to work to improve how we partner with our third parties to drive improved environmental sustainability throughout our supply chain.\n\nWe are initiating collaborations with our value-chain partners to:\n\n- Gather their Company-apportioned activity-based/actual emissions data\n- Forecast future performance of emission reduction plans\n- Realize actual emission reductions for planned projects\n\nWe have created an enterprise-wide decarbonization roadmap focusing on third parties supplying goods and services such as logistics, packaging, information technology, active pharmaceutical ingredients and site services.\nWe hire passionate people who believe in taking on the world\u2019s most pressing health issues. We seek to maximize each employee\u2019s potential and the contributions they bring each day to deliver on the Company\u2019s purpose.\n\nOur focus is to enable every employee to continuously learn and grow, creating a greater connection to the organization and accelerating the development of all talent. We believe our employees are at the center of everything we do. Leading from this foundation fuels our efforts to ensure we are succeeding in attracting, developing, retaining and inspiring our employees.\n\nTo execute on these priorities and ensure success, we have enhanced our development program offerings while also remaining anchored in driving our culture transformation forward.

We know that diverse teams thrive and contribute to our Company\u2019s overall success. In 2022, 52 percent of all hires globally were female while in the U.S., 47 percent were from underrepresented ethnic groups. We provide our managers and external recruiting organizations with the tools they need in order to succeed in mitigating unconscious biases throughout the hiring process. We employ a targeted communication strategy with marketing, social media and alliances that reach broad and diverse pools of talent.\n\nDespite lingering pandemic fears, 2022 continued to show significant hiring growth in many of our regions including the U.S., our largest-volume hiring market. We also saw hiring growth in Europe and Asia Pacific. This global growth is largely due to investments in sales, clinical trials, IT, and digital and analytics.\n\nAs a result of the global pandemic, China\u2019s 2022 hire rate decreased due to lockdowns and restrictions in the country. Our hiring strategy in the region continues to focus on securing digital, analytical and automation skill sets across all divisions, especially in Oncology and Vaccines in Global Human Health and in our R&D division.\n\nNotably, we increased our efforts around creating a diverse workforce through our sourcing, branding and selection processes. We successfully collaborated with a number of external partners to attract diverse candidates across many different demographics.\n\nOur Company has continued to invest in and partner with several diversity hiring programs in the U.S.\n\nOur aim for 2023 is to increase our hiring commitments across programs. We will continue to promote early talent initiatives. Overall, we achieved success in identifying, sourcing and attracting critical talent in a post-pandemic environment.\n\nSee GRI 405 on page 134 for information on our diversity hiring programs.\nWe have strategically-located discovery centers in regions with active biomedical research communities in California and Massachusetts, as well as principal sites outside of the U.S., including the United Kingdom, Switzerland and China. These centers allow us to recruit talented local scientists and facilitate collaboration with local academic institutions and companies. These discovery sites complement and connect with the strong R&D capabilities and expertise based at our New Jersey and Pennsylvania sites.\n\nLearn more about our compensation and benefits on our corporate website.\n\nOur Well-being Report demonstrates the priority we place on employee well-being and our commitment to hold ourselves accountable to measure our progress, celebrate successes and constantly raise the bar for our employees and their families. Our well-being framework focuses on the physical, mental, financial and social well-being of all our employees, and our robust suite of benefits and resources targets each of these areas.\n\nFor details, please see our Well-being Report on our corporate website.\n\nEmployee volunteering\n\nEach year, our employees around the world take an active role in giving back to their communities by donating volunteer hours to help improve health and well-being through a range of volunteer activities.\n\nSee the Philanthropy page on our corporate website for examples and more information on our volunteer programs, such as our Fellowship for Global Health and legal pro-bono program.\n\nParental leave\n\nWe offer our employees who become parents up to 12 weeks of paid time off following the birth or adoption of their child.\n\nFor more information, please see our Well-being Report, as well as the Compensation and Benefits page on our corporate website.\nOur Company\u2019s EHS management system includes comprehensive programs focused on reducing risks, work-related injuries/illnesses and other safety incidents from our operations. We focus on safe facility design, process controls, operation and maintenance procedures, protection systems and emergency-response capabilities.\n\nOur EHS Management System supports our Company\u2019s objectives by promoting a strong EHS culture through visible leadership, active employee engagement and a focus on proactive identification and elimination of hazards. Our Employee Safety Committees demonstrate this EHS engagement in action. These Committees include workers and management in a partnership to proactively address EHS issues.\n\nWhile we have reviewed the ISO 18001 Standard, we have not pursued certification because we believe that our current EHS management systems are robust and achieve our desired levels of EHS performance.\n\nFor consistency across the Company, and to enable us to compare our injury rates with those of other multinational companies, we use the U.S.-based OSHA recordkeeping criteria for recording and tracking work-related injuries and illnesses. We require all injuries, illnesses and incidents involving our employees to be reported and investigated to determine their cause. We also require corrective and preventative actions be taken to prevent recurrence.\n\nPlease see GRI 403-9 and GRI 403-10 on pages 126-129 for our performance on these metrics.\n\nAs a global health care company, we strive to provide a safe and healthy workplace. We seek to reduce environmental, health and safety (EHS) risks in order to eliminate work-related injuries, illnesses and unplanned events from all aspects of our operations through a comprehensive EHS program. We are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace that complies with all applicable safety laws and regulations. In addition, we aim for EHS performance that is among the best in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nAll employees, service providers and Company-managed contractors must follow the standards and requirements in our EHS management system. Compliance with these requirements is measured through site-audit processes and through peer reviews for construction.\n\nEach year, we set targets and track leading and lagging safety metrics. These metrics include safety observations, near-miss incidents, peer safety reviews, Recordable Injury Rates (RIR), Lost Time Injury Rates (LTIR) and Days Away, Restricted or Transferred (DART) rates.\n\nWe identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis and apply the hierarchy of controls in order to eliminate hazards and minimize risks. We continually evaluate and work to improve our occupational health and safety management system.\nProcess safety\n\nOur process safety program identifies, controls and manages risks associated with the manufacturing and handling of our human and animal health products. The program applies to operations that are subject to process safety regulations, and to our pilot plants, manufacturing operations and utility areas where process hazards may exist. In addition, we have implemented a structured, chemical-reaction-hazard review program for our research laboratories.\n\nIn the early stages of product development, we conduct chemical reaction and thermal testing of our intermediate materials and products to identify potential reactivity, fire and explosion hazards, and environmental risks. This testing continues throughout the life cycle of each product to ensure that we are aware of the process risks of each material and can properly manage these risks. Global process safety professionals work with operations and engineering personnel to conduct process hazard analyses to thoroughly evaluate our operations. These structured reviews take place at every stage from the initial start-up through the final process design. This ensures our facility design, equipment, operating controls and maintenance procedures are effective in identifying, evaluating, managing and mitigating process-related hazards.\n\nNon-routine hazardous work\n\nWe have developed global safety standards to minimize the potential for serious incidents when working at heights, entering confined spaces and working on or near machinery, piping and electrical systems. This global effort is focused on creating a rigorous and safe approach to risk reduction when performing these non-routine, high-hazard work activities.\n\nCapital projects construction safety\n\nWe have a strong construction safety program with a focus on zero harm to people, property and the environment. Our Global Engineering Solutions (GES) group oversees hundreds of contractors and thousands of skilled craft workers on our construction projects worldwide. Safety is integrated into all stages of our construction projects, beginning with the concept and design phases, and is carried through to Detailed Design, Construction and Commissioning/Qualification. In 2022, 10.5 million hours were spent in construction on GES Capital Project work.\n\nOur construction safety program mandates pre-job planning, hazard assessments and daily safety checks. We also conduct peer reviews by bringing together in-house engineers, contractors, the EHS construction team and other partners to conduct thorough project safety evaluations and share best practices. In 2022, we completed 64 peer safety reviews on projects, covering 100 percent of our active projects that were chosen for peer safety reviews.\n\nThe construction industry continues to see a negative trend related to the availability of contractor and craft resources. The impacts of this trend require management of resource availability issues, varied levels of experience and safety competencies. GES continues to use a \u201chyper-care\u201d program to ensure additional supervision and safety oversight of new contractors, high-risk work scope contractors and less-experienced contractors.\n\nGES also uses a rigorous, third-party prequalification program\u2014Highwire\u2014to evaluate and score contractors and subcontractors. This tool allows the team to evaluate contractors\u2019 safety programs, past safety performance, safety incident rates, experience modifier rate and training verification of craft, and reviews any regulatory citations prior to allowing them to bid on any projects.\nSafety for non-Company personnel\n\nAll contractors working at our sites are required to follow a prequalification and EHS evaluation process as specified in our Company\u2019s Global Contractor Management Standard. They are assigned an internal \u201ccontractor liaison\u201d to monitor EHS compliance, perform EHS inspections and evaluations and ensure they follow their safety compliance plans. Contractors are required to report and investigate all EHS incidents and near-miss events. They also work with site-based EHS contacts to identify and implement corrective and preventive actions, which are tracked to completion.\n\nIntegrated Facilities Management (IFM) partners are globally sourced companies that are responsible for supporting our Company for facility-related tasks. IFM partners are required to follow our Company\u2019s EHS standards and site-specific EHS procedures in order to monitor compliance activities associated with their scope of services and meet EHS- and sustainability-related performance objectives.\n\nIFM partners are managed through a central governance team. The governance process includes dedicated resources to measure, monitor and evaluate IFM partners\u2019 EHS and sustainability performance, as well as adherence to Company requirements on an ongoing basis. IFM partners proactively follow a continuous improvement process whereby each year, in addition to our Company requirements, specific targets are set up and monitored at the governance level.\n\nMotor vehicle safety\n\nThe purpose of the motor vehicle safety program is to promote a strong safety culture for our employees who operate vehicles during the conduct of Company business. The program is designed to reduce the number and severity of motor vehicle accidents and injuries along with a reduction in violations. Our global motor vehicle safety standard and adopted programs, such as predictive analytics assessments, allow us to develop employee-specific defensive driving action plans, and to promote safe driving skills and behaviors for our sales and marketing employees (who operate the majority of our business-use vehicles).\n\nEmergency response\n\nWe prioritize the prevention of incidents through equipment and facility design, operational and maintenance procedures and employee training. However, in the event that unplanned incidents occur, we maintain emergency preparedness and response capabilities at our facilities. Emergency response programs help secure the safety and well-being of our employees and visitors, the protection of the environment and nearby communities, as well as protecting our physical assets. We also conduct pre-emergency planning for credible emergency scenarios such as process upsets, fires, spills, releases, severe weather and security-related incidents.\n\nSite-specific emergency response procedures include incident reporting and management, personnel evacuation, and medical and incident response and control. We routinely conduct emergency response drills and train employees in job-specific and site-specific emergency response duties.\n\nMany of our manufacturing plants have on-site, trained emergency response teams and mobile fire and rescue apparatus that can respond to fires, medical emergencies, technical rescues and spills/releases. Most of our emergency response teams interact directly with their local community-based emergency responders and, in some cases, assist off-site when requested.\nLoss prevention\n\nWe proactively assess and manage the risks associated with fires and natural catastrophes (e.g., hurricanes, floods, windstorms and earthquakes) through our Loss Prevention Program. This program focuses on eliminating or reducing the impact of potential loss events through:\n\n- Facility and process designs\n- Inspection, prevention and maintenance procedures\n- Fire suppression, detection and specialized protection systems\n- Emergency response and business continuity programs\n\nWe engage globally-recognized, external loss prevention engineering service providers to routinely inspect and review designs and modifications of facilities. This posture assists us in maintaining a high standard of loss prevention that corresponds to the level of operational risk, monetary value and supply chain importance.\n\nIndustrial hygiene\n\nThe Industrial Hygiene (IH) program helps safeguard employee health throughout all stages of research and manufacturing. Our IH professionals identify chemical, physical and biological hazards, and assess exposures and control risks. Based on industry-leading best practices, we accomplish this through a hierarchy of controls. These include: Prevention; Substitution; Engineering; Administrative; and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).\n\nOur practice when designing new processes and facilities is to build safety into our designs organically by eliminating risks, substituting less hazardous processes or materials and installing effective engineering and operational controls. We also confirm the ongoing effectiveness of these controls after installation through a robust monitoring program.\n\nWe use a similar approach when addressing existing processes and facilities. Our priority is to eliminate hazardous materials and processes. When elimination is not possible, we use less hazardous substitutes and then evaluate potential engineering controls to mitigate the remaining risk. Where engineering controls are insufficient, or not feasible, we establish effective work practice controls, including those that may require selected types of PPE.\n\nBiological safety\n\nOur biological safety program aims to protect our employees, customers and communities by identifying, assessing and controlling biosafety and biosecurity risks. The biological safety program is designed to control biological exposure and support the research, development and manufacturing of vaccines and medicines for communicable and non-communicable diseases. Our program supports UN SDG 3, and aligns with the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), GHSA Biosafety and Biosecurity Action Package.\n\nIn 2022, our Company launched an updated engineering design standard that governs fit-for-purpose biological laboratory facility design to support our pipeline. This enabled our Company to design Biological Safety Level 2 (BSL-2) and BSL-3 laboratories for safe research and development of vaccines and therapeutics to combat endemic or emerging infectious\ndiseases like dengue, brucellosis and bovine botulism. In an effort to improve biosafety capabilities, our Biosafety Center of Excellence conducted a Biocontainment Engineering Workshop to increase the biosafety knowledge base of our engineers and biosafety professionals. The team also developed an engineering project-risk-assessment tool and integrated other biosafety tools into the existing Company global engineering project team roadmap to improve design decisions for new and renovated biological facilities.\n\nWe partner with our community of public and private sector biosafety professionals in order to help educate biorisk professionals globally, and develop guidelines that protect human and animal health and the environment. In 2022, we volunteered with American Biological Safety Association (ABSA) International to support ISO Technical Committee 212\u2019s Working Group 5 to develop the ISO 35001 Implementation Guide, and to draft a new ISO Biosafety Professional Competency Standard. We also supported the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Zodiac Project to improve biosafety in veterinary diagnostic laboratories globally, and presented on sustainable effluent decontamination at the International Veterinary Biosafety Workgroup.\n\nIn 2022, our biological safety professionals facilitated 293 biorisk assessments to support research and development and manufacturing activities across all Company divisions. By developing and leveraging an asset called Biorisk Assessment and Repository (BAR), we believe that we have set new biorisk management standards for the industry. BAR evaluates biosafety, bioethics and biosecurity risk associated with biological materials and establishes sustainable risk-control strategies that protect human health and the environment.\n\nErgonomics\n\nWe have implemented a program focused on the reduction of ergonomic risk in process, equipment design and the work environment. We identify ergonomic risk and exposure of tasks in all areas of the organization. Our ergonomic programs encourage employee participation in workplace assessments, risk identification and implementation of sustainable engineering controls. Where engineering controls are not feasible, administrative and behavioral controls are implemented including, but not limited to, job rotation, job hazard identification and body mechanics training. We also require an ergonomic design standards review for all new or renovated facilities and projects to maximize worker comfort and health and minimize ergonomics hazards and risk factors. In 2022, there was a 47 percent reduction in ergonomic lost time injuries (15 in 2021 vs 8 in 2022).\n\nOur remote worker ergonomic assessment process and work-from-home furniture policy continues to prove successful in eliminating injuries and encouraging good working habits. This policy provides hybrid and remote workers with access to resources that guide proper home office workstation setup and identify appropriate furniture, equipment and solutions needed to maintain a healthy work-from-home environment. As a result of this program, there were no lost time, recordable or first aid ergonomic cases associated with work-from-home computer workstations in 2022.\n\nGRI 403-3 Occupational health services\n\nOccupational health principles apply to all employees and directly-supervised contingent workers. We promote compliance with both the letter and the spirit of applicable occupational health laws, Company policies and requirements. We prioritize continuous improvement and assess our improvements objectively through internal measurement and external benchmarking, incorporating best practices and participating in occupational health research where appropriate.\n\nTo meet the Company\u2019s objectives, we focus on seven key areas:\n\n- Prevention and risk-minimization\n- Quality assurance\n- Global standards and communication\n- Education and training\n- Role of management\n- Collaboration with EHS\n- Global employee health governance\nPrevention and risk minimization\n\nThe best way to maintain the occupational health of our employees is to reduce risk and prevent illnesses and injuries. Occupational Health Services collaborates closely with the EHS organization to identify and evaluate potential health risks to our employees in an effort to reduce adverse impacts. We take proactive steps to prevent occupational injury and illness through our Medical Surveillance program. This program evaluates new and existing workplace hazards and allows the teams to identify and implement procedures and clinical protocols to eliminate these hazards and prevent future occurrences. In the event of an occupational injury or illness, Occupational Health Services performs joint follow-up investigations with the EHS organization and conducts analyses to further refine our preventive efforts and reduce avoidable risks.\n\nWhen employees are ill or injured at work or through personal circumstances, we support their recovery so they can return to work healthy to perform their jobs. When an employee experiences an occupational injury or illness, we promote and facilitate appropriate treatment and rehabilitation.\n\nQuality assurance\n\nOur Quality Assurance program ensures that both our occupational health staff and our external vendors for occupational health are compliant with our occupational health corporate policies, procedures and guidelines.\n\nGlobal standards and communication\n\nOur occupational health programs are not static, and we drive continuous improvement in their performance. We refine programs, policies and procedures based on evolving workplace hazards in the Company. We tie our occupational health performance to corporate and divisional goals and objectives, when applicable.\n\nWe adhere to and promote Company goals, programs, procedures and policies designed to provide a high level of respect for the health of our employees globally. We foster openness and respectful dialogue with our employees, anticipating and responding to concerns about our operations.\n\nEducation and training\n\nWell-informed and trained employees provide the backbone for maintaining employee health in the workplace. We assist in providing appropriate education and training programs for our employees, so that they understand potential health hazards and necessary precautions related to their job duties. We also invest in our occupational health team's professional growth to foster business excellence in the conscientious execution of their responsibilities.\n\nRole of management\n\nManagers are responsible for implementing and adhering to both Company and local (country or regional) occupational health policies. They may also provide input into occupational health policy and strategies. Similarly, we expect division and business unit leaders to make certain that their teams provide input on occupational health strategies, policies and programs, as appropriate. Above all, leaders ensure that their organization provides adequate resources to support occupational health performance.\nCollaboration with EHS\n\nEHS provides input to Global Employee Occupational Health policy and strategies that promote the Company\u2019s occupational health program.\n\nActivities include:\n- Co-developing and reviewing occupational health programs, as applicable\n- Assessing potential workplace health hazards (chemical, biological and physical)\n- Preventing adverse health effects from hazards\n- Identifying causal factors associated with injuries and illnesses\n- Working with site health professionals to analyze and track the safety performance of the Company\n\nGlobal employee health governance\n\nOur executive vice president and chief human resources officer (EVP/chief HR officer) is the senior Company official who advises the Executive Team on occupational health strategies, policies and programs, and reports to the team on occupational health matters that impact employee health and human performance. Together, our EVP/chief HR officer, senior vice president of compensation and benefits, and vice president of global safety and the environment promote effective collaboration on occupational health and safety matters. Their mission is to achieve the Company\u2019s occupational goals by overseeing and sponsoring the program.\n\nWorker training on occupational health and safety\n\nEHS training is critical to build employee EHS competencies to improve compliance, reduce risks and drive continuous improvement. EHS professionals complete an assessment of the activities performed and identify relevant EHS topics in EHS training plans. These plans comply with internal and regulatory training requirements specific to each particular country and are reviewed periodically to ensure that they remain current.\n\nEHS training program materials are available in both instructor-led and e-learning formats.\n\nWe have a global standard that defines the EHS training expectations for employees:\n- Manager training covers specific management responsibilities with regard to EHS compliance\n- EHS professional training is designed to expand technical expertise\n- Employee training covers the specific information our employees need to perform their jobs, focusing on hazards they encounter on the job and any corresponding control measures\n\nPromotion of worker health\n\nGlobal Employee Health Services provides workers access to nonoccupational medical and health care services to address major non-work-related health risks. The team operates both globally and locally. Global Employee Health also provides occupational and health care services to employees such as:\n- Medical clearances for job placement and evaluations to assess capability to perform a job task\n- Regulatory assessments for potential health hazards and reproductive health hazards\n- Consultations that prevent injury and illness, such as those related to travel and unique workplace hazards\n- Treatment for employees with a work-related injury or illness\n\nOn-site Global Employee Health personnel support the Company\u2019s people through employee health services clinics located on many sites. All facilities provide occupational and preventive health services that work to keep employees healthy, on the job and functioning at optimal capacity. Global Employee Health supports many of the programs, including biometric screenings for employee personal health assessments, and vaccinations against flu and other viruses, including COVID-19.\nOur most vital occupational health services relate to medical advice and consultation, medical evaluations, medical surveillance, care of occupational injuries and illnesses, identification and reporting of new potential hazards and adverse health effects, emergency medical response and\u2014most importantly\u2014prevention.\n\nTo develop and maintain awareness of all workplace health hazards, Global Employee Health Services maintains a close functional working relationship with site management, safety and industrial hygiene professionals. Global Employee Health Services are also responsible for maintaining employee health records in accordance with local regulatory requirements. Employee health is a Company priority, so we strive to continuously improve our programs globally and at each site. These efforts include communication of our global policies, procedures and protocols; administering regulatory and compliance audits; and providing critical oversight for our occupational health programs.\n\nIn 2022, our Lost Time Incident rate (LTIR) was 0.06, a 22 percent reduction from 2021. Our recordable incident rate (RIR) was 0.26, a 31 percent increase from 2021. There was one fatality in 2022 due to a motor vehicle accident.\n\nIn 2022, our top three types of recordable injuries were:\n- 30% related to struck/caught\n- 20% related to slips, trips and falls\n- 18% related to ergonomics\n\nWe focus on the early identification of hazards through reporting and analysis, eliminating high-risk tasks, improving engineering controls, and performing coaching and training to our workforce to aid in identification and elimination of EHS risks.\n\nIn 2022, we are still reporting fewer miles driven than in pre-pandemic year 2019. While in 2021 there was an increase in collisions per million miles (CPMM), in 2022 there was a 25 percent decrease from 2021. Online defensive driving training for 2022 focused on common at-risk behaviors (e.g. distractions, speeding, safe following distances). Our motor vehicle safety program uses a risk-based approach for assigning online defensive driving training, where the lowest-risk drivers complete training annually and high-risk drivers complete training quarterly.\nConstruction\n\nIn 2022, Global Engineering Solutions (GES) received two safety excellence awards for First Place Best Safety Durham DS4 Project, and Honorable Mention Best Safety Durham Flash Project from the Construction Users Roundtable (CURT). CURT is a global organization that provides an international forum for the exchange of information and expertise to improve safety, productivity and competitive advantage for the construction industry.\n\nIn 2022, COVID-19 did not affect our construction safety performance. We had 10.5 million construction hours globally and achieved zero injuries on most of our capital construction projects. The construction RIR result was 0.50, and this was below the GES target KPI of 0.55. The construction DART rate was 0.21, and this was below the GES target KPI of 0.23.

We accomplish this by collaborating with business partners across the Company to understand critical business challenges and to align and prioritize learning solutions to support addressing those challenges. We then design, develop and execute innovative learning experiences to strengthen our workforce and drive business impact.\n\nGL&D ensures that all learning opportunities are developed to allow for diversity of thought and an enriched accessible learning experience. We identify learning needs of our global diverse employee population through extensive discovery of learner personas, requirements and environments. Our strategy allows us to anticipate, identify, prioritize, design, develop and implement learning solutions that provide growth and development across five moments of an employee\u2019s career.\n\nThese moments include:\n- In-role growth\n- Career acceleration\n- Leader development\n- Company and culture\n- Mandatory training\n\nGL&D understands employee skills and capabilities must support our Company\u2019s aspiration and purpose. As a result, we continuously evaluate our organizational capability needs and retool the learning culture and strategy to support our employees.\n\nGRI 404-1 Average hours of employee training\n\n| Training and education\u00b9 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|-------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Total course completions for all learners (in millions) | 4.4  | 5.3  | 7.2  | 6.3  | 5.1  |\n| Hours of training for all learners (in millions)\u00b2 | 2.2  | 2.7  | 3.6  | 3.2  | 2.5  |\n| Average course completions per learner | 43   | 55   | 69   | 51   | 42   |\n\n\u00b9 \u201cAll learners\u201d is defined as all active regular and part-time employees, as well as applicable contingent workers.\n\u00b2 Based on average of 30 minutes per course.\nOur current talent management practices provide performance management, leadership development, talent assessments, and succession planning.

Feedback on employee performance includes how well employees demonstrate our aspirational culture. We seek to emphasize not just what an employee achieves, but also how they achieve. Managers gather feedback about their employees and write performance reviews providing holistic feedback on employees\u2019 accomplishments.\n\nTransition assistance programs may be provided to support employees who are exited as part of a workforce restructuring.

We look to have the diversity of our employees mirror the external world. This enables us to understand the needs of customers, health care providers and patients we serve, including those with different abilities. Ultimately, because of our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, we strive to take responsibility and operate our business in a way that ensures fairness and equality of opportunity for all employees.\n\nWith our commitment to employee health paramount, we continue to focus on creating and implementing effective strategies and programs to protect employees, while furthering a safe and productive culture that embraces inclusion as a competitive advantage. We appreciate our employees for their determination and resilience, and their inventiveness, dedication and compassion deserve special note.\n\nGlobal Diversity & Inclusion (GD&I) objectives\n\nOur GD&I strategy is grounded in our commitment to a more globally diverse and more inclusive workforce for our employees. We are creating an environment of belonging, engagement, equity and empowerment so that we can ensure patients experience ultimate health outcomes. The GD&I strategy takes a holistic approach where everyone can contribute to our mission.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, we focus our efforts on the following:\n\n- Our People: Strengthen the foundational elements of diversity\n- Our Culture: Ensure accountability to drive an inclusive culture\n- Our Business: Continue to leverage diversity and inclusion to ensure business value\n- Our World: Transform the environment, culture and business landscape\n\nOur enterprise-wide plan demonstrates our commitment to diversity and inclusion as a business priority. Leading to enhanced collaboration, innovation and agility, the plan aligns our business objectives for diversity and inclusion to drive long-term, sustainable business performance. Our objectives for diversity and equal opportunity also support the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to advance gender equality, provide fulfilling work and economic growth, reduce inequalities within and among countries, and strengthen our global partnerships.\n\nOur GD&I strategic framework focuses on the following priorities:\n\n- Continue to build the diversity and inclusion capabilities of our global workforce\n- Ensure accountability at all levels of the organization\n- Integrate diversity and inclusion into our business practices to drive performance\n- Work to influence the environment, culture and business landscape to help achieve a more inclusive and sustainable world\nGD&I Ambassador teams\n\nOur GD&I Center of Excellence (CoE) provides comprehensive and practical guidance and support for diversity and inclusion across all business practices and systems.

Diversity and inclusion are so important to our Company that they serve as a key dimension to our sustainability goals and our Ways of Working. Additionally, our Board of Directors has a clearly stated Diversity Policy that recognizes that maintaining a truly diverse membership with regards to educational and professional background, gender, race, age, sexual orientation, ethnic and national background, and other differentiating personal characteristics promotes inclusiveness. This enhances the Board\u2019s deliberations and contributes to the Board\u2019s overall effectiveness to better represent the long-term interests of the Company and its shareholders.\nOur CEO further reinforces our commitment to GD&I. Viewing GD&I as a strategic business imperative, he advocates for diversity and inclusion through the following commitments:\n\n- Approving intentional efforts to ensure equality of opportunity\n- Driving accountability through meetings with his Executive Team of direct reports, our senior leaders, and engaging employees in Company-wide events to review key strategic initiatives centered on GD&I\n- Conferring with our Chief Human Resources Officer and Chief Diversity Officer on innovation opportunities and business solutions\n\nPay equity\n\nWe have had a longstanding commitment to fair and equitable pay for all employees doing similar work. This commitment is consistent with our core values of integrity, fairness and treating all people with dignity and respect. Having the right culture, systems and practices for talent recruitment and development are critical in driving our ability to compete in global markets where talent is increasingly scarce and diverse. Diversity, equity and inclusion are among our ethical and strategic imperatives.\n\nPay equity is a critical principle at our Company. We maintain a Pay Equity Council that is deeply engaged in our pay equity initiatives. The Pay Equity Council is jointly led by our vice president of Diversity and Inclusion and senior vice president of Global Rewards & HR Operations. Among its members are leaders within our GD&I, Compensation and Benefits, Talent Acquisition and Employment Legal organizations.\n\nPay equity is a topic that is rightly receiving a great deal of attention. While many other organizations have only recently begun to explore how to pay their employees equitably, providing fair and equitable pay has been one of the pillars of our compensation philosophy for many years.\n\nOur efforts toward pay equity include:\n\n- Establishing clear and transparent pay practices and policies to ensure that we are paying our employees equitably across all genders, races and ethnicities\n- Basing compensation on job-related factors such as the nature of the job, work location, and employees\u2019 relative skills and work experience\n- Training our people managers on our diversity, equity and inclusion policies to ensure that decisions regarding employees, including those related to compensation, are based on legitimate job-related criteria and not personal characteristics such as gender, race or ethnicity\n- Affirming our commitment to fair and equitable pay by encouraging dialogue between people managers and employees to address pay-related questions and concerns\n\nIn 2022, as part of our commitment to increase transparency and visibility into our pay equity efforts, we conducted several education sessions, equipped our leaders with pay equity resources and engaged with employees around the globe.\n\nWith the support of external experts and legal partners, we have continued to conduct annual pay equity studies in the U.S. and abroad. The pay equity studies take into account job-related factors as described above, and allow us to identify whether any adjustments to compensation would be sensible to ensure that we continue to pay our employees equitably. Where appropriate, based on the determinations of our pay equity studies, we make base salary adjustments to maintain pay equity across gender, race and ethnicity.\n\nIn 2022, our pay equity study achieved nearly worldwide coverage, encompassing approximately 90 percent of our global employee population, or nearly 60,000 employees. In the U.S., our study showed that we have achieved greater than 99 percent pay equity for female and male employees, and that we have achieved greater than 99 percent pay equity for non-white (including Black, Hispanic and Asian employees) and white employees. Globally, targeted base-pay adjustments were rarely necessary. We remain committed to ensuring that pay equity is maintained for all employees.\n\nOur continuing focus on pay equity furthers our goal of being the employer of choice for workers of diverse backgrounds, and it supports our efforts to attract and retain the best talent and reward performance consistent with our Leadership Standards. These are clear business imperatives for our Company, and we remain firmly committed to them.\n\nSee our Diversity & Equity page on our corporate website for more information on our commitments to pay equity and gender equality.\nLeadership development\n\nAs part of our strategy to drive business results and advance our purpose, we remain committed to leadership development to support equity for our employees across all dimensions of diversity, including those you can see and those you cannot. We continue to develop and offer leadership programs to promote equality and publicly report on our progress to achieve gender equality.\n\nSee GRI 404 on page 130 for more information on our leadership programs to promote equality.\n\nBuilding a more inclusive workplace and a culture of belonging\n\nA major priority at our Company is to ensure our employees feel a sense of belonging. We promote programs for people managers that support inclusion and that our leaders use to share their perspectives. Our Pulse surveys allow us to measure our employees\u2019 perceptions on inclusion and other critical workforce issues. The Pulse surveys are just one of the avenues we use to directly engage employees and remain accountable to their needs. They also allow us to be responsive to employee feedback on workforce issues and to integrate their input into decision-making. We are proud of the fact that across an average of our 2022 surveys, 81 percent of our employees stated that they feel a sense of belonging at our Company. Also, 87 percent of our employees felt their people leader actively supported diversity and inclusion in their work group.\n\nRelated to our focus on inclusion is our commitment to a decade-long practice of understanding, measuring and acting to sustain high employee engagement. We maintain a practice of listening deeply to our employees. This is critical to our own decision-making, and influences leaders across the organization. Many of our EBRGs offer listening forums to colleagues to foster authentic and courageous conversations in an emotionally safe environment.\n\nGoing forward, we are publicly committed to maintaining or exceeding our current employee engagement index score through 2025, as measured through Pulse surveys, which are conducted multiple times a year.\n\nEmployee retention, recognition and people leader capability\n\nThe past year reflects our ability to continually attract and retain highly qualified people, strengthen our competitiveness and mitigate employee turnover. We have held ourselves accountable to actions designed to provide equality of opportunity and have increased our diverse representation. Last year, we also shared our goals for improving diverse representation in senior management, including women and people of Black/African American and Latino/Hispanic descent.\n\nWe aim to create more opportunities for underrepresented groups by evaluating our hiring processes to determine where we can remove barriers. This includes training our people managers on strategies to mitigate unconscious bias in the candidate selection, hiring and recognition process.\n\nIn addition to our enterprise-wide, unconscious-bias education (first introduced to the organization in 2014), we have developed a Learning Journey framework focused on critical capabilities, behavioral expectations and targeted learning assets to continue to drive our strategic focus and investment in building a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment for all our employees.\nAllyship\n\nIn 2022, we continued to evolve our global allyship effort, with senior sponsorship from the chief diversity officer and the chief of staff to the chairman and CEO. This included the launch of the Ally Resource Center, an internal library of over 125 resources featuring active allyship and content from each of the 10 EBRGs. Our inaugural allyship webcast drew nearly 800 attendees from over 40 countries.\n\nGender-sensitive recruitment and retention\n\nWe recognize that talent acquisition is pivotal in sourcing, attracting diverse talent and supporting hiring people managers, and in eliminating unconscious bias in the selection process.\n\nTalent Acquisition uses a cutting-edge technology platform to scan the language used in job postings and to highlight suggested language changes that ensure our job descriptions are gender neutral and inclusive. This is in addition to a careful review of job postings to ensure there is no biased language.\n\nOpportunities for people with disabilities\n\nWe encourage a culture of transparency, and align with external organizations that share our vision for full disability inclusion to foster a culture of inclusion and belonging that supports people with disabilities.\n\nThe Valuable 500\n\nIn 2022, we became one of 75 companies to participate in a new mentoring program, Generation Valuable. This program pairs an employee with a disability with an executive for a mentorship.\n\nDisability inclusion in our supply chain\n\nIn 2022, we joined the Disability:IN Procure Access Initiative, a business-to-business initiative facilitated by Disability:IN and their Digital Accessibility Program.\n\nDigital accessibility\n\nIn 2021, we implemented a global digital accessibility policy, seeking to ensure equal access across the Company digital landscape\u2014for the internal workforce as well as external patients and consumers and, in 2022, implemented the 5-year digital accessibility roadmap.\n\nUniversal design\n\nDesigning for accessibility, usability and inclusion in the built environment goes beyond the Americans with Disabilities Act. We created a universal design standard for our facilities around the globe, in order to make a difference in the lives of our employees and guests. This approach is especially critical for a workplace centered around science and invention, and our mission to save and improve lives.\n\nA culture of employee well-being\n\nTo succeed, we prioritize the health, well-being and safety of our employees. We are committed to continuing the special emphasis we placed on our employees\u2019 well-being during the pandemic, including reinforcing a collaborative culture and ways of working that drive long-term success.\n\nPlease see our Well-being Report on our corporate website to see how we support employee well-being in the U.S. and around the globe.\nExpanding our pipeline of diverse talent\n\nIn the past year, we have continued outreach to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) by partnering with several organizations, including the College Diversity Network and the National Urban League, to focus on building deep partnerships with colleges, students, faculty and alumni of HBCUs. We also focus on barriers that may limit the employee candidate pool, including the geographic location of open positions and job prerequisites of prior pharmaceutical experience. To broaden our access to diverse talent, we post some positions with an option to work virtually, offer relocation services and carefully consider whether prior pharmaceutical experience is required.\n\nWe leverage key partnerships such as:\n\n- Ascend\n- Best Buddies\n- Disability: IN\n- Executive Leadership Council (ELC)\n- INROADS College Links\n- Lesbians Who Tech\n- National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering (NACME)\n- National Urban League\n- Out & Equal\n- Women of Color in Pharma (WOCIP)\n\nSkills-First\n\nSkills-First is a paradigm shift in how our Company attracts, develops and advances talent with an increased focus on skills instead of a four-year degree or credentials for appropriate roles. This approach creates equitable access to meaningful career opportunities for a broader pool of diverse candidates. It also helps to fuel innovation within our Company by bringing in new ideas and perspectives. In 2022 alone, our Company posted 900 roles not requiring a four-year college degree. Key partnerships helping to accelerate our Skills-First transformation include OneTen and Year Up, among others.\n\nOneTen Initiative\n\nOneTen is a coalition of CEOs and leading companies helping to close the opportunity gap for Black talent in America and to ignite potential for generations to come. Under the leadership of our CEO and Chairman Rob Davis, we have made progress towards our commitment to OneTen\u2019s mission of hiring, promoting, and advancing one million Black individuals who do not have four-year college degrees into family-sustaining careers over 10 years. In 2022, we posted approximately 900 job roles without a bachelor\u2019s degree requirement. We also launched our first Skills-First apprenticeship program with apprentices in digital marketing, data analytics, and information technology. Consistent with our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, our Company is determined to be a role model within OneTen and adopt a Skills-First talent approach within appropriate business areas.\n\nTo learn more, please visit the story on our corporate website.\nYear Up\n\nWe are among the 250 corporations partnering with the innovative organization Year Up. This nonprofit seeks to ensure equitable access to economic opportunity, education and justice for all young adults. They accomplish this by closing the job market opportunity gap for economically-disadvantaged youth by offering six months each of intensive training and corporate internship in either information technology, financial operations, sales and customer support, business operations, or software development and support at major corporations. In 2022, the Company provided approximately 90 student internships to candidates sourced by Year Up, with plans for continued growth and expansion of this partnership in the future.\n\nMinorities in Agriculture, Natural Resources and Related Sciences (MANRRS)\n\nOur Animal Health Division partners with MANRRS to support the identification of diverse talent from the agricultural sciences and related fields and to expose them to the variety of career paths available in the animal health industry in addition to the veterinary field. The growing areas of connected technology and other smart data products and services for animal health and well-being\u2014where Merck Animal Health is a global leader\u2014are examples of exciting career paths that are available to today\u2019s talent.\n\nMerck Animal Health Veterinary Scholarship Program\n\nOur scholarship program offers grants to all outstanding veterinary students to further their education as they pursue careers in animal medicine. In 2022, over $1.2 million in scholarships were awarded to 311 students from 70 different countries.\n\nNextGen Network global reverse mentoring program\n\nWe are seeing the impact and value of having multiple generations in the workplace. In 2018, the NextGen Network created a global reverse mentoring program called GEN2GEN. The success of the program is evidenced by program participation across 58 countries. GEN2GEN empowers generational change uniquely by offering co-mentoring partnerships where our younger generations advise our more-tenured generations.\n\nExtending our GD&I commitment beyond our employees\n\nOur work in equity does not stop at the doors of our Company. It continues outside our employee base and into communities all over the world, including communities that have historically been underserved or underfunded. We engage with partners to advance the efforts of our global diversity and inclusion commitments and to support underserved communities all over the globe.\n\nCEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion\n\nFive years ago, we signed a pledge to join the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion. This commitment extends beyond our employees to supporting businesses around the world by making a difference in global economic inclusion. We continue to work with this vital organization to share best practices and identify new opportunities to foster diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nEconomic inclusion and supplier diversity\n\nIn 2022, 14 percent of our total procurement spend went to minority-, women-, veteran-, LGBTQ+- and disability-owned business enterprises.\n\nIt is important to provide definitions and context for diverse suppliers. Diverse suppliers are businesses that are 51 percent managed, controlled and operated by a person or persons of the following categories:\n\n- Minority: Black, Hispanic, Asian and Native American\n- Women\n- LGBTQ+\n- Veteran, service-disabled veteran\n- Disability-owned business\n\nFor more information on our supplier diversity program, please see GRI 204 on page 77.\n\nLearn more about our commitment to diversity in clinical trials on our corporate website.\n## Diversity of Governance bodies and employees\n\n| Gender and ethnicity                                      | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Women in the workforce                                    | 49%  | 49%  | 50%  | 50%  | 50%  |\n| Women on the Board\u00b9                                       | 33%  | 46%  | 46%  | 43%  | 46%  |\n| Women in executive roles\u00b2                                 | 20%  | 20%  | 33%  | 33%  | 23%  |\n| Women on the senior management team\u00b3                     | 27%  | 30%  | 31%  | 36%  | 34%  |\n| Women in management roles\u2074                                | 41%  | 42%  | 42%  | 44%  | 45%  |\n| Members of underrepresented ethnic groups on the Board\u00b9   | 17%  | 23%  | 31%  | 21%  | 15%  |\n| Members of underrepresented ethnic groups in executive roles (U.S.)\u00b2 | 30%  | 40%  | 25%  | 42%  | 39%  |\n| Members of underrepresented ethnic groups on the senior management team (U.S.)\u00b3 | 19%  | 21%  | 20%  | 25%  | 28%  |\n| Members of underrepresented ethnic groups in the workforce (U.S.) | 28%  | 29%  | 30%  | 32%  | 34%  |\n| Members of underrepresented ethnic groups in management roles (U.S.)\u2074 | 22%  | 23%  | 25%  | 26%  | 27%  |\n| New hires that were female                                | 51%  | 51%  | 50%  | 53%  | 52%  |\n| Promotions that were female                               | 52%  | 53%  | 52%  | 53%  | 54%  |\n| New hires that were members of underrepresented ethnic groups (U.S.) | 36%  | 35%  | 40%  | 46%  | 47%  |\n| Promotions that were members of underrepresented ethnic groups (U.S.) | 28%  | 30%  | 32%  | 34%  | 37%  |\n\nNote: We have publicly disclosed EEO-1 information since 1999.

Support and respect for the protection of human rights is embedded and reflected in our operational policies and procedures, as summarized in the table below.\n\n| Human rights issue                  | Policies / standards | Governance |\n|------------------------------------|----------------------|------------|\n| Health and safety                  | \u00d7                    | Global Safety & Environment |\n| Forced labor and human trafficking | \u00d7                    | Human Resources |\n| Discrimination and harassment      | \u00d7                    | Human Resources |\n| Child labor                        | \u00d7                    | Human Resources |\n| Freedom of association             | \u00d7                    | Human Resources |\n| Working hours                      | \u00d7                    | Human Resources |\n| Privacy                            | \u00d7                    | Global Privacy Office |\n| Security                           | \u00d7                    | Global Security |\n| Access to grievance mechanisms     | \u00d7                    | Office of Ethics |\n| Suppliers and business partners    | \u00d7                    | Global Supplier Management |\n\n| Lead function                      |                      |\n|------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Global Safety & Environment        |                      |\n| Human Resources                    |                      |\n| Human Resources                    |                      |\n| Human Resources                    |                      |\n| Human Resources                    |                      |\n| Global Privacy Office              |                      |\n| Global Security                    |                      |\n| Office of Ethics                   |                      |\n| Global Supplier Management         |                      |\nRemedy\n\nAs part of our efforts to protect against business-related human rights abuses, we have established a grievance mechanism that allows employees and workers to report concerns in a confidential manner without fear of retaliation. This grievance mechanism, and associated reporting channels, are fundamental to ensuring that employees and workers have access to an effective remedy whenever human rights impacts occur.\n\nFor more information on mechanisms for raising concerns, please see GRI 2-26 on pages 44-45.\n\nWe expect our suppliers to encourage all workers to report concerns or suspected illegal activities without threat of reprisal, intimidation or harassment, and to investigate and take corrective action if needed. In addition, we expect our suppliers to provide workers with information on how to confidentially report concerns and ensure that reporting workers are protected from retaliation.\n\nGovernance\n\nOur oversight and monitoring of business-related human rights risks is supported by relevant internal functions and business units, including Human Resources; Global Safety & Environment; Global Supplier Management; Supply Chain Management; Ethics & Compliance; Global Security; Global Privacy Office, Information Risk Management; Enterprise Risk Management; and the Office of Social Business Innovation.\n\nOperations that have been subjected to human rights reviews\n\nWe perform supplier labor and human rights audits (using independent third-party service providers) at select direct material suppliers\u2019 facilities located in countries that are known to present an increased risk of human rights abuses.\n\nFor more information, please see GRI 414 on page 145.\n\nEmployee training on human rights policies and procedures\n\nBusiness-related human rights issues are embedded within our internal training programs to help maintain employee awareness and understanding of our Company\u2019s expectations. Examples of human-rights-related topics covered by existing training programs include health and safety; privacy and data protection; harassment and discrimination; and diversity and inclusion; as well as training that explains how to confidentially report concerns, emphasizing the importance of speaking up. Completion of assigned training is closely monitored and reported.\n\nInvestment agreements and contracts that include human rights clauses or underwent screening\n\nOur Global Supplier Management Group (GSMG) function oversees contract development and execution activities associated with the sourcing and selection of our suppliers of goods and services. Through our standard contracts and agreements, we seek a written commitment from suppliers to respect and abide by the principles set forth in our Business Partner Code of Conduct (BPCC). Our BPCC states that business partners are expected to uphold the human rights of workers, treat workers with dignity, respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights and ensure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses.\n\nFor more information on our social assessments for suppliers, please visit GRI 414 on page 145.\nSupplier social assessment\n\nGRI 414 Management approach\n\nSupplier due diligence assessment for labor practices and human rights\n\nWe respect human rights and support transparency in our supply chain. We are committed to upholding the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI) Principles and we require our suppliers to operate in compliance with all applicable laws. We have a formal program led by our Global Supplier Management Group (GSMG) to evaluate the risks for labor and human rights (LHR) in our supply chain. We have a Conflict Minerals due diligence program and complete the associated annual reporting.\n\nOur policies\n\nOur policies serve as our standards of conduct for engaging with stakeholders. They are founded on our Code of Conduct (Our Values & Standards) and are used to navigate and guide our decisions. They help us identify, address and mitigate risks.\n\nFor information on our policies, please visit our Policies & Positions and Sustainability Resources pages on our corporate website.\n\nHuman rights and labor risks\n\nWe recognize that companies with supply chains that extend into high-risk countries potentially face greater LHR risks. Our Company can be exposed to these risks through our supply chain, as some of our third-party suppliers and service providers operate in higher-risk countries.\n\nTo help manage and address potential risks associated with third-party business relationships, GSMG has an established cross-functional, third-party risk management committee and program. LHR risks are considered as part of our third-party risk management activities. We also recognize that potential risks may exist beyond Tier 2 suppliers.\n\nWe continue work to detect and address the risks in our supply chain through:\n\nSupplier selection\n\nSelecting suppliers that are socially responsible and who share our commitments to ethics and integrity. We strive to obtain the services, goods, active ingredients, components, finished goods or other products in a way that is lawful and fair.\n\nExpectations\n\nSetting and communicating our expectations of suppliers, including those related to child labor, forced labor and human trafficking. We use our Business Partner Code of Conduct to communicate our expectations. It has been translated for all countries in which we operate.\n\nSupply chain mapping\n\nMapping our supply chain to identify which of our suppliers operate in countries that are known to present a significant risk of LHR issues. We use this information to help us decide upon the level of due diligence that may be necessary.\n\nDue diligence\n\nConducting appropriate supplier due diligence to help determine the level of risk presented by suppliers, including potential new (prospective) suppliers as well as our existing suppliers. Our supplier due diligence process for LHR targets direct materials suppliers, including external manufacturing suppliers and contract manufacturing organizations.\n\nA self-assessment questionnaire is used to gather information on freely chosen employment, child labor, employment practices, employee disclosures, fair treatment, wages, benefits and working hours. Suppliers\u2019 responses are used to judge whether that supplier has programs and/or procedures in place to address potential risks for labor and human rights, including modern slavery and human trafficking. The information gathered as part of due diligence is used to determine the acceptability of suppliers\u2019 local practices. Results are then applied by GSMG to inform our supplier selection and risk management processes.\nContracts\nSeeking written commitment from suppliers to respect the principles set forth in our Business Partner Code of Conduct through our contracts/agreements. Our contract templates contain a Business Partner Code of Conduct compliance clause that includes provisions related to modern slavery.\n\nAuditing\nPerforming LHR audits at select supplier facilities to verify their conformance with our expectations (as stated in our Business Partner Code of Conduct), and working with them to address identified nonconformances. We use independent third-party audit firms to perform announced LHR audits at suppliers\u2019 facilities. When preparing our audit schedule, we consider the industry risk, the category of materials supplied, the country in which the supplier operates and results of past due diligence.\n\nRemedial actions\nTracking and reporting on the closure of remedial actions taken by suppliers to address identified nonconformances (gaps/concerns) revealed by supplier LHR auditing.\n\nMonitoring\nAssigning relationship managers from within GSMG to oversee and monitor the performance of key suppliers. We continue to hold suppliers accountable for meeting their contractual obligations.\n\nGovernance\nUsing our Third-Party Risk Committee to help govern and oversee the management of risks associated with third-party relationships. This committee is chaired by our senior vice president for Global Procurement. The role of our Third-Party Risk Committee (and associated Third-Party Risk Team) is to assist senior leadership by providing independent and objective oversight, monitoring and reporting in relation to the risks presented by third parties.\n\nEngagement\nEngaging and seeking input from relevant stakeholders, including GSMG, Ethics & Compliance, Legal, Global Safety and Environment and Office of Social Business Innovation.\n\nCollaboration\nWorking with PSCI to develop training, tools and maturity models, and share knowledge across our industry and with our suppliers.\n\nTraining\nAs part of onboarding, training on our Company\u2019s Business Partner Code of Conduct, third-party risk management, and mitigating modern slavery risks in supply chains is provided to sourcing professionals that have responsibility for supplier selection, oversight and monitoring.\n\nNext steps\nWe will continue working on our efforts to identify, assess and address LHR risks within our operations and supply chains.\n\nThese efforts will include:\n\u2022 Investigating all reported concerns promptly\n\u2022 Conducting supplier labor and human rights due diligence to identify and address risks\n\u2022 Auditing select suppliers to verify conformance with standards for LHR\n\u2022 Holding suppliers accountable for addressing nonconformances revealed by LHR audits\n\u2022 Participating in the activities/initiatives of PSCI\u2019s Human Rights and Labor Sub-Committee\n\nNew suppliers screened using social criteria\n\nPlease see GRI 2-6 on page 35 for information on our supply chain risks and associated KPIs.\nManagement approach\n\nOur Company\u2019s Political Contributions Committee engages in the political process\u2014at both the federal and state levels\u2014to educate policymakers, lawmakers and candidates on policy issues critical to our industry and our Company\u2019s core purpose to invent new medicines and vaccines to save lives. The Center for Political Accountability, at the Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, has recognized our Company as a \"Trendsetter\" for the last six years in their annual CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability report.\n\nWe continue to make bipartisan contributions that are carefully considered on a case-by-case basis. In establishing our political giving priorities, our contributions committee considers various factors to prioritize candidates who support policies that enhance innovation and patient access to health care. We certainly do not agree with every position that every recipient of PAC support takes on every important social and business issue.\n\nPolitical contributions\n\nWe spent a total of $989,900 in U.S. corporate political contributions in 2022. A large portion of these funds were used to support the campaigns of 410 candidates in 21 states plus the District of Columbia. The party breakdown of the contributions for individual candidates was 49.76 percent Democratic, 49.76 percent Republican, and 0.49 percent Independent. Republicans held a majority in 61 chambers, Democrats held the majority in 37 chambers and in one chamber power is divided equally between the parties.\n\nSupport was also provided under this program to state legislative leadership committees, industry-affiliated political action committees, and several national organizations representing state elected officials. Examples of these groups include the Republican Governors Association and the Democratic Governors Association, as well as PhRMA expenditures in California that are derived from Merck\u2019s dues to this association.\n\nOur Company representatives involved in state-government-affairs activities made the recommendations for specific contributions based on the budget and priorities approved by the Political Contributions Committee. Outside legal counsel conducted a thorough review of all proposed contributions to ensure that they were permitted under state law. Corporate political contributions were then approved by U.S. Legal after outside legal counsel review and approval.\n\nIn addition to these contributions, in 2022 we also provided corporate contributions to candidates or political parties in Australia and Japan. These contributions were reviewed and approved in accordance with all relevant internal policies and in compliance with the electoral funding and disclosure laws of their respective countries.\n\nInformation on all of our contributions can be found on the Transparency Disclosures page of our corporate website.\nCustomer health and safety\n\nGRI 416 Management approach\n\nOur quality strategy is focused on maintaining sustained quality and compliance excellence through focused digital technologies, effective oversight and risk mitigation, engaged and empowered colleagues and communities, and a mature Quality Management posture. Our quality strategy is a key enabler to ensuring patient safety and the overall quality and continuous supply of our products.\n\nWe operate in a highly complex and ever-changing regulatory landscape driven by many different factors, including novel scientific discoveries and technological advancements. Specifically, we are leveraging new technological advancements such as integrated IT tools, artificial intelligence (AI) and streamlined digital platforms to further enhance how we manufacture high-quality products. We apply and adhere to a strict set of quality standards, and have policies and procedures in place to define, measure, control and sustain product quality excellence. Our Global Quality organization is responsible for establishing the standards to ensure that our Company\u2019s products are manufactured, tested, released and distributed in compliance with regulatory requirements.\n\nWe continuously strive to enhance these standards in order to ensure ongoing compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs). We provide appropriate, ongoing training on cGMPs for our employees so they are prepared to perform their duties effectively. Our quality system not only ensures that all applicable employees are trained, but also monitors the effectiveness of the training provided.\n\nOur medicines and vaccines are widely tested before they are approved for marketing. This testing is governed by a comprehensive regulatory scheme and by our research policies. We assess the safety of our products in rigorous nonclinical and clinical trials prior to seeking regulatory approval. Following approval of our drugs, vaccines or devices our Company continues to monitor their safety profiles.\n\n| Product recalls | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|-----------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Global number of product recalls\u00b9 | 11   | 7    | 16   | 15   | 5    |\n| Number of product recalls exclusively outside of the U.S. | 9    | 6    | 14   | 13   | 2    |\n| Global number of units subject to recall\u00b2 | 1,726,354 | 106,694 | 5,895,375 | 1,839,656 | 109,473 |\n\n\u00b9 Periods following June 2021 exclude products included in spin-off to Organon & Co.\n\u00b2 \"Units subject to recall\" is defined as units within scope of a recall that are outside of company control.\n\u00b3 All 2022 recalls were voluntarily initiated.\nAnimal Health\n\nResearch and development\n\nThe Animal Health vice presidents of R&D (Pharmaceuticals/Biologicals) hold joint responsibility for the benefit-risk determination for our Animal Health pipeline and marketed Veterinary Medicinal Products (VMPs), and oversee all Animal Health clinical programs.\n\nWe test our investigative animal health pharmaceuticals and vaccines vigorously for safety, quality and efficacy before submitting them for approval, which can be obtained only after thorough review by independent regulatory authorities.\n\nThis testing and refining of a product can take years to complete. When all of the required testing is completed and found to be satisfactory by the appropriate government regulatory agency, the product is approved to be sold. Once a product is on the market, we follow all applicable pharmacovigilance rules and findings are assessed and reported to regulatory authorities.\n\nRegulatory affairs\n\nA consistent, science-based regulatory environment is one of the key conditions necessary for innovation and for providing our customers with high-quality products. We support global harmonization of the regulatory process for veterinary medicines through our global trade association, HealthforAnimals, which is recognized as an observer organization. This allows HealthforAnimals to offer input and provide perspectives in meetings with international standards-setting bodies, including:\n\n- International Cooperation on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Veterinary Medicinal Products (VICH)\n- Codex Alimentarius\n\nQuality\n\nAll of our pharmaceuticals and vaccines must be tested for product quality as well as for their safety and efficacy in treated animals. Our submissions to regulatory agencies also include rigorous human food safety testing for those products used in food-producing animals, in addition to user safety and environmental safety assessments.\n\nPharmacovigilance\n\nOur Animal Health Global Pharmacovigilance (GPV) team manages a global system for the collection, review and reporting of adverse event (AE) reports received by our Company worldwide, and for the continuous assessment of product safety. GPV leads all safety monitoring and signal management activities for the Animal Health VMP portfolio from the time of initial product approval through the end of the product life cycle.\n\nFor more information, please visit the Ethical Treatment of Animals page on our corporate website.\nIn 2022, we continued our commitment to increasing our focus in this area and have strategically enhanced our ability to make a long-term impact on patient safety through various education campaigns. We are committed to cooperating with relevant government agencies, other pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, health professionals, consumer groups and key related organizations in fighting the problem of counterfeit pharmaceutical products, and in educating the public about the risks of counterfeit products and how to protect against them.\n\nThis effort includes a multi-pronged approach to communicating the threat that counterfeit medicines pose and to mitigating this threat as effectively as possible while recognizing that it cannot be entirely eliminated.\n\nAppropriate collaboration and information-sharing in order to raise public and stakeholder awareness of the issue and risks are a crucial focus of our product integrity program. Through active partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies, and with organizations focused on security, patient safety and public health, we provide effective advocacy on high-priority anti-counterfeiting policy initiatives.\n\nThese collaborative efforts support the production of reports, white papers and data-circulation initiatives, as well as promote the intelligence sharing necessary to combat threats from counterfeit medicines.\n\nThe anti-counterfeiting data below details the number of new suspected and substantiated counterfeit events in 2022 and for the previous four years. It reflects the current status of each event for all years presented as of February 2023.\n\nThroughout 2022, Global Security addressed 2,102 product integrity events in 90 countries, involving counterfeit, diversion, supply chain security, tampering and brand security (non-Merck, unapproved generic product). Approximately 20 percent of these events have been proactively investigated by Global Security to identify new or emerging product integrity threats, or to further characterize and mitigate known threats.\n\nWe enable meaningful enforcement actions as a key strategic priority, and in 2022 our product integrity activity led to 166 arrests and the seizure of more than 11,009 units of counterfeit or illicit versions of our products. There were 65 prosecutions resulting from product integrity investigations in 2022.\n\nCounterfeit products\n\nWe invest in an industry-leading, rigorous and intelligence-led product integrity strategy that is solely focused on protecting patients from the harm associated with counterfeit and diverted medicines. Our Global Security Group oversees our global product integrity strategy and leads its execution. The strategy seeks to protect our patients and our Company\u2019s reputation from the negative impacts of counterfeit medicines using a three-pronged strategy focused on:\n\n1. Securing the supply chain\n2. Investigations and enforcement\n3. Raising public and stakeholder awareness\nAnother crucial aspect of investigations is the forensic analysis of questionable products. This forensic testing is aimed at concluding whether a questionable product is counterfeit, diverted or otherwise illicit. Counterfeit products are characterized to gain further intelligence and understanding of the counterfeiters and the threats to public health. We also have forensic detection devices in the field to analyze and detect counterfeits in regions around the world.\n\nAs counterfeiters improve their skills and techniques, our forensic scientists have pioneered the use of several analytical tools for the detection and characterization of counterfeit medicines and continue to explore new analytical tools that would increase their forensic testing capabilities. Lab findings are shared with regulatory and/or law-enforcement agencies and may be used to support subsequent enforcement actions and legal proceedings.\n\nThere were 771 unique questioned samples received as evidence and prepared for forensic testing in relation to active events in 2022. As part of our proactive awareness program, throughout 2022 Global Security trained approximately 1,734 law-enforcement personnel in more than 44 countries regarding the patient safety risks associated with counterfeit and diverted medication. Global Security also launched an internal training program on the Counterfeit, Diversion and Tampering (CDT) reporting process in late 2017. To date, more than 96,000 employees and contractors have completed this training globally.\n\nSupply chain security and serialization\n\nOur proactive focus on managing supply chain security risk is based on our careful implementation and management of strict policies and procedures designed to protect the legitimate distribution of our products. We require customers to purchase our products directly from our Company or from authorized distributors listed publicly on our corporate website.\n\nWe maintain our commitment to ensure compliance with established Company policies, standards and procedures throughout the supply chain by identifying vulnerabilities and threats to the supply network. Resources are positioned globally to monitor and manage our security programs and investigate incidents when they occur. As a certified Importer under the Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (CTPAT) Program, we are validated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection as an elite Tier 3 Member recognized as implementing best practices in supply chain security. This adds an important layer to the security of our products and materials imported to the U.S.\n\n| Anti-counterfeiting\u00b9 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|---------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Investigations of suspected counterfeit products\u00b2 | 269  | 560  | 555  | 935  | 691  |\n| Substantiated cases of counterfeit products | 231  | 214  | 75   | 112  | 196  |\n\n\u00b9Prior-year data have been adjusted to reflect the current status of each event as of March 2023.\n\u00b2Evidence from ongoing investigations of suspected counterfeit products can result in recategorization.\nSerialization\u2014adding a 2D barcode with a unique identification number on each package that goes to market\u2014is one of the tools we are investing in to secure our supply chain and prevent or detect counterfeiting. A serial number on individual packages may enable anyone along the supply chain\u2014from a distributor to a pharmacist to a patient\u2014to scan the code and verify it as a serial number corresponding to a genuine product of our Company. Serialization can add a robust layer to our product security platform. When associated with a regulatory mandate that specifies effective implementation and reporting to a national database, this method of product tracking can become a more meaningful product security tool.\n\nMany jurisdictions around the world are requiring serialization on pharmaceutical packages or are considering such mandates. However, each country\u2019s regulations are different, which makes it very challenging for our packaging sites and distribution networks to meet these diverse and intricate requirements, with additional complexity as reporting requirements are phased in.\n\nWe launched the Global Product Serialization Initiative in 2012, with the goal of meeting these varying requirements in a robust, standardized and effective way based upon GS-1 standards.\n\nThrough these efforts, we are currently in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements related to serialization. We are also working with industry associations and regulatory authorities to better understand potential new requirements and to advocate for simple, standardized and common-sense regulations that can be effective at protecting against counterfeit medicines.\n\nIn addition to our compliance with regulatory requirements related to serialization, we are also exploring opportunities to deploy voluntary serialization and secondary verification technologies to further enhance the security and traceability of our products. These multifactor verification systems would be enabled by blockchain nodes and applications that allow for secure and immutable product tracing that could be accessed by all supply chain partners and end users. We are currently running several proof-of-concept and pilot studies involving these emerging technologies, as well as participating in active industry associations, such as PharmaLedger, to further develop and apply these digital solutions.\n\nClinical trial site monitoring, design, conduct and oversight\n\nWe have a longstanding commitment to sharing the results of our clinical trials, regardless of their outcome, in a timely manner. If a clinical trial of a marketed product is terminated early for safety reasons, we promptly disclose medically important information to regulatory authorities and the public, update the status on ClinicalTrials.gov within 30 days and submit a manuscript to a journal (or post a summary online) within 12 months after the last patient\u2019s last visit occurs. If the trial was terminated for efficacy reasons, the results will be disclosed within 12 months after the last patient\u2019s last visit occurs.\n\nSummaries of terminated trials will provide information about patient disposition, safety and adverse experiences, as well as an explanation as to why the trial was terminated early. We comply with all applicable laws and regulations associated with the registration of clinical trials in publicly accessible registries and subsequent posting of the results from these trials. We have put in place the processes necessary for compliance with the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 and the EU Clinical Trials Regulation No 536/2014 (EU-CTR), including those related to clinical trial registration and posting results.\n\nFor those who analyze, report or publish the results of clinical trials, a clinical trial registry also provides information on trials in progress and the ability to track such trials over the course of development. Company-sponsored and -conducted clinical trials involving patients assigned treatment with investigational and marketed products are registered at trial initiation on ClinicalTrials.gov, EUclinicaltrials.eu and ENCePP.eu.\n\nIn accordance with our public policy position statement on clinical trial ethics, all investigational studies in human subjects are conducted in a manner consistent with applicable laws, regulations and guidelines for the protection of human subjects, including those issued by the International Council for Harmonisation: Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP). However, individual country regulations and guidelines should remain the primary determinant of specific requirements for the conduct of medical research. In all regions, we have a commitment, where appropriate, to the study of diverse patient populations, including underrepresented groups, women and children. As a result, we strive to obtain information among diverse\npopulations, ensuring a thorough evaluation of the safety and efficacy of our medicines and vaccines. These efforts allow us to seek regulatory approvals throughout the world and thereby offer our medicines globally to patients who need them.\n\nWhen appropriate, an internal Data-Monitoring Committee (DMC) of our research laboratories\u2019 senior managers reviews unblinded data from ongoing trials in a pre-specified, scientifically acceptable manner. The goals of the DMC are to protect the safety of trial participants and to assess whether the risk/benefit profile is favorable. The DMC\u2019s recommendations are communicated internally to relevant scientists and can be distributed externally to clinical investigators, review boards or regulatory agencies, as appropriate.\n\nGCP/Pharmacovigilance (PV) inspections\n\n| Year | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| GCP/PV inspections by regulatory agencies of the Company or clinical trial investigators that led to significant fines, penalties, warning letters or product seizures | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n\nPlease visit the U.S. Food & Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) MedWatch website for more information on product safety alerts. You may visit the FDA\u2019s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) website for up-to-date information on fatalities associated with product use.\n\nFor more information on our approach to clinical trials, please visit the Clinical Trials page on our corporate website.\nMarketing and labeling\n\nGRI 417 Management approach\n\nOur chief medical officer is responsible for the benefit-risk determination of our Human Health pipeline and marketed products. The chief medical officer provides medical oversight for all clinical programs, supervises the development and implementation of medical policies (including those related to data transparency and the sharing of clinical data), and has responsibility for the design, execution and implementation of pre-registration expanded access (\u201ccompassionate use\u201d) programs.\n\nOur chief safety officer is responsible for determining the Human Health product-risk profile, and for overseeing the safety of our Human Health products. Our Global Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance function, led by the chief safety officer, manages a global system for the collection, review and reporting of adverse events (AEs), and for the continuous assessment of product safety.\n\nThe Animal Health vice presidents in R&D (Pharmaceuticals/Biologicals) hold joint responsibility for the benefit-risk determination for our Animal Health pipeline and marketed veterinary medicinal products, (VMPs) and oversee all Animal Health clinical programs.\n\nClinical safety and risk management\n\nThe Clinical Safety and Risk Management organization leads the Risk Management Safety Team for all Human Health candidates and products, from the beginning of Phase 2b through the end of the product life cycle. Clinical Safety and Risk Management is responsible for the development of proactive clinical safety risk-management strategies, including the Risk Management Plan, which is a regulatory requirement in many countries for marketed drugs and vaccines.\n\nVeterinary medicinal product safety and risk management\n\nThe Animal Health Global Pharmacovigilance Team manages a global system for the collection, review and reporting of AEs, and for the continuous assessment of product safety. Global Pharmacovigilance leads all safety monitoring and signal management activities for the Animal Health VMP portfolio, from the time of initial product approval through the end of the product life cycle.\n\nGRI 417-1 Requirements for product and service information and labeling\n\nSASB 270a.2 Code of ethics governing promotion of off-label use of products\n\nConsistent with applicable FDA regulations, the labels in our product packaging contain information about adverse reactions and other potential risks that are either serious or otherwise clinically significant. We include contact details in our product packaging and on our corporate website for patients, human and animal caregivers, farmers and producers, and human and animal health professionals to report AEs in the U.S. Outside the U.S., AEs are reported in accordance with any additional local country laws and practices.\n\nThere are occasions when our Company, in consultation with regulatory authorities, may determine that it is important to communicate new or updated information promptly to health care providers involved in prescribing or dispensing a drug or in caring for patients who receive a drug. In these situations, we work with regulatory authorities to communicate this information to health care professionals in a timely manner so that they can inform patients through appropriate mechanisms.\nProduct label reviews\n\nThe ongoing oversight and monitoring of our product labels are a major focus of our safety efforts. Our label review teams monitor information on our products and work with our product Risk Management Safety Teams to develop or update product labeling. We regularly communicate relevant information to regulatory authorities worldwide.\n\nHealth literacy\n\nHealth literacy is essential to our overall strategy. We incorporate health literacy into all aspects of a product\u2019s development and life cycle, from clinical testing to labeling and packaging to patient education. In 2020, we founded a worldwide community of practice for health literacy, with membership from eight different nations and various corporate divisions.\n\nThis community of practice was established to assist in identifying and organizing health literacy advocates with the goal of training and educating colleagues more broadly, both through formalized, concerted efforts and through incidental collaboration in the course of daily work.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, the community of practice launched an internal health literacy dictionary with more than 1,000 words, and established an internal health literacy portal for the exchange of materials and best practices.\n\nWe are dedicated to increasing people\u2019s health literacy in the U.S. and around the world. As part of this commitment, our health literacy team has developed a novel method to enhance the patient labeling process for new compounds.\n\nThe purpose of this is to validate comprehension across all the different consumer categories, with a particular emphasis on those who have lower levels of health literacy. To date, 10 of our medicines have FDA-authorized patient labels that were produced with input from patients whose health literacy skills ranged from low to high. Employees who create and assess patient labeling for novel compounds have been required to undergo training in health literacy methods for patient labels since 2021.\nCustomer privacy\n\nManagement approach\n\nInformation about our Company, products and people is one of our most valuable assets. We are committed to the ethical use, management, and protection of information.\n\nOur commitment applies not only to our Company\u2019s information but also to the information entrusted to us by others. Our tools, processes and procedures ensure that we appropriately collect, use and safeguard information throughout its life cycle to ensure integrity of information and to prevent unauthorized access and disclosure. We have developed and continue to improve upon a comprehensive, global, state-of-the-art information security and cyber resiliency program.\n\nOver the past 20 years, we have developed and continually improved a comprehensive global privacy program that promotes organizational accountability for privacy, data governance, and data protection across our business and with our collaborative partners and suppliers. We were the first in the world to obtain regulatory approval in the EU for Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs), based in part on our existing Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPRs) certified program.\n\nThis achievement demonstrates that organizations can rely on common internal standards and processes to govern international data transfers across both the EU and APEC regions to simplify their ability to address the growing regulatory challenges in this area.\n\nOur holistic approach to privacy has its origins in biomedical research ethics and the protection of participants in the research studies that we sponsor and conduct. We have adapted human subject research ethics standards for risk-benefit analysis, transparency, anonymization, coding, and prior review to other activities and processes involving data about people.\n\nGlobal Privacy Program\n\nRegulators around the world are increasingly adopting regulations similar to, or modeled on, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We are well positioned in that our global privacy program is based on the GDPR. Our global privacy program is also intended to be flexible and adaptable to be compliant to new laws and regulations that take effect in the jurisdictions where we conduct business. Examples include the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA); the Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA) in Virginia; the Privacy Act (ColPA) in Colorado; the Consumer Privacy Act (CPA) in Utah; the Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring Act (PDPOMA) in Connecticut; and major revisions to the Data Protection Acts in China, Canada, and Indonesia.\n\nIn addition, there is increased regulatory scrutiny and interest in companies that seek to collect and monetize personal information without full transparency and permission from data subjects. We anticipate that regulators will continue to increase requirements in these areas and levy fines. We believe that we are well positioned for these changes due to the deployment of a comprehensive, closed-loop privacy program and our active engagement with regulators around the world.\n\nThe Global Privacy Office reports to our chief ethics and compliance officer who reports directly to our chief executive officer. Oversight of our global privacy program is conducted within the Privacy and Data Protection Board (PDPB). This is a cross-functional governance board that connects to our Company\u2019s Corporate Compliance Committee. The PDPB meets quarterly.\n\nWe are increasingly reliant on third-party partners and service providers to assist us in our global operations. Just as we need to pay close attention to privacy and data protection, so do the third parties that comprise our supply chain. Our Company employs a robust third-party due diligence process to ensure that we only do business with reputable third parties who share our values and standards.\n\nOur approach is one of accountability and transparency. The heart of this program is a leveraged, world-class Global Privacy Program that manifests itself throughout the world as a network of over 250 Privacy Stewards. Program maturity is measured through a combination of annual privacy self-assessments at the entity and organization level, and by comprehensive privacy audits conducted by internal audit.\nWe also provide annual mandatory cybersecurity training to communicate and reinforce the guidelines in the Information Security Standards Handbook and our commitment to a strong cybersecurity culture. We have established a systematic approach for ensuring employees can understand and comply with Company policies. We developed a robust cybersecurity training and awareness program that frequently and consistently delivers both compulsory and voluntary learning opportunities designed to encourage employees to make security-aware decisions regarding our Company\u2019s information security risks. Topics include, but are not limited to, information protection, identity, email, browsing and mobile security. Employees are also expected to maintain an up-to-date record of their qualifications that details relevant cybersecurity work experience, skills, certifications and internal, industry or vendor-provided training they receive.\n\n**GRI 418-1 Substantiated complaints regarding breaches of privacy or losses of personal data**\n\nWe have a well-established process by which privacy incidents can be reported to the Global Privacy Office and be investigated. The first step of this process is to verify the facts reported and to substantiate the concern. In 2022, we received 217 substantiated privacy concerns, which marks a 49 percent reduction compared to the previous year. This reduction was mainly due to consistent network traffic monitoring and increased privacy and cybersecurity awareness efforts. Four out of 217 incidents were deemed to be reportable to data protection authorities and/or data subjects.\n\n| Global Privacy Program | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Number of concerns regarding privacy practices, breaches of privacy and losses of personal data that were substantiated | 315 | 29\u00b2 | 250\u00b3 | 425\u00b3,\u2074 | 217\u2075 |\n| Number of privacy breaches requiring notification by our Company to individuals or government authorities | 2 | 2 | 0 | 3 | 4 |\n\n1 Privacy concerns reported here include all concerns about our privacy practices reported to our Company\u2019s Privacy Office and substantiated or verified. Verified concerns are investigated as part of the Company\u2019s Incident Management Process which includes a determination of whether regulatory or data subject notification is required.\n\n2 Change in reporting criteria to exclude non-privacy, quality-related issues from the data.\n\n3 Increased sensitivity of network traffic monitors contributed to increased number in 2020 and 2021.\n\n4 The number of substantiated incidents reported for 2021 has been decreased by one to correct a previous misclassification.\n\n5 Consistent network traffic monitoring and increased privacy and cybersecurity awareness efforts resulted in reduced number of privacy incidents in 2022.\nThe **GRI Standards** represent global best practices for reporting publicly on a range of economic, environmental and social impacts. The table below summarizes where responses to the GRI disclosures can be found throughout this report.\n\n### General Disclosures\n\n**GRI 2: General Disclosures**\n\n|   |   |   |\n|---|---|---|\n|
