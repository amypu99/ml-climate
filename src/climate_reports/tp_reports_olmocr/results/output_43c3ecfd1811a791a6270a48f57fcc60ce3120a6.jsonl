And today, change is once again upon us. Artificial intelligence is becoming pervasive at rapid speed, and society is already adjusting. The next decade is expected to bring even more opportunities with the age of machine learning and the metaverse, in which the physical world will merge with an immersive virtual world.\n\nThe growth of new technologies means more demand for chips, and the semiconductor industry will play a critical role in shaping the future. But greater opportunity also means greater responsibility: If the semiconductor industry is expected to grow to $1 trillion within the decade, ESG will play an even more important role in building a responsible and sustainable industry.\n\nWhile it is expected that the industry will almost double in size, it\u2019s imperative our impact on the environment doesn\u2019t increase at the same rate. At Lam, we have set a goal to achieve 100% renewable electricity by 2030 and net zero by 2050, and we have defined the key milestones to get there. In 2022, we became the first U.S.-based semiconductor equipment manufacturer to have its near-term emission reduction targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative. Additionally, in 2022, we exceeded our 2025 water savings goal.\n\nGrowing to a trillion-dollar industry will also require a strong pipeline of STEM talent. To support that, Lam pledged to donate $10 million to the nonprofit FIRST\u00ae Global to help bring science and technology education to youth around the globe. With this partnership, we are creating opportunities for continuous discoveries, and ultimately inspiring the next generation of innovators.\n\nWe are also committed to ensuring human rights across our operations and supply chains. That\u2019s why we recently published a human rights policy that affirms and expands upon our ongoing commitment to upholding internationally recognized human rights standards.\n\nAt Lam, we recognize the value of collaboration, so while we are focused on our own progress, we are also working across the industry\u2014and the broader business community\u2014to build a responsible and sustainable semiconductor ecosystem.\n\nLam joined the UN Global Compact, the world\u2019s largest sustainability initiative, with an ambition for businesses to take shared responsibility for achieving a better world. We also worked with industry leaders to form the Semiconductor Climate Consortium, a new partnership with SEMI to accelerate the industry\u2019s response to climate change. We are working across our supply chain, with a goal to increase supplier engagement and assess their performance on human rights and climate action. We are also engaging closely with our customers because we know their use of our tools impacts their sustainability goals. Through our Semiverse\u2122 Solutions, we are bringing our industry into the virtual space, improving the sustainability of our work, and creating new ways to build the next generation of the workforce quickly and efficiently.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that semiconductors have revolutionized the world, and as we continue to innovate the next generation of technology breakthroughs, we must do it in a sustainable way\u2014for our customers, employees, communities, stockholders, and the planet. None of us can succeed alone, so let\u2019s build the future we want together.\n\nTim Archer\npresident and chief executive officer\n\n---\n\n1 Our 2030 emissions reduction goal was validated in 2022 and was subsequently restated in 2023 in alignment with SBTi.\nFor decades, Lam Research has been challenging assumptions and pushing the boundaries of semiconductor technology.\n\nWe create solutions that enable chipmakers to power progress\u2014always thinking ahead to ask, what\u2019s next?\n\nLam\u2019s global edge\n\n14 primary locations, including:\nFremont, California headquarters\n\n11 manufacturing facilities\n\n6 research & development labs\n\n19,200+ global employees, distributed across:\n\n- 50.2% United States\n- 20.1% Southeast Asia & India\n- 8.5% South Korea\n- 6.3% Taiwan\n- 6.2% Europe\n- 5.9% China\n- 2.8% Japan\n\nNote: Minimal rounding has been applied to these data.\n\n1 Unless stated otherwise, the data in this report are as of Dec. 31, 2022.\n## Financial overview\n\n| (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES AND PER SHARE DATA) | FY 2020       | FY 2021       | FY 2022       | CHANGE FY 21 TO FY 22 |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------------|\n| Revenue                                              | $10,044,736   | $14,626,150   | $17,227,039   | 17.8%                 |\n| Gross margin                                         | $4,608,693    | $6,805,306    | $7,871,807    | 15.7%                 |\n| Gross margin as a percent of total revenue           | 45.9%         | 46.5%         | 45.7%         | (0.8)%                |\n| Total operating expenses                             | $1,934,891    | $2,323,283    | $2,489,985    | 7.2%                  |\n| Research and development (R&D) expenses              | $1,252,412    | $1,493,408    | $1,604,248    | 7.4%                  |\n| R&D as a percent of operating expenses               | 64.7%         | 64.3%         | 64.4%         | 0.1%                  |\n| Net income                                           | $2,251,753    | $3,908,458    | $4,605,286    | 17.8%                 |\n| Net income per diluted share                         | $15.10        | $26.90        | $32.75        | 21.7%                 |\n\n### Revenue by region FY 2022\n\n- **China**: 31%\n- **Korea**: 23%\n- **Taiwan**: 23%\n- **Japan**: 17%\n- **United States**: 8%\n- **Southeast Asia**: 8%\n- **Europe**: 4%\n\n---\n\n1.

R&D expenses are included in total operating expenses.\nLiving our Core Values\n\nOur Core Values are the bedrock on which Lam\u2019s culture is built. They help us cultivate an environment where we can come together to do our best work. These values are ingrained in our daily operations and our efforts to propel sustainable growth, from the way we design new products to how we engage with our stakeholders and teams.\nOur vision for a future of accelerated innovation\n\nTo bolster innovation we must first address and identify common barriers. Within the semiconductor industry, those barriers can include research and communication silos that keep us working apart. By sharing knowledge and insights more widely, we can unlock solutions for a smarter, faster, more sustainable world.\n\nHere\u2019s how we\u2019re collaborating internally and externally to realize new opportunities for what our industry can achieve:\n\n- **Collaborating with customers** to reduce our industry\u2019s environmental impact by developing tools (the products we make) and processes with sustainability in mind.\n- **Teaming up with industry leaders** to break down research and development silos, advocate for our business and stakeholders, and advance climate action.\n- **Coaching and investing in startups** to help them grow and bring transformative technologies and sustainable solutions to scale.\n- **Engaging suppliers** to support them in their own environmental and social efforts, such as driving human rights programs and environmentally sustainable material sourcing.\n- **Partnering with universities and academic consortia** to support and solicit advanced research on the industry\u2019s most pressing challenges.\n- **Collaborating internally** by participating in cross-functional teams, sharing data-based insights, knowledge, and best practices.\n- **Empowering employees** through employee resource groups, volunteerism, and other programs that leverage employees\u2019 passions to drive positive change.\nBuilding momentum to achieve our ESG goals\n\nAs we progress in each of Lam\u2019s ESG pillars, our goals keep us focused and accountable. In 2022, we made important strides, including surpassing our water goal years ahead of schedule. We also received approval from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for our near-term emissions-reduction goals. Unless stated otherwise, we aim to complete each of our ESG goals by 2025.\n\n| ESG PILLAR          | GOAL                                                                 | STATUS | TIMEFRAME |\n|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|\n| Governance          | \u2022 Continue to expand our disclosure and alignment with industry-recognized frameworks and standards |        | Annual    |\n| Product innovation  | \u2022 83% of customers measured by emissions set science-based targets (SBTs)\u00b2 |        | Cumulative from baseline |\n| Sustainable operations | Achieve net zero emissions by 2050 by meeting the following targets: |        | Annual    |\n|                     |   \u2022 Achieve 100% renewable electricity by 2030\u00b3 |        | Cumulative from baseline |\n|                     |   \u2022 Reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 25% by 2025 and 60.6% by 2030 from a 2019 baseline.

It provides a framework for meaningful investments, proactive risk management, and globally focused action. Our approach emphasizes engagement, goal setting, and accountability. We aspire to continuously increase transparency and disclosure, in line with industry-recognized frameworks, best practices, and standards.\n\nOur ESG strategy consists of six pillars that reflect areas where Lam can make a significant positive impact. These pillars include:\n\n- **BUSINESS AND GOVERNANCE**: Integrate ESG into our business operations and foster ownership and accountability as we advance our ESG strategy and goals.\n- **PRODUCTS AND CUSTOMERS**: Innovate with ESG in mind and design for environment principles to be a partner of choice for our customers and support their ESG goals.\n- **SUSTAINABLE OPERATIONS**: Minimize our environmental impact through investments in energy, water, waste, and GHG emissions reductions.\n- **OUR WORKPLACE**: Build an inclusive, diverse, and engaged workplace while achieving top performance in health and safety.\n- **RESPONSIBLE SUPPLY CHAIN**: Ensure an ethical and responsible business ecosystem focused on human rights and the environment.\n- **OUR COMMUNITIES**: Be a responsible corporate citizen with programs focusing on transformative learning, resilient communities, and inclusive societies.\n\nAligning our strategy with the UNGC and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n\nLam is dedicated to the development, implementation, and disclosure of responsible business practices\u2014qualities that are championed by the UNGC. Based on this alignment, we joined the UNGC in 2022 to underscore our commitment to accelerating ESG progress on a global scale. The organization is the world\u2019s largest corporate sustainability initiative, with tens of thousands of participants worldwide. As a member, Lam supports the UNGC\u2019s Ten Principles for labor, environment, anti-corruption, and human rights, as well as the advancement of the UN\u2019s SDGs.\n\nThe SDGs represent an international effort to tackle the world\u2019s most pressing issues. As global citizens, we see the framework of the SDGs as another method of measuring Lam\u2019s progress and ensuring our ESG initiatives serve the greater good. We aim to drive progress on the SDGs throughout Lam\u2019s operations and supply chain, including through our workforce, our products, and our new social impact platform. Learn how Lam is working to accelerate progress toward priority SDGs.\n\nLearn more about our ESG strategy\nLeading with accountability\n\nLam\u2019s Board of Directors (Board) and leaders are committed to strong corporate governance to deliver stakeholder benefits over the long term. We have processes in place for ESG governance, which extend throughout our organization and lead all the way up to our Board. These processes establish clear responsibilities for the oversight, management, and implementation of our ESG strategy.\n\nIn 2022, we deepened our Board\u2019s engagement around ESG issues and increased the cadence of our leaders\u2019 ESG briefings. Our chief communications officer presents ESG updates via presentations or written reports to the Board or its Nominating & Governance Committee four times per year. Additionally, our vice president of global trade and government affairs (GTGA) now briefs the Board\u2019s Nominating & Governance Committee at each of its meetings. We also tied our executive compensation program to progress on Lam\u2019s ESG goals to ensure that Lam\u2019s executive leaders are accountable for driving ESG progress and are rewarded for their achievements. Human capital management and ESG goals represented 20% of the corporate scorecard used as part of the determination of the annual incentive compensation for our named executive officers.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Refers to our named executive officers for our fiscal year ended June 26, 2022, which was the fiscal year during which annual incentive program payouts for calendar year 2021 were made, as determined in accordance with the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nCelebrating the legacy of Catherine P. Lego\u2019s leadership at Lam\n\nIn 2022, Lam announced the retirement of Catherine P. Lego, who served on our Board for more than 16 years. Throughout her tenure, she was a chair or member of each of the Board\u2019s committees. She has also served on other boards over a span of more than 30 years, including for several other semiconductor and technology companies.\n\nChairman of the Board Abhijit Y. Talwalkar stated, \u201cAlways highly engaged and thoughtful in her guidance, Cathy\u2019s understanding of the semiconductor industry, commitment to accountability, and drive for continuous improvement enabled her to make an incredible and lasting impact at Lam.\u201d\n\nLearn more about:\nour ESG governance program \u2794\nour Board diversity metrics \u2794\nEngaging our global stakeholders\n\nThe semiconductor industry is dynamic, presenting new challenges and opportunities each day. Through regular engagement, we stay informed of the issues that matter most to our communities, customers, employees, industry organizations, policymakers, stockholders, and other stakeholders. We tailor our engagement approach to each group, connecting through activities such as industry forums, meetings, and community events.\n\nLearn more about our approach to stakeholder engagement \u2192\n\nEnsuring a focused approach: What we learned from our latest materiality assessment\n\nAn effective ESG strategy can\u2019t remain stagnant\u2014it must be agile to address issues as our business, industry, and world evolve. With that in mind, Lam conducts in-depth ESG materiality assessments every three to five years or whenever there\u2019s a notable shift in our industry and business. During this process, we engage a diverse group of internal and external stakeholders, whose insights help guide and affirm Lam\u2019s ESG approach.\n\nWe conducted our latest assessment in 2022, using a double materiality methodology in line with guidance from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). We reviewed topics that are aligned with a variety of standards, frameworks, and rating entities and narrowed them down to identify topics that have the greatest relevance to our business (such as risk mitigation, market presence, innovation, and reputation). In total, we engaged more than 50 global stakeholders, including internal subject matter experts, customers, investors, suppliers, trade associations, and community organizations. Through surveys and interactive interviews, participants rated ESG topics based on their importance and potential internal and external impacts. We also integrated results from an ESG materiality employee survey to further incorporate our employees\u2019 perspectives.\n\nBased on the results, we identified the following topics as being most impactful and strategically important to Lam\u2019s ESG program: climate strategy, product stewardship, employee fulfillment, inclusion and diversity, supplier engagement and environmental performance, and leadership accountability. Other ESG topics indicated on the matrix\u2014such as corporate governance, ethics, labor practices, human rights, and community engagement\u2014are also key to our success and are foundational to our business. Within this ESG report, we discuss the majority of the topics identified through the assessment.\n\n2022 ESG materiality matrix\n\nThe identification of a topic or other matter as \u201cmaterial\u201d for purposes of this report does not and should not be interpreted to mean that it is material for any other purpose, including for the purpose of our financial statements or the documents we file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nBuilding an ethical culture\n\nDo the right thing. The concept sounds simple but putting it into practice requires both dedication and awareness of how to react when challenges arise. This is work we\u2019re committed to, as we know it\u2019s fundamental to maintaining strong internal and external relationships based on honesty, integrity, and trust. Our Global Standards of Business Conduct (GSBC) supports our Core Values and details the behavior we expect of every employee. The GSBC is a cornerstone of our E&C program, which is designed to meet evolving global requirements.\n\nOur E&C program is further strengthened by Lam\u2019s E&C Steering Committee, which provides strategic and operational guidance. In 2022, the E&C team enhanced our culture of integrity by forming our first regional E&C Steering Committee in Malaysia, which supports local compliance objectives as well as the agenda of our global E&C Steering Committee. We also launched a global Ethics Ambassador program for which we selected and trained employees outside of E&C about promoting an ethical culture and driving progress on our initiatives in our ambassadors\u2019 respective business units and regions.\n\nOur global E&C team works to promote an organization-wide culture of ethics and compliance. The team is led by our chief compliance officer (CCO), who manages our E&C function. The CCO reports to Lam\u2019s chief legal officer and has dotted-line reporting to the Board\u2019s Audit Committee.\n\nProgram focus areas:\n\n- RISK MANAGEMENT\n- POLICIES AND PROCEDURES\n- COMMUNICATION\n- TRAINING\n- INVESTIGATIONS\n\nHosting Lam\u2019s E&C Week\n\nIn October, Lam hosted its first-ever E&C Week, which focused on raising awareness of E&C resources, recognizing and celebrating ethical behavior, and reinforcing our ethical values and culture. We connected with employees by holding regional town halls with global leaders and members of our E&C team. We also shared a video in which CEO staff members discussed the importance of our Core Values and building an ethical culture. Employees nominated colleagues for our inaugural Ethics Award, where we celebrated doing the right thing.\n\nCompliance at Lam is both a strategic enablement and risk management function that focuses on innovation and setting new boundaries. We continue to make investments in people, technology, and resources to support this vision. Our program is based on Lam\u2019s Core Values, which sit at the heart of everything that we do.\u201d\n\nSangeet Dalliwall\nsenior director, E&C at Lam\nRisk management\n\nAssessing internal and external risk on an ongoing basis is essential for Lam's long-term success. As we face challenges related to our growing global footprint and a shifting regulatory landscape, this work is key to the continuity and resilience of our business.\n\nWith this in mind, we further operationalized our E&C global risk assessment program in 2022 by conducting a focused risk assessment; enhancing our third-party risk management program; implementing a gifts, meals, travel, and entertainment monitoring program; and conducting manager workshops.\n\nPolicies and procedures\n\nLam is committed to fair and humane employment practices as a core business principle. In 2022, we developed and published our first corporate-wide Human Rights Policy, which underscores our commitment to respecting human rights and treating our workers and business partners with dignity and respect. Our policy aligns with several internationally recognized standards, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the UN's Guiding Principles on Human Rights, and the Responsible Business Alliance Code of Conduct. Looking ahead, we intend to build on this policy by developing and implementing a formal human rights program.\n\nCommunication\n\nOpen communication is a Core Value at Lam and is key to building a successful E&C program. We distribute global bulletins and regional newsletters that focus on relevant topics so our employees can recognize and respond appropriately to potential compliance risks and ethical issues. On a quarterly basis, people managers receive tailored communications on trending E&C risk areas in a company newsletter. We also use multiple channels to solicit employee feedback, including deploying surveys and conducting employee focus groups after delivering in-person and virtual training. Our leadership team plays an important role in raising awareness about our E&C program. In 2022, several of our global leaders participated in town halls and employee meetings to discuss and reinforce the importance of building on Lam's ethical culture.\n\nTraining\n\nOur training program equips and empowers our employees to make ethical and compliant decisions. We deliver training to increase awareness of our policies and processes through a combination of in-person and virtual sessions and online training modules, which we refresh each year. Lam requires employees to complete annual training that reinforces their understanding of selected topics within the GSBC.\n\nWe rolled out additional manager resources and mandatory ethical leadership training for our people managers in 2022. Our newly created manager resource center provides our people managers with practical guidance for identifying and handling ethical challenges. We also held in-person manager workshops to provide tips and tools to our managers to encourage ethical behavior and support employees who raise concerns.\n\nInvestigations\n\nLam's E&C team can't be everywhere, so we rely on employees to speak up if something doesn't seem right. All Lam employees have the right and responsibility to raise ethical concerns to their managers, senior management, human resources, or the E&C team. Employees and third parties\u2014including contractors, suppliers, and customers\u2014can make a report through our Ethics Helpline via telephone or online.\n\nLearn more about our Ethics Helpline and approach to investigations\n\n---\n\n1Employee completion rate was calculated by excluding: 1) employees who were on leave of absence during the reporting period; and 2) employees who left the company during the reporting period before completing the training. The reporting period was from Oct. 2022 to March 2023.\nProtecting data and intellectual property\n\nAs we fuel our innovation pipeline, we are committed to keeping the intellectual property and data of our company, employees, customers, and suppliers safe. Lam holds International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27001 certification for information security at our corporate headquarters and engages an independent, third-party expert to evaluate security capabilities against the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cyber Security Framework (CSF). As we continued to mature our information security processes in 2022, we improved our scores across the five pillars of the NIST CSF: identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover.\n\nINNOVATION SPOTLIGHT\n\nMindful care of our valuable assets\n\nIn an industry facing unprecedented supply chain pressures, balancing the need for business agility and security can be a challenge. One employee who understands this well is Nivedita (Niv) Kamat, a program manager with Lam\u2019s Governance, Risk, and Compliance Information Security group.\n\nAs part of Lam\u2019s Sensitive Information Protection program, Niv runs an initiative to safeguard thousands of critical drawings. After discovering that one of the program\u2019s safety protocols stood in the way of business agility, she met with several internal and external stakeholders to develop new processes to meet the program\u2019s goals.\n\nThis led to the creation of a Supplier Tier Management application that enables Lam to secure its drawings while granting access to authorized users. Launched in 2022, with full implementation planned for 2023, the solution makes Lam even more nimble while keeping the company\u2019s files safe and secure.\nEngaging policymakers and complying with global taxation\n\nOur company and industry exist within a dynamic regulatory environment. Lam's Global Trade and Government Affairs group is responsible for Lam's strategic engagement with Congress, the U.S. executive branch, and other regulatory bodies at the local, state and federal levels, as well as internationally, to help inform sound public policy in support of our industry and business. We pursue a collaborative approach to policy engagement, working alongside our customers, suppliers, and industry peers with a focus on the following issues:\n\n- Business operations\n- Export controls and trade policy\n- Research and development\n- Tax policy\n\nOur lobbying and political activities are governed by our GSBC, as well as our Political Activity and Government Affairs Policy.\n\nLearn more about our policies and governance approach\n\nIn 2022, the GTGA group remained focused on addressing issues such as supply chain resiliency and trade compliance in the local economies in which we operate. The group played a central role in helping Lam navigate new export controls issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security in October. The controls restrict the export of advanced U.S. chipmaking equipment to the People's Republic of China. These controls directly impact our industry and business, so the group worked closely with Lam's leadership and Board to ensure a compliant, proactive response.\n\nExternally, the GTGA group played a leading role in industry consortia to amplify Lam's voice in the wafer fabrication equipment industry and larger semiconductor ecosystem. In November, Lam joined the Semiconductor Climate Consortium as a founding member to advocate for semiconductor industry climate action on a global scale. Lam has also established its political action committee, Leading American Microelectronics Political Action Committee (LAMPAC), as another means of engagement and advocacy.\n\nEnsuring compliance with global taxation\n\nOur approach to global taxation is to comply with all legal, regulatory, and internal control requirements.\n\nLearn more about our approach to global taxation\n\nSupporting U.S. semiconductor competitiveness\n\nRecent challenges related to the pandemic, as well as geopolitical conflicts, have highlighted the importance of semiconductor manufacturing within the U.S. Headquartered in Fremont, California\u2014with manufacturing sites in California, Ohio, and Oregon\u2014Lam has long represented the strength of American manufacturing and innovation on a global stage.\n\nIn 2022, Lam's president and CEO, Tim Archer, testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. During the hearing, entitled \"Developing Next Generation Technology for Innovation,\" he discussed opportunities to bolster American competitiveness and address key challenges that industry leaders continue to face.\n\nHe focused on three areas that could benefit from the committee's consideration: leveraging existing infrastructure, such as the National Labs; enabling shared innovation, including through the establishment of the National Semiconductor Technology Center; and taking an \"all-of-ecosystem\" approach.\n\n\"U.S. leadership in semiconductor manufacturing technology remains strong because of the innovation, drive, and resourcefulness of American workers across the semiconductor ecosystem. I am proud of the role that Lam Research and our employees have played for more than four decades in setting the pace for innovation and in maintaining U.S. leadership in the global market.\"\n\nTim Archer\npresident and CEO at Lam\n\nRead the full transcript\n\n1 Bureau of Industry and Security Office of Congressional and Public Affairs, \"Commerce Implements New Export Controls on Advanced Computing and Semiconductor Manufacturing Items to the People's Republic of China (PRC).\"\nProduct innovation\n\nIN THIS SECTION:\n\n18 Highlights\n19 Creating our most efficient and sustainable generation of products\n20 Bringing our Tech Vision to life\n24 Developing sustainable solutions\n25 Giving our customers a market edge\n26 Delivering safe, high-quality products\nBy collaborating with our industry and customers, we continue to define what\u2019s next.\n\nEvery year, Lam strives to enable semiconductor breakthroughs that may have seemed impossible the year before. Through experimentation, collaboration, and rigorous testing, we continue to do what\u2019s never been done. Today, advanced microchips shape everything from how we communicate to how we work and drive. The potential for future innovation is limitless, but we don\u2019t plan to realize it alone. Instead, we\u2019re prioritizing open communication and strategic investments in research and development (R&D). By embracing diverse perspectives, we can unlock a faster, smarter, and more sustainable world.\n\nIn 2022, we sponsored and participated in numerous industry and university events to collectively address the semiconductor industry\u2019s most pressing challenges. One highlight was our Tech Symposium, themed \u201cEngineering a Greener Fab.\u201d Internally, we focused on developing smarter, more efficient products and processes to measure and reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions footprint of our tools. These efforts support sustainability in our industry.\n\n### Product innovation\n\n| GOAL | STATUS | 2022 PROGRESS |\n|------|--------|---------------|\n| 83% of customers measured by emissions set science-based targets (SBTs)\u00b2 | | 16.9% of customers as measured by emissions have set SBTs |\n\n#### 2022 HIGHLIGHTS\n\n- Released three new products: Argos\u00ae, Prevos\u2122, and Selis\u00ae\n- Began establishing a baseline to measure Lam\u2019s product-based energy usage and emissions\n- Invested over $1.6 billion in R&D\u00b3\n- Opened new R&D labs in India and South Korea\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Unless stated otherwise, we aim to complete each of our ESG goals by 2025.\n\u00b2 Previously, this goal targeted SBTs for 83% of customers measured by revenue by 2025. Lam updated this goal in 2022 per the SBTi verification and approval process.\n\u00b3 Based on Lam\u2019s 2022 fiscal year.\nCreating our most efficient and sustainable generation of products\n\nIt starts by sparking sustainable innovations.\n\n\u2022 Investing in R&D\u2014including over $1.6 billion in 2022\u00b9\n\u2022 Listening to our customers and imagining new ways to meet their needs\n\u2022 Breaking down research silos and bringing experts together to explore big ideas\n\nUnderstanding our product impact and opportunities is key.\n\n\u2022 Using Equipment Intelligence\u00ae sensors to measure the GHG emissions and energy usage of our products\n\u2022 Incorporating Design for Environment (DfE) principles and designing for the entire product lifecycle\n\u2022 Embracing smart solutions to accelerate Industry 4.0\n\nThe result: Breakthrough solutions that enhance performance, precision, and yield, including:\n\n\u2022 Sense.i\u00ae: A smart solution that enables customers to reduce their energy and material and achieve a smaller fab footprint\n\u2022 Argos\u00ae, Prevos\u2122, and Selis\u00ae: Products that enable ultra-high selectivity and precision to facilitate the next generation of 3D devices\n\u2022 Coronus\u00ae: A bevel clean system that improves yield by up to 2% per wafer\n\n\u00b9Based on Lam\u2019s 2022 fiscal year.\nBringing our Tech Vision to life\n\nTechnology moves fast\u2014and it\u2019s not enough to just keep pace. At Lam, we\u2019re determined to lead our industry into a future that works better for us all. Rather than taking a single-minded approach, we focus on bringing together our industry\u2019s brightest minds. Together, we\u2019re asking big questions, addressing persistent challenges, and realizing new opportunities for what semiconductors can do.\n\nBuilding an innovative workforce\n\nOur work to accelerate large-scale innovation begins by inspiring Lam\u2019s teams. Each year, our Office of the Chief Technology Officer organizes a variety of collaborative and innovation-focused internal events. We also make a point to highlight Lam employees who are driving innovation and providing opportunities to share their knowledge with others.\n\nIn 2022, we continued our Celebrating Innovation campaign for the second year to highlight stories of innovation by employees in technical and non-technical roles (look for highlights in our Innovation Spotlights throughout this report). Lam\u2019s leaders also engaged our global technological community through several sessions focused on our Core Values. Through our Seminar Series, we invited our engineering community to share their work and insights with their peers. Additionally, our Innovation Speaker and Book Series brought the outside world in to educate and inspire Lam employees. Topics featured during our 2022 Innovation Speaker Series include: the intersection of innovation and ESG, how to innovate inside bureaucracies, developing a culture of innovation, and innovations in additive manufacturing, among others.\n\nDriving research-backed breakthroughs\n\nAs chip technology becomes radically small and almost inconceivably precise, the challenges we face become greater and more complex. We support academic research that provides insights into these challenges and opportunities for our industry to advance. By collaborating with leading universities around the world, we boost innovation and fuel our talent pipeline.\n\nOpening the doors to two new global hubs of R&D\n\nOne way we accelerate learning and development cycles is through our investments in semiconductor R&D. In 2022, we opened two advanced facilities in South Korea and India.\n\nLocated in the heart of South Korea\u2019s K-semiconductor cluster, the Korea Technology Center enables Lam engineers and customers to work side-by-side. Together, they can qualify new devices, processes, and yield improvements\u2014allowing for fewer and faster development cycles. The new location also lends itself to closer relationships with local suppliers, universities, and research institutions, and has the added environmental benefit of less travel.\n\nOur India Center for Engineering specializes in the R&D, engineering, and testing of wafer fabrication hardware and software used to create next-generation memory and logic devices. The new facility doubles Lam\u2019s footprint in India and supports shorter development cycles by enabling engineers to design, test, and validate new deposition and etch technologies on site.\n\n\u201cI see vast potential in the ability of our engineers to have hands-on access to Lam\u2019s tools at the India Center for Engineering. This access will have a transformative impact on both the speed and the quality of the engineering solutions that are being developed there.\u201d\n\nSesha Varadarajan\nsenior vice president, Global Products Group at Lam\nHow we\u2019re unlocking research-backed breakthroughs\n\nUnlock Ideas\nprovides awards to support the testing of novel ideas proposed by Lam\u2019s global technical community in collaboration with university faculty. In 2022, the program sought proposals in categories including sustainability for the second year.\n\nUniversity Collaboration Showcase\nbrings Lam employees together to share results from our university research collaborations and Unlock Ideas projects. We hosted the event virtually for the third year in 2022.\n\nElevate Ideas\nprovides additional funding and support to take successful Unlock Ideas projects to the next level. After piloting the program in 2021 with two awards, we awarded two new winners in 2022.\n\nCelebrating the people who push technology forward\n\nIn May 2022, we held our Technical Awards Ceremony to celebrate some of the exemplary people behind Lam\u2019s technical achievements. We were proud to announce our newest Lam Research Fellow and present our annual Patented Innovation Award.\n\nLam Fellows advance the development of products, processes, and technologies that bring value to customers and industry year after year. Our newest fellow, John Drewery, has been with Lam since 2011. He has deep expertise in both deposition and etch, with his contributions in product development recognized at Lam and industrywide. Throughout his 25 years in the industry, he has secured 49 patents. He is known as a passionate mentor who inspires future technical leaders at Lam.\n\nTechnological innovations keep Lam at the forefront of our industry with competitive differentiation and commercial success. Thus, our Patented Innovation Award recognizes the achievements of inventors who earn a U.S. patent for their breakthrough innovations. In 2022, we presented the award to a well-rounded team of 11 Lam inventors. Together, they secured two innovative patents in dielectric atomic layer deposition, an area of significant strategic importance for Lam\u2019s growth objectives.\n\nLearn more about how we\u2019re engaging universities\nBringing experts together to engineer a greener fab\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to change processes that take place on an atomic scale, but for the sake of our industry and planet, there\u2019s got to be a greener way. That was the focus of Lam\u2019s 2022 Technical Symposium, themed \u201cEngineering a Greener Fab.\u201d\n\nThe symposium is Lam\u2019s premiere forum for joint academic and industry cooperation. The 2022 event took place at the University of California, Berkeley, with participants joining in person for the first time since 2019.\n\nExperts used the forum to share and discover leading-edge technologies aimed at advancing environmental sustainability for semiconductor fabrication. Highlights included faculty presentations, panels, student posters, and keynotes from our customers Intel and Micron.\n\n\u201cThe key to innovating is bringing together diverse groups of people and going outside our own little world.\u201d\n\nRick Gottscho\nexecutive vice president, strategic advisor to the CEO, and former chief technology officer at Lam\nSupporting the next generation of semiconductor innovators with Lam Capital\n\nSometimes, you\u2019ve got to disrupt the system to move it in a new direction. In that regard, Lam Capital invests in innovative companies that are addressing today\u2019s most high-impact problems.\n\nIn conjunction with the Tech Symposium, we hosted our second-annual Lam Capital Venture Competition in 2022. During the event, select startups pitched sustainable innovations to a panel of venture capital judges. Proposed solutions ranged from wastewater treatment to microfabs to energy-saving strategies. The winning startup, XLight, pitched an energy-efficient technology for photolithography. The prize: a $250,000 investment funded by Lam Capital.\n\n2022 TECH SYMPOSIUM BY THE NUMBERS\n\n11 universities represented\n11 companies represented\n6 customer keynotes and faculty presentations\n6 venture capital judges, plus a judge from Lam Capital\n\n$250K investment to the winning team by Lam Capital\nDeveloping sustainable solutions\n\nWe are driven to accelerate a net zero transition and a future where our company and customers can achieve more while using less. In that pursuit, one of the most impactful steps we can take is to track and reduce our product-based emissions. This will give Lam an edge in providing the solutions customers need to reduce their environmental impact while meeting increasing demands.\n\nAs of 2022, emissions generated from the energy use of our products represent 55% of our total GHG emissions. To reduce the emissions output of our products, we\u2019re optimizing solutions that are smarter and more efficient. In doing so, we\u2019re proving that it\u2019s possible to increase productivity while reducing the use of raw materials, energy, and space.\n\nAccelerating Industry 4.0\n\nA new phase of the industrial revolution is beginning\u2014known widely as Industry 4.0. It\u2019s an era defined by automation, machine learning, interconnectivity, and real-time data. Our Equipment Intelligence\u00ae solutions combine these elements with Lam\u2019s equipment and process expertise. By enabling faster learning cycles, these solutions help customers enhance productivity, efficiency, and performance while minimizing waste.\n\nFor example, Lam\u2019s Net Zero Product Working Group uses Equipment Intelligence\u00ae sensors to monitor and report the energy and resource consumption of our lab tools. In 2022, the group worked toward establishing baseline data for our tools\u2019 energy consumption and GHG footprint. This will help Lam address our product-based emissions, while supporting our customers\u2019 sustainability goals. The working group\u2019s vision is to connect this data to specific fab processes, enabling customers to optimize resource planning and reduce their energy usage, GHG emissions, and costs. We also made progress on product sustainability by:\n\n- Implementing throughput and uptime improvements, which improve the efficiency of tool operations by 4% and yield with station matching by 60%.\n- Releasing new ECO Mode features for 2300 and Sense.i\u00ae etch tools, which save up to 30% peripheral energy in idle mode and result in faster tool time recovery.\n- Increasing RF generation efficiency on our Vantex tool, which reduces the energy consumed per RF subcomponent by 10%.\n\nIncorporating DfE principles\n\nDfE principles guide us to develop products with their full lifecycle in mind. In doing so, we\u2019re finding ways to reduce the environmental impact of our products while maintaining or improving quality and value. In 2022, our working group continued to incorporate these principles into the product design process.\n\nThree new products that are accelerating three-dimensional (3D) scaling\n\nTypically, companies talk about scaling in terms of expansion. In semiconductor manufacturing, it often means the opposite. One of our industry\u2019s pressing challenges is to continuously scale the tiny devices in chips to make chips that are smaller, denser, and more powerful. This is driving many semiconductor manufacturers to move away from planar structures in favor of complex, 3D versions.\n\nLam\u2019s etch and deposition tools are at the forefront of this innovation, and in 2022, we announced three new precision selective etch innovations: Our new Argos\u00ae, Prevos\u2122, and Selis\u00ae products are designed to complement and extend Lam\u2019s industry-leading etch solutions portfolio. These breakthrough products are enabling chipmakers to etch and modify films with ultra-high selectivity and precision to achieve the most advanced integrated circuit performance capabilities and accelerate 3D scaling.\nGiving our customers a market edge\n\nWhen they ask, we deliver. That\u2019s how we build our customers\u2019 trust. And what many of them want are faster, more efficient, and sustainable chipmaking solutions. Our customers are global technology leaders, and we take pride in supporting their success. Through close collaboration, we strive to exceed their expectations and continuously anticipate their long-term needs.\n\nOur Customer Support Business Group (CSBG) supports Lam\u2019s customers across the equipment lifecycle. From solutions that increase system uptime to offerings that extend the product lifecycle, the group\u2019s goal is to help customers optimize quality and cost, with the added benefit of reducing their environmental impact.\n\nCSBG\u2019s strategy for providing best-in-class customer support:\n\n- **Customized service and software solutions** that enhance productivity throughout the product lifecycle\n- **High-quality, low-defect consumable and non-consumable spare parts** designed to increase circularity while balancing performance, availability, and cost\n- **Technology and productivity upgrades** that increase productivity, reliability, and efficiency and extend product lifecycle\n- **Reliant systems**, including new and refurbished equipment, that extend product lifecycles, increase production capacity, and decrease waste\n- **Technical training**, including software and hardware courses, to develop customers\u2019 knowledge and technical expertise\n\nLam's installed base included approximately 84,000 chambers at the end of 2022.\n\nSimulating complex processes to get real results\n\nLam engineers have a knack for getting to the bottom of vexing customer challenges. Yet wafer-based experiments require an investment in resources and time. Realizing this, several have turned to our powerful SEMulator3D software to create renderings, simulate fabrication processes, and calculate the physical properties of nanostructures without ever stepping into a lab.\n\nAmong them is Peng Fei Lyu (left), a process engineer who facilitated a special interest group to receive training on the software at Lam China. After learning the software, the team used it to identify the root cause of an issue in a customer\u2019s etch process\u2014cutting a task that would have taken approximately 10 wafers and two weeks in a lab down to about an hour.\n\nAnother member of the group, process engineer Tian Hao Zhang (right), used the software to help a customer determine their ideal etching approach. In doing so, he and his colleagues cut the experimentation time down from 10 weeks to four while using a third of the wafers required for traditional testing. By helping engineers deliver rapid results while reducing material waste and costs, the software is helping Lam build value for our company and customers.\nProducts that support a circular economy\n\nWhen great products go further, we all win. In addition to new systems, CSBG provides refurbished tools, previous generation tools, and equipment upgrades. These options deliver great customer value while avoiding the environmental impacts of manufacturing new tools and sending existing equipment to landfills. Our spares offerings include the reuse of high-value spare parts such as electrostatic chucks, RF hardware, and showerheads through a variety of re-cleaning, repair, refurbishment, and re-coating services. Learn more about our spares offerings.\n\nHOW OUR CSBG OFFERINGS MAKE A DIFFERENCE:\n\n- **~$400M** worth of annual materials savings enabled by re-cleaning services\n- **~$150M** worth of annual materials savings enabled by repair & refurbishment services\n- **20%** of Etch installations used upgrades or tools with refurbished components in 2022\n- **33%** of electrostatic chucks (ESCs) shipped in 2022 were refurbished, representing a 70%+ increase since 2019\n- **~8kg** aluminum reused in each refurbished ESC baseplate, representing 30 metric tons (MT) reused in 2022\n- **~5kg** hazardous residue avoided by each refurbished ESC baseplate, representing 18 MT avoided in 2022\n\nDelivering safe, high-quality products\n\nOur cross-functional Quality Leadership team oversees our design teams to ensure the safety and quality of every product they create.

These values shape our approach to reducing Lam\u2019s environmental impact, and executing on our commitment to operating responsibly and improving our sustainability performance over time.\n\nPositive change requires action, so we are pursuing global initiatives to reduce our energy and water consumption and minimize waste. By 2050, we aim to achieve net zero emissions. It\u2019s a bold ambition, and Lam was among the first in the semiconductor industry to establish such a goal. Our net zero roadmap outlines our path to achieving climate progress. It informs the way we create products, upgrade our facilities, and allocate our resources and time.\n\nIn 2022, our employees mobilized to move our climate and environmental initiatives forward. They completed solar and energy-efficiency projects and exceeded our water-savings goal. Lam closed the year by joining the Semiconductor Climate Consortium as a founding member, demonstrating our company\u2019s climate leadership on a global scale. As the work continues, we\u2019re energized by how far we\u2019ve come and our vision for a greener future ahead.\n\n### Sustainable operations\n\n| GOAL | STATUS | 2022 PROGRESS |\n|------|--------|---------------|\n| Achieve net zero emissions by 2050 by meeting the following targets: | | |\n| \u2022 Achieve 100% renewable electricity by 2030 | | |\n| \u2022 Sourced 44% renewable electricity globally in 2022 | | |\n| \u2022 Reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) GHG emissions 25% by 2025 and 60.6% by 2030 from a 2019 baseline.

Lam updated this goal in 2022 per the SBTi verification and approval process.\n3 Previously, the 2030 goal targeted a 46% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) GHG emissions. Due to a previously unidentified source of Scope 1 emissions, Lam worked with SBTi to update our 2019 emissions inventory and restate our 2030 goal.\n4 Primarily due to the increase in usage of a specific chemical in our testing process between 2019 and 2022.\n5 The 2030 goal was validated in 2022 and was subsequently restated in 2023 in alignment with SBTi. Note: Sustainable Operations data is comprehensive of all Lam-owned and leased facilities, including our subsidiary Silvex, Energy, waste, and water data is not currently included for Avonisys, Coventor, Metryx, SemSysco, Solmates, or Talus. Greenhouse gas emissions for these entities is included in our reported Scope 1 and 2 emissions (Talus, Metryx, and Coventor), or within our Scope 3 investment data (Avonisys, Solmates, SemSysco).\nAdvancing our net zero roadmap\n\nWhile net zero emissions is our long-term vision, our success starts with the action we take today. Our net zero roadmap outlines our strategy to achieve time-based targets that keep us accountable and on track. Lam\u2019s Net Zero Leadership team drives these efforts with ultimate oversight from our Board.\n\nExternally, we engage our customers and suppliers to support them in setting and achieving science-based targets (SBTs). We strive to lead by example, and in 2022 we achieved SBTi validation for our near-term GHG-reduction goals. These goals are in line with limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C, representing the most ambitious SBTi designation available. We recently discovered a source of Scope 1 emissions which caused a significant increase of our previously reported Scope 1 emissions, dating back to our 2019 baseline year. This led us to work with SBTi to restate our 2030 goal by targeting a 60.6% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions, instead of the prior target of a 46% reduction. We are acting with expediency with a goal to eliminate this emissions source completely.\n\nBy identifying risks related to climate change, we can take meaningful steps to make our company more resilient. Learn more about our 2021 climate change risk analysis assessment and how our practices align with frameworks, such as the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\n\nNet zero roadmap\n\n- **2021**\n  - Announced SBTi intention and net zero pathway\n\n- **2022**\n  - Achieved SBTi approval for three near-term emissions-reduction targets\n\n- **2025**\n  - Reduce Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) GHG emissions by 25% from a 2019 baseline\n  - Achieve 12M kWh in total energy savings\n  - 46.5% of suppliers and 83% of customers measured by emissions will set SBTs\n\n- **2030**\n  - Reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 60.6% from a 2019 baseline\n  - Achieve 100% renewable electricity\n  - 95% of top direct suppliers measured by spend will set SBTs\n\n- **2040**\n  - Achieve net zero operations (Scope 1 and 2)\n  - Achieve absolute reduction in supply chain emissions (goal to be set)\n\n- **2050**\n  - Achieve net zero emissions\n\n---\n\n1 Previously, the 2030 goal targeted a 46% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) GHG emissions. Lam updated this goal in 2023 following a restatement of our baseline in alignment with SBTi.\nDriving reductions in each scope\n\nEach part of Lam\u2019s value chain presents unique emissions-reduction challenges and opportunities. For instance, while we have the most control over reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, they account for only about 8% of our combined 2022 Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions. To achieve net zero emissions, we must take a value-chain-wide approach, with a focus on operational efficiency and supplier, employee, and customer engagement. More details on our emissions management can be found in our annual CDP Climate Change questionnaire submission.\n\nBreaking down our 2022 value chain emissions\n\n| Scope | GHG emissions | Emissions details | How we\u2019re driving reductions |\n|-------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Upstream activities | 2,034,127 metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO\u2082e) | \u2022 Purchased goods & services: 1,764,704 MTCO\u2082e  \n\u2022 Capital goods: 5,759 MTCO\u2082e  \n\u2022 Fuel- and energy-related activities: 52,793 MTCO\u2082e  \n\u2022 Upstream transportation & distribution: 173,093 MTCO\u2082e  \n\u2022 Waste generated in operations: 8,556 MTCO\u2082e  \n\u2022 Business travel: 10,731 MTCO\u2082e  \n\u2022 Employee commuting: 18,491 MTCO\u2082e  \n\u2022 Upstream leased assets: N/A | Engaging suppliers to set SBTs and providing support and resources to help them build carbon measurement and reduction capabilities and purchasing offsets for portions of our business travel |\n| Lam facilities & operations | 63,300 MTCO\u2082e | \u2022 U.S.:  \n\u2022 Fremont, CA: 23,227 MTCO\u2082e  \n\u2022 Livermore, CA: 2,382 MTCO\u2082e  \n\u2022 Tualatin, OR: 8,876 MTCO\u2082e  \n\u2022 Ohio: N/A  \n\u2022 Austria: 1,195 MTCO\u2082e  \n\u2022 South Korea: 16,078 MTCO\u2082e  \n\u2022 Malaysia: N/A  \n\u2022 Taiwan: 4,439 MTCO\u2082e  \n\u2022 India: N/A  \n\u2022 Leased (All): 7,103 MTCO\u2082e | Maximizing energy efficiency, purchasing RECs, and investing in large-scale projects to transition to renewable electricity |\n| Scope 1, direct | ~433K MTCO\u2082e | \u2022 Hydrofluorocarbons: 3,673 MTCO\u2082e  \n\u2022 Perfluorocarbons: 5,321 MTCO\u2082e  \n\u2022 Other fluorinated: 13,591 MTCO\u2082e  \n\u2022 Non-fluorinated: 506 MTCO\u2082e  \n\u2022 Other refrigerants: 385,764 MTCO\u2082e  \n\u2022 Diesel: 63 MTCO\u2082e  \n\u2022 Natural gas: 19,468 MTCO\u2082e  \n\u2022 Liquid petroleum gas: 4,587 MTCO\u2082e  \n\u2022 Owned vehicles: 25 MTCO\u2082e | Optimizing our processes and products, investing in emissions controls and energy-efficiency technologies, updating manufacturing and lab processes, and evaluating lower global warming potential process gas alternatives |\n| Scope 2, market-based indirect | 607,555 MTCO\u2082e | \u2022 Downstream transportation & distribution: 607,555 MTCO\u2082e  \n\u2022 Processing of sold products: N/A  \n\u2022 Use of sold products: 3,704,749 MTCO\u2082e  \n\u2022 End-of-life treatment of sold products: 2,546 MTCO\u2082e  \n\u2022 Downstream leased assets: N/A  \n\u2022 Franchises: N/A  \n\u2022 Investments: 418,167 MTCO\u2082e | Developing efficient products and processes, establishing a baseline for product-based energy consumption and emissions, and engaging customers to set SBTs |\n| Scope 3, indirect | 4,733,017 MTCO\u2082e | \u2022 Investments: 418,167 MTCO\u2082e | |\nScope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by year\n\nFrom 2019 to 2022, our overall Scope 1 and 2 emissions increased by 207% from our updated 2019 baseline. The baseline values and subsequent year emissions growth is primarily due to a previously unknown source of Scope 1 emissions. In addition, we found that we had not accounted for the partial abatement of certain process gas emissions at our Fremont, California, lab facility. We revised the historical data on this page to reflect these changes. In addition, we limited our Scope 3 emissions increase to a modest 1% despite seeing nearly 18% in revenue growth.\n\nProcess chemistry emissions by type\n\n2022 GHG EMISSIONS HIGHLIGHTS\n\n496,298 combined MTCO\u2082e Scope 1 & 2 (market-based) GHG emissions\n\n92% of Lam\u2019s GHG footprint made up of Scope 3 emissions\n\n23% reduction in Scope 2 (market-based) GHG emissions from 2019 baseline\n\n1% increase in Scope 3 GHG emissions from 2021\n\nFrom 2019 to 2022, our overall Scope 1 and 2 emissions increased by 207% from our updated 2019 baseline.

In addition, we limited our Scope 3 emissions increase to a modest 1% despite seeing nearly 18% in revenue growth.\nDecarbonizing our industry together\n\nLam has long been active in SEMI, the global industry association representing the electronics manufacturing and design supply chain. In 2022, we joined SEMI\u2019s Semiconductor Climate Consortium as a founding member. The consortium is the first global, ecosystem-wide collaborative of semiconductor companies dedicated to reducing industry-based emissions. Through collaboration, transparency, and ambitious goal setting, we aim to advance our industry\u2019s response to climate change\u2014one of the most pressing challenges of our time.\n\nAs a participant, Lam has the opportunity to:\n\n- Shape industry standards on sustainability\n- Share knowledge and best practices, and collectively solve the industry\u2019s big challenges\n- Leverage industry-level collaborations to accelerate our own climate progress\n\n\u201cLam is committed to proactive climate action. We share the Semiconductor Climate Consortium\u2019s vision to drive progress on climate challenges within our industry. By collaborating with fellow members, we hope to accelerate solutions with greater speed and scale than can be achieved alone.\u201d\n\nShawn Covell\nmanaging director, global ESG strategy at Lam\nOptimizing energy\n\nWe can\u2019t power semiconductor breakthroughs without consuming energy\u2014and our energy needs increase as our operations expand. Our goal is to adopt solutions that decouple Lam\u2019s growth from increased energy use and emissions. To do so, we\u2019re transitioning toward renewable electricity and optimizing our facilities and processes to be more energy efficient. Currently, our renewables are sourced from a mix of onsite solar and renewable energy credits.\n\nPursuing 100% renewable electricity\n\nOur Villach, Austria, plant uses 100% renewable electricity through a combination of onsite solar and purchased electricity. In 2022, we completed a solar expansion project to achieve additional energy generation at the site, which now generates approximately 3.6 megawatt-hours (MWh) per day. We project that the site will eventually generate 8 MWh per day following further expansion work planned for 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, at our facility in Malaysia, which we opened in August 2020, we completed a two-part solar project. Lam\u2019s Global Workplace Solutions (GWS) team expedited phase two of the solar project, completing the installation of 1,076 solar panels in December 2022.\n\nOur Malaysia facility\u2019s new solar panels cover the majority of the roof\u2019s 800,000-square-foot rooftop and generate 13 MWh per day. They supply 20% of the site\u2019s electricity requirement.\nUsing an innovative mindset to increase global energy savings\n\nIn our everyday lives, many of us adopt energy-conscious behaviors\u2014from turning the thermostat down during cold-weather months to turning the lights off when we leave a room. At Lam, we take a similar approach to drive energy-efficiency improvements. When implemented at our facilities, these upgrades can lead to large-scale savings in energy, emissions, and costs.\n\nRecently, we turned our attention to Lam\u2019s new manufacturing site in Malaysia, a state-of-the-art facility designed with efficiency in mind. Lam\u2019s outlook: Why stop there when we can make it even better? We challenged the site\u2019s employees to push efficiency further. In response they embarked on a series of building improvements, including:\n\n- Reducing lighting during off hours\n- Reducing cooling in the office\n- Exploring the potential to reduce cleanroom humidity in the future\n\nSome solutions turned out to be simple but required critical thinking. For example, by reducing pressure in the facility\u2019s clean room, they enabled the fans to slow down\u2014achieving energy savings while keeping the space contaminant free.\n\nOur teams also drove improvements at sites in the U.S., completing lighting upgrades in Livermore, California; commissioning a scrubber to reduce fan speed in Fremont, California; and installing a variable frequency drive (VFD) air compressor and chiller in Tualatin, Oregon. Installing a VFD chiller resulted in immediate energy savings. Additionally, by monitoring the chiller\u2019s operation and adjusting its controls, the Tualatin facilities team nearly doubled the energy savings achieved from installing the equipment itself. For 2023, we have enrolled in energy-efficiency programs sponsored by the local utilities in Oregon and California to identify and implement low- or no-cost improvements.\n\nImproving seed lift\n\nAt our facility in Springfield, Ohio, we grow silicon ingots\u2014large crystals that are sliced into wafers. Getting the seed of the ingot to lift into a defect-free crystal is a highly technical and energy-intensive process. In 2021, we implemented process improvements that reduced the number of attempts to achieve each high-quality crystal. We conducted a follow-up seed lift project in 2022, which enabled improved mixing and energy efficiency, and therefore increased energy savings and yield. Outcomes included:\n\n- Nearly 50% increase in the speed at which crystals are pulled\n- 13.7% increase in energy savings per wafer millimeter\nAccelerating water savings\n\nWater is a key component in semiconductor manufacturing, making it critical to our company, suppliers, and customers. At Lam, we rely on freshwater to operate our chillers, house scrubbers, process cooling water systems, and soft water treatment plants. It\u2019s a precious resource that we share with our communities.\n\nIn water-stressed regions, we know it is imperative to manage water as responsibly and sustainably as we can. In 2022, we exceeded our goal to achieve 17 million gallons of water savings in water-stressed regions from a 2019 baseline by 2025. As part of setting this goal, we used the World Resource Institute Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas to identify which of our facilities were in water-stressed regions. To date, we have identified six sites throughout California, South Korea, India, and Malaysia. However, regions identified as water-stressed shift over time, so we will continue to periodically review and update this list.\n\nIn these and other areas, our GWS team explores and invests in water-saving technologies and efficiency upgrades. We monitor industrial wastewater and stormwater discharges in accordance with local regulatory requirements, and often find ways to repurpose process-based wastewater to support other areas of our operations. To build on our success in achieving our initial water-savings goal, we are updating our 2025 goal to 80 million gallons of water savings from a 2019 baseline.\n\nPURSUING\u2014AND EXCEEDING\u2014OUR WATER-SAVINGS GOAL\n\n- Added eight water recovery units to our abatement systems in California.\n- Operationalized reuse and recovery systems and additional water recovery units at our sites in Malaysia; South Korea; and Fremont, California. These projects led us to drive widespread water savings and exceed our 2025 water-savings goal.\n- Added another seven water recovery units in California.\n- Updated our 2025 goal to achieve 80 million gallons of water savings.\n\nLearn more about our approach to responsible water management on our website and in our annual Water Security submission to CDP.\n\n2022 Water usage in water-stressed regions\n\n| Region     | Million Gallons | % of Total Usage |\n|------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| Fremont    | 118.6           | 29.79%           |\n| Malaysia   | 25.9            | 6.49%            |\n| South Korea| 16.9            | 4.24%            |\n| Livermore  | 10.8            | 2.72%            |\n| India      | 0.3             | 0.08%            |\n| Total      | 172.5           | 43.33%           |\n\n1Water-stressed regions as identified through the World Resources Institute (WRI) Water Risk Atlas.\nMaximizing value by minimizing waste\n\nTo ensure a sustainable future, we need to reduce waste. Whether it\u2019s operating more efficiently or embracing circularity, we\u2019re committed to doing our part.\n\nLam generates both non-hazardous and hazardous waste as we research, develop, and manufacture our products. We actively monitor this waste and manage it in accordance with industry best practices, and our ISO 14001 multi-site certification drives us to reduce our environmental impact by using materials as efficiently as we can.\n\nEmbracing circularity to reduce non-hazardous waste\n\nMost of the waste we generate consists of non-hazardous materials, such as wood pallets, cardboard and packaging, and municipal waste. To reduce these streams, we employ circular practices, such as waste reduction, recovery, recycling, and reuse.\n\nIn 2022, our teams identified strategies to better manage and reduce non-hazardous waste. They partnered with a third party to conduct reporting and internal audits, which resulted in key recommendations for efficient waste management practices. We are now engaging employees to implement these practices globally, while exploring an additional third-party partnership to examine our practices related to receptacles, signage, composting, compacting, and more. Lam has also joined SEMI\u2019s Circularity working group to share best practices and collaborate to advance further industry innovations.\n\nNon-hazardous waste generation and recycling\n\nNon-hazardous waste recycling by material\n\n2022 NON-HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT HIGHLIGHTS\n\n9,261 MT of non-hazardous waste generated\n\n77% recycling rate\nOur commitment to strong environmental management\n\nLam holds ISO 14001 multi-site certification for environmental management, which covers our Fremont and Livermore, California; Tualatin, Oregon; and Villach, Austria; sites, and individual site certification for Osan, Korea and Eaton, Ohio. As an engaged member of the RBA, we also complete voluntary assessments across our manufacturing sites.\n\nIn 2022, our sites\u2019 self-assessment questionnaires (SAQ), which cover environmental and social topics, low-risk scores. We also earned Silver recognition for our first RBA-validated audit at our Livermore, California, site.\n\nReduce. Reuse. Rethink.\n\nSometimes it pays to challenge the status quo and test new ways to optimize existing processes. That was true for a manufacturing process where we shipped unused parts back to the warehouse to be returned to stock.\n\nIn the past, our material handlers shipped each part in individual boxes, which were discarded once the parts were re-stocked and stored in bulk. Then, Willis Wah, who joined Lam from a global shipping company, put his expertise to work to streamline the process and reduce packaging waste.\n\nAs the manager of logistics for Lam\u2019s Fremont, California, campus, Willis worked with the Warehouse team to consolidate and ship the parts in reusable totes. Within the first month of implementation, the new process helped Lam avoid using approximately 275 boxes. It also led to reduced labor hours and transportation costs, and made stress injuries less frequent among material handlers.\nResponsible hazardous waste management\n\nOur manufacturing processes and research & development (R&D) operations use chemicals that produce hazardous waste, such as lab debris and waste that is corrosive or flammable. We follow strict controls to responsibly handle each of these streams and aim to divert hazardous waste from landfills by finding alternative methods of disposal. As part of our commitment to environmental stewardship and due diligence, we conduct a periodic risk assessment of our hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDF). Lam partners with CHWMEG\u2014a nonprofit trade association whose members strive to efficiently steward waste\u2014to perform comprehensive TSDF audits, the results of which we integrate into our risk assessment process.\n\nProactive chemicals management\n\nChemicals enable us to manufacture leading-edge products, and they\u2019re essential to R&D. Our site Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) and Product groups work together to ensure our employees handle these materials with caution and care. This begins even before chemicals arrive at Lam\u2019s sites, as we use a chemical information management system to track and monitor our chemical inventories and approve site-based chemical requests. Once onsite, our teams focus on proper transportation, storage, and inventory management to track where and how chemicals are used and manage potential risks.\n\nIn 2022, we continued to drive consistency among all Lam sites and integrate a chemical information management system as part of the overall chemical management process at the new sites in South Korea, Malaysia, and India. In 2023, we plan to improve our purchasing systems to allow easier and more automated environmental reporting.\n\nLearn more about our hazardous waste disposal methods\n\n99.99% hazardous waste diverted from landfills in 2022\nEmbracing green chemistry practices\nWe use our expertise to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of various chemicals in terms of their effectiveness, availability, and impact on the environment. As global chemical regulations become more complex, we are proactively working with our supply chain partners, chemical suppliers, and chemicals management systems to ensure Lam\u2019s ongoing compliance and to adopt emerging green chemistry practices.\n\nWe work with our engineers and designers to make decisions with the planet in mind. In 2022, we created a tool that engineers can use to assess the GHG emissions intensity of various recipes that are used to process the wafers. We plan to expand on this project in 2023 and share the insights we\u2019ve gained across our organization.\n\nManaging air pollution\nClean air is essential for human and environmental health, and we are committed to doing our part to reduce air pollution. As we work to reduce emissions, our teams have pilot programs in place to further integrate Lam\u2019s tools with our customers\u2019 chemical systems. This allows us to minimize chemical waste and maximize abatement system efficiency. Sometimes we do this by using external abatement systems. In other cases, we focus on selecting processes that minimize the use of high global warming potential chemicals and thereby reduce emissions.\n\nEngaging employees in environmental action\nFor many of Lam\u2019s passionate employees, internal sustainability is just the start. We\u2019re proud to see our employees get involved with their local communities to plant trees, protect biodiversity, and advocate for environmental health. A key pathway for employee-led sustainability action is Lam\u2019s Employee Sustainability Community (LESC). This employee resource group (ERG) includes more than 450 global members working to support sustainable change.\n\nIn 2022, LESC facilitated many volunteer and learning opportunities, including inviting Stacey MacNeil, Lam\u2019s chief communications officer, to discuss our company\u2019s net zero roadmap. LESC members in Malaysia planted trees to mark 50 years of industrialization in the country, and, in India, LESC hosted a Best out of Waste competition to showcase employees\u2019 commitment to recycling and reuse.\n\nBecause of these efforts, LESC received Lam\u2019s 2022 Environmental Stewardship Award, which highlights employees\u2019 environmental efforts, both at Lam and in our communities. Sponsored by EHS, the Environmental Stewardship Awards are part of a larger campaign for Earth Month, which, this year, included events around the globe. Many more environmental activities took place throughout the year, as employees acted with purpose for a better, greener world.\n\n\u201cLESC Malaysia formed after learning about the company\u2019s net zero ambition and roadmap. We\u2019re a passionate group of individuals working to spread awareness and directly support Lam's ESG goals. We strive to leverage our Core Values, cross-functional collaboration, and continuous improvement to make a positive impact on the planet.\u201d\n\nEC Pon\nLESC Malaysia co-leader at Lam\nOur workplace\n\nIN THIS SECTION:\n\n41 Highlights\n42 Engaging and developing our people\n46 Shaping an inclusive culture\n53 Keeping our employees safe\nWe're engaging employees to shape a culture rooted in our Core Values.\n\nHow do we solve the unsolvable? By bringing together the brightest minds and empowering them to reach new heights. Our workplace programs are designed to facilitate collaboration, enhance safety, spur innovation, and accelerate employee growth. We strive to offer inclusive development opportunities and benefits that meet our employees\u2019 holistic needs. This supports our goal to build on our high-performance culture with best-in-class employee engagement. It also bolsters our work to create a more diverse and inclusive workplace\u2014work that begins by expanding our talent pipeline and collaborating with industry and community partners to create more opportunities for women and underrepresented students and professionals in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).\n\nIn 2022, we opened the doors of our new India Center for Engineering and our Korea Technology Center. As we expanded Lam\u2019s operations, our Core Values and Purpose kept our global workforce united and aligned. With a focus on engagement, we increased employee outreach and grew our employee resource groups (ERGs). We also rolled out new manager resources and cutting-edge benefits that further empower our employees to lead and thrive.\n\n### Workplace\n\n| GOAL                                                                 | STATUS | 2022 PROGRESS                                                                 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Build on our high-performance culture with global employee engagement at the global benchmark, as measured by our annual employee surveys |        | \u2022 Ended the year with an engagement score of 78, one point below the global top tier benchmark of 79 |\n| Maintain an OSHA recordable injury rate at or below 0.4 annually    |        | \u2022 Realized recordable injury rate of 0.35                                    |\n| Increase the proportion of women (globally) and underrepresented employees (U.S.) across the company |        | \u2022 Increased the proportion of women in our global workforce by 3.0% and underrepresented employees in the U.S. by 5.0% over 2021 |\n\n1 Unless stated otherwise, we aim to complete each of our ESG goals by 2025.\n\n### 2022 HIGHLIGHTS\n\n- Matured our engagement process with new data inputs and a pulse survey\n- Implemented a new Student Loan Assistance program in the U.S.\n- Jumped 68 places to #219 on Forbes\u2019 list of the World\u2019s Top Female-Friendly Companies\n- Expanded our enhanced paid parental leave and paid bonding leave policies to our employees across the globe\n\n### RELEVANT SDGs\n\n- View SDG alignment\nEngaging and developing our people\n\nLam has a legacy of strong employee engagement and development, and those priorities came to the forefront in 2022.

These efforts helped us land at #555 on Forbes\u2019 list of the World\u2019s Best Employers and #29 among the best employers recognized in the U.S.\n\nTurning our employees\u2019 insights into action\n\nThere\u2019s power in really listening, and we trust our employees to know what they need to succeed. We regularly engage employees to find out what\u2019s working and how we can better meet their evolving needs. The key is to turn those insights into action\u2014in the form of innovative development opportunities, benefits programs, and more. That\u2019s how we deliver a positive employee experience that supports recruitment, retention, and professional growth.\n\nOur engagement strategy:\n\n- **Listen** through annual, pulse, and lifecycle surveys; one-on-one meetings with managers; discussions with Lam\u2019s leaders, and team meetings.\n- **Learn** through sophisticated data collection that captures and cross-references key employee insights.\n- **Improve** our workplace programs and practices by sharing key insights with teams who have the power to act.\n\nIn 2022, we matured our engagement processes to improve data collection and analysis and make survey insights more accessible and actionable across Lam\u2019s teams. We conducted our annual survey in June, with seven new data inputs to measure key engagement correlations. We also added two new data outputs to enable cross-program analysis and shared the results with six internal teams.\n\nAfter the survey, we leveraged online learning and a new Experience Progress Roadmap to drive employee feedback and conversations. Another feature was a short pulse survey administered in October to continue engaging with employees on key topics.\nMAKING THE MOST OF OUR EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT SURVEYS\n\nSurvey design\n\nOur annual engagement survey in June included 17 questions across 5 categories.\n\nWe added 5 new questions to reflect core engagement drivers:\n\n- Cared for at work\n- Ethical behavior\n- Company values\n- Continuous improvement\n- Manager support\n\nAnd followed up with a 3-question pulse survey in October.\n\nScores\n\n78 employee engagement score\nFalling one point below the global top-tier benchmark\n\n84% response rate\nOne percentage point below the global top-tier benchmark\n\n75 2022 Inclusion Index\nRepresents the combined scores of three questions driving inclusion, authenticity, and equal opportunity\n\nInsights & actions\n\nBased on our top 3 survey insights, employees say they:\n\n- Feel supported by their managers and cared for at work\n- Believe Lam has a strong culture of ethics and recognition\n- Desire varied and timely communication\n\nEmployees\u2019 feedback indicates a high rate of satisfaction with areas including:\n\n- Recognition\n- Manager support\n- Feeling cared for at work\n- Career path opportunities\n\nWe responded to survey insights with 3 key actions:\n\n- Enhanced inclusion and diversity training with new INCLUDE manager training\n- Launched culture workshops for new employees\n- Guided managers to prioritize teamwide communication\n\nSupporting a sense of connection\n\nSince 2020, many new employees have worked with their teams remotely. To help them build a strong sense of connection, Lam\u2019s global Human Resources team launched new culture workshops for these employees in 2022. During 90-minute sessions, Lam\u2019s senior leaders demonstrated how we put our Core Values into action. In total, they engaged more than 2,700 employees during 37 global sessions delivered in each region\u2019s local language.\n\nAdditionally, we facilitated virtual executive employee engagement sessions for those hired within the past six to nine months, in which employees shared their experiences with Lam\u2019s chief human resource officer and CEO. These leaders also hosted roundtables with managers of highly engaged teams, which our sites modeled in various regions. Members of Lam\u2019s Board got involved by engaging with recently hired college graduates to create an opportunity for two-way feedback and insights.\n\n\u201cBeing able to speak directly with Board members helped me connect to our company\u2019s culture and understand that we are all one team working together.\u201d\n\nXiaomin Yun\nproduct engineer 4 at CSBG\nEmbracing workplace flexibility\n\nSeveral years after the emergence of the pandemic, workplace flexibility is here to stay. In 2022, we updated our workplace modalities to include onsite, onsite flex, virtual flex, and remote. Workplace flexibility supports an inclusive culture by enabling employees to work in ways that meet their unique needs. In fact, our virtual-flex employees scored the highest on engagement\u2014exceeding the technology industry benchmark. Employees attributed their positive experiences to Lam\u2019s culture, well-being programs, and strong employee support. We\u2019re proud to see our people thrive in this environment and rolled out additional resources to support them in 2022.\n\nOur return-to-work pilot program provided employees with the following tools:\n\n- Home office stipend to help offset remote work expenses\n- New manager training on \u201cLeading in a Hybrid Environment,\u201d along with guidance on how to host virtual meetings and keep remote participants engaged\n- Internal sites providing information on Lam\u2019s virtual-flex and in-person policies\n\nUp-skilling our teams\n\nFrom the first day employees join us, we put them on a trajectory for long-term growth. We use layered development programs to support Lam\u2019s employees and leaders through experience and education.\n\nTo expand this programming, we launched Supervisor Essentials, a learning program designed specifically for manufacturing supervisors, in 2022. We also continued several ongoing development opportunities, such as BetterUp coaching for new managers, our Targeted Manager Support program, our enterprise-wide mentoring program, and our Leap technical training and certification program for new hires and Lam engineers.\n\nLam earned Training Magazine\u2019s 2022 Training APEX Award, which recognizes organizations that excel in training and human capital development.\nCelebrating and caring for our employees\n\nOur employees are high achievers. We strive to equip them with resources for overall health and well-being, while making them feel appreciated and inspired to keep reaching new heights. Our benefits and recognition programs support these aspirations and reinforce Lam\u2019s Core Values.\n\nRecognizing exceptional performance\n\nAs we mature our engagement processes, we\u2019re delving into the link between engagement and recognition. Recent research indicates that organizations with meaningful recognition programs have a 14% employee engagement, productivity, and performance edge. The data also places leadership support and recognition among the top most effective non-financial factors for retention.1\n\nIn 2022, we continued our Above and Beyond recognition program, in which employees can acknowledge their colleagues\u2019 great work and embodiment of Lam\u2019s Core Values. We also recognized employees\u2019 commitment to enhancing sustainability through our environmental stewardship awards.\n\nFor the second year, we held a Gratitude Summit, in which employees could attend a series of workshops sponsored by Workhuman. We also worked with Workhuman to conduct a cross-program analysis of our employee engagement survey results so we could better understand the intersection of employee recognition and engagement.\n\nIn 2022, Lam earned GOLD Recognition from the American Heart Association for implementing best practices that build a culture of health for our employees.\n\nDelivering inclusive benefits\n\nEmployees can be more present at work when they have a foundation of overall well-being, whether that means taking time off to be with family, getting regular check-ups, or improving financial health. We strive to continuously enhance our benefits to support the needs of Lam\u2019s diverse employee base. Our goal is to deliver resources that support all aspects of our employees\u2019 well-being and health.\n\nOne of our focus areas is increasing family and parental support. In 2021, we enhanced our U.S. parental leave policy to give birth mothers up to six months of paid parental leave. We also began providing 16 weeks of paid bonding leave to all other new parents\u2014regardless of gender. In 2022, we expanded both policies to our employees across the globe.\n\nIn March, we teamed up with Fidelity to launch our new Student Loan Assistance program for eligible U.S. employees. The program offers $400 per month to eligible employees who have a qualified student loan for their own education in an accredited program. Employees can take advantage of the benefits tax-free, with the money transferring directly to their loan provider.\n\nAdditional benefits for 2022 include:\n\n- Elective fertility preservation through Anthem*\n- Standalone ID theft protection through LifeLock*\n- Accident and hospital indemnity coverage through MetLife*\n- Healthcare concierge and advocacy service through Health Advocate*\n- Personal Observance Day*\n- Malaysia Fitness Center\n\n*For U.S. employees only\n\n2022 BENEFITS HIGHLIGHTS\n\n500+ employees benefited from our new Student Loan Assistance program.\n\n100+ health and well-being events, including a global virtual health fair, webinars, challenges, and more.\n\nExplore our employee benefits programs \u2192\nShaping an inclusive culture\n\nIn the dynamic semiconductor industry, our culture keeps us strong and steady. It\u2019s what brings us together\u2014and what sets our business apart. At Lam, we\u2019re building a culture based on our company\u2019s Core Values. We welcome diverse perspectives and strive to create an environment where every employee feels they belong. These values are key to attracting, retaining, and developing highly skilled talent. They fuel innovation, build mutual respect, and enable us to better serve our customers, colleagues, and other stakeholders.\n\nSetting the intention\n\nOur Inclusion and Diversity (I&D) strategy is led by Lam\u2019s global head of inclusion and diversity. It includes three pillars:\n\n- Fostering inclusion\n- Increasing diversity\n- Sharing our progress\n\nLam\u2019s leaders take an intentional and progress-oriented approach to build inclusive behaviors across our organization. We aspire to increase the proportion of underrepresented employees and women in Lam\u2019s workforce. In this regard, skill-building and accountability are key. As Lam\u2019s leaders created their performance and development plans in 2022, we asked them to set a target focused on I&D for the first time.\n\nAdditionally, more than 1,700 global people managers participated in our new INCLUDE training which aims to expand inclusive leadership capabilities, and further embed I&D as a Core Value shaping our culture. We also administered our Hire Like a Champion training for the second year, which supports inclusive hiring practices. The 2022 training included cohorts in the U.S. and Asia, which focused on recruiting high-potential minority and female candidates.\n\nOur commitment to non-discrimination\n\nWe aim to maintain and cultivate a workplace where every person has equal opportunities to thrive. Our Global Employment Practices Statement declares our support of workers\u2019 rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining, to the extent permitted under local laws.\n\nIn line with the highest ethical and legal standards of labor and employment laws in every country where Lam maintains our workforce, we are committed to equal opportunity and non-discrimination in all our employment practices. We prohibit unlawful discrimination, harassment, and retaliation in any aspect of employment, including recruiting, hiring, promotion, and compensation. In 2022, we published a new Human Rights policy to further ensure the protection, safety, and dignity of all Lam employees.\n\nMaking our workplace inclusive for people of all abilities\n\nLam's Employee Relations team works closely with employees who have disabilities to provide workplace accommodations as needed. Together we develop creative and effective solutions, such as job modifications for physical restrictions, sign language interpretation, and schedule accommodations to minimize obstacles or barriers.\nOur 2022 workforce at a glance\n\n**Board gender diversity**\n\n- **Global**\n  - Female: 33.3%\n  - Male: 66.7%\n  - Other: 0.0%\n\n- **U.S.**\n  - Female: 22.3%\n  - Male: 77.3%\n  - Other: 0.4%\n\n**Board ethnic diversity**\n\n| ETHNIC DIVERSITY | FEMALE | MALE |\n|------------------|--------|------|\n| Asian            | 1      | 3    |\n| White            | 2      | 3    |\n\n**Advancing equity at Lam**\n\nAt Lam, we are committed to promoting equity in our workforce. To demonstrate this commitment, we have expanded our Employee Relations function globally, providing managers and employees with a dedicated team to surface and resolve a wide range of workplace issues.\n\nTo ensure accountability, we regularly measure our progress in recruiting, hiring, and retaining a diverse workforce. We also conduct an annual pay equity assessment of our compensation practices and systems to promote fair and equitable compensation in our workforce.\n\nWe also leverage the expertise of a nationally recognized law firm and its data-driven statistical model to objectively analyze our pay practices and identify trends and patterns. We use this information to maintain and improve Lam\u2019s global compensation philosophy and practices.\n\n*Note: Minimal rounding has been applied to these data.*\n2022 Employee demographics\n\nU.S. employees\n\n- White: 49.3%\n- Asian: 7.3%\n- Hispanic or Latinx: 3.1%\n- Chose not to disclose: 0.7%\n- Two or more races: 2.6%\n- Black or African American: 0.5%\n- Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander: 0.5%\n- American Indian or Alaskan Native: 0.5%\n\nU.S. gender and ethnicity\n\n- Male: 53.8%\n- Female: 46.2%\n\nU.S. veteran status\n\n- U.S. veteran: 8.3%\n- Non-U.S. veteran: 91.7%\n\nGlobal employees by generation\n\n- Born 1996 or after: 11.0%\n- Born 1980-1995: 27.1%\n- Born 1965-1979: 53.8%\n- Born 1946-1964: 8.1%\n\nEmployees who disclosed their disability status (global)\n\n- Disclosed disability status: 37.7%\n- Chose not to disclose: 62.3%\n\nNote: Minimal rounding has been applied to these data. Data do not include Talus.\nIncreasing opportunities for diverse talent in STEM\n\nEveryone deserves the chance to succeed. Yet diverse talent remains largely underrepresented in STEM. Too often, students and candidates face institutional, social, and economic barriers that make it difficult to break into these fields and advance. At Lam, we believe it\u2019s time for that to change, so we use our resources, reach, and leadership position to move the needle. We collaborate with universities and academic organizations to provide internships, fund fellowships, and support our recruitment goals, in addition to sponsoring and attending key industry events to amplify and recruit diverse STEM professionals.\n\nOur 2022 activities included attending AfroTech\u2019s annual conference, which brings together Black entrepreneurs and innovators. Internally, our Talent Acquisition team piloted a new centralized talent-sourcing model in the U.S., which emphasizes outreach to diverse candidates and includes a diverse-slate-of-candidates goal. Other ongoing pipeline-building activities include:\n\n**U.S. university collaborations**\n\nIn 2022, we continued our collaboration with the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) for the second year. Lam provided $100,000 to fund 20 scholarships at UNCF schools, including historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs). We also launched new alumni and student recruiting relationships including:\n\n- Georgia Institute of Technology\n- National Society of Black Engineers\n- Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers\n- Spelman College\n\n**U.S. academic internships and fellowships**\n\nLam serves as a key partner for the National Consortium of Graduate Degrees for Minorities in Engineering (GEM), which provides graduate-level fellowships to underrepresented candidates in engineering and science. In 2022, we provided $460,000 to enable 20 GEM fellowships\u2014up from 13 fellowships in 2021. GEM also provides its fellows with exposure to industry internship programs, including our own. We were proud to welcome GEM fellows as part of a highly diverse and talented intern cohort in 2022.\n\n**Global academic scholarship awards**\n\nWhen we see passion and talent, we go all in to help STEM students succeed. In 2022, several of our locations in Asia provided scholarships aimed at increasing I&D in STEM. Lam provided Thesis Award scholarships to three universities in China, as well as scholarships for women in STEM in Taiwan.\n\nLearn more about the transformative learning initiatives launched through our new social impact program. \u2192\n\n---\n\n**2022 WORKFORCE DIVERSITY HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n- **3.0%** increase in proportion of female employees in Lam\u2019s global workforce from 2021\n- **5.0%** increase in proportion of underrepresented employees in Lam\u2019s U.S. workforce from 2021\n- **20** fellowships funded through our collaboration with GEM\n- **59%** diversity for global intern class\n- **11** hires through partnership with National Society of Black Engineers\n\nLearn more about our university partnerships and programs \u2192\nSupporting women in our industry and workforce\n\nDespite some improvement, women remain largely underrepresented in global STEM careers. We are committed to shifting this gender imbalance\u2014especially in the semiconductor industry\u2014and we know progress must start from within. One of our workplace goals is to increase the proportion of women throughout our company by 2025. To drive progress, we strive to amplify the voice of our industry\u2019s women leaders while creating a workplace environment where women can excel and advance.\n\nIn 2022, we updated our internal hiring practices to strive to include a female employee on every interview panel. Compared to 2021, we increased the proportion of women at our company by 3.0%. We supported female STEM leaders through company webinars, industry conferences, and global ERGs. One highlight was attending our first in-person Grace Hopper Celebration\u2014the premier U.S. conference for women in tech. During the conference, three of Lam\u2019s female leaders hosted an inclusion-focused career development workshop. Themed \u201cBreaking Barriers Through Innovation,\u201d the breakout session engaged more than 200 participants.\n\nLam also sponsored the 2022 Diversity in Tech Symposium, themed \u201cAdvancing Climate Resilience.\u201d The symposium was hosted by the University of California\u2019s EDGE in Tech Initiative, which is committed to addressing challenges faced by women and other under-included identities in engineering and computer science. Also in California, Lam attended the Women in Semiconductor Hardware conference. We were a finalist for the Designing the Difference award, which recognizes companies that are making a significant and measurable impact on advancing the industry through I&D.\n\nAt Lam\u2019s new site in Malaysia, our manufacturing leadership team boasts 50% female representation.\n\nThe Lam India Women\u2019s Network (LIWN) was our first ERG launched in India. LIWN brings female employees together to focus on personal and professional development, networking and collaboration, and business impact. During 2022, LIWN hosted a financial awareness session, career-mapping and Gallup Strengths profiling workshops, and many other events.\n\n---\n\n1Catalyst, \u201cWomen in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).\u201d [https://www.catalyst.org/research/women-in-science-technology-engineering-and-mathematics-stem/#:~:text=Women%20with%20bachelor%20degrees%20and%20women%20overall%20underrepresentation%20in%20STEM](https://www.catalyst.org/research/women-in-science-technology-engineering-and-mathematics-stem/#:~:text=Women%20with%20bachelor%20degrees%20and%20women%20overall%20underrepresentation%20in%20STEM)\nConnecting employees through ERGs\n\nLam\u2019s ERGs create a welcoming space where employees empower each other to learn, develop, advocate, and lead. Under our model, each ERG develops its own charter, initiatives, and goals, which support ESG progress, mentorship, inclusion, community outreach, and employee engagement.\n\nMembers of our CEO staff engage closely with ERGs and serve as executive sponsors for each group. The support goes two ways, with sponsors often seeking feedback on emerging and ongoing company initiatives. In 2022, our leaders held roundtables with global ERGs, including a U.S. roundtable where over 80 participants joined Lam\u2019s CEO. Globally, we continued to grow our ERG network, achieving above-average Fortune 500 participation. Our global ERGs include:\n\n- Black Employee Network\n- Community of Latinos and African Americans for Student Success and Outreach\n- Lam Employee Sustainability Community*\n- Lam India Women\u2019s Network\n- Lam\u2019s Veteran Community\n- New Professionals Network\n- PRIDE LGBTQ+ Allies\n- Women in Customer Support Business Group (CSBG)\n- Women in Engineering\n- Women@Fremont\n- Women in Global Operations (WGOP) U.S. Korea, and Malaysia\n- Women in Leadership at Lam\n- Women of Southeast Asia\n- Women in Taiwan\n- Women in Taiwan\nERG FAST FACTS\n\nWe now have 15 ERGs in 6 countries with 3,500+ members.\u00b9\n\nERGs hosted 60+ events in 2022.\n\nWe began promoting ERGs through our onboarding materials to help employees get involved right away.\n\nLearn more about one of our newest ERGs, LESC \u2192\n\nCultivating inclusion year-round\n\nCreating an inclusive culture is a year-round commitment. It\u2019s part of how we show up at work each day. We also take time to highlight important moments throughout the year that honor, celebrate, or affect diverse employee groups. Examples from 2022 included:\n\n- Black History Month: honored with a letter to employees from Vince Brigman, Lam\u2019s corporate vice president of global finance and corporate functions operations, who also sponsors two ERGs\n- International Women\u2019s Day: celebrated with a \u201cBreak the Bias\u201d webinar and campaign promoted by our LIWN ERG\n- Earth Month: included activities hosted by our global chapters of LESC and the local green teams\n- PRIDE: celebrated by Lam\u2019s Pride ERG, which hit a new milestone by growing to 200 members\n- Global Diversity Awareness Month: featured several activities, including a keynote on \u201cReimagining Global Inclusion,\u201d an interactive theatrical activity, and interactive conversations on \u201cLeading from the Top\u201d\n\n\u201cWomen should not have to settle based on limitations and boundaries. At Lam, we\u2019re asking what can be done to remove those barriers, instead. Our Women in Global Operations ERG helps members address potential barriers by growing their network, finding mentorship and guidance, and building long-term careers at Lam.\u201d\n\nSoon Kuek\nmanaging director and general manager,\nLam Malaysia manufacturing\n\n\u00b9Employees may belong to multiple ERGs as we encourage allyship and cross-cultural engagement.\nKeeping our employees safe\n\nEnsuring employees\u2019 safety is fundamental to creating a positive work experience\u2014whether it be in an office, manufacturing plant, or lab. We follow strict safety protocols and prioritize training and risk controls to help employees safely perform their tasks.\u00b9\n\nOur global EHS policy applies to every employee and outlines our commitment to protecting all Lam personnel and minimizing risk.\n\nWe also maintain a single site certification at our Fremont, California, headquarters for ISO 45001, the globally recognized standard for occupational health and safety management systems.\n\nIn 2022, our Tualatin, Oregon, site achieved Voluntary Protection Program Star Status, the highest health and safety award bestowed by OSHA\u2019s U.S. and Oregon divisions. The award recognizes Lam\u2019s low illness and injury rates and our commitment to a culture of safety\u2014setting us on a bold trajectory for continuous improvement and accountability for our safety performance. Overall, we conducted more than 264,000 Risk Management by Walking Around inspections, a process used to identify and track safety issues and implement corrective actions.\n\nAt Lam Korea, we apply a \u2018planning, execution, validation, and problem-solving\u2019 cycle, based on the safety and health management practices put forth by ISO 45001. We strive to monitor and address risks that can lead to safety and health issues while building a safety culture for all employees.\u201d\n\nAndy Yeo\nEHS specialist at Lam Korea\n\n\u00b9Data are inclusive of Lam Research and Silfex.\nWorking toward our safety goal\n\nOne of our ESG goals is to achieve an OSHA recordable injury rate at or below 0.4. In 2022, we achieved a rate of 0.35. Lam\u2019s growth in 2022 posed additional safety challenges, as we increased the number of temporary employees working in our operations. To offset this challenge, we invested in prevention-based education, training, awareness, and emergency preparedness programs.\n\nExamples of these investments include our general health and safety training, physical training program, and ergonomic assessments. We also continued our Safety Awareness for Everyone (SAFE) program, which we use to update employees on emerging safety issues. We employ SAFE to prevent future issues by including lessons and stories based on incidents from the past.\n\nRecordable injury rate (Lam vs. industry)\n\nInnovation spotlight: Enabling a safe, smooth shift to next-generation product design\n\nTypically, engineers design products using 3D models, then deliver manufacturing information in 2D drawings. At Lam, we\u2019re moving to a new model-based definition (MBD) format, in which engineers embed all product data\u2014including assembly-level bills of materials (BOMs)\u2014directly in their 3D models.\n\nUsing MBD reduces design time and creates a single resource for Lam\u2019s engineers, manufacturers, suppliers, and customers. However, there are challenges in making the transition. For example, to create a 3D spare-parts identifier, which field technicians and customers use to service tools and replace parts, engineers must manually copy part numbers from a BOM and paste them into a computer-aided design model for verification.\n\nRamanathan Kannappan, a Bangalore-based senior designer at Lam, identified several issues with this process. Copying the wrong part number or overwriting data can lead field technicians and customers to order the wrong part, and engineers risk repetitive strain injuries by completing the same task hundreds of times.\n\nAs a solution, Ramanathan created a macro for the BOM that identifies duplicate parts, prevents data overrides, and improves project communication. Since implementing the macro, engineers have nearly eliminated data errors and cut project-ownership times by up to 50%.\nResponsible supply chain\n\nIN THIS SECTION:\n\n56  Highlights\n57  Our strategy for mutual success\n60  Advancing climate action together\n61  Upholding human rights\n61  Ensuring responsible sourcing of minerals\n61  Cultivating a diverse supply chain\n62  Collaborating toward ESG progress\nWe collaborate with suppliers to grow and scale for the future.\n\nLam\u2019s advanced technologies rely on specialized materials and components. To source them, we collaborate with thousands of suppliers around the world. We invest in supplier relationships built on shared values of open communication and trust. Our Core Values drive us to take ownership for upholding responsible, ethical practices and continuously improving our supply chain performance over time.\n\nOur supply chain focus areas include climate action, human rights, supplier diversity, and responsible mineral sourcing. To increase supplier engagement across these areas in 2022, we matured our supply chain management processes and grew our Supply Chain ESG team. We also surveyed our suppliers on their climate performance and helped them accelerate progress toward their sustainability goals. By the year\u2019s end, more than half of our top 100 suppliers (by spend) acknowledged our Climate Pledge. Together, we can collaborate toward mutual ESG progress and long-term, sustainable business growth.\n\n### Responsible supply chain\n\n| GOAL                                                                 | STATUS | 2022 PROGRESS                                                                 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Achieve more than 90% compliance with our social and environmental expectations across our top-tier suppliers |        | \u2022 Exceeded our goal with 94% of suppliers responding to our conflict minerals survey |\n| Engage with at least 50% of our top-tier suppliers on environmental sustainability opportunities |        | \u2022 Exceeded our goal by engaging with 100% of top-tier suppliers in 2022         |\n| Increase engagement with all suppliers on social and environmental topics through assessment, training, and capacity building |        | \u2022 Deepened supplier engagement through our inaugural Supplier ESG Forum, new supplier engagement platform, new monthly webinar series and newsletter, and additional trainings via the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) |\n| 46.5% of suppliers measured by emissions will set SBTs\u00b2 |        | \u2022 14.5% of suppliers as measured by emissions have set SBTs                   |\n\n### 2022 HIGHLIGHTS\n\n- Launched our supplier engagement platform\n- Engaged suppliers at Lam\u2019s inaugural Supplier ESG Forum\n- Received Lam Climate Pledge acknowledgments from 53% of top 100 suppliers\n- Leveraged RBA tools to assess supplier performance\n\n### RELEVANT SDGS\n\n1 Unless stated otherwise, we aim to complete each of our ESG goals by 2025.\n2 Previously, this goal targeted SBTs for 80% of top direct suppliers (by spend) by 2025 and 95% by 2030. Lam updated this goal in 2022 per the SBTi verification and approval process.\n\nNote: Unless otherwise noted, data in this chapter are inclusive of direct material spend globally.\nOur strategy for mutual success\n\nLam\u2019s supply chain is extensive, so we employ strong oversight and governance to facilitate comprehensive supply chain management across the globe. Our Supply Chain ESG team leads our direct supplier risk assessment efforts, with a focus on driving continuous improvements. Lam also has cross-functional supply chain teams that collaborate to share best practices around supplier engagement.\n\nEmbedding ESG across our supply chain\n\nWe manage and monitor ESG performance throughout our supply chain through a strategic framework built on five pillars:\n\n- Transparency\n- Responsibility\n- Risk Assessment and Audit\n- Training\n- Governance\n\n\u201cWe believe it is vital that we prioritize innovation, competitiveness, collaboration, and supply chain security to maintain U.S. leadership in this critical global industry.\u201d\n\nTim Archer\npresident and CEO of Lam\nspeaking about U.S. semiconductor competitiveness during his testimony before the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\nLearn more about his testimony \u2192\nManaging the supplier lifecycle\n\nLam engages suppliers early in the supplier lifecycle and continues to manage and facilitate their progress over time. We evaluate suppliers based on multiple factors, including known human rights risk indicators, geography, and spend. Upon selection, we encourage suppliers to become RBA members and contractually require that every supplier adheres to our Global Supplier Code of Conduct (GSCC), the RBA Code of Conduct, and applicable laws and regulations. Throughout the supplier lifecycle, we continue to conduct due diligence using a risk-based approach. This process may include RBA audit reports, inspections, and corrective actions as needed.\n\nIn 2022, we leveraged additional RBA tools to better quantify risks in the regions where our suppliers operate. This included requesting and collecting RBA self-assessment questionnaires (SAQ) and audit assessments via RBA\u2019s Validated Assessment Program. Through the process, we identified three high-risk countries for child labor and migrant labor. We use country-level risk data to inform our overall supplier engagement and assessment strategy. And, for any specific supplier risks, we apply the RBA guidelines to address those on a case-by-case basis by requesting corrective action plans and that follow-up closure audits are completed.\n\nINNOVATION SPOTLIGHT\n\nLeveraging plug-and-play technology to expedite direct material shipments\n\nSupply chain challenges in 2022 led to significant delivery delays for certain tools. As the team worked to address these challenges, one opportunity that was identified led to reduced delivery time for some shipments by more than 50%. How did we do it? A cellphone-sized device that costs about $40.\n\nThe idea came from Joe Picciocchi, who joined Lam\u2019s Livermore, California, site in 2021 as senior manager of logistics. At the time, it took about 12 days for a shipment from our supplier in Guadalajara, Mexico, to arrive at our Tualatin, Oregon, site. Realizing Logistics had no way of tracking a package\u2019s location, Joe launched an initiative to equip critical shipments with inexpensive trackers that provide real-time location data. This empowered Logistics to optimize manufacturing schedules and hold transportation vendors accountable.\n\nAs a result, the shipping time from Guadalajara, Mexico, to Tualatin, Oregon, now takes just four to five days. Currently, Logistics is tying its shipment-tracking data to Lam\u2019s Transportation Management System. In the future, the system could leverage predictive analytics and artificial intelligence to automatically plan and dispatch shipments.\nConducting due diligence at key steps\n\n**Screening and evaluation**\n- Lam\u2019s top direct material suppliers are assessed on human rights, environmental impact, and other known risk indicators including business volume and geographic location.\n\n**Onboarding**\n- New direct suppliers are required to acknowledge Lam\u2019s GSCC.\n- Existing qualified suppliers are contractually obligated to comply with the GSCC as well as the RBA Code of Conduct.\n\n**Getting started**\n- Critical suppliers are assessed through our Quality Management System (QMS) with a focus on new regional suppliers supporting Lam\u2019s Asia manufacturing locations.\n\n**Managing progress**\n- Our top suppliers are eligible to be awarded bonus points on their monthly Supplier Scorecard for diversity, ISO-14001 certification or RBA membership.\n- We ask our top suppliers to acknowledge Lam\u2019s Climate Pledge and provide carbon emissions data via our supplier engagement platform.\n- We offer supplier support to build environmental knowledge and capabilities that includes webinars and resources from academic institutions and subject matter experts.\nAdvancing climate action together\n\nBeyond supporting our business and customers, our supplier relationships are intrinsic to our net zero targets. Upstream activities contribute to our Scope 3 emissions, so if we want to reduce them, we need top suppliers on board.\n\nIn 2022, we engaged with 100% of our top-tier suppliers (by spend) on environmental sustainability opportunities, exceeding our goal of engaging at least 50% of our top-tier suppliers on these topics by 2025. We also made progress toward our 2025 goal by supporting 46.5% of top suppliers (measured by emissions) in setting SBTs.\n\nDuring the year, we surveyed our top suppliers to better understand their climate progress and encouraged them to commit to climate action by acknowledging our Climate Pledge. We also began asking suppliers to take a carbon footprinting class through the RBA. By engaging suppliers on these issues, we are encouraging them to measure and manage important areas of their environmental impact. This supports mutual progress toward our respective ESG priorities and goals.\n\n59% survey completion and 53% acknowledgement of the Lam Climate Pledge by top 100 suppliers.\n\n9 suppliers completed energy audits.\n\n21 of our top 100 suppliers published annual sustainability reports.\n\n50% of supplier survey respondents indicated they are using renewable energy.\n\nESG survey respondents by region of origin\n\n- North America 66%\n- Asia 23%\n- Europe, Middle East & Africa 11%\n\n*Based on ESG survey responses from 62 suppliers. Data have been rounded.*\nUpholding human rights\n\nWhen it comes to safe, dignified, and lawful working conditions, no one should be left behind. We are committed to protecting and supporting human rights\u2014both in our supply chain and in our global operations. Not only is this a compliance issue; it aligns with our Core Values of honesty, integrity, mutual respect, and mutual trust. We expect our suppliers and sites to comply with laws including\u2014but not limited to\u2014the U.K. Modern Slavery Act of 2015 and the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010.\n\nLam published its first Human Rights Policy in 2022, which outlines our expectations to uphold internationally recognized human rights. This policy applies to all employees and we expect our suppliers, as well as our business and community partners, to adopt similar practices. The policy aligns with the RBA\u2019s Code of Conduct and builds on expectations outlined in our GSCC. Additionally, our Global Employment Practices Statement declares our support of workers\u2019 rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining, to the extent permitted under local laws. These documents are distributed via email, published on our intranet, and made publicly available on our website.\n\nRegular training is an important part of our human rights program. And in 2022, we had 269 global supply chain management employees complete human rights training. We also requested our top suppliers to complete RBA\u2019s online human rights module.\n\nLearn more about how we uphold human rights in our supply chain\n\nEnsuring responsible sourcing of minerals\n\nRaw minerals are the building blocks of semiconductor technology, and we are committed to ensuring that they are ethically and responsibly sourced. Lam is a member of the Responsible Mineral Initiative (RMI), a multi-stakeholder organization that helps address egregious human rights issues in the mining of tin, tantalum, tungsten, gold, and other minerals of concern. Since 2012, we have used the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template developed by RMI to assess our suppliers. In 2022, we expanded our due diligence efforts related to minerals of concern to include cobalt and mica, as recommended by RMI.\n\nAccess our Conflict Minerals Policy Statement\n\nCultivating a diverse supply chain\n\nInclusion and diversity are part of our Core Values at Lam, and we recognize the value that our relationships with diverse suppliers bring. During our supplier onboarding process, we implement measures to identify diverse suppliers, including minority-, women-, LGBTQ+-, and veteran-owned businesses, as well as businesses owned by people with disabilities. We also include diverse qualifications in our Supplier Scorecard and track and report spending with diverse direct material suppliers on a periodic basis. Our diverse supplier spend totaled $123.3 million in 2022.\n\nLearn more about our approach to cultivating a diverse supplier network\nCollaborating toward ESG progress\n\nOur Supply Chain ESG team engages suppliers to understand their challenges, priorities, and needs. They also reach out with best practices and resources to help suppliers build capability to make progress on social and environmental goals. In addition to rolling out our supplier engagement platform in 2022, we launched:\n\n- An ESG-focused webinar series and a monthly newsletter, which we shared with nearly 200 direct and indirect suppliers\n- A dedicated email address for supplier queries\n- An ESG portal to provide suppliers with additional support and resources\n\nWe also offered additional training sessions and tools to help suppliers calculate their GHG emissions.\n\nCelebrating and connecting with top suppliers\n\nSemiconductors are strategically important to the world. Throughout 2022, our suppliers played a key role in ensuring that the semiconductor ecosystem could continue to meet heightened demand. We presented our highest-performing suppliers with Excellence Awards during our annual Supplier Day at the end of October, recognizing their accomplishments across several categories.\n\nIn conjunction with Supplier Day, we held our inaugural Supplier ESG Forum where we presented XP Power with our Supplier ESG award. The event included an expert panel with Lam\u2019s supply chain leaders, a keynote speaker from our customer Intel, and a presentation from a key supplier, Celestica. The forum was a catalyst for relationship-building and prioritizing environmental initiatives.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why open communication is one of Lam\u2019s Core Values\u2014we believe it translates to mutual success. This holds true for our approach to engaging suppliers to drive joint progress on climate action, human rights, and other issues related to ESG. By investing in close, collaborative partnerships, we can build a stronger semiconductor ecosystem and future for all.\u201d\n\nPat Lord\nchief operating officer at Lam\nOur communities\n\nIN THIS SECTION:\n\n64  Highlights\n65  Powering breakthroughs together\n66  Transformative learning\n68  Resilient communities\n69  Inclusive societies\n70  Turning employees\u2019 passion into action\nWe use our resources to foster communities that are empowered, inclusive, and resilient.\n\nLam\u2019s business is about powering semiconductor breakthroughs, and our communities know we don\u2019t stop there.

Lam attracts people who are changemakers and problem solvers at heart\u2014when they see a community in need, they pitch in.\n\nIn 2022, our employees worked alongside colleagues and neighbors to pack backpacks, donate textbooks, and plant trees. They held fundraisers and drives to support local causes and took part in Lam\u2019s longtime tradition of delivering joy. As an organization, we launched our new social impact platform, which focuses our community work around three areas that align with our values and strengths. Lam also kicked off our first signature initiative, a three-year collaboration with FIRST Global. We look forward to working with the organization to inspire science and technology leadership and innovation in youth. It\u2019s just one way we\u2019re working with our community partners to power breakthroughs together.\n\n### Community\n\n| GOAL                                                                 | STATUS | 2022 PROGRESS                                                                 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Determine key targets for larger-scale impact aligned to a new strategic focus |        | \u2022 Achieved our goal by launching a new social impact framework with three strategic focus areas to guide our giving and signature program initiatives |\n| Implement measurement of outcomes for key program and large-scale grants |        | \u2022 Began developing a reporting process and measurement outcomes |\n| Increase annual unique participation rate in all employee giving programs from 10% to 30% |        | \u2022 Increased annual unique employee participation rate from 10% in 2021 to 18% in 2022 |\n| Increase employee volunteer hours by 33% from a 2019 baseline |        | \u2022 Achieved and surpassed our goal with employees completing 21,133 volunteer hours in 2022 for a total increase of 58% from a 2019 baseline and set a new goal to achieve 40,000 by end of 2025 |\n\n### 2022 HIGHLIGHTS\n\n- Rolled out Lam\u2019s new **Powering Breakthroughs Together** social impact platform\n- Committed $10M over three years to **FIRST Global**\n- Increased volunteer hours by 65% from 2021, logging 21,133 hours in 2022\n- Organized 80+ employee-driven events for our Deliver Joy campaign\n\n### RELEVANT SDGS\n\n- Quality Education (4)\n- Reduced Inequalities (10)\n- Climate Action (13)\n\nView SDG alignment\n\n---\n\n1 Unless stated otherwise, we aim to complete each of our ESG goals by 2025.

In 2022, we introduced our new social impact platform to bring that vision to life. Our new platform, Powering Breakthroughs Together, provides a framework for Lam to make a positive community impact where it matters most. Our strategy is to cultivate meaningful relationships with charitable organizations that share our purpose and vision. In August 2022, we closed our first cycle of grants with applicants supporting each of our focus areas:\n\n**Transformative learning**\nWe\u2019re pushing the boundaries of education to carve out new pathways for learners, innovators, and creative thinkers.\n\n**Resilient communities**\nWe\u2019re helping communities build resilience in the face of adversity through strong relationships, enhanced technological capacity, preparedness, and recovery planning.\n\n**Inclusive societies**\nWe\u2019re working to change inequitable systems and increase access to resources and opportunities that help communities reach their full potential and flourish.\n\nOur social impact manifesto\n\nFor more than forty years, we\u2019ve defied conventions. Challenged assumptions. Pushed the boundaries of technical limitations. But we know, technology alone doesn\u2019t enable breakthroughs. People do. They think big to build better communities. To create safer, more sustainable systems. To relentlessly pursue innovation that delivers real impact. When people are empowered to collectively reimagine tomorrow, we power a better world for generations to come.\n\nOur new Powering Breakthroughs Together platform speaks to what Lam stands for and the type of social impact we want to make. Through it, we\u2019re building meaningful partnerships with organizations that align with Lam\u2019s Guiding Principle to act with purpose for a better world.\u201d\n\nChristie Valdez\ndirector of community relations at Lam\nLaunching our signature program with FIRST Global\n\nReady.

Our assurance statement, however, represents our independent opinion and is intended to inform all stakeholders including Lam.\nAssurance letter (continued)\n\nScope of Assurance\nThe scope of work agreed with Lam includes the following:\n\nOrganizational boundary\n- All global facilities under Lam\u2019s operational control\n\nData Verified for the period of January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022\n- GHG Emissions Scope 1 and 2\n- Energy Consumption\n- Energy Savings\n- Water Usage\n- Water Saving\n- Waste & Waste Data Diversion Rate (including Hazardous Waste)\n- Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR)\n\nData Verified for the period of January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2021\n- GHG Emissions Scope 1\n- Water Saving\n\nData Verified for the period of January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020\n- GHG Emissions Scope 1\n- Water Saving\n\nData Verified for the period of January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019\n- GHG Emissions Scope 1\n\nWe do not express conclusions on other information that may be published on Lam\u2019s website or sustainability disclosures for the current reporting period or previous periods.\n\n| Topic                        | Accounting Metric                                                                 | Units          |\n|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Greenhouse Gas Emissions     | (1) 2022 Gross global Scope 1 and 2 emissions (2) 2021 Gross global Scope 1 and 2 emissions (3) 2020 Gross global Scope 1 and 2 emissions (4) 2019 Gross global Scope 1 and 2 emissions | Metric tonnes CO\u2082e (MTCO\u2082e) |\n| Energy Consumption           | 2022 Total energy consumed                                                        | Kilowatt hours (kWh) |\n| Energy Savings               | 2022 Energy savings achieved                                                       | Kilowatt hours (kWh) |\n| Water Usage                  | 2022 Total water usage                                                             | Gallons        |\n| Water Savings                | 2020 \u2013 2022 Total water savings                                                   | Gallons        |\n| Waste Management             | (1) 2022 Total amount of hazardous waste (2) 2022 Total amount non-hazardous waste generated (3) 2022 Total percentage hazardous waste recycled (4) 2022 Total non-hazardous waste recycled | Metric tonnes (MT) Percentage (%) |\n| Employee Health & Safety     | Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR)                                             | Rate per 200,000 hours |\n| Progress towards 2025 Goals  | (1) 2022 GHG Scope 1 and 2 emissions (market-based) change against 2019 baseline (2) 2022 Hazardous waste to landfill (3) 2022 Water savings exceed 2025 ESG goal | Percentage (%) |\nLevel of Assurance\n\nWe performed a limited assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (revised) \u2013 \u2018Assurance Engagements other than Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial Information\u2019, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. This standard requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance.\n\nDNV applies its own management standards and compliance policies for quality control, in accordance with ISO/IEC 17029:2019 - Conformity Assessment Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of management systems, and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing and are less detailed than those undertaken during a reasonable assurance engagement, so the level of assurance obtained is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. We planned and performed our work to obtain the evidence we considered sufficient to provide a basis for our opinion, so that the risk of this conclusion being in error is reduced, but not reduced completely.\n\nDNV\u2019s assurance engagements are based on the assumption that the data and information provided by the client to us as part of our review have been provided in good faith. This includes but is not limited to sales and acquisitions, building occupancy rates, operating hours, and operational control. DNV expressly disclaims any liability or co-responsibility for any decision a person or an entity may make based on this Independent Assurance Statement.\n\nAssurance Methodology\n\nDNV is a leading provider of sustainability services, including verification of GHG emissions data and other environmental metrics. Our environmental and social assurance specialists work in over 100 countries.\n\nIn that respect, the environmental footprint inventories have been evaluated against the following reporting criteria:\n\n- World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) / World Resources Institute (WRI) Greenhouse Gas Protocol, A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard REVISED EDITION\n\nDNV used a risk-based approach throughout the assurance engagement, concentrating on the areas that we believe are most material for both Lam and its stakeholders. DNV applied a materiality threshold of five percent for all data in scope.\n\nThe assurance process involved a series of 60-minute interviews with the accountable party(ies) and/or senior manager(s) responsible for collating the information at a corporate level to:\n\n- Perform a walkthrough to understand how data is managed and reported and the systems, legal registers, processes, and procedures used\n- Interview of managers and data users representing relevant functions for supporting the environmental inventory and safety data management process\n- Review the controls in place to confirm data and information accuracy\n- Confirm the scope and boundaries of the data included\n- Requests for further evidence and documentation in support of testimony and system observation\n\nThe assurance process includes desk review of the submitted documentation, site visit, data records and sources relating to the selected performance metrics and corporate environmental footprint data claims.\n\n- Review of the processes and tools used to collect, aggregate, and report on all data and metrics\n- Assessment of environmental and other information systems and controls, including:\nAssurance letter (continued)\n\n- Selection and management of all relevant environmental and safety data and information\n- Processes for collecting, processing, consolidating, and reporting the environmental and safety data and information\n- Systems and processes that ensure the accuracy of the performance data and information\n- Design and maintenance of the environmental and employee workforce and safety information system\n- Systems and processes that support the environmental and employee workforce and safety information system\n- Performed sample-based audits of the processes for generating, gathering, and managing the data\n  - Performed key data recalculations to confirm accuracy\n  - Examination of the social, governance, and environmental data and information to develop evidence for the assessment of the claims and assertions made\n  - Evaluation of whether the organization conforms to the reporting criteria\n  - Evaluation of whether the evidence and data are sufficient and support Lam's environmental, social and performance claims\n  - Conducted remote site assessment at Fremont, California to review GHG emissions, energy, waste, and health and safety management\n\nIn addition to the above, specific to the environmental indicators, the following steps were conducted for energy savings, waste, and water:\n\n**Energy Savings**\n- Review of energy conservation measures implemented in the reporting year\n- Conducted sample-based review of the process for quantifying energy savings performance including:\n  - Evaluation of reasonableness and conservativeness of assumptions related to energy baseline and savings calculated from energy conservation measures\n  - Desk-based review of energy calculations provided by Lam and energy consultants\n\n**Waste**\n- Review of the waste segregation methodology and description of waste categorization\n- Conduct data checks for the waste data collected, transferred, and calculated\n- Perform sample-based assessment of data reported against the source data (waste collected to landfill and waste diverted) provided by waste management companies.\n\n**Water**\n- Review water usage measures within the reporting year\n- Conducted desk review and sample selection to cross check data points provided by Lam Research\n- Review the water savings allocation methodology and the assumptions made in the water savings section\nAssurance letter (continued)\n\nData Verified\n\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions \u2013 CY 2022\n- Scope 1 Emissions 432,998 MT CO2e\n- Scope 2 Emissions (location-based) 131,084 MT CO2e\n- Scope 2 Emissions (market-based) 63,300 MT CO2e\n\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions Scope 1 Restatement \u2013 CY 2019, CY 2020, CY 2021\n- 2019 Scope 1 Emissions Restatement 79,313 MT CO2e\n- 2020 Scope 1 Emissions Restatement 232,662 MT CO2e\n- 2021 Scope 1 Emissions Restatement 288,007 MT CO2e\n\nEnergy Consumption \u2013 CY 2022\n- Total Energy Consumed 493,955,846 kWh\n\nEnergy Savings \u2013 CY 2022\n- Energy Savings Achieved 2,243,860 kWh\n\nWater Used \u2013 CY 2022\n- Total Water Usage 398,130,121 Gallons\n\nWater Savings \u2013 CY 2020, CY 2021, CY 2022\n- Water Savings in CY2020 6,767,100 Gallons\n- Water Savings in CY2021 6,767,100 Gallons\n- Water Savings in CY2022 33,380,713 Gallons\n\nWaste \u2013 CY2022\n- Total Hazardous Waste 1,922 Metric tonnes\n- Hazardous Waste Recycled 48%\n- Total Non-Hazardous Waste 9,261 Metric tonnes\n- Non-hazardous Waste Recycled 77%\n\nEmployee Health & Safety \u2013 CY 2022\n- Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) 0.35\n\nProgress towards 2025 ESG Goals\n- CY 2022 Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions against 2019 baseline 207%\n- CY 2022 Hazardous Waste to Landfill 0.01%\n- CY 2022 Water Savings exceed 2025 ESG goal 176%\n\n1 MT CO2e stands for metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent\n2 Scope 1 Restatement from 2019 \u2013 2021 is based on a newly identified refrigerant (FC-3283).\nAssurance letter (continued)\n\n**Inherent Limitations**\nDue to the selective nature (sampling) and other inherent limitations of both procedures and systems of internal control, there remains the unavoidable risk that errors or irregularities may not have been detected. Calculations of energy savings are subject to inherent limitations, given the nature and the methods used for determining such data. DNV did not conduct independent measurement of the energy savings variables. This is a limitation which can influence the accuracy of our opinion. Finally, the selection of different but acceptable measurement techniques, in particular related to the waste and energy savings performance, may result in materially different measurements.\n\n**Assurance Opinion**\nBased on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the information and data within the Report is not fairly stated and has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the criteria stated. This conclusion relates only to the information in the Report and is to be read in the context of this Assurance Statement.\n\n**Independence**\nDNV was not involved in the preparation of any part of Lam\u2019s data or report. This is our first year of providing assurance for Lam. We adopt a balanced approach towards all stakeholders when performing our evaluation.\n\nDNV Business Assurance USA, Inc.\nKaty, Texas\nJune 27, 2023\n\nStephen Carlson\nLead Verifier\n\nOwen Chen\nLead Verifier\n\nShruthi Poonacha Bachamanda\nTechnical Reviewer\n## Assurance letter (continued)\n\n| Topic          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Methodology                                                                                                                                  | Units          |\n|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| **Energy Savings** | 2022 Energy savings achieved  \nEnergy savings achieved as a result of energy conservation measures (ECM) implemented at all global facilities under Lam\u2019s operational control in the reporting year.
