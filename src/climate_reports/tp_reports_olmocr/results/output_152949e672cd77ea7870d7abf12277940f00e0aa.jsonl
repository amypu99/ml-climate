It has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards and integrates the recommendations of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\nIn addition to the information found in this report and on our website, we externally report on our Travel with Purpose strategy, programs and progress toward our 2030 Goals in Hilton\u2019s Form 10-K, Annual Report and Proxy Statement. We obtain third-party assurance over selected data disclosed in this report, as indicated in our 2022 Assurance Statement. All financial figures indicated in this report are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted.\nIn 2022, we continued advancing our Travel with Purpose strategy and our 2030 Goals\u2014but we also saw an opportunity to raise the bar based on rigorous analysis and the latest information available. We introduced new, more ambitious environmental and social goals which are laser-focused on paving the way to a net-zero future and creating an engine of opportunity in the communities where we live, work and travel. Those ambitions come to life across our business and are integrated in everything we do, from sustainable operations to responsible sourcing and inclusive hiring practices.\n\n**OUR JOURNEY TO REDUCE EMISSIONS**\n\nAs climate science has evolved, our environmental goals and approach have, too. Driven by data, we are leading the industry with ambitious 2030 targets validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) on our journey toward reducing emissions across our entire global portfolio while creating greater operating efficiencies.\n\nIn partnership with our owners, we reduced single-use plastic amenities in our hotels, expanded our replacement of traditional light bulbs with more energy-efficient LEDs, offered guests on-property electric vehicle charging, and provided lower-emission choices with carbon-neutral options for our meetings and events customers. We also opened what we believe to be the first net-zero hotel in the United States: Hotel Marcel New Haven, Tapestry Collection by Hilton.\n\nAdditionally, in 2022 we made a strategic investment in Fifth Wall\u2019s Climate Tech Fund to support its work to deliver innovative decarbonizing technologies to the real estate industry.\n\n**OUR CULTURE OF RESPONSIBILITY**\n\nHilton is one of the world\u2019s largest hospitality companies, and with more than 7,000 hotels around the globe, we recognize our responsibility to be a leader as an inclusive workplace and to be a force for good in the communities where we operate. As a business of people serving people, we are focused on creating a culture that serves our Team Members\u2014from empowering them to bring their full selves to work to creating opportunities for all in our communities.\n\nWhen the conflict in Ukraine unfolded, we quickly deployed resources to protect our Team Members and guests in the region. We also partnered with American Express to donate room nights to support Ukrainian refugees and humanitarian relief efforts across Europe.\n\nTo further impact our communities, through the Hilton Global Foundation, we granted more than $2M to organizations that advance our Travel with Purpose Goals, including awarding 39 Action Grants for hotels to lead impact projects in their communities. Finally, throughout the year, our team also expanded our relationships with local and diverse suppliers around the world.\n\n**OUR TEAM DEDICATION**\n\nAt the heart of all of these incredible efforts are our more than 400,000 Team Members, who are working in thousands of communities globally to share our signature hospitality and make the world a better place. Thanks to their tremendous dedication, we also earned recognition for our environmental and social efforts from many leading benchmarking organizations, including being named:\n\n- A global sustainability leader on the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices for the sixth consecutive year\n- A Gold Medal designee by EcoVadis\n- The #1 company for ESG by DiversifyInc, and a member of its Hall of Fame\n- The #2 World\u2019s Best Workplace by Great Place to Work Institute and Fortune Magazine, and the only hospitality company on the list\n\nI am so proud of all that we accomplished in 2022\u2014thank you to our Team Members, hotel owners, guests and partners around the world. Together, we are proving that hospitality is truly an unstoppable force for good.\n\nChristopher J. Nassetta\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nApril 6, 2023\nHilton at a Glance\n\nHilton is one of the largest and most recognized hospitality companies in the world.

At the heart of this strategy are our people, who bring our commitment to sustainable travel to life.\nHilton proudly serves as an industry leader in driving social and environmental impact and sound governance. Yet we are continuously striving to advance our ESG strategy and evolve our programs to do better\u2014for our guests, our communities and the world.\n\nWhile social and environmental responsibility has always been a priority for Hilton, in 2018 we set ambitious Travel with Purpose 2030 Goals to hold ourselves accountable for progress across our operations, supply chain and local businesses. Our 2030 Goals are underpinned by targets which closely align with the United Nation\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nThrough Travel with Purpose, our leaders are using their innovation and influence to make meaningful differences in the destinations and communities in which we operate.

The results of the assessment are being used to ensure that Hilton\u2019s ESG programs not only remain aligned with long-term business strategies across departments and geographic regions, but ultimately will have a positive impact on responsible tourism.\n\n\u201cWorking closely with Hilton, Asset World Corporation is rolling out initiatives that align to our sustainable development pillars: Better Planet, Better People and Better Prosperity.

Then, by considering carbon credits, the remaining actualized carbon emissions from the meeting or event can be offset.\n\nHilton partnered with Amex GBT to showcase how hotels can help business travel managers and event planners incorporate sustainability into their travel plans.\n\nAmerican Express Global Business Travel (Amex GBT) Global Business Consulting partnered with Hilton to develop the Amex GBT Stay Green whitepaper, helping business travel leaders to understand the latest best practices in global travel and meetings with respect to hotel sustainability.

Over 1,600 of our hotels have now installed convenient EV chargers, which enable our guests to travel more sustainably and reinforce our commitment to reduce the environmental impact on the destinations where we operate.\n\n**SUSTAINABLE MENU OPTIONS:**\nGuests can sample climate-conscious menus featuring locally sourced, sustainably grown meals designed to boost energy and minimize leftovers. Hotels may share the bounty with others by donating remaining food, where allowed by law.\n\n**BULK AMENITIES:**\nGuests will find that hotels are transitioning to full-size amenities, which will greatly reduce plastic waste. And as hotels make this transition, we\u2019ve maintained our relationship with Clean the World to recycle these full-size bottles, diverting them from ending up in landfills.\n\n**DIGITAL KEY:**\nIn 2015, Hilton\u2019s app-based Digital Key program was launched to allow guests to bypass the front desk and check in virtually. In 2021, this program expanded to include Digital Key Share to allow guests to share their keys with friends and family members via the app. This technology is now available at more than 80% of Hilton\u2019s portfolio. It has been used to open more than 168 million guest room doors since 2020.\n\nEach Hilton property, in alignment with our overarching Travel with Purpose strategy, chooses unique ways to make a difference in our communities. Our brands take the initiative to make noticeable and lasting upgrades as part of our ongoing commitment to reduce environmental impact.\n\n**Encouraging responsible tourism**\n\n**Grand Wailea, A Waldorf Astoria Resort**\n\nGrand Wailea participates in the Hawaii Tourism Authority\u2019s M\u0101lama Hawaii initiative, which invites guests to m\u0101lama (give back) through volunteer work in return for incentives. Through the M\u0101lama Hawaii program, guests can work together with the coastal preservation team from our NGO partner Hawaii Land Trust in some of Maui\u2019s most treasured natural preserves. Guests get the chance to give back to the community, learn about the traditional Native Hawaiian approach to land stewardship, and make a lasting impact on Maui through service.

We aim to meet the expectations of the growing number of purpose-driven consumers who value sustainable travel.\n\n**RESETTING OUR SCIENCE-BASED TARGETS**\n\nIn 2018, Hilton was the first major hospitality company to set science-based targets to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in line with climate science. These targets were validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and served to guide annual reduction goals for our hotels and across the enterprise.\n\nIn line with the SBTi requirement, we committed to review our emissions goals every five years to ensure ongoing alignment with the Paris Agreement, which reflects the latest climate science and which had evolved over the past five years. For this reason, we undertook the rigorous application and analysis process in 2022 to evaluate our existing targets, assess our current and projected greenhouse gas inventory, and align the data to the latest methodology from the SBTi, which is a collaboration among four leading organizations: World Resource Institute\u2019s Center for Sustainable Business, World Wildlife Fund, Climate Disclosure Project, and the United Nations Global Compact. This rigorous exercise allowed us to set new, enhanced carbon intensity reduction targets that were both more ambitious and grounded in the realities of the latest climate science. The new targets were revalidated with SBTi and announced publicly in mid-2022.\n\nOur reduction targets are separated into two categories: Scope 1 & 2 emissions from our managed portfolio, for which we have operational control; and Scope 3 emissions from our franchised properties. As a result, the entirety of our current and projected portfolio is covered within the SBTi goal framework.\n\n**OUR PATH TO ACHIEVING AMBITIOUS GOALS**\n\nIn 2022, Hilton engaged Schneider Electric, a global leader in energy and sustainability solutions and strategy development, to help us define our roadmap to achieve our revalidated 2030 science-based targets. We formed a global cross-functional work group composed of our ESG team and our global operations engineering teams, which collaborated with Schneider Electric to collect and review hotel utility trends, hotel efficiency project data, development pipeline projections, anticipated technology and grid transformation, and other data to chart our path toward 2030.\n\nTogether, we ran a rigorous analysis of our enterprise-wide emissions data and calculated key interventions, their estimated cost and payback, and environmental benefit.\nA PHASED IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY\n\nUltimately, we developed a phased implementation strategy to reduce our emissions, prioritizing key sustainability initiatives for maximum impact. The approach begins with operational shifts that require limited resources to implement, followed by investments in high-impact energy efficiency projects. In the next stage, we work toward off-site renewable energy procurement and end-of-life equipment replacement, as well as high-efficiency retrofits and electrification measures. The final phases of the roadmap focus on on-site renewable electricity generation and, as a last step, the purchase of renewable energy certificates (RECs) and carbon offsets for any remaining unavoidable emissions.\n\nThis waterfall approach enables Hilton to make informed decisions and has helped us chart the path to achieving our emissions intensity reduction of 75% for managed properties and 56% across our franchised portfolio by 2030.\n\nTHE STATE OF OUR EMISSIONS INTENSITY\n\nOur primary source of emissions comes from the operation of our hotels. In 2022, we saw a resurgence in travel and resulting higher occupancy rates across our global portfolio. As a result, we experienced an increase in utility consumption across energy and water and an increase in waste generation compared to 2020-2021. As the business continues to recover, we aim to remain below pre-pandemic consumption levels and to pursue our roadmap to achieve our new and more ambitious 2030 emissions targets.\n\nRoadmap to Emissions Intensity Reduction\n\n| STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES | ENERGY EFFICIENCY | RENEWABLE POWER PROCUREMENT | RETROFITS & ELECTRIFICATION | ON-SITE GENERATION | OFFSETS & RENEWABLE ENERGY CERTIFICATES |\n|--------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Current practices that require no or low cost | Enhancing efficiency with faster payback investments, often capturing tax or utility incentives to accelerate ROI | Making investments in off-site renewable power in partnership with owners; opportunity to sell back to the grid and secure RECs | At the end of life, investing in higher efficiency mechanical equipment, ideally powered by electricity. The emissions associated with these investments often last over 20 years | Harnessing clean renewable power from the sun or deep inside the earth | Purchasing annual high quality carbon offsets and RECs as a last resort to make up the balance |\n\nOur robust action plan, developed in consultation with global sustainability leader Schneider Electric, projects our emissions based on our development pipeline, projected costs, efficiency investments, greening of the grid, and other factors.\n\nNote: In partnership with Schneider Electric, Hilton devised this roadmap. We are taking into account the growth we will experience in our pipeline (i.e., growth will increase our emissions, so the roadmap considers a potentially higher emissions volume from having more properties included in the calculation). Lastly, we are taking into account the greening of the grid.\nTraveling with a Purpose to us means embracing the environment and the people we meet. Appreciating and learning from the different towns we visit helps us to see why it is important both to tread lightly and bring home with us the best souvenir possible: a new perspective on how beautiful the world is.\u201d\n\nCory and Beau Williams\nBrothers and Co-Owners of Bot\u00e1nika Osa Peninsula, Curio Collection by Hilton\n\nEnvironmental stewardship\nBot\u00e1nika Osa Peninsula, Curio Collection by Hilton, Costa Rica\n\nIn 2022, Hilton opened Bot\u00e1nika Osa Peninsula as a distinctive nature resort presenting exclusive access to Costa Rica\u2019s unspoiled South Pacific Coast. Managed by Aqua-Aston Hospitality, this property is located beside Corcovado National Park and the Golfo Dulce tropical fjord, which offer some of the region\u2019s most ideal eco- and adventure tourism activities.\n\nThe hotel team strives to connect tourism and conservation by preserving the local environment and educating guests and local students about the value of environmental stewardship. They work with the community to provide guidance on ocean protection and responsible fishing; host school field trips with nature guides to educate children on local ecosystems and animals, such as sea turtles; and manage the logistics of a recycling program that creates jobs and reduces waste.\n\nBiodiversity is a component of our environmental policy. We manage risk to the natural habitat of the destinations where we operate by assessing our impact on marine and terrestrial biodiversity at our hotels. The Verisk-Maplecroft\u2019s Climate Change Vulnerability Index monitors our biodiversity risks and maps against multiple climate scenarios. The results of this risk analysis are shared with our hotels using LightStay. Furthermore, many hotels have retained partners to advance local efforts to preserve and protect local habitats and biodiversity as part of destination stewardship efforts.\n\nIndustry leadership\nHilton drives sustainable travel by participating in industry groups such as the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) Sustainability Leadership Council, the American Hotel & Lodging Association\u2019s (AHLA) Sustainability Committee and Responsible Stay Initiative, and the Sustainable Hospitality Alliance (SHA) Senior Advisory Council.\n\nThe GBTA Sustainability Leadership Council is comprised of 16 global travel industry executives who advise on GBTA\u2019s overall strategy to influence climate action and corporate responsibility. As part of its early initiatives, GBTA released the industry\u2019s first-ever comprehensive study\u2014across travel suppliers, travel buyers, and policy and government stakeholders\u2014on the state of sustainability in business travel and actions to improve the sector\u2019s environmental performance. Hilton joined the council in March 2022.\n\nThe SHA helps drive collaboration for a more sustainable future in the hospitality industry by focusing on issues such as human rights, youth employment, climate action and water stewardship. As part of SHA\u2019s Senior Advisory Council, we serve as an ambassador to key stakeholder groups by advising on the latest industry issues to ensure SHA is well positioned to achieve its greatest impact.\n\nIn 2022, AHLA launched a new initiative called Responsible Stay to highlight industry efforts in sustainability focused on four key areas: energy efficiency, water conservation, waste reduction and responsible sourcing. We endorsed this initiative and look forward to continuing to work together on ways to make the hospitality industry more environmentally and socially sustainable.\n\n\u201cTraveling with a Purpose to us means embracing the environment and the people we meet. Appreciating and learning from the different towns we visit helps us to see why it is important both to tread lightly and bring home with us the best souvenir possible: a new perspective on how beautiful the world is.\u201d\n\nCory and Beau Williams\nBrothers and Co-Owners of Bot\u00e1nika Osa Peninsula, Curio Collection by Hilton\nDecarbonization, one step at a time\n\nWe believe we can achieve our energy goals through a relentless focus on energy efficiency, electrification, and transition to renewable power, which will reduce both utility costs and greenhouse gas emissions from our portfolio of hotels.\n\n100% certified renewable electricity is used to power nearly 1/3 of all managed hotels in EMEA\n\n100% offset of Scope 3 emissions from Hilton corporate air travel and rental cars\n\nRENEWABLE ENERGY\n\nOur operations teams are exploring ways to increase our renewable energy procurement across our global portfolio, seeking green energy contracts where possible. Hilton works with hotel owners to identify opportunities to invest in small- and large-scale renewable and low-carbon technologies that make financial and practical sense, with the aim for hotels to operate from a self-sufficient energy supply. All managed hotels in the U.S. are encouraged to procure at least a portion of their electricity from renewable sources through our energy procurement services contracting program.\n\nNearly one-third of managed hotels across EMEA, as well as our Watford and Glasgow corporate offices, are currently powered with 100% certified renewable electricity. Since 2022, two-thirds of hotels across the Middle East, Africa and Turkey completed a feasibility study for an on-site solar photovoltaic project.\n\nSUSTAINABLE MEETINGS AND EVENTS\n\nWe also partnered with ClimeCo to develop a portfolio of verified carbon credits available for corporate customers hosting meetings or events at our hotels around the world.\n\nIn 2022, we promoted renewable energy projects such as solar, wind and wastewater offset projects with the purchase of verified and Gold-certified carbon offsets to address the emissions that could not be reduced and associated with our regional and global corporate conferences in Orlando, Las Vegas, London and Singapore, which hosted over 5,000 attendees.\n\nEV CHARGERS FOR GUEST USE\n\nAlso in 2022, we launched two key initiatives that will better serve guests who are seeking electric vehicle (EV) charging options.\n\nThe primary component of this launch was digital: A new filter on Hilton\u2019s website and Hilton Honors app now allows guests to search for hotels that offer on-site EV charging.\n\nThe EV charging filter, announced in January, has been well received by guests and Team Members.\n\nHilton Supply Management (HSM) secured partnerships with five EV charging companies to enable more hotels to install EV chargers, increasing the number of hotels with EV chargers to more than 1,600 globally.\n\nENERGY-EFFICIENT LIGHTING\n\nBy 2024, all of Hilton\u2019s properties worldwide will have completed a full transition to LED lighting, a highly energy-efficient technology. This initiative will both reduce hotels\u2019 energy consumption and generate long-term cost savings on electricity bills. Changing light bulbs is the most common request received by engineering teams at our hotels, as LEDs have a significantly longer lifespan than traditional light bulbs, this transition will also save our Team Members\u2019 time that they can use to focus on other decarbonization efforts.\n\nThe EV charging filter, announced in January, has been well received by guests and Team Members.\n\nHilton Supply Management (HSM) secured partnerships with five EV charging companies to enable more hotels to install EV chargers, increasing the number of hotels with EV chargers to more than 1,600 globally.\n\nENERGY-EFFICIENT LIGHTING\n\nBy 2024, all of Hilton\u2019s properties worldwide will have completed a full transition to LED lighting, a highly energy-efficient technology.

It is backed by 70 of the world\u2019s largest owners, operators and developers of real estate from 15 countries. Fifth Wall invests in technology companies tackling climate change, aging buildings and infrastructure, inaccessible housing markets, unreliable supply chains, and the future of work. Hilton is the only hotel brand investing in Fifth Wall\u2019s Climate Tech Fund, demonstrating our commitment to climate action and decarbonization.\n\nAquicore:\nIn 2022, Hilton deepened its partnership in the U.S. with Aquicore, a leading platform for energy and facility performance management in commercial real estate. The platform equips operations and engineering leaders to monitor the central plant and HVAC systems centrally, and identify and deliver actionable, low- or no-cost equipment modifications to improve asset performance. Real-time insights into sources of energy waste enable our teams to run properties more efficiently and reduce their carbon footprint.\n\nSince installing Aquicore in our first property in 2017, we have achieved over $4 million in energy cost savings to date across dozens of full-service properties.\n\nHampton by Hilton Edinburgh Airport carrying out an inspection of plant equipment, ensuring there are no signs of damage or leakage.\n\nAnother first\n\n100% OF ELECTRICITY FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY\n\nHilton Vienna Park: 100% of the electricity used in Hilton Vienna Park is hydropower generated. It boasts a Room Energy Management System, solar window foil to reduce energy waste, and LED and energy-efficient light bulbs. For the past decade, Hilton Vienna Park has been recognized for its sustainability efforts and has been awarded the Austrian Eco Label certification for sustainability, the first national eco-label for tourism worldwide.\n\nHampton Inn/Homewood Suites by Hilton Boston Seaport: In August 2022, the hotel became the first U.S.-managed hotel to sign an energy deal which supplies certified renewable energy for 100% of the hotel\u2019s electric consumption.\n\nNEW CHARGING STATIONS\n\nHilton Addis Ababa: In partnership with Green Tech Ethiopia, this property inaugurated Ethiopia\u2019s first EV charging station at a hotel in the presence of high government officials and invited guests.\n\nThe Minister of Tourism H.E. Nasise Chali and Minister of Transport H.E. Dagmawit Moges congratulated Hilton on another first by taking the lead for supporting guests who drive electric vehicles. With this initiative, Hilton Addis Ababa supports the aim of improving Africa\u2019s green energy future.\n\nHilton Zhoushan: Newly installed Tesla charging stations provide services to more than 3,100 guests with EVs, reducing vehicle carbon emissions by 60 tons. Nearly 20% of properties in Mainland China have EV chargers.\n\nExample EV charging station found at over 1,600 of our hotels.\nGreen Key certification\n\nRome Cavalieri, A Waldorf Astoria Hotel\n\nThe hotel has achieved Green Key certification for the fourth consecutive year. In the last five years, the hotel has achieved a high level of energy efficiency, undertaken excellent waste management, constantly monitored carbon emissions, and collaborated regularly with numerous local associations that support disadvantaged communities. The hotel\u2019s sustainability efforts have led to significant reduction in operating costs. These accomplishments are driven by LED installations, irrigation management and daily utility monitoring.\n\nDesigning greener hotels\n\nWE ARE THE ONLY MAJOR HOTEL BRAND TO HAVE ACHIEVED CERTIFICATION TO ISO ACROSS OUR GLOBAL PORTFOLIO OF HOTELS\n\nThrough our efforts, we have one of the largest portfolios of buildings certified to ISO standards in the world. Our certifications to ISO 14001 (Environmental Management), ISO 50001 (Energy Management) and ISO 9001 (Quality Management) requirements by tracking emissions reductions following the implementation of our investments in efficiency and resilience. Owners of both managed and franchised properties are required to build and operate hotels that align with our Brand Standards, which include minimum guidelines for energy and water efficiency, and are required to operate in compliance with ISO 14001 and ISO 50001.\n\nGREEN BUILDING GUIDANCE\n\nWe encourage our owners to build or renovate hotels to the highest green building standards that can apply in the hotel\u2019s location. Our approach includes providing design guidance during construction as well as operational guidance for our existing portfolio. The Energy and Water Efficient Design Companion Guide complements our Brand Standards by offering improvements that can be made during hotel development, refurbishment and maintenance to improve environmental performance. We encourage implementation of efficient appliances and building systems when the equipment reaches its end of life.\n\nDuring 2022, we retained ReTech Advisors, a leading sustainability consultant, who will help us to develop sustainable design checklists for renovations, conversions, and new builds that we will co-create with our architecture, design and construction (AD&C) team to support our owners to achieve more sustainable design and a lower cost of ownership.\n\nWe are exploring new business partnership opportunities to make it easier for our owners to streamline the donation of all soft goods, furniture, finishes, and fixtures in guestrooms and public spaces to charitable organizations and recycling centers across the U.S. In addition, during LED lighting conversions in the U.S., we have made a recycling program available to owners that separates lamp components and reports the volume of materials diverted from landfills.\nConserving water, one of the world\u2019s most valuable resources\n\nWe embed water stewardship throughout our global operations. We work closely with our hotels, our suppliers and our community partners to drive water reduction and conservation as well as improve water availability and quality in all our locations around the world.\n\n100% of our portfolio of hotels were mapped for WWF\u2019s Water Risk Filter\n\nWATER AS A MOST PRECIOUS RESOURCE\n\nWe\u2019ve developed standards for the architecture, landscaping and basic systems of our hotels that lessen energy usage, limit light and air pollution, and conserve water. Our water conservation efforts for our mega brands (e.g., Hilton Garden Inn, Embassy Suites) include:\n\nWATER-SENSITIVE LANDSCAPES: Lush gardens and lawns are water-intensive. Replace the thirsty species with drought-tolerant native plants or succulents.\n\nWATER-EFFICIENT FIXTURES: High-efficiency, adjustable-flow and controlled-stream showerheads, toilets and faucets conserve water.\n\nAdditionally, our brand standards require all hotels to regularly monitor and report their water-use metrics compared against an improvement goal. They must also employ LightStay to report on an active water-related improvement project.\n\nELEVATING OPERATIONAL WATER EFFICIENCY\n\nSeveral Hilton properties have demonstrated leadership in tackling water consumption by improving operational water efficiencies.\n\nSTORMWATER MANAGEMENT: In an effort to reduce the burden on the city\u2019s stormwater infrastructure and improve water quality, Conrad Washington, DC features an on-site stormwater management system where it is able to capture 97 percent of rainfall and use it to irrigate the hotel\u2019s outdoor terraces and to cool its air conditioning towers.\n\nMORE EFFICIENT EQUIPMENT: Home to several plunge pools, Waldorf Astoria Los Cabos Pedregal uses high-efficiency variable speed pumps, electrical heaters and gas heaters to help reduce energy by up to 50%. Additionally, each of the guest room doors automatically shuts off the cold-water valve when the guest leaves the door ajar, helping to minimize condensation.\n\nWATER RECYCLING: Grey water is lightly used water from day-to-day activities that is safe and effective to use in many landscaping efforts. The grey water recycling system at Hilton Garden Inn Dubai Mall of the Emirates has significantly reduced water consumption since its opening, helping to combat Dubai\u2019s water scarcity issue.\n\nWATER RISKS IN THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE\n\nWe map our hotels against the WWF-DEG Water Risk Filter and use the data to analyze current and future water risks across our portfolio. LightStay contains this analysis so that our hotel teams can understand and address water risks specific to their geolocation. Using the WWF-DEG Water Risk Filter, we evaluate factors that may potentially impact our current global hotel operations and expansion in specific geographic markets. We also study specific areas and river basins where our water stewardship initiatives would have the greatest value.\n\nOur water stewardship strategy focuses on the following areas of our value chain: hotels and guests; suppliers and services; and communities and watersheds.\n\nWater-saving laundry products\n\nWe encourage our hotels to opt for cleaning products that require lower energy and water use. For example, two of our hotels in India have piloted the use of a low temperature laundry program. Advanced by Diversey, which uses up to 28% less water and 24% less energy, and produces 28% less effluent waste. Based on the positive results of this pilot, we plan to roll out this program to further hotels in the region.\nReducing waste and advancing a circular economy\n\nWaste reduction, recycling, and food upcycling and donation are all critical components of creating a more environmentally friendly hospitality industry.\n\n35.7% of waste diverted from landfills (managed hotels only)\n\n2.3M+ bars of soap donated in 2022\n\nREDUCING WASTE ACROSS OUR VALUE CHAIN\n\nOur waste reduction strategy focuses on supply chain evaluation and sustainable sourcing initiatives, while taking steps to divert remaining waste from landfill through donation, recycling, composting and waste-to-energy incineration.\n\nWe have adopted a prevention, recovery and recycling strategy across our hotels in the Americas and EMEA regions and piloted the program in Asia Pacific.\n\nFOOD AS AN ASSET\n\nWe encourage our hotels to utilize the Hotel Kitchen Toolkit, developed by the World Wildlife Fund, which guides hotels through techniques for reducing food waste in every step of the food and beverage process: preventing food loss and waste before it arises through thoughtful menu planning, recovering wholesome, otherwise wasted food for donation, where possible; and channeling food scraps toward other uses such as animal feed and compost. All of this is supported by data tracking through LightStay to enable decision making.\n\nIn 2022, we also laid the groundwork for a new initiative with the World Resources Institute Cool Food program to leverage best practices, explore options for more plant-rich menus to reduce the climate impact of food served at our properties, and to reduce food waste.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, an estimated 17% of total global food production goes to waste, of which 5% comes from the food service industry. Estimates suggest that 8\u201310% of global greenhouse gas emissions are associated with food that is not consumed. Taking a firm stand, our Team Members have embraced waste reduction and food upcycling strategies in creative ways, all over the world. Here are just a few examples:\n\nNEW PILOT PROGRAM WITH GOODR: We began a pilot with Goodr, a Black-woman-owned company that collects unused food and delivers it to a national network of nonprofits. The pilot began at the Hilton Orlando, serving 590 meals to the local community, diverting 708 lbs. of food from landfill, and preventing 384 lbs. of carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nFOOD WASTE REPORTING SYSTEMS: Sixty-seven of our hotels in EMEA have adopted food waste reporting systems, such as Winnow, which leverages AI technology to help chefs accurately pinpoint food waste streams, cut costs and tailor purchasing decisions based on the data.\n\nIMPLEMENTING COMPOSTING: Hilton Seychelles Labriz Hotel has implemented a compost heap, the output of which helps to grow its on-site organic garden, adopted a stringent food waste\u2013monitoring effort, and engaged with a water-bottling plant to replace plastic water bottles. Other environmental efforts include using only recycled glass, tins and PET bottles.\n\nLeftover food shouldn\u2019t be wasted\n\nWaste reduction, recycling, and food upcycling and donation are all critical components of creating a more environmentally friendly hospitality industry.\n\n35.7% of waste diverted from landfills (managed hotels only)\n\n2.3M+ bars of soap donated in 2022\n\nREDUCING WASTE ACROSS OUR VALUE CHAIN\n\nOur waste reduction strategy focuses on supply chain evaluation and sustainable sourcing initiatives, while taking steps to divert remaining waste from landfill through donation, recycling, composting and waste-to-energy incineration.\n\nWe have adopted a prevention, recovery and recycling strategy across our hotels in the Americas and EMEA regions and piloted the program in Asia Pacific.\n\nFOOD AS AN ASSET\n\nWe encourage our hotels to utilize the Hotel Kitchen Toolkit, developed by the World Wildlife Fund, which guides hotels through techniques for reducing food waste in every step of the food and beverage process: preventing food loss and waste before it arises through thoughtful menu planning, recovering wholesome, otherwise wasted food for donation, where possible; and channeling food scraps toward other uses such as animal feed and compost.

Other environmental efforts include using only recycled glass, tins and PET bottles.\nPROGRESS IN REDUCING SINGLE-USE PLASTICS\n\nPlastic pollution threatens communities, environments and the destinations in which we operate. In 2022, we continued to focus on reducing single-use items through various programs launched in hotels and in partnership with local suppliers. Guests can expect most of our hotels to be free of miniature toiletries by the end of 2023. Our app-based Digital Key program saw greater adoption in 2022, as more guests chose to bypass the front desk and check in virtually.\n\nMany of our hotels around the world have implemented sustainable hydration solutions such as reusable drinking vessels, refill stations and closed loop bottling systems. Currently, more than 2,400 hotels have hydration stations offered for guests.\n\nKEEPING SOAP OUT OF LANDFILL\n\nWe are proud to have been the first hotel brand to make soap recycling a brand standard, and the first to set the commitment to send zero soap to landfill. We operate the largest soap recycling program in the hotel industry, with more than 80% of our portfolio enrolled, including all hotels in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nUsed soap from guest rooms is collected by our housekeeping teams and sent to our partners, including Clean the World, Soap Aid, Soap Cycling, and Sundara, which sanitize the soap and turn it into new bars for donation. Through our soap recycling partnership with Clean the World, we recycled our soap into more than 2.3 million bars that have been donated to those in need, diverting more than 211,000 pounds from landfill in 2022.\n\nWaste-to-product initiatives creating shared value with Diversey\n\nWe partner with international cleaning and sanitation company Diversey, Inc. throughout the Asia-Pacific region to help with various waste reduction and community improvement efforts. Our 2022 partnership highlights include:\n\n- **LINENS FOR LIFE:** This program repurposes discarded linen from hotels, including curtains, uniforms, bed sheets and tablecloths, into products that can be sold and used by the local community. Diversey\u2019s NGO partners create job opportunities for workers to design and sew these linens into items such as school uniforms, newborn baby swaddling cloth and COVID face coverings.\n\n- **PLASTIC SHREDS:** This program employs a creative process that turns plastic into smaller shreds that become downstream alternatives to gravel. Plastic pieces are \u2018entombed\u2019 into concrete pavements that can be used by communities to fill potholes and build carparks. A simple 2x1m pavement can entomb as much as 172 liters of shredded plastic chips, or 8,200 500-milliliter bottles, according to Diversey\u2019s research.\n\n- **COFFEE BRUQUES:** This program turns discarded coffee grounds into cleaner alternatives to charcoal, which can be used as fuel by communities or for the hotel\u2019s own kitchen needs.\n\n- **UPCYCLING IN REAL LIFE:** Hilton Luxor Resort & Spa\n\n  At Hilton Luxor Resort & Spa sustainable solutions and smart investments build on the positive impact the property creates. This property introduced two exciting concepts: using fabric laundry bags to eliminate the use of plastic materials and recycling discarded swimming pool floats that otherwise would have been throw away.\n\n- **HYDROPONIC FARMING:** Conrad Abu Dhabi Etihad Towers\n\n  As part of a strategy to support sustainability and protect the environment, Conrad Abu Dhabi Etihad Towers has achieved its goal of adopting a vertical hydroponic farm for zero waste. The technology relies on carefully planting each plant less than 100 meters from the hotel\u2019s Michelin-starred restaurants. As it boosts its ambition to become a zero-waste destination, the hotel\u2019s gardener will work with kitchen teams to ensure only specific amounts of each plant are grown, so they don\u2019t spoil or get thrown away.\nSocial Impact\n\nOur enduring role is to foster opportunity for people, including our Team Members and our neighbors in the destinations where we operate around the world. In addition, we bring urgent focus and committed action to the pursuit of diversity, equity & inclusion and to the protection of human rights.\nAt Hilton, we lead with culture and are fiercely committed to creating the world\u2019s best work environment. Understanding and integrating our Team Members\u2019 unique perspectives and voices\u2014along with those of our guests, owners, suppliers and partners\u2014is essential to cultivating our inclusive environment. We strive to reflect the global communities where we work, live and thrive.\n\nOver the last century, Hilton has curated exceptional experiences, extraordinary stays and memories to last a lifetime. We seek to build strong connections and make a lasting impact in our communities, whether by leading service initiatives, encouraging people to join our team, or inspiring their dreams.\n\nIn 2022, we enhanced our existing Travel with Purpose social goals to further commit to the areas where we can have the greatest impact, including supporting career opportunities, community impact, and responsible, inclusive conduct across our business.\n\n**RESPONDING TO THE UKRAINE CRISIS**\n\nOur hotels have always been a part of the fabric of the communities that we serve, and during times of crisis, Hilton is there to support our Team Members, guests and communities. In support of the Ukrainian people, Hilton Global Foundation made contributions to World Central Kitchen to provide hot meals within the borders as well as surrounding European countries. In addition, Project Hope served as a boots-on-the-ground partner, providing humanitarian assistance and emergency supplies to displaced people.\n\nHilton Prague and Hilton Prague Old Town\n\nHilton Prague and Hilton Prague Old Town have always worked closely together to support the community. After the conflict in Ukraine began, the hotels rallied to support Ukrainian refugees. From collecting donations, to housing and employing refugees and covering the costs of a children\u2019s summer camp, these two properties spread the light and warmth of hospitality to provide a helping hand at a time when Ukrainians needed it most.\n\nAs Chef de Cuisine of Estuary at Conrad Washington DC, Chef Ria Montes is excited to bring a new, innovative take on the seasonal flavors of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed.\nCelebrating our Team Members\n\nWe all want to be part of something bigger than ourselves and be appreciated for our contributions to a collective effort\u2014which is why we believe recognition is so important.\n\nRECOGNIZING TEAM MEMBERS\n\nOur Team Members are at the core of our success. Whether through our recognition resources or our signature recognition programs, we strive to celebrate our Team Members\u2019 accomplishments\u2014big and small. Our recognition website provides self-service, customizable resources including printable certificates and cards. To show our appreciation, we also recognize individuals throughout the year with programs such as our annual Team Member Appreciation Week\u2014a dedicated week to celebrate our employees around the world\u2014and Catch Me at My Best\u2014which encourages guests, managers and peers to recognize Team Members whose actions and attitudes embody our values. In 2022, more than 1.3 million Catch Me at My Best messages were sent.\n\nTwo of our most prestigious recognition programs are the CEO Light & Warmth Award and the Hospitality Heroes Award\u2014both of which we expanded in 2022. The CEO Light & Warmth Award is our company\u2019s top honor for Team Members who have brought our Purpose and Values to life. Individual winners receive $10,000, three free night stays, and diamond status for three years. Team winners receive $1,000 per Team Member. In 2022, we celebrated 15 individual winners and two teams. The Hospitality Heroes Award recognizes the true heroes among us who have made a lasting impact by acting in moments of crisis or helping to make a guest\u2019s dream come true. Winners receive a $300 cash prize. This year, we celebrated 56 winners out of thousands of nominations from more than 1,000 hotels across 87 countries.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always filled with incredible energy during Team Member Appreciation Week. It makes me feel proud to be appreciated for my work. When you love your job, it\u2019s the best gift you can give yourself.\u201d\n\nTeam Member in T\u00fcrkiye\n\nLinen Room Attendant in T\u00fcrkiye\n\nThrive at Hilton International Housekeeping Week\n\nAround the world, our housekeeping teams are at the heart of the unforgettable experiences we create for our guests. Our Team Members elevate housekeeping to an art form, such as the amazing towel art during our International Housekeeping Week celebration.\nEnabling our Team Members to Thrive at Hilton\n\nWe know that when our Team Members thrive, so do our guests and our communities. That is why we are committed to providing industry-leading programs that deliver a fully human experience and create the best, most inclusive home for our Team Members.\n\nINVESTING IN OUR TEAM MEMBERS\u2019 DEVELOPMENT\n\nAt Hilton, we are focused on building a Team Member experience that is rooted in continuous learning\u2014starting from day one. Whether it is learning the ropes during onboarding, building core service skills, or refining job skills, we offer a combination of curriculums that support Team Members in their roles today and prepare them for lifelong careers in hospitality.\n\nThrough Hilton University, our online learning platform, all Team Members have access to over 25,000 courses, providing the ability to explore new skills or expand their expertise. We know that leadership skills are important at every stage of someone\u2019s career. That is why all Team Members also have access to leadership development curriculums through our Lead@Hilton platform, which includes on-demand, self-paced content, such as a virtual series that delivers Harvard-led content aligned to critical capabilities identified for different levels of hospitality leaders.\n\nHilton\u2019s signature Leadership Development programs focus on building effective leaders across the enterprise to grow our bench strength. These programs provide opportunities for participants to develop key capabilities, form networks with senior leaders and enhance their business acumen.\n\nOur goal is to continuously upskill, reskill and multi-skill each Team Member, always seeking to set them up for development and growth within our company. We do this through our robust Job Skills training platform\u2014a consistent, one-stop location for our Team Members to locate digital training checklists, and mobile-enabled resources. We understand that not everyone learns in the same way, and some Team Member workdays are not conducive to sitting in front of a screen. For example, Job Skills training for Housekeeping Team Members includes audio guides in multiple languages that Team Members can listen to while completing a room cleaning at their hotel\u2014providing on-site, on-demand learning opportunities that are comfortable and accessible.\n\nWe are committed to investing in our Team Members\u2019 future. In May 2022, we proudly became the first in our industry to partner with Guild Education to provide U.S.-based Team Members with debt-free, continuing education opportunities. From day one of employment, Team Members in the U.S. can choose among Guild\u2019s over 70 programs\u2014including professional certificates, college preparatory classes, high school completion courses, and English language learning. This program roster has been curated to help Team Members learn, lead and grow in areas that cultivate personal fulfillment and support the needs of our business.\n\nGuild continues to pick up momentum with 2,753 total profiles completed, 1,479 applications submitted, 454 Team Members enrolled, and 91 graduates (as of 12/31/2022).\n\n\u201cI would like to go to college for a hospitality degree. I came to the United States for a better opportunity and to develop in my education. Hilton, thank you for the opportunity for a better life.\u201d\n\nMerarys Alcantara\nHousekeeping Supervisor, Hilton Miami Airport\n\nMaximizing internal mobility\n\nMaximizing internal mobility is critical to build robust talent pipeline. In 2022, 56% of Global Corporate Director and above roles were filled internally and 50% of U.S. Owned & Managed General Manager roles were filled internally.\nSupporting our Team Members\u2019 holistic wellbeing\n\nHilton\u2019s commitment to helping Team Members thrive extends to all aspects of physical, emotional, financial and social wellbeing. We provide a variety of programs to support our Team Members personally and professionally.\n\nPRIORITIZING HEALTH AND WELLNESS\n\nWe provide Team Members a space to openly address mental wellbeing through a variety of resources including over 100 leader testimonials. In 2023, we expanded our mental health conversations around mental health and ways to seek clinical support if needed. We also offer free counseling sessions to our Team Members and their families through our Employee Assistance Program and a free, dedicated on-site counselor available to our Corporate Team Members. In addition, we partnered with Thrive Global to provide all Team Members access to an app-based experience, loaded with practical micro-steps and tools to track progress. We have found that this initiative is resonating with our Team Members who report an increased comfort level in talking about their mental wellbeing with their managers.\n\nIn 2022, we built on the success of our mental wellbeing initiative and launched the Care For All platform. This extended our support to Team Members beyond their own self-care and enabled them to better care for others. Through our new publicly available Care for All platform, Team Members and their loved ones can explore articles, podcasts and eCourses, organized by type of care. As we are often not the sole caregivers in our lives, this platform is available publicly so Team Members can share with friends and family members who are supporting them.\n\nAs a first for the hospitality industry, all full-time and part-time Team Members in the U.S. and the U.K. also have no-cost access to an on-site counselor available to our Corporate Team Members. In addition, we partnered with Thrive Global to provide all Team Members access to an app-based experience, loaded with practical micro-steps and tools to track progress. We have found that this initiative is resonating with our Team Members who report an increased comfort level in talking about their mental wellbeing with their managers.\n\nSUPPORTING CURRENT AND FUTURE WORKING PARENTS\n\nStarting and growing a family can be one of the most exciting experiences one can have, but we know it can also be stressful. That is why we offer a suite of programs, from leave benefits to educational resources, targeted at working parents.\n\nThrough our partnership with Thrive Global, we offer an eCourse, Thriving Parenthood, which provides all Team Members globally with resources ranging from family-building to re-integrating into work.\n\nStarting in January 2023, U.S.-based Team Members seeking family-building and fertility management services can connect to a network of high-quality fertility specialists through our new insurance benefits partner Progyny, which helps everyone to navigate the process and provide access to the most sought after fertility clinics across the U.S.\n\nEXCEPTIONAL FAMILY BENEFITS\n\nOur Adoption Assistance Program for U.S. Team Members reimburses qualified adoption expenses\u2014up to $10,000 per eligible child, with no limit to the number of adoptions. Bonding time is one of the most important times\u2014and because of this, our Maternity and Parental Leave Programs provide eligible Team Members with paid time off to recover after having a baby and to spend time with their new family. Birth parents get 12 weeks of paid time off. Non-birth parents including adoptive parents get four weeks of paid time off.\n\nTo support U.S. Team Members who need to travel for work, we offer Milk Stork which makes it easy for business travelers to ship or carry breast milk home, at no cost. Additionally, through our partnership with Bright Horizons, corporate Team Members can reserve high-quality, in-home emergency backup care for children, pets, adults or elder relatives.\n\nCREATING TIME TO RECHARGE\n\nWe recognize the importance of encouraging our Team Members to take time away from work. In 2023, we expanded our Thrive Sabbatical program to two offerings, both of which give Team Members the time and resources to Thrive. Twenty Team Members will be selected\u201410 from each of the following experiences:\n\nTHRIVE SABBATICAL \u201cGIVE A DREAM\u201d:\n\nTeam Members will receive one month off and $5,000.

We are proud to create a culture where all are welcomed and celebrated.\n\nTo achieve our vision of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I), we have set ambitious commitments, built accountability mechanisms into our business, established strong partnerships, and developed targeted training, hiring, and work culture development programs to cultivate talent from all backgrounds.\n\nA FIRM COMMITMENT TO AN AMBITIOUS AGENDA\n\nAs part of our DE&I efforts, we released our representation commitments and shared workforce demographics on our diversity website. By the end of 2027, we are committed to achieving global Gender Parity and 25% U.S. Ethnic Diversity at our corporate leadership levels. By publicly sharing this data, which is updated annually, we encourage transparency and accountability, and ensure we remain focused on making progress.\n\nWe strive to create an environment where every Team Member can feel at home. Our leaders play an active role in how we bring our bold agenda to life, and they are committed to building an inclusive organization through effective talent management practices. Because of this, part of leader compensation is tied to progress against our diversity representation goals. To ensure inclusivity and to remove bias throughout our U.S. recruiting and hiring process, we strive for external candidate slates representing 50% Gender Diversity and 33% Ethnic Diversity.\n\nCULTIVATING AN INCLUSIVE WORK CULTURE\n\nWe invest in several programs that celebrate diverse backgrounds and help to create the most inclusive home for our Team Members. These include allyship training, our Team Member Resource Groups, Courageous Conversations mentorship, and benefits that bolster human relationships such as paid parental leave.\n\nTeam Member Resource Groups\n\nOur Team Member Resource Groups are voluntary groups that build communities across our workforce, provide professional opportunities to Team Members, and foster innovation in our business. This year, we hosted heritage months to celebrate, share, and reflect on our diversity.\n\n| Team Member Resource Groups |\n|-----------------------------|\n| Abilities | Asian and Pacific Islander (API) | Black | Pride | Women |\n| EMEA Ethnic | Hispanic/Latinx | Military | Generations |\nELEVATING AWARENESS AND ALLYSHIP THROUGH TRAINING\nA great place to work creates a sense of belonging and acceptance\u2014regardless of background, ethnicity, age, ability, gender, or sexual orientation. We train for that.\n\nHotel and corporate Team Members are required to complete annual training as part of Hilton\u2019s commitment to an inclusive and respectful environment for all. This includes:\n\n1. DEI/UNCONSCIOUS BIAS TRAINING to build awareness of the implicit bias all humans have and how to overcome this to create an inclusive environment for all. This includes our Hilton-designed, bespoke training program, Creating Intentionally Inclusive Guest Experience. Training is based around hospitality scenarios, so our Team Members are best prepared to relate and apply what they\u2019ve learned.\n\n2. PREVENTING HUMAN TRAFFICKING TRAINING to learn the signs of human trafficking for sexual or labor exploitation and know how to take action.\n\n3. CODE OF CONDUCT TRAINING to reinforce our value of integrity and maintain the highest ethical standards.\n\n4. HARASSMENT-FREE WORKPLACE TRAINING to create a positive environment for all, avoiding actions which create a hostile workplace. This work is never done. We remain committed to listening, learning, and leading to create a welcoming and hospitable experience for all Team Members and our guests.\n\nEXTERNAL RECOGNITION\nWe are proud to be recognized for our Hilton culture.\n\nGreat Place to Work (GPTW)\n#1 Ranking, 2021 DiversityInc\nTop 50 Companies for Diversity\nInducted into Top 50 Companies for Diversity Hall of Fame\n#1 Ranking for ESG by DiversityInc\n\nGreat Place to Work (GPTW)\n#2 World\u2019s Best Workplace\n#1 Best Place to Work in six countries\nRanking in 29 countries and certified in 25 others\nGPTW & Fortune\n#2 Best Place to Work in the U.S.\n\nFIFTH CONSECUTIVE YEAR\n#1 Best Place to Work for Women in the U.S.\n\nCourageous Conversations\nWe believe our team is stronger for the diverse experiences and perspectives each of us brings to the table.

These live, candid conversations focus on a range of topics, including race, gender, age, physical and mental ability, allyship, and a host of other important issues. The program, which began in 2020, has included internal stakeholders as well as external thought leaders. Thousands of Team Members have taken advantage of the live and recorded sessions.\n\nSharing the Diverse Perspectives of our Team Members\nWe amplify our Team Members\u2019 voices on our careers blog and social media channels to celebrate the rich diversity of our Hilton family and the inclusive environment we are fostering around the world.\n\n\u201cDuring Travel with Purpose Week, our clients said our work with Courageous Conversations for outweighs any other initiatives we\u2019ve undertaken.

That\u2019s what, to me, hospitality is about.\u201d\n\nBea Jaramillo\nHilton Austin, HR Director\nEXPANDING OUR TEAM MEMBER ASSISTANCE FUND\n\nHilton was founded on the belief that our hospitality has the power to be a force for good in this world and, with the mission to provide financial relief, globally, to individuals impacted by natural disaster, personal hardship and crisis instances, the Team Member Assistance Fund (TMAF) is an extension of that commitment.\n\nIn August 2022, Hilton expanded its TMAF program to provide further assistance to its Team Members. In addition to continuing to support Team Members following disasters, the expanded program now enables the TMAF to support those experiencing undue financial hardship due to an unexpected personal circumstance such as the unexpected death of a spouse. Over its nine-year history, the TMAF has distributed nearly $3M to 3,600+ Team Members.\n\nTeam Members Supported by the Team Member Assistance Fund in 2022\n\n| Region   | Number of Team Members |\n|----------|------------------------|\n| Americas | 9%                     |\n| EMEA     | 24%                    |\n| APAC     | 66%                    |\n\nBY TYPE OF HARDSHIP\n\n- Personal Hardship: 2%\n- Natural Disaster: 9%\n- Crisis: 15%\n- Hotel Hardship: 74%\n\nBUILDING OYSTER REEFS IN LOUISIANA\n\nWetlands in Louisiana are disappearing, and rising water is eroding delicate shorelines. Team Members from the Hilton New Orleans Riverside partnered with the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana to incorporate recycled oyster shells (some from Hilton restaurants) to build oyster reefs. Not only does this keep shells out of landfill, but it also helps to slow coastal land loss.\n\nPLASTIC PREVENTION IN U.A.E.\n\nThe DoubleTree by Hilton Ras Al Khaimah Team, in partnership with Ras Al Khaimah Waste Management, conducted a beach cleanup to prevent plastic and other waste from getting washed into the sea.\n\nCULTIVATING SUSTAINABLE DAILY HABITS\n\nHilton Queenstown Resort and Spa and DoubleTree by Hilton Queenstown implemented an environmental challenge for Team Members to complete 10 tasks over a week, including carpooling, having two-minute showers and eating vegetarian meals. The Team Member with the most points was named as the Sustainability Queen/King.\n\nSupporting Team Members After Hurricane Ian\n\nIn September 2022, the southeastern region of the United States was hit with a Category 4 hurricane, Hurricane Ian, which caused widespread damage across many states including Florida, South Carolina, and North Carolina. For over 100 Team Members in need, the TMAF was able to provide evacuation support and, in the aftermath of this devastating storm, support the rebuilding and repairing of homes.\n\nDISASTER RELIEF\n\nWith our broad global footprint, hotels in the community are often the best positioned to provide support when a disaster hits. Through our Hilton Global Foundation and strategic partnerships with local organizations, we provide disaster relief and help rebuild infrastructure for communities to become more resilient.\n\nIn 2022, we responded to crises and disasters across the globe, including war, weather events and the COVID-19 pandemic. The HGF granted $110,000 to World Central Kitchen and Project HOPE, for example, to support on-the-ground relief efforts in response to the Ukraine Refugee Crisis and Hurricane Ian in Florida.\n\nEXPANDING OUR TEAM MEMBER ASSISTANCE FUND\n\nHilton was founded on the belief that our hospitality has the power to be a force for good in this world and, with the mission to provide financial relief, globally, to individuals impacted by natural disaster, personal hardship and crisis instances, the Team Member Assistance Fund (TMAF) is an extension of that commitment.\n\nIn August 2022, Hilton expanded its TMAF program to provide further assistance to its Team Members.

The HGF granted $110,000 to World Central Kitchen and Project HOPE, for example, to support on-the-ground relief efforts in response to the Ukraine Refugee Crisis and Hurricane Ian in Florida.\nSupplier diversity at work\n\nWe believe that the strength of our business and the trusted reputation of our brands is rooted in our efforts to advance the fight for economic empowerment.\n\nFostering Authentic Supplier Diversity\n\nOur industry-leading Supplier Diversity Program, ranked as #13 by DiversityInc in 2022, is the cornerstone of our company\u2019s commitment to experience a world that is bigger than ourselves. Since the program\u2019s inception 10 years ago, we have made meaningful connections with more than 2,400 small, disadvantaged or minority, veteran, LGBTQ, women and disabled-owned businesses. To date, our supplier spend with these valued partners has nearly exceeded $334 million.\n\nWe believe our supplier community should reflect the diverse communities in which we all live, work and travel. As such, we leverage the Supplier Diversity Program to forge strategic partnerships, host informative events, and offer valuable resources to overlooked businesses. HSM works closely with partners and collaborators to identify new opportunities to expand our network of certified diverse suppliers and to increase our engagement with other like-minded organizations.\n\nWe know a more diverse Hilton means a stronger Hilton, and we seized many opportunities last year to expand our focus on diverse suppliers while extending the reach of our customers. We take seriously our responsibility to authentically promote inclusion, support and respect in a global community that grows more diverse by the day.\n\nLocal Sourcing\n\nIn 2022, our Europe and Middle East regions identified local sourcing as a strategic opportunity. Our hotels can have a powerful impact in their communities by investing in products from local artisans, farmers and small businesses while enhancing the experience for their guests. For example, hotels may commission artwork from local artisans, procure food and beverage ingredients from local farms or fisheries, or feature local products in hotels.\n\nIn partnership with agri-tech platform Fresh On Table, the UAE HSM and Food & Beverage teams committed to sourcing 350 tons of local produce for its hotels. To meet this goal, 22 properties across the country committed to procure a minimum of 19 ingredients exclusively from UAE farms\u2014with Fresh on Table acting as the catalyst to source fresh fruit, vegetables, dairy and poultry from farms across the Emirates. The team purchased no fewer than 173 line items across 32 properties, equivalent to 400 tons\u2014with an impactful saving of nearly 9 million kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent and more than 127 million food miles throughout the year. Furthermore, the successful launch of a local egg program across the Emirates has resulted in nearly 6 million eggs being served to Hilton guests, sourced from Emirates Poultry Farm.\n\nData Tracking for Insights\n\nHilton understands the importance of data tracking and reporting as the means to quantify our goals. In Europe, the HSM team piloted a detailed evaluation of local sourcing in Austria, Germany and the Netherlands, reviewing 13 suppliers and more than 10,000 unique items in total. The team discovered that bakery items were the most locally sourced product category in these countries, with 70% of items sourced within their respective countries. Meat was locally sourced at 53% on average, and produce was calculated at 45%. Fish was identified as the strongest area of opportunity for local sourcing.\n\nAcross the three countries, the current local sourcing average was 13%, with potential for improvement. This data and these insights will be leveraged to influence future decisions to strengthen local supplier enablement and reduce our carbon footprint.\n\nCelebrating Local Culture\n\nDoubleTree by Hilton, Weerawila Rajawarna Resort\n\nThe newly built resort stimulates Sri Lankan skills and craftsmanship by interweaving the environment and local culture of the village of Weerawila. Villagers are hired to prepare local food such as \u201choppers,\u201d while fermented buffalo milk, a local delicacy, is featured in the menus. Handicrafts made by locals from natural plants and weeds found along the canals are given to guests as mementos.\n\n* Wages are determined based on NAICS code of the supplier.\n** Total output based on national economic multiplier.\nProtecting human rights and freedoms\n\nAs a business of people serving people, protecting human rights is essential.\n\nOur universal respect for inherent freedoms is outlined in our Human Rights Principles, aligned with the United Nations Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). Our requirements are further established in our Code of Conduct and Responsible Sourcing Policy, and include the prohibition of all forms of forced labor, bonded labor, child labor, slave labor, human trafficking, and recruitment fees from within the Hilton value chain. Our latest Slavery and Trafficking Statement describes our approach to human rights in greater detail.\n\nADDRESSING RISKS IN OUR HOTEL OPERATIONS\n\nWe recognize that hotels around the world are at risk of being used by traffickers for commercial sexual exploitation and that labor exploitation can occur in our own operations and supply chain. To mitigate these challenges, we are focused on mapping our risks, educating stakeholders, maintaining updated policies, establishing effective grievance mechanisms and collaborating with leading organizations.\n\nMapping our risks\n\nWe have mapped all of our hotels and supply chain against external human risk indices from Verisk-Maplecroft that inform us on both our operational and sourcing risks. Our Safety and Security team also tracks human rights risks, such as risks of human trafficking for all our managed and franchised hotels. Having an accurate assessment helps us focus our efforts in areas with the highest risks.\n\nMitigating risks in our development pipeline\n\nWhile Hilton does not own or manage the construction of our hotels, we provide our owners and business partners with tools to identify and manage human rights risk within their own supply chains. For all new countries we enter, we conduct country-level due diligence and develop appropriate risk mitigation plans to protect against human rights risks, including unfair labor practices, across our new property developments.\n\nEDUCATING OUR EMPLOYEES\n\nWe strive to raise awareness about threats to human rights within Hilton operations to avert risks of forced labor, trafficking, modern slavery, or other human rights issues. In 2022, more than 294,000 managed and franchised hotel Team Members were trained in the following key areas:\n\nHUMAN TRAFFICKING: Since 2011, we have remained proud supporters of ECPAT and signatories to the ECPAT Tourism Child-Protection Code of Conduct. All hotel-based Team Members must complete ECPAT\u2019s preventing human trafficking training on an annual basis. Our program raises awareness of human-trafficking processes and signs, empowers our Team Members to be vigilant and communicative, and highlights resources that can be used for reporting potential activity.\n\nMODERN SLAVERY: We also developed the hospitality industry\u2019s first tailored training in 2018 to identify \u201cKey Risks of Modern Slavery in Labor Sourcing,\u201d and donated the training to members of the Sustainable Hospitality Alliance. Within Hilton, this training is available to all Team Members, and is mandatory for Team Members in EMEA directly involved in recruitment and outsourcing.\n\nIN 2022\n\n98% of managed hotels completed Diversity & Inclusion/Unconscious Bias and creating a Harassment-Free Workplace training\n\n100% of managed and franchised hotels mapped for numerous human rights risks, including modern slavery, women\u2019s & girls\u2019 rights, child labor, forced labor, freedom of assembly, indigenous people\u2019s rights and human trafficking\n\n98% of managed hotels completed training on preventing human trafficking\n\nSupporting trafficking survivors\n\nIn 2022, the Hilton Global Foundation announced a donation commitment of $500,000 toward the American Hotel & Lodging Foundation\u2019s No Room for Trafficking\u2019s Survivors Fund over the next three years, growing the fund by 50%. The program will equip community-based organizations with the resources they need to engage and support trafficking survivors\u2014from direct financial support of their short-term, baseline needs to career-related support that can set them up for stability and success.\n\nIt\u2019s a Penalty Campaign\n\nIn 2022, Hilton continued to work with It\u2019s a Penalty to advance our shared goal of protecting human rights through educational outreach at high-profile sporting events and campaigns globally. In June, Hilton Birmingham Metropole welcomed more than 100 guests including media and sports ambassadors to a launch event ahead of the start of the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. As part of Hilton\u2019s support for the important campaign, Team Members at the hotel completed specialist training to spot the signs of human trafficking.\n\nSimilarly, in January 2023, Hilton\u2019s Safety and Security Team, along with It\u2019s a Penalty, hosted a training and media event to prepare for the influx of travelers during the Super Bowl outside of Phoenix. The Arizona Biltmore donated a ballroom to the event, welcoming more than 25 local Hilton hotels and training 125 Team Members.\nAdvancing a responsible, sustainable supply chain\n\nWith global operations spanning 123 countries and territories, we recognize the importance and opportunity to drive positive economic, environmental and social impact across our supply chain.\n\nHilton has ambitious supply chain goals to advance responsible and sustainable sourcing. We directly engage with suppliers on their ESG strategy, conducting due diligence upstream and downstream to ensure our partners are committed to responsible business and sustainable operations. We leverage our Hilton Responsible Sourcing Policy by including it in all supplier contracts and requiring all companies to meet these minimum ESG standards.\n\nASSESSING SUPPLIER ESG RISK AND PERFORMANCE\n\nOur global procurement and supply chain services team, Hilton Supply Management (HSM), engages a collaborative platform, EcoVadis, to assess, track and improve our suppliers\u2019 sustainability performance. In particular, we prioritize evaluating our high-spend and high-risk suppliers, concentrating on their business practices related to environment, labor and human rights, and ethics.\n\n\u2018High spend\u2019 includes suppliers with whom HSM\u2019s contracted annual spend is greater than $1 million USD. \u2018High risk\u2019 includes suppliers providing Hilton with labor, rubber, cocoa, packaging, paper, textiles, and/or crops (e.g., tea, coffee, soy, palm oil, rice, cotton, bananas).\n\nHigh-spend and high-risk suppliers are required, by contract, to meet Hilton\u2019s EcoVadis program and meet threshold requirements. HSM has also started to take into consideration the ESG performance of suppliers in the \u2018request for proposal\u2019 process (typically receiving a 5\u201310% weighting of the overall score).\n\nIn 2022, we launched a pilot with MindClick to evaluate the social and environmental performance of vendors and their specified products across focused-service and all suite brands within three product categories.

In particular, we prioritize evaluating our high-spend and high-risk suppliers, concentrating on their business practices related to environment, labor and human rights, and ethics.\n\n\u2018High spend\u2019 includes suppliers with whom HSM\u2019s contracted annual spend is greater than $1 million USD. \u2018High risk\u2019 includes suppliers providing Hilton with labor, rubber, cocoa, packaging, paper, textiles, and/or crops (e.g., tea, coffee, soy, palm oil, rice, cotton, bananas).\n\nHigh-spend and high-risk suppliers are required, by contract, to meet Hilton\u2019s EcoVadis program and meet threshold requirements. HSM has also started to take into consideration the ESG performance of suppliers in the \u2018request for proposal\u2019 process (typically receiving a 5\u201310% weighting of the overall score).\n\nAs a supplier, Hilton undergoes EcoVadis sustainability assessment annually.

Everyone\u2014from our CEO and board to Team Members\u2014joins forces to integrate responsible hospitality principles into the way we do business. To keep that promise, we consistently measure our progress toward our goals and use that data to assess risk and drive decision making.\nThe Hilton Team in the United Arab Emirates practicing responsible sourcing of food.\n\nBOARD COMPOSITION AND INDEPENDENCE\n\nEveryone at Hilton is responsible for integrating the Travel with Purpose philosophy into our business and, to make this happen, we put structures in place to leverage multiple governance mechanisms.\n\nThe board of directors directs and oversees the management of our business and affairs in a manner consistent with the best interests of Hilton and its stockholders.\n\nAs the decision-making body, they select and oversee our members of senior management and exercise direct oversight of strategic risks. Our CEO Chris Nassetta serves as the only executive member. The lead independent director serves as a liaison between the CEO and independent and non-management directors\u2014whereas 78% of directors are independent.\n\nThe board is supported by a fully independent Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating & ESG Committee.\n\nThe board conducts annual self-evaluations to determine whether it and its committees are functioning effectively as required by applicable law and the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The board also periodically considers the mix of skills and experience that directors bring to the board to assess its overall strength. Each committee conducts an annual self-evaluation that compares the performance of the committee with the requirements of its written charter, and the committees report the results of these assessments to the board.\n\nFurther information on our board composition can be found in the Governance section of our 2022 Proxy Statement and in our Corporate Governance Guidelines.\nHilton integrates Travel with Purpose into our business using multiple governance mechanisms including policies, committees and networks.\n\n**Board of Directors**\nSets strategic direction, oversees ESG performance, reviews the ESG strategy on an annual and as-needed basis, and ensures the business is managed ethically and responsibly.\n\n**Board Nominating and ESG Committee**\nReviews and assesses the ESG strategy, practices and policies on a quarterly basis, and makes recommendations to the board as appropriate.\n\n**CEO and Executive Committee**\nCEO is accountable for ESG-related issues and decisions.

These Team Members make a special commitment to advancing our 2030 goals across the enterprise. Champions hold a wide breadth of responsibilities, from organizing events to supporting ESG-related activities such as Earth Week or Travel with Purpose Week.\nOur approach to advocacy and public policy\n\nWe work with industry associations to influence policymaking to help us reach our corporate objectives and Travel with Purpose Goals.\n\nWE ARE THE COMPANY WE KEEP\n\nHilton and our association partners work together to monitor and shape global legislative and regulatory issues. In 2022, we joined advocacy efforts to advance legislation related to ESG topics including:\n\n- Preventing human trafficking\n- Expansion and adoption of EV charging stations\n- Tax policy to support energy efficiency upgrades to our hotels\n- Immigration and visa reform\n- Food waste\n- Plastics reduction\n- Skills training and apprenticeship programs\n- DE&I\n- Greenhouse gas emissions disclosures and reporting\n- Human rights\n\nAs a member of the U.S. Travel Sustainable Coalition and AHLA\u2019s Sustainability Committee, we have a leadership role in setting our industry\u2019s sustainability goals. With this ethos in mind, we continue to engage with our industry trade partners on removing barriers to cross-border travel, jumpstarting business travel and increasing funding for destination marketing organizations, among other priorities.\n\nIn 2022, our President and CEO Chris Nassetta served on the U.S. Travel and Tourism Advisory Board (TTAB) advising the Secretary of Commerce on government policies and programs that impact the U.S. travel and tourism industry. TTAB contributed directly to shaping the 2022 National Travel and Tourism Strategy which included a goal of reducing travel and tourism\u2019s impact on climate change. Beginning in 2023, Mr. Nassetta assumed the role of National Chair of the U.S. Travel Association, further amplifying Hilton\u2019s role in shaping the future of the industry. Hilton also engages globally with our industry\u2019s trade associations, including the Hotel Association of Canada, UKHospitality, and the World Travel & Tourism Council, to advance our advocacy agenda and ESG goals.\n\nIn 2022, Hilton paid $313,832 in dues associated with lobbying in the U.S. to the trade associations in the table to the right. All payments are publicly disclosed, along with political activity, on Hilton\u2019s Investor Relations website and updated semiannually.\n\nFor the second year in a row, Hilton was named a 2022 Trendsetter in the CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability, a recognition reserved for companies that score 90 points or higher on the index.\n\nReleased annually by the Center for Political Accountability (CPA) and the Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, the index measures political disclosure and accountability policies and practices for election-related spending by S&P 500 companies, including political spending policies and board oversight.\n\nChris Nassetta at the U.S. Travel Association\u2019s Q1 Travel Outlook Media Roundtable, held at Waldorf Astoria Washington DC.\nPartnerships\n\nOur partnerships with key trade associations, business coalitions, and NGOs help us to amplify our impact and make collective progress on our shared goals.\n\nIn 2022, our Public Affairs team advocated for policies to address a tight labor market. This includes supporting incremental and comprehensive immigration reform to ensure we have a strong pipeline of talent to help hotels meet their workforce needs. Through our engagement with IFA and AHLA, we highlighted the benefits of franchising as well as the benefits of working in hospitality, including a diverse workforce and opportunities for career growth.\n\nWe also advocated for the easing of travel restrictions, including the reopening of international travel and the removal of the pre-departure COVID-19 testing requirement for inbound travelers to the U.S. Together with our partners, we assisted in the advocacy efforts that secured $250 million for Brand USA\u2014the nation\u2019s destination marketing organization\u2014to bring back visitors now that travel has resumed and support our industry\u2019s full recovery.\n\nAccomplishing big-picture goals such as these is no small feat. Hilton needs the support of many international organizations for our mutual economic success, and we engage with the valuable partners included on this page on a routine basis.\n\nHotel del Coronado\u2019s Ocean Explorers Program allows kids to explore tidepools as a beach activity.\nPolicies and reporting: ethical conduct matters\n\nWe hold ourselves and our partners to the highest ethical standards. We are committed to pursuing the most responsible business practices, acting with integrity, and managing risk, with appropriate board oversight.\n\nA CULTURE OF INTEGRITY\n\nOur ethics and compliance program underpins our entire organization. Our Code of Conduct, which defines our responsibilities to our stakeholders and guides our decision making, is applicable to all Team Members, officers and directors of Hilton, and to the Team Members of all hotels owned, operated or managed by Hilton. All Team Members must complete training on the Code of Conduct and must adhere to following its principles and policies.\n\nTeam Members are expected to report suspected misconduct and are encouraged to do so through the Hilton Hotline, available online and by telephone 24/7. The Hotline is run by an independent company. Team Members are allowed to report concerns anonymously unless otherwise required by law. Hilton takes steps to protect the confidentiality of anyone who makes a good faith report of an actual or suspected violation to the extent reasonably possible. We encourage Team Members to raise concerns about potential violations of our Code of Conduct, including human trafficking or modern slavery.\n\nAny alleged failures to comply with the Code of Conduct are investigated and disciplinary action is taken as appropriate, up to and including termination. The Hotline also is available externally to suppliers, business partners, consumers and community members. Hilton\u2019s Global Compliance team is responsible for conducting intake of all Hotline reports.\n\nANTI-CORRUPTION AND BRIBERY\n\nOur Code of Conduct explicitly prohibits bribery and corruption, and our Anti-Corruption Policy provides our Team Members with additional detailed guidance regarding the requirements of anti-bribery laws applicable to Hilton, bribery risk areas specific to Hilton business activities, and the responsibilities of Team Members to prevent and report potential bribery.\n\nOur Group Finance, Legal Compliance, Internal Audit, and Risk functions oversee compliance with our anti-corruption and bribery standards, including monitoring and investigating Hilton Hotline matters. Risk-based Internal Audits and other related governance activities are performed at hotels and corporate offices in the U.S., Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Additionally, we conduct background checks on all prospective partners.\n\nAll Corporate Team Members, General Managers and senior Team Members are expected to actively support anti-corruption policies and practices at corporate offices and properties globally. Certifications of compliance with the Code of Conduct are obtained from all locations annually.\n\nDATA PRIVACY AND CYBERSECURITY\n\nHilton is committed to delivering the highest levels of customer service, which includes respecting our customers\u2019 privacy and protecting personal information. Our Global Privacy Statement describes how we collect, use and disclose personal information. Our Data Protection Officer, who is dedicated to addressing privacy concerns, sits within Hilton\u2019s Legal Compliance and Privacy team.\n\nTo protect our customers\u2019 and Team Members\u2019 personal data, Hilton Team Members are required to complete annual cybersecurity and privacy training courses. We engage with third parties to conduct periodic assessments on our cybersecurity at both the corporate and property level, and to perform on-site breach simulation exercises. We also undergo audits to ensure our technology environment remains aligned with the ISO 27001 security control requirements.\n\nAs a service provider and merchant under the Payment Card Industry\u2019s (PCI) Data Security Standards (DSS), we undergo an annual comprehensive third-party audit to process billions of dollars in credit card payments. Additionally, the Audit Committee assists the board in monitoring cybersecurity risk by receiving quarterly reports from our Technology team that cover, among other things, our information security framework, threat assessment, response readiness, and training efforts.\nEVALUATING AND MANAGING RISK ACROSS OUR BUSINESS\n\nThe board of directors has overall responsibility for risk oversight, which includes understanding material risks, management steps to address these risks, and appropriate levels of risk for our company.\n\n- The Audit Committee assists the board in fulfilling its risk oversight responsibilities by regularly reviewing our accounting, reporting and financial practices, including our financial statements, administrative and financial controls, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and our enterprise risk management program.\n\n- The Compensation Committee assists the board by overseeing and evaluating risks related to compensation structure and programs, including the formulation, administration and regulatory compliance with respect to compensation matters, and coordinating succession planning discussions.\n\n- The Nominating & ESG Committee assists the board by overseeing and evaluating programs and risks associated with board organization, membership and structure, corporate governance, and ESG matters. In addition, our board receives quarterly detailed ESG performance reviews from management.\n\nEVALUATING ESG-RELATED RISKS\n\nTo evaluate ESG-related risks, we map 100% of our hotels and pipeline countries against a series of external environmental and social risk indices that are updated at least annually. Information from these external indices is embedded in LightStay to help every hotel understand the key priority areas in its local operating environment and community.\n\nMaterial ESG risks, including risks related to climate change, environmental impact, social impact, human rights, and ethics, fraud and corruption are integrated in Hilton\u2019s Enterprise Risk Management Process.\n\nIn addition, we conduct an internal Global Enterprise Risk Survey, which is distributed to more than 300 Hilton leaders. The Executive Committee, board of directors, and Audit Committee use its findings to inform enterprise-wide strategic planning. Health and safety risks management systems are utilized across all managed hotels and corporate offices and made available to franchised properties.\n\nBased on the survey results, the ERM team engages with risk owners throughout the organization and with the Enterprise Risk Committee. The results of this risk assessment inform our enterprise-wide strategic planning.\n\nMITIGATING RISK IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN\n\nHilton is committed to promoting and protecting human rights across our supply chain and in countries where we operate. Hilton has developed and piloted an ESG and human rights due diligence program to encourage vendors to meet Hilton\u2019s standards and maintain those standards during the contract term.\n\nVendors are required to comply with Hilton\u2019s Responsible Sourcing Policy, which includes our Human Rights Principles. We are dedicated to eradicating any form of forced labor and human trafficking, and we partner with cross-industry networks to advance international human rights.\n\nOur procurement team, Hilton Supply Management, thoroughly assesses products before selecting them for use in our hotels. This includes reviewing the ESG performance of our suppliers and products.\nPROVIDING EFFECTIVE SAFETY AND SECURITY PROGRAMS\n\nAs part of our commitment to safe and healthy workplaces, Team Members undergo training in workplace safety, security, fire safety, food hygiene and emergency procedures applicable to their regions. All hotels are audited against strict Fire Life Safety Brand Standards, which ensure a safe environment for all who stay, visit or work at our properties. Our managed properties have access to a library of custom-made training courses, available in the School of Safety and Security, while our franchised properties receive pertinent guidance during times of crisis. In addition to a wide range of training resources, managed hotels are able to access a wealth of guidance, procedures and checklists, created by industry experts to reduce the likelihood of accidents.\n\nSAFETY IN A GLOBAL CRISIS\n\nPrior to the conflict in Ukraine, Hilton was monitoring the growing threat, using a wide range of intelligence tools to prepare contingency measures. Our Team Members and properties in Ukraine received extensive guidance before and during the conflict allowing us to facilitate temporary hotel closures and expatriate evacuations.\n\nHilton communicates with properties using a customized crisis communication app, Konexus Hilton Alert, which is loaded with step-by-step guidance. This app enables hotels to rapidly escalate an emergency response on property, alerting key corporate stakeholders to initiate high-level safety and rescue procedures. Corporate leaders can also use the tool to poll hotels during a crisis (e.g., an earthquake), generating a rapid assessment of which properties are affected and require assistance.\n\nResponding to security threats in Papua New Guinea\n\nRecently, civil unrest occurred in the city of Port Moresby, capital of Papua New Guinea, following the announcement of elections and a subsequent declaration of a state of emergency. After our safety and security team at Hilton Port Moresby received reports of rioting within local community hubs and universities, and social media was flooded with violent imagery, the team initiated a lockdown in response to the violence, communicating clearly with hotel Team Members, and providing temporary accommodation to those who could not leave the compound as a result of the lockdown. We also facilitated the safe transportation of inbound guests from the airport due to the ongoing rioting. Throughout the period of civil unrest, the team stayed connected with domestic and international intelligence briefs and provided continuous security advice to our guests and Team Members.\n\nOur culture of responsibility\n\nHilton London Metropole has continued a partnership with WorkFit, a program supporting people who have Down syndrome, through a number of work opportunities at the hotel. WorkFit and the hotel have been partnering together for five years. WorkFit also partners with other hotels in the U.K., and a total of 16 WorkFit members who have Down syndrome have had an employment opportunity through Hilton.\n\n\u201cHenderson Park is proud to have been a part of the many important internal infrastructure initiatives implemented and supported alongside the renovation of the Hilton London Metropole. Together, with our world-class partners, we sought to create a conscientious, future-proof concept capable of continuous improvement of the guest experience through an ESG lens.\u201d\n\nNick Weber\nFounder and CEO of Henderson Park, a London-based Hilton owner group\nAppendix\nPerformance Tables\n\nAt Hilton, we closely track and report on our environmental and social impact.\n\n###

Reduction in logged 2020 and 2021 volunteer hours is primarily attributable to the temporary closing or suspension of hotels due to the pandemic.\n2. Figures provided are cumulative impact since 2015.\n3. 2021 was an anomalous year. Many hotels faced significant challenges training staff as they continued to experience issues related to the business impacts of the pandemic, including closures, low occupancy, staff shortages and furloughed employees. As lean teams faced conflicting priorities, course completions suffered, as reflected in the data. We also expect some of the reduction to be attributable to under-reporting.\n4. 2019\u20132021 human trafficking training numbers are combined managed and franchised. For 2022, we have broken out managed and franchised for greater detail.\nWhile the percentage of hotels in regions with high or extremely high baseline water stress remained consistent at 34 percent between 2019 and 2020, we identified an increase in the percentage of water being consumed in areas of higher water stress. This is partially attributable to some of our larger properties being located in regions that experienced higher levels of occupancy during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nApproximately 41 percent of total waste is estimated to be food waste, based on a sample of approximately 50 food waste reduction pilots worldwide. Hilton continues to refine its food waste reporting in alignment with the WRI\u2019s Food Loss and Waste Protocol.\n\nWe seek to provide material, decision-useful sustainability information to our investors in line with the recommendations of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB).

In 2022, we reevaluated our environmental impact 2030 Goals and set more ambitious targets. Hilton was the first major hospitality company to set science-based targets that were approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (\"SBTi\") and the first major hotel brand to obtain revalidation by SBTi. In June 2022, SBTi verified our near-term targets (1.5\u00b0C by 2030), which are in alignment with our updated environmental 2030 Goals to cut emissions intensity of our managed hotel portfolio by 75 percent and of our franchised hotel portfolio by 56 percent, with 2008 as our baseline. We continue to work toward our 2030 Goal of reducing water and waste intensity at the hotels we operate, including those that are owned, leased and managed, by 50 percent, with 2008 as our baseline.\n\nAdditional information on our management approach, programs, targets and performance can be found throughout our 2022 ESG Report and in our Environmental Policy Statement.

Through this evaluation, more than 200 relevant ESG topics were identified, examined, and then consolidated into a list of 17 material ESG Aspects aligned to industry guidance and sector trends. To assess the materiality of the 17 Aspects, Hilton engaged nearly 1,500 internal (e.g., Hilton leadership, team members) and external (e.g., NGOs, guests, owners and developers, suppliers, and investors) stakeholders through interviews and surveys.\n\nPlease see 2020 Materiality Assessment for more information.\n\nIn the materiality assessment, Hilton asked internal and external stakeholders to rate the perceived importance of the identified 17 ESG Aspects, and their perception of ESG aspects that are likely to grow in importance over the next three to five years. The results of the stakeholders\u2019 feedback were then mapped onto a Materiality Matrix and Stakeholder Priority Map. Results were presented to and reviewed by Hilton\u2019s executive leadership, including our CEO and the board of directors\u2019 Nominating & ESG Committee.\n\nWe disclose our approach towards each of the 17 ESG Aspects and progress in our ESG Report.\n\nCommunity engagement and empowerment\u2014p. 15\nClimate action\u2014p. 22-23\nBiodiversity and destination stewardship\u2014p. 24\nEnergy conservation\u2014p. 25-27\nWater stewardship\u2014p. 28\nWaste management and circular economy\u2014p. 29-30\nEconomic impact on communities\u2014p. 32-40\nEmployee development and wellbeing\u2014p. 33-35\nDiversity, equity & inclusion\u2014p. 36-39\nDisaster preparedness and response\u2014p. 40\nEmployee and guest health, safety and security\u2014p. 42-51\nHuman rights\u2014p. 42\nEngagement with suppliers\u2014p. 41-43\nHealthy, safe and sustainable food\u2014p. 44\nResponsible sourcing of goods and services\u2014p. 45\nEthical business practices and regulation compliance\u2014p. 49-51\nPolicy engagement and advocacy\u2014p. 49\n**ECONOMIC IMPACTS**\n\n**201** Management disclosure approach\n\nHilton\u2019s impact on the economy through its business and relationships with various entities including third-party owners and other strategic partners such as management companies and suppliers is detailed in the 2022 Form 10-K.\n\n**201-1** Direct economic value generated and distributed\n\nThe direct economic value generated by our business is detailed in our 2022 Form 10-K (Item 1 Business\u2014\u201cOverview\u201d).\n\nAs an example, Hilton\u2019s global procurement and supply chain arm, Hilton Supply Management (HSM), works with more than 85,000 Tier 1 suppliers to source over 482,000 products for hotels around the world, servicing over 14,000 properties, including more than 6,600 non-Hilton-branded hotels.\n\n**201-2** Financial implications and other risks and opportunities for the organization\u2019s activities due to climate change\n\nAs an operator and franchisor of hotel properties in 123 countries and territories, Hilton is subject to the physical effects of climate change, including sea level rise, droughts and intensified storms and other weather events. Damage to hotels resulting from the physical effects of climate change could lower demand for travel to certain locales and affect the performance of certain hotels, which could in turn have a negative impact on our results of operations.\n\n**201-3** Defined benefit plan obligations and other retirement plans\n\nHilton\u2019s benefit plan obligations and other share-based compensation expenses are detailed in the 2022 Form 10-K (Note 13. Employee Benefit Plans, Note 14. Share-Based Compensation).\n\n**INDIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACTS**\n\n**203** Management disclosure approach\n\nWe have enhanced our existing Travel with Purpose social goals to further commit to the areas where we can have the greatest impact, including supporting career opportunities, community impact, and responsible, inclusive conduct across our business. Please view our 2022 ESG Report (Social Impact, p. 32) for further detail.\n\n**203-1** Infrastructure investments and services supported\n\nThrough our Hilton Global Foundation and strategic partnerships with local organizations, we provide disaster relief and help rebuild infrastructure for communities to become more resilient. Please view our 2022 ESG Report (Disaster Relief, p. 40) for further detail.\n\n**PROCUREMENT PRACTICES**\n\n**204** Management disclosure approach\n\nIn addition to collaboration across our industry and within the business community, we are focused on achieving change by leveraging the scale of our supply chain. We remain committed to embedding ESG due diligence across our supply chain and partnering with suppliers to advance positive impact in our communities. Furthermore, we leverage our size and scale to expand local sourcing from small businesses and strengthen business with diverse suppliers. Through our award-winning Supplier Diversity Program, we engage women, minority, veteran, disabled and LGBTQ+-owned businesses in sourcing opportunities across the company in all categories.\n\n**204-1** Proportion of spending on local suppliers\n\nOne of Hilton\u2019s Travel with Purpose 2030 Goals is to leverage our large global footprint and deep integration within our communities to expand local sourcing and business with diverse and small suppliers. Our hotels continue to advance local sourcing in their communities, with 50% of our brands having a local sourcing brand standard in place.\n\nFor a product to be considered locally sourced in the United Kingdom, the product must be made within the United Kingdom. Additionally, in 2022 our Europe and Middle East regions identified local sourcing as a strategic opportunity. Please view our 2022 ESG Report (p. 19, 41) for further detail.\n**ANTI CORRUPTION**\n\n**Management approach disclosure**\n\nBribery and corruption are explicitly prohibited in our Code of Conduct, with oversight from our Group Finance and Risk Management functions. Internal Audits are also conducted at the Group\u2019s hotels and corporate offices in Asia Pacific, Europe and the Middle East. In the United States, these audits are conducted by an independent third-party auditor. Additionally, we conduct background checks on all prospective partners. We maintain a whistleblower policy and procedure to encourage the reporting of any inappropriate activity. Any failures to comply with the Code of Conduct are investigated and disciplinary action is taken as appropriate, up to and including termination. All General Managers and senior colleagues are expected to actively support anti-corruption policies at individual hotels and properties. Certifications of compliance with the Code of Conduct are obtained from all hotels annually with a mid-year update. Please see Hilton Code of Conduct for more information.\n\n**ENVIRONMENTAL ENERGY**\n\n**Management approach disclosure**\n\nWe are committed to effective energy management and work with our value chain partners to realize long-term energy reductions and sustainable energy procurement.\n\nOur primary source of emissions comes from the operation of our hotels. In 2022, we saw a resurgence in travel and resulting higher occupancy rates across our global portfolio. As a result, we experienced an increase in utility consumption across energy and water and an increase in waste generation compared to 2020\u20132021. As the business continues to recover, we aim to remain below pre-pandemic consumption levels and to stay on track to achieve our new and more ambitious 2030 emissions targets. We outline our approach in our Energy Stewardship Policy Statement, and actions taken to mitigate our energy footprint in the 2022 ESG Report.\n\n**Energy consumption within the organization**\n\nIn 2022, our total energy consumption was 19.93 million megawatt hours. Please view our 2022 ESG Report (Performance Table, p. 53) for further detail. Our 2022 energy data has been externally assured, as noted in our 2022 Assurance Statement.\n\n**Energy intensity**\n\nIn 2022, our energy use intensity was 0.2414 megawatt hours per square meter, representing an annual increase of 0.8% per square meter across the Hilton global portfolio of owned, managed and franchised hotels. Please view our 2022 ESG Report (Performance Table, p. 53) for further detail. Our 2022 energy data has been externally assured, as noted in our 2022 Assurance Statement.\n\n**Reduction of energy consumption**\n\nAcross our global operations (owned, managed and franchised hotels), Hilton has reduced total energy use intensity by 37% since 2008. For our managed portfolio only, we have reduced total energy use intensity by 35.7% since 2008. Reductions in energy have been achieved as a result of ongoing energy conservation activities, efficiency projects, and implementation of innovative energy saving technologies. Refer to our 2022 ESG Report (p. 25, 27) for further detail on our energy performance and energy reduction activities.\nAs one of the largest hospitality companies in the world, we recognize that we have a significant water footprint and are committed to demonstrating water stewardship by reducing our water consumption by 50% by 2030 in our managed operations (2008 baseline), and mapping global water risks, with particular emphasis on identifying and implementing innovative solutions in high water risk locations.\n\nWe outline actions taken to mitigate our water footprint in the 2022 ESG Report. Please view our 2022 ESG Report (p. 8, 18, 28) for further detail.\n\nIn 2022, our total water withdrawal was 155,848.88 megaliters (156 million cubic meters). Our water consumption intensity was 472.05 liters per square meter, representing an annual increase of 8.2% per square meter across the Hilton global portfolio of owned, managed and franchised hotels.\n\nAcross our global operations (owned, managed and franchised hotels), Hilton has reduced total water use intensity by 38.1% since 2008. For our managed portfolio only, we have reduced total water use intensity by 33.4% since 2008.\n\nPlease view our 2022 ESG Report (Water, p. 28 and Performance Table, p. 54) for further detail. Our 2022 water data has been externally assured, as noted in our 2022 Assurance Statement.\n\nWe are committed to leading the hospitality industry toward a net-zero future and reducing our greenhouse gas emissions in line with climate science. In 2022 we strengthened and validated our emissions intensity reduction goals with SBTi, and are committed to cutting emissions by 75% in our managed portfolio, and 56% in our franchised portfolio by 2030.\n\nWe outline actions taken to mitigate our carbon footprint in the 2022 ESG Report.\n\nIn 2022, our Scope 1 emissions were 0.45 million metric tons of CO\u2082e. Please view our 2022 ESG Report (Performance Table, p. 53) for further detail. Our 2022 Scope 1 emissions data has been externally assured, as noted in our 2022 Assurance Statement.\n\nIn 2022, our Scope 2 location-based emissions were 1.92 million metric tons of CO\u2082e. Our Scope 2 market-based emissions were 1.90 million metric tons of CO\u2082e.\n\nPlease view our 2022 ESG Report (Performance Table, p. 53) for further detail. Our 2022 Scope 2 emissions data has been externally assured, as noted in our 2022 Assurance Statement.\n\nPer our Operational Control boundary, on-site emissions at properties owned and operated by franchisees are reported as Scope 3 emissions. In 2022, Hilton\u2019s Scope 3 emissions from franchisees were 4.02 million metric tons CO\u2082e. The total includes emissions from on-site fuels combustion (0.89 million metric tons CO\u2082e) and indirect emissions from the generation of electricity, heat or steam purchased from a utility provider (3.20 million metric tons CO\u2082e). In addition, in 2022, we generated Scope 3 emissions of 17,095 metric tons CO\u2082e from employee business and air travel, and 86,883 metric tons CO\u2082e from the disposal of waste associated with our operations.\n\nPlease view our 2022 ESG Report (Performance Table, p. 53) for further detail. Our 2022 Scope 3 emissions data has been externally assured, as noted in our 2022 Assurance Statement.\nIn 2022, our total Scope 1 and 2 location-based emissions intensity was 0.084 metric tonnes per square meter, which represents a 5% increase over prior year. Our total 2022 market-based Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity was 0.085 metric tonnes per square meter, representing a 5% increase over prior year.\n\nPlease view our 2022 ESG Report (p. 23, 27, and Performance Table, p. 53) for further detail. Our 2022 Scope 1 and 2 emissions data has been externally assured, as noted in our 2022 Assurance Statement.\n\nWe are committed to reduce our waste production, increase our diversion from landfill, responsibly handle, store and dispose of all hazardous waste, and reduce food, plastics and packaging waste.\n\nWe outline actions and initiatives taken to reduce our waste footprint and promote a circular economy in the 2022 ESG Report.\n\nIn 2022, total weight of waste generated was 414,792 metric tons, and a breakdown of this total by composition was 342,131 metric tons of landfill waste and 72,661 metric tons of diverted waste across our global portfolio of owned, managed and franchised properties.\n\nPlease view our 2022 ESG Report (Performance Table, p. 54) for further detail. Our 2022 waste data has been externally assured, as noted in our 2022 Assurance Statement.\n\nIn 2022, our landfill diversion rate for our global operations was 17.5%, while the managed portfolio achieved a diversion rate of 35.7% in 2022. Our diversion rate accounts for ongoing waste streams that are recycled, composted, incinerated for waste-to-energy, or otherwise diverted from landfill.\n\nIn 2022, our landfilled waste was 342,130.66 metric tons. Our landfilled waste intensity was 0.0041 metric tons per square meter, representing an annual increase of 11.56% per square meter across the Hilton global portfolio of owned, managed and franchised hotels. Across our global operations, Hilton has reduced landfilled waste intensity by 57.6% since 2008.\n\nOur management approach to environmental compliance is outlined in the Hilton Environmental Policy Statement.\n\nIn 2022, Hilton did not identify any known instances of non-compliance with environmental laws and/or regulations.\nThe Hilton Supply Management Responsible Sourcing & Sustainability team engages procurement and business leaders to assess and mitigate sustainability risks in our supply chain. The team oversees the development of our comprehensive responsible sourcing strategy and guides global decisions related to implementation. All suppliers are required to observe and abide by Hilton\u2019s Responsible Sourcing Policy, which is included in all supplier contracts. We continue to advance our partnership with EcoVadis to assess our critical suppliers\u2019 sustainability risk and performance. We have begun to implement the requirement of existing and new critical suppliers to complete EcoVadis assessment if they have not already done so. EcoVadis assesses a supplier across the four themes of environment, labor & human rights, ethics, and sustainable procurement.\n\nWe have conducted a thorough analysis of our most material sourcing categories: seafood, meat and proteins, produce, and apparel and linens. A dedicated role and a cross-functional advisory group now helps to drive responsible sourcing across these categories. This group oversees the development of our comprehensive responsible sourcing strategy and guides global decisions related to implementation. We continued to make incremental progress towards our goal of strengthening responsibly sourced products across our owned, managed and leased properties, including our goal to increase sustainable seafood sourcing from Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) fisheries and Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) farms.\n\nNew suppliers that were screened using environmental criteria\n\n110 new suppliers were screened using EcoVadis environmental criteria in 2022.\n\nAt Hilton, we are committed to creating a work environment that is diverse, equitable and inclusive. We prioritize employee wellbeing through a variety of programs such as the Care for All initiative.

See Hilton\u2019s Code of Conduct.\n\nWith a global footprint across 123 countries and territories, written descriptions of occupational health and safety functions vary by region, and reflect local legislative requirements.\n**TRAINING AND EDUCATION**\n\n**404** Management approach disclosure\n\nWe offer a variety of robust training and education programs ranging from upskilling, reskilling and leadership training, to offer a work environment that fosters growth and career progression.\n\n**404-1** Average hours of training per year per employee\n\nHilton employees complete an average of 40 hours of training per year.\n\n**404-2** Programs for upgrading employee skills and transition assistance programs\n\nThrough Hilton University, our online learning platform, all Team Members have access to over 25,000 courses, providing the ability to explore new skills or expand their expertise.

The current brand standard requires that hotels input the following data into LightStay on a monthly basis:\n\n- Energy consumed from all energy sources (electricity, gas, steam, chilled water, other).\n- Water consumed from all sources, including municipal water supply and other sources.\n- Waste disposal including landfilled and diverted waste streams (recycled, organic, other).\n- Waste diversion rate (%)\n\nHilton tracks and supports hotel compliance with the LightStay brand standards globally through the use of LightStay compliance alerts, monthly compliance reports, and direct communications with the Regional Property Operations and Brand Performance teams.\n\n### TABLE 1: GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS\n\n| INDICATOR | 2022 Total | Intensity | Intensity \u2013 Change From 2021 |\n|-----------|------------|-----------|-----------------------------|\n| Scope 1 Direct emissions | 446,064 | 0.0157 | 4.24% |\n| Scope 2 Indirect emissions (Location-based) | 1,922,844 | 0.0678 | 4.67% |\n| Scope 2 Indirect emissions (Market-based) | 1,004,610 | 0.0472 | 4.62% |\n| Scope 1 + 2 emissions (Location-based) | 2,368,928 | 0.0835 | 4.75% |\n| Scope 1 + 2 emissions (Market-based) | 2,350,604 | 0.0829 | 4.71% |\n| Scope 3 emissions from Franchises | 4,020,579 | 0.0742 | 5.50% |\n| Scope 3 emissions from Landfilled Waste | 86,883 | 0.0031 | 15.43% |\n| Scope 3 emissions from Business Travel | 17,095 | \u2013 | 124.47% |\n\n### TABLE 2: OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL DATA\n\n| Indicator | 2022 Total | Intensity | Intensity \u2013 Change From 2021 |\n|-----------|------------|-----------|-----------------------------|\n| Energy consumption (MWh) | 6,800,671 | 0.2598 | 7.02% |\n| Managed | 15,127,543 | 0.2423 | -2.25% |\n| Total | 19,928,216 | 0.2414 | 0.75% |\n| Water consumption Megaliters | 13,785 | 485 | 8.66% |\n| Managed | 25,196 | 465 | 7.92% |\n| Total | 38,962 | 472 | 8.93% |\n| Water withdrawals Megaliters | 55,065 | 1,042 | 8.66% |\n| Managed | 102,754 | 1,850 | 7.92% |\n| Total | 155,849 | 1,888 | 8.93% |\n| Landfilled waste Metric Tons | 92,429 | 0.0055 | 15.43% |\n| Managed | 249,702 | 0.0046 | 10.07% |\n| Total | 342,131 | 0.0041 | 11.56% |\n| Waste diverted from landfill Metric Tons | 51,249 | 0.0018 | 35.93% |\n| Managed | 21,412 | 0.0004 | -4.54% |\n| Total | 72,661 | 0.0008 | 20.62% |\n| Waste diversion rate (%) | 35.67% | 3.68% |\n| Managed | 73.00% | -10.86% |\n| Total | 17.92% | 110% |\n\n### TABLE 3: SOCIAL IMPACT DATA\n\n| Indicator | 2022 total |\n|-----------|------------|\n| Disaster relief funds distributed to Hilton Team Members through the Team Member Assistance Fund | $362,031,77 |\n| Volunteering (number of hours) | 344,958 |\n| Grants awarded to community partners through the Hilton Global Foundation | $2,916,000 |\n| Team members supported by the Team Member Assistance Fund | 1,423 |\n| Mandatory Anti-Trafficking Training | Managed \u2013 98% |\n| (number of General Managers attesting at hotel Team Members have completed) | Franchises \u2013 70% |\n| Supplier Diversity Program | 2,458 |\n| (number of women, minority, veteran and LGBTQ\u2013owned businesses we have supported) | |\n| Refugees Impacted (cumulative since 2015) | 78,588 |\nDue to the large percentage of reporting properties, the automated calculations in LightStay (floor area 2) are based on international standard data. Historical emissions factors for electricity, natural gas and other energy sources are stored in LightStay and used to calculate the hotel\u2019s Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. Location-based electricity CO\u2082 emissions factors are updated annually in LightStay for the current calendar, based on the most recent and accurate source data available for the country or subregion.\n\nCompliance Alerts: The LightStay system generates monthly alerts for incomplete or out-of-range consumption values. Hotels have 60 days to enter their utility bills or they will receive an alert message in LightStay. Hotels must address all outstanding alerts within 30 days to remain in compliance with the brand standards.\n\nLightStay Training: All new hotels must complete an online LightStay training course through Hilton University within three months of opening. Advanced courses are available and LightStay offers extensive user guidance and how-to-guides.\n\nLightStay Support: Hotels are encouraged to contact the LightStay Support team to help understand their alerts and correct any data input errors. LightStay Support attempts to contact hotels directly to resolve major data issues and may also correct obvious decimal or unit errors, with notification sent to the hotel.\n\nSince 2010, hotel utility data in LightStay has been used for Hilton\u2019s external reporting of energy, emissions, water, and waste impacts. Hilton and its consultants have followed a consistent methodology, adapted to meet the company\u2019s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) strategy. Travel with Purpose reporting requirements.\n\nConsistent with Hilton\u2019s 2030 Travel with Purpose goals, Hilton measures the company\u2019s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) strategy, and consultants have followed a consistent methodology, adapted to meet the company\u2019s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) strategy. Travel with Purpose reporting requirements.\n\nReporting Scopes:\n\nScope 1 includes all on-site GHG emissions from fuel use, almost exclusively natural gas for comfort heating and hot water generation.\n\nScope 2 includes all grid electricity used by Hilton\u2019s managed hotel properties. The individual hotel CO\u2082 emissions factors for the reference group were verified based on the emissions source data provided by country or subregion (i.e., US eGRID, DEFFRA, IEA).\n\nScope 3 includes all grid electricity at the Franchised hotels, as well as emissions relating to managed hotel landfill waste and Corporate business travel. Again, CO\u2082 emissions factors were verified for different countries and subregions based on international standard data.\n\nRisk Evaluation\n\nSufficiency, Appropriateness, and Material misstatement\n\nThe sufficiency of data and the appropriateness of both the automated LightStay and final corporate analysis were evaluated for sufficiency, appropriateness, and risk of material misstatement based on analysis methodology.\n\nSufficiency Risk\n\nDue to the large percentage of reporting properties (7035) and the large property pool (6256 Franchised properties and 829 Managed properties), the Risk of data insufficiency was determined to be Low. Annual sustainability results are based on an evaluation of year-over-year results for a reference group of properties with data verified complete and accurate for aggregated reporting purposes. The reference group for 2022 included 90% of total managed properties, and analysis of the reference group\u2019s performance supplied the average values (by region) used to complete and correct the data from the remaining properties.\n\nData gathered using the LightStay system has been verified at the site level by DEKRA site sampling, included in Hilton\u2019s ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and ISO 50001 site visits. Data anomalies are analyzed at the site level and corrective actions are implemented.\n\nAppropriateness Risk\n\nThe automated calculations in LightStay (floor area normalization) have been verified for this and all previous reporting cycles and no errors have been found. Hence, the Risk of inappropriate analysis in the LightStay system was determined to be Low. Data, once it is reported into LightStay, is also analyzed at the corporate level annually for anomalies and missing data, and properties are excluded from the reference group.\n\nMateriality Risk\n\nRisk of material misstatement was determined to be Low. The final analysis by Hilton staff consisted of spreadsheet review and identification of anomalies. There were 104 energy-based anomalies at the property level identified (1.5% anomaly rate), and the most significant have been added to the sampling plan for internal and external audit in 2023. Anomalies also include any issues with water use reporting. Materiality of the chosen methodology was verified by taking the final result for all properties not in the anomalous group, using their unmodified (raw) data and comparing it to the final result for all properties with all normalization factors active. The raw data showed an intensity of 0.081 Metric tons per square meter, while the final data showed an intensity of 0.083 Metric tons per square meter. Variance was only 2.25%, well within the 5% materiality limit.\n\nOther Environmental Claims\n\nWater and waste data were both reported into LightStay using the same platform as the energy and greenhouse gas data reviewed above. During the data cleansing process, the properties\u2019 water use and waste stream data was evaluated, consistent with the criteria regarding missing and anomalous data above, to determine the reference group and to estimate impacts by excluded and new hotels. Water anomalies were added to the audited group (see \u2018Materiality Risk\u2019 above).\n\nSocial Impact Data\n\nProperties report volunteer events and participation through LightStay. The summary report of the volunteer hours was reviewed. Numeric outliers were identified and the specific entries within LightStay were reviewed. No discrepancies were noted.\n\nHilton provides Hilton Effect Grants through the Hilton Effect Foundation to properties requesting funds for social or environmental projects. The amount transferred from Hilton in 2022 was confirmed by a representative from the Hilton corporate accounting department.\n\nHilton has assigned Anti-Trafficking Training Courses to all properties through Hilton University. Records from Hilton University were reviewed.\n\nHilton\u2019s Supplier Diversity Program currently includes 2,458 diverse suppliers. Supplier information is reviewed by two separate third party processes.\n\nAbout DEKRA\n\nDEKRA Certification Inc. is a Management System certification company that has provided ISO 9001, 14001 and 50001 certification services to Hilton since 2010.\n\nBeginning in 2008, DEKRA then operating as KEMA Registered Quality, Inc. has provided independent validation services to Hilton for their LightStay Program. DEKRA did not assist or consult with Hilton at any time in generating the Reported Data within the scope of the verification. DEKRA has procedures in place to ensure its work is free from bias and is not unduly influenced by outside parties. DEKRA employees and contractors who participated in assurance activities were free from personal, financial, or other relationships that would potentially compromise their impartiality.\n\nLikewise, the personnel who performed assurance activities were all experienced environmental, sustainability and social responsibility auditors. The competence of these people is continually monitored and recorded. All assurance activities were subject to DEKRA\u2019s peer review and quality assurance processes.\n\nAttested By\n\nZed Bates\nAIBR Accredited Verifier\nExecutive Order H-15-171\nLead Auditor\nDEKRA Certification Inc.\n\nDr. Cem Onus\nManaging Director\nDEKRA Certification Inc.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-04-27", "created": "2025-04-27", "metadata": {"Source-File": "climate_reports/tp_reports/hilton_worldwide_2022.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.1.59", "pdf-total-pages": 73, "total-input-tokens": 205689, "total-output-tokens": 54027, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 77, 1], [77, 888, 2], [888, 4691, 3], [4691, 6822, 4], [6822, 7185, 5], [7185, 9858, 6], [9858, 11650, 7], [11650, 14646, 8], [14646, 17066, 9], [17066, 22167, 10], [22167, 27884, 11], [27884, 31893, 12], [31893, 36096, 13], [36096, 39681, 14], [39681, 43336, 15], [43336, 44282, 16], [44282, 44577, 17], [44577, 47104, 18], [47104, 52646, 19], [52646, 57770, 20], [57770, 57951, 21], [57951, 60615, 22], [60615, 63775, 23], [63775, 67778, 24], [67778, 71811, 25], [71811, 75124, 26], [75124, 77939, 27], [77939, 81573, 28], [81573, 87460, 29], [87460, 91246, 30], [91246, 91559, 31], [91559, 93702, 32], [93702, 96028, 33], [96028, 99676, 34], [99676, 105875, 35], [105875, 108326, 36], [108326, 112891, 37], [112891, 116183, 38], [116183, 119983, 39], [119983, 126530, 40], [126530, 130815, 41], [130815, 135828, 42], [135828, 140517, 43], [140517, 140938, 44], [140938, 142604, 45], [142604, 145206, 46], [145206, 148116, 47], [148116, 149535, 48], [149535, 153713, 49], [153713, 156914, 50], [156914, 160397, 51], [160397, 160406, 52], [160406, 164054, 53], [164054, 168272, 54], [168272, 170741, 55], [170741, 171807, 56], [171807, 176295, 57], [176295, 180880, 58], [180880, 184463, 59], [184463, 187182, 60], [187182, 190297, 61], [190297, 194040, 62], [194040, 197216, 63], [197216, 200360, 64], [200360, 202524, 65], [202524, 205510, 66], [205510, 208954, 67], [208954, 211776, 68], [211776, 215346, 69], [215346, 218024, 70], [218024, 221994, 71], [221994, 229875, 72], [229875, 229875, 73]]}}
