Performance metrics and targets, footnotes and additional detailed information can be found in the PepsiCo 2021 ESG Performance Metrics.\n\nAs a general matter, recent organizational changes (e.g., acquisitions and divestitures) are reflected in our reporting as soon as data becomes available, at which point, previously reported impacted metrics that are deemed significant are recast to consistently reflect the impact of the organizational changes.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, information available with respect to our acquisitions of Hangzhou Haomusi Food Co., Ltd. (Be & Cheery), BFY Brands, Inc. (BFY), Pioneer Food Group Ltd. (Pioneer Foods), Rockstar Energy Beverages (Rockstar) and SodaStream International Ltd. (SodaStream) is included herein.\n\nTargets apply to PepsiCo\u2019s operations as well as our value chain (e.g., franchise bottlers, joint ventures where PepsiCo has operational control, co-manufacturers, etc.) unless otherwise noted.\nWhat does it mean to be a truly sustainable company?\n\nAt PepsiCo, we recognize that the futures of our company, communities, and planet are all inextricably linked. That reality has been driven home again and again in recent years, first by the COVID-19 pandemic, then the deadly conflict in Ukraine. Through it all, climate change has continued to increase its impact on our fragile ecosystems, leading to extreme weather, crop failures, and changes in the range and abundance of certain plants and animals. All of these issues have resulted in a collision of food shortages, supply chain bottlenecks, and a refugee crisis unlike anything Europe has seen since World War II.\n\nIn this context, we have been thinking hard about what it means to be a truly sustainable company, one that creates growth and value for all of our stakeholders. We know that to be successful five years, 10 years, 20 years from now, we need to create more resilience in our business. And that means we need to change what we do and how we do it.\n\nIn September 2021 we launched a strategic, end-to-end transformation of our business. We put sustainability and human capital at the center of how we will create growth and value, by operating within planetary boundaries and inspiring positive change for the planet and people. We call this approach PepsiCo Positive (pep+), reflecting a new reality where consumers, customers, our associates, investors, regulators, and many other stakeholders are becoming more interested in the future of the planet and society. From sourcing ingredients to making and selling our products more sustainably, pep+ connects the future of our business with the future of our planet.\n\nThe launch of pep+ is a turning point for PepsiCo. We have an opportunity to use our scale \u2014 with operations in more than 200 countries and territories, more than 25 crops sourced from approximately 7 million acres in more than 30 different countries, and more than one billion interactions with consumers each day \u2014 to help build a more sustainable food system. By advancing our pep+ goals, we believe we will be a consistent top market performer and a force for good by doing what\u2019s right for people and the planet.\n\nBy becoming better ourselves, we not only meet the needs of our stakeholders but position ourselves for long-term growth. We can help define for the world what it means to be a truly sustainable company, and build a stronger, more resilient future for us all.\n\n\u201cPepsiCo remains committed to taking a leadership role in the creation of a more sustainable food system that preserves the planet and positively impacts people and communities across the world. With the ongoing volatility around the globe, our pep+ agenda continues to be the right path for our planet and our business.\u201d\n\nJim Andrew\nChief Sustainability Officer\n\n\u201cThe investments we have made in pep+ aim to ensure the sustainability of our business and the hundreds of thousands of jobs we support across our global supply chains \u2014 creating growth and value within planetary boundaries while inspiring positive change for people and the planet.\u201d\n\nHugh Johnston\nVice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer\nAcross our value chain, PepsiCo is using our global reach and expertise to drive solutions at scale. PepsiCo\u2019s sustainability strategy targets every stage of our complex value chain to use resources more efficiently, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, replenish water, improve our products and recapture packaging materials. Investments in our circular and inclusive value chain will help accelerate the systemic change needed to address major global challenges.\n\n1. **Agricultural Sourcing**\n   PepsiCo sources crops from more than 30 countries and supports more than 100,000 jobs throughout our agricultural supply chain. The standards we apply and promote can help improve the environmental, social and economic health of agricultural communities around the world.\n\n2. **R&D and Manufacturing**\n   We spent >$750 million on R&D in 2021 as part of our continued investment in developing quality and innovative beverages and convenient foods. Our 294 manufacturing facilities bring together innovators and operations teams who work to use water, energy and ingredients efficiently to create our beverages and convenient foods. In 2021, we produced more than 90 million metric tons of beverages and convenient foods.\n\n3. **Distribution**\n   PepsiCo products are sold in over 200 countries and territories. In 2021, our company-owned fleet traveled approximately 1.2 billion miles worldwide to bring PepsiCo products to customers. We are working to reduce the impact of those miles by continuing to adopt more efficient vehicles and practices.\n\n4. **Consumption**\n   PepsiCo products are enjoyed by consumers more than 1 billion times a day. We\u2019re responding to changing consumer preferences by transforming our product portfolio and reformulating many of our beverages and convenient foods to reduce added sugars, sodium and saturated fat.\n\n5. **Post-Consumer**\n   PepsiCo\u2019s sustainable packaging vision is to help build a world where packaging never becomes waste by driving the shift from a linear economy to a circular economy. We continue to grow our portfolio of Beyond the Bottle offerings, innovate to develop sustainable packaging and work to improve recycling infrastructure.\nWe\u2019re charting a new course to drive positive action for the planet and people.\n\nWe\u2019re evolving how we source our ingredients and make and sell our products, and how we inspire people through our brands.\n\n**pep+ has three pillars:**\n\n- **Positive Agriculture**\n  - We\u2019re working to source our crops and ingredients in ways that restore the earth and strengthen farming communities.\n  - We\u2019re supporting regenerative agricultural practices that aim to make soil healthier, sequester carbon, improve watershed health and biodiversity, and strengthen farmer livelihoods. We\u2019re working closely with our farmers and intermediary suppliers to embed these practices throughout our agricultural supply chain. In 2021:\n    - We spread regenerative agriculture practices to more than 345,000 acres, toward our goal of 7 million acres by 2030.\n    - Globally, more than 90% of our grower-sourced crops were sustainably sourced through our Sustainable Farming Program.\n    - We continued working with USAID on a 5-year, $20 million partnership to support women-owned and women-led enterprises.\n    - We committed $5 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture through AgMission.\n    - As of 2020, we reached 14% of our 2025 goal to improve water-use efficiency by 15% (versus a 2015 baseline), in high water-risk watersheds where we directly source our crops.\n\nFor more details see ESG Topics A-Z: Agriculture.\nPositive Value Chain\nWe\u2019re helping build a circular and inclusive value chain.\n\nClimate\nAchieve net-zero emissions across our value chain by 2040; by 2030, reduce our GHG emissions by more than 40% (versus a 2015 baseline), doubling our prior climate goal:\n\n- We are investing in zero- and near-zero emission delivery vehicles for our company-owned fleets and partnering with others to support decarbonization of the broader transport industry and improving energy-use efficiency and working to scale renewable fuel solutions at our manufacturing facilities.\n- As of 2021, we\u2019ve improved our operational water-use efficiency by 18% (versus a 2015 baseline) in high water-risk areas, toward our goal of 25% by 2025.\n\nPackaging\nPepsiCo envisions a world where packaging never becomes waste:\n\n- We\u2019ve announced ambitious new goals around our aim to reduce our use of virgin plastic, use more recycled content in our plastic packaging and scale business models like SodaStream that avoid or minimize single-use plastic. These new targets complement our 2025 goal of making 100% of our packaging recyclable, compostable, biodegradable or reusable.\n- Achieving these ambitious goals will require investment and innovation, and we are exploring renewable, non-fossil-fuel-based sources for packaging materials, such as plant-based materials that are safe, efficient and have a lighter carbon footprint than fossil-fuel based plastics.\n- We\u2019re helping to develop infrastructure, advocating for smart policies and engaging consumers so that packaging never becomes waste.\n\nPeople\nProvide meaningful jobs and growth opportunities for our people and empower them to make a positive impact at work, at home and in their local communities:\n\n- We are providing new programs aimed at making PepsiCo an even better place to work and empowering our associates to make a greater impact on their communities.\n- We are launching a tuition assistance program giving U.S. associates access to 100+ debt-free degrees, certificates and trades programs.\n- We are focused on retaining and growing diverse female talent through mentoring, coaching and development programs throughout career stages.\n\nBuild a better workplace and world by advancing human rights and diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) for our people, in our business partnerships and our communities:\n\n- We continue to make progress on our Racial Equality Journey (REJ) in the U.S., a more than $570 million set of commitments launched in 2020 with a focus on three pillars: People, Business and Communities.\n- We are working to increase women in managerial positions, ensure pay equity across employee groups and promote fair, safe and injury-free working conditions.\n- In our communities, we are striving toward our goal to bring safe water access to 100 million people since 2006 and advance food security.\n\nFor more details see ESG Topics A-Z: Climate Change, Water, Packaging, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.\nPositive Choices\nWe\u2019re inspiring people through our brands to make choices that create more smiles for them and the planet.\n\nExpanded portfolio offerings\nContinue to provide consumers choice for every occasion by expanding our product offerings by 2025:\n\n\u2022 We\u2019ve made significant progress on reducing added sugars in our beverages and reducing sodium in convenient foods. In 2021, we attained our saturated fat reduction goal of 75% of our convenient foods portfolio not exceeding 11 grams of saturated fat per 100 Calories.*\n\n\u2022 We\u2019re expanding our product line to include ingredients that offer greater nutritional benefits or are better for the planet, like chickpeas and other legumes, whole grains, plant-based proteins, fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds.\n\n\u2022 We\u2019re also striving to take a consistent approach to nutritional labeling throughout the world.\n\nInnovative packaging solutions\nWe\u2019re developing and deploying disruptive sustainable packaging materials and new models for beverages and convenient foods:\n\n\u2022 We\u2019re expanding pilots with the rollout of Off The Eaten Path commercially compostable packaging in Whole Foods in the United States.\n\n\u2022 We launched Gatorade sachets in Australia, allowing consumers to use their own reusable water bottles.\n\n\u2022 We\u2019re transitioning brands like Pepsi Zero Sugar, Mtn Dew and Aquafina to 100% recycled PET in various markets.\n\nPlanet \u2022 people brands\nWe\u2019re using the scale of our iconic, globally recognized brands to inspire people to make positive choices for our communities and planet:\n\n\u2022 We\u2019re thinking about where ingredients are sourced and by whom, how much water and energy is used to make our products, how we can be more efficient and sustainable with our packaging solutions, and how our brands show up for their communities.\n\n\u2022 We are working to develop industry-wide environmental labeling standards that let consumers know that buying a particular product will help build a more sustainable food system \u2013 from the way the ingredients were grown, to the way it was made, to the way it was designed to be consumed.\n\n* Based on our Top 23 convenient foods markets, which represent 86% of our global convenient foods volume as of 2021.\n\nFor more details see ESG Topics A-Z: Nutrition, Packaging,
