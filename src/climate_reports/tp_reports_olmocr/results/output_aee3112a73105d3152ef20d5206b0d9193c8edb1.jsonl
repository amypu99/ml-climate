We manage ESG risks and opportunities to create long-term value for stockholders, customers and employees. We apply ESG principles across the enterprise. Providing products and services that are accessible, competitively priced and mindful of environmental and social impacts is important to our strategy \u2013 and success.\nThis Sustainability Report builds on the content in our 10-K and Proxy Statement and on AllstateSustainability.com to tell the full story of Allstate\u2019s long-term value creation. We incorporate the Guiding Principles and Content Components of the Integrated Reporting (IR) framework as produced by the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC). We include disclosures to the relevant SASB sector standards, the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) guidelines, our EEO-1 report and our Executive Summary. Finally, the report references the GRI Standards and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs).\n\nWe prioritize ESG topics based on their alignment to Our Shared Purpose, Transformative Growth and long-term enterprise value creation. To determine Allstate\u2019s risks and opportunities as well as our social and environmental impact more holistically, we periodically conduct sustainability assessments to learn what ESG issues are significant to our stakeholders.\n\nWhat does value creation look like at Allstate?\n\nWe have adopted the Integrated Reporting (IR) framework, which integrates our financial information and sustainability data to showcase the company\u2019s commitment to and progress toward creating long-term value for those we serve. We aim to follow the spirit of the IR guidelines to: improve the quality of information to providers of financial capital and enable efficient and productive allocation of capital, promote a cohesive approach to corporate reporting and communicate about factors that materially affect our ability to create value over time, enhance accountability and stewardship for the six capitals (financial, manufactured, intellectual, human, social and relationship, and natural) and support integrated thinking and decision-making that create value over the short, medium and long term.\n\nTo read a message from Chair, President and CEO Tom Wilson, please visit the Leadership Message page at AllstateSustainability.com.\nOur approach to ESG reporting\n\nAccountability\n\nAllstate has strong corporate governance guided by three primary principles: dialogue, transparency and responsiveness. The Board of Directors\u2019 enhanced governance policies align with best practices and serve the interests of stockholders. Allstate\u2019s stockholder engagement program is integral to the Board\u2019s oversight and decision-making process and informs important practices and policies in our strategy, compensation and ESG programs. The Board has reviewed Allstate\u2019s ESG investing strategy and expansion of carbon transition investment capabilities. For more information about our governance practices, see our 2023 Proxy Statement.\n\nAllstateSustainability.com has additional details and resources that helped shape this report. These include the Executive Summary, EEO-1 and Public Policy reports as well as Awards, SASB, GRI and TCFD indices, CDP responses, ESG Data and more.\n\nPolicies and practices\n\nResponsiveness to stakeholders\n\nConsideration of stakeholders is a core principle of Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) sustainability reports. We identify key stakeholder groups through the ESG Steering Committee, feedback from senior leaders and employees, and by mapping the full scope of our impacts. We select stakeholders according to their knowledge and understanding of our company as a whole, their orientation relative to or within the financial services industry and the extent to which they can impact, or be impacted by, Allstate.\n\nWe interviewed stakeholders and analyzed their perspectives available from public documentation for our 2020 sustainability assessment. In 2021, we supplemented our 2020 sustainability assessment with extensive stockholder outreach to foster dialogue on societal issues of importance. In 2022, we created a Societal Engagement Framework (SEF) to prioritize our engagement on issues where we have a unique ability to make a meaningful impact. The framework allows us to align our values, business priorities and ESG actions. The framework evaluates issues on five criteria: importance to our ability to serve customers, level of Allstate\u2019s expertise, ability to effect change, impact on stakeholders and risk-adjusted returns. We further prioritize our efforts on ESG matters that are strongly aligned to our brand, business, and risk and return profile. Three ESG focus areas have been identified as most significant to Allstate and its stakeholders: climate, data privacy and equity.\n\nPrograms and performance\n\nSince 2010, Allstate has partnered with global research firm RepTrak to study how stakeholders perceive Allstate and what influences those perceptions. These insights drive action. We survey customers, consumers, agents and employees every quarter, as well as investors and opinion leaders each year, and policymakers every two years. Each survey measures both emotional and rational elements of reputation. The emotional reputation score helps us understand how stakeholders feel about Allstate. Rational reputation metrics help Allstate understand what\u2019s underneath that emotional reputation score \u2013 the behaviors, attitudes and perceptions that influence what stakeholders think about Allstate. This helps us understand what stakeholders are willing to do on Allstate\u2019s behalf. Strong reputation scores correlate to stakeholders behaving in ways that are meaningful to Allstate, such as buying a new policy, recommending our products, services and agents, and saying something positive about the company. Allstate ended 2022 with its highest consumer reputation score since tracking began in 2010.\nCustomer-centric products and technology\n\nWe empower customers by ensuring our products are accessible, competitively priced and aligned with our social and environmental goals. Allstate made significant progress in 2022 toward our Transformative Growth strategy by expanding customer access, improving customer value and deploying new technology ecosystems.\n\nAccountability\n\nDeveloping and providing customer-centric products is the responsibility of multiple teams at Allstate. In addition, every member of Allstate\u2019s Board of Directors is customer focused and brings an innovation perspective that enables Allstate to generate disruptive innovation and extend or create new business models to develop responsible products.\n\nProducts\n\nAllstate has been protecting people from life\u2019s uncertainties since 1931. We continuously develop and improve products and services so our customers can live well protected. Below are key highlights from 2022.\n\nDrivewise\u00ae\n\nWe are redefining insurance through telematics. Our Drivewise product gives customers insight into their behavior and promotes safe driving. Customers save just by activating Drivewise in the Allstate mobile app. As of year-end 2022, Drivewise was available in 49 states and Washington, D.C., with over 1.79 million Drivewise connections.\n\nAllstate launched free Crash Detection Services through Drivewise. Using telematics and the sensors in a smartphone, the Allstate mobile app can detect when a customer may have been involved in a serious car crash as a passenger or a driver. The app offers quick access to emergency assistance, claims and Allstate Roadside Services. In 2022, 226 customers used this feature to call 911, and 108 customers used it to call for roadside assistance. Additionally, 440 customers started a claim after they received a Crash Detection notification.\nCustomer-centric products and technology\n\nMilewise\u00ae\n\nMilewise, Allstate\u2019s pay-per-mile auto insurance, was available in 22 states as of Dec. 31, 2022, and gives customers the same great coverage and claim service from Allstate. Allstate ended 2022 with 351,000 vehicles enrolled in Milewise.\n\nCyber coverages\n\nAllstate Business Insurance offers its customers eight types of first-party and third-party technology-focused coverages. Cyber coverages are essential for business owners because personal information held by a business can be lost, stolen or accidentally released. Allstate offered Cyber coverage in 47 states and Washington, D.C., as of Dec. 31, 2022.\n\nAllstate Identity Protection\n\nAllstate Identity Protection (AIP) includes comprehensive financial and credit monitoring, industry-leading coverage and remediation services, innovative data and privacy tools as well as a full suite of cybersecurity protection. In early 2023, we launched over 20 new product features, including the Elder Fraud Center. We\u2019ve managed the spike in fraud cases effectively and earned a strong post-remediation satisfaction score of 98%. Read more in Allstate\u2019s Identity Fraud in Focus quarterly report. The employee benefits business at AIP remains strong. During open enrollment season in 2022, 468 new employer clients were onboarded, and approximately 56,000 new plans went into effect.\n\nAvail and Arity\n\nIn 2022, Allstate announced a new parking garage partnership to make car-sharing easier and more accessible for travelers and locals alike. Partnering with self-service LAZ Parking garages and other locations, Avail was offered at 31 sites in Chicago and 12 in Denver as of January 2023 and has already grown further. Anyone who parks in a participating location can share their car by signing up through the Avail app or on the website and earn money to help offset the costs of car ownership and parking. Avail drivers are covered by Allstate insurance, complete with access to roadside assistance and 24/7 customer support.\n\nWe offer everything you need for a smooth trip.\n\nArity is a mobility data and analytics company that collects and analyzes driving data to help make transportation smarter, safer and more economical. By Dec. 31, 2022, Arity had collected more than 1 trillion miles of driving data at a rate of nearly 12,000 miles per second.\n\nEnvironmentally responsible products\n\nWe offer the Homeowners Policy Green Improvement Reimbursement Endorsement. It allows a customer to replace damaged or destroyed appliances and equipment with more energy-efficient items and be reimbursed by Allstate for the additional cost. The product is available in most states.\n\nUnderwriting technology and digital transformation\n\nDigital transformation enables Allstaters to support high value-add activities, spur innovation and reduce expenses. In 2022, Allstate created the Digital Transformation Office (DTO) to help realize our vision of becoming the leading digital insurer. The DTO aims to accelerate enterprisewide digital transformation and best-in-class experiences for all stakeholders.\n\nDecision modeling\n\nIn 2022, we completed the implementation of all auto and property rules as part of a multi-year underwriting transformation journey. Through this transition to decision modeling, we decreased our cycle time to implement an underwriting rule change, updated consumer and agency messaging to be more user-friendly and increased the sophistication of our executed rules. Decision modeling is our single source for building, housing and implementing our Risk Management Policy.\nPrivacy and information security\n\nWe are an industry leader on data privacy and information security. Privacy is embedded in our day-to-day business activities and is a key part of everything we do at every stage of product design through delivery.\n\nAccountability\n\nThe Board prioritizes its responsibility to oversee data protection efforts, including policies and systems designed to prevent and, if necessary, respond to cyber threats. The Board and Audit Committee provide oversight of our privacy and cybersecurity programs. Our privacy and information security teams collaborate closely but operate independently. Internal and external privacy and information security audits help evaluate our programs\u2019 effectiveness. We are continuously looking for vulnerabilities across the enterprise, performing ongoing rigorous tests and exercises to identify and resolve vulnerabilities. Allstate Information Security (AIS) has Risk and Governance teams that monitor adherence to information security policies and standards as well as the personal information privacy standard.\n\nPolicies and practices\n\nOur privacy policies, standards and procedures support compliance with privacy laws, provide the foundation for compliance with future laws and support efforts to be more privacy-forward. Our consumer privacy principles are detailed in Allstate\u2019s Privacy Policy, which applies to all employees unless otherwise stated. Our Online Privacy Statement has more information about Allstate\u2019s practices related to collection, use and sharing of consumers\u2019 personal information. Other entities within the Allstate family provide separate privacy statements; see The Allstate Foundation, Arity, Allstate Protection Plans, National General and Allstate Identity Protection websites for information.\nPrograms and performance\n\nAllstate periodically conducts an independent privacy program maturity assessment. We evaluate the privacy program and compare it to trends in the insurance and technology industries. In our most recent maturity assessment, we analyzed, evaluated and verified progress across privacy components through interviews with the privacy team and other enterprise stakeholders and reviews of relevant documents. The privacy and information security programs address the following priorities: access control, detect and respond, protecting data and security governance.\n\nEmployee awareness and training\n\nOur security education and awareness teams lead extensive employee communication campaigns to reduce cyber risk from human error. We run phishing simulations with real-time feedback and training for employees who fail the simulation. The awareness program is assessed by the Gartner Employee Awareness Survey, which measures employee security behaviors and decision-making. Allstate outperforms industry peers and other Fortune 500 companies in all 33 categories, with a Secure Behavior score of 94%.\n\nWe provide on-demand and topic-specific training customized for current issues such as cybersecurity. We offer more advanced and specialized role-based training to employees in higher-risk roles. Allstate\u2019s Business Information Security Officers (BISO) group delivers training and year-long awareness activities. In 2022, 199 BISO training sessions were conducted, with a total audience of 14,184 employees and sessions tailored to their specific areas of responsibility.\n\nSecurity and privacy in our supply chain\n\nWe established a security assessment program for suppliers that evaluates both privacy and security impacts of proposed process changes. We also require all contingent workers who have access to our network to complete training on Allstate\u2019s security policies and to adhere to the privacy expectations described in our Supplier Code of Business Conduct. Learn more about how our supplier programs are integrated with our Inclusive Diversity & Equity and Climate strategy, disaster resiliency and operational footprint work in those sections of this report. We comply with the UK Modern Slavery Act and post our Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement on the Allstate Northern Ireland and Allstate external websites.\nEthics and integrity\n\nEthics and integrity are the foundation of everything we do at Allstate. Our Global Code of Business Conduct, updated in 2022 to be more targeted and more accessible for our employees, sets the expectations for ethical conduct that guide every business decision and employee action around the globe. Built atop the code, our robust Ethics program provides resources, training and education, as well as governance and accountability, to ensure that ethics and integrity are maintained throughout our business processes, our business partnerships and our supply chain.\n\nAccountability\n\nAllstate\u2019s ethics and compliance programs are chartered, independent functions overseen by the chief ethics and compliance officer (CECO) and supported by hundreds of employees. The CECO reports quarterly to executive leadership at the cross-functional Internal Compliance and Controls (ICC) meeting and semiannually to the Audit Committee and Board of Directors, including in executive session, to cover ethics, regulatory compliance and privacy topics such as trends, audits, performance, education, risk and culture. The CECO has broad, independent authority to enforce the company\u2019s Global Code of Business Conduct; ensure appropriate resources for ethics and compliance; report on the company\u2019s performance regarding ethics, regulatory compliance and privacy; and oversee integrity investigations.\n\nPolicies and practices\n\nAllstate\u2019s policies help communicate our expectations for ethical behavior and provide guidance and resources to employees who are facing ethical dilemmas. Allstate\u2019s policies form only a piece of our holistic approach to ethics and integrity.\n\nDigital ethics framework\n\nIn 2022, Allstate evolved its digital ethics framework to provide actionable guidance and a simple path for identifying and addressing ethical concerns. The framework informs the use of data and artificial intelligence, as well as other innovative technologies, across the enterprise.\nReporting concerns\n\nAllstate\u2019s Speak Up Process educates and encourages employees to report any activities that cause concern and to seek guidance when situations arise that fall outside policy guardrails. Any suspected privacy incident can be raised to the Enterprise Business Conduct team or the local cybersecurity team. In 2022, Allstate launched a privacy center on Allstate.com with simplified consumer-friendly messaging about Allstate\u2019s privacy practices and easy-to-navigate privacy choices.\n\nWe support and train employees and managers about a variety of reporting pathways to allow employees to choose one that feels comfortable. In 2022, approximately 40% of employees who filed reports through the Speak Up Process hotline did so anonymously, which is consistent with benchmarks indicating a healthy reporting environment. Allstate policy and the Global Code of Business Conduct prohibit any form of retaliation for reporting a workplace or ethical concern.\n\nPrograms and performance\n\nEnterprise Business Conduct\n\nAllstate\u2019s Ethics, Regulatory Compliance and Privacy programs are supported by the Enterprise Business Conduct (EBC) team and the Compliance & Governance team, both led by the CECO. These teams regularly assess ethics, regulatory compliance and privacy risk at the enterprise, business and area of responsibility levels. They map over 60 potential risks across 30 business units and levels of operation. They evaluate inherent and residual risk, document requirements and controls, create plans and complete monitoring and testing to ensure ongoing compliance. They also identify and assess new laws and regulations to determine applicability, impact and remediation.\n\nTraining and education\n\nAllstate employees worldwide are required to complete annual ethics and compliance training and certification to the extent allowed by applicable law. In 2022, training was shortened and updated to align with the updated Global Code of Business Conduct. Allstate took a data-driven approach to determine how best to target training to each audience.\n\nThe Allstate Board of Directors receives training in ethics, decision-making, insider trading, cybersecurity, conflicts of interest and regulatory developments. As part of our Board of Directors annual compliance process, the Board reviews our six policies: anti-bribery, antitrust, insider trading, inclusive diversity, sexual harassment, violent crime, as well as the Global Code of Business Conduct.\nClimate strategy, disaster resiliency and operational footprint\n\nClimate change is one of the most critical challenges of our time, and insurers have an important role to play. Customers\u2019 homes are subject to increasingly severe weather catastrophes. In 2022, Allstate incurred 124 natural catastrophe events, totaling $3.1 billion. Catastrophic losses create volatility in shareholder returns. To mitigate our climate change impact, we focus on our operational footprint. We measure and aim to minimize greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the buildings and vehicles we own, the goods and services we buy and the ways we move about to do business.\n\nAccountability\n\nAllstate\u2019s business viability depends on effectively modeling, pricing and managing climate-related risks. We are developing products and services that address climate change and the transition to a lower-carbon future. We are also working internally and with our value chain to develop strategies and actions to meet our new net zero emission target. Senior management and the Board of Directors identify, measure, manage and monitor material risks, including those presented by climate change, such as severe weather and the potential for increased natural catastrophes. Allstate\u2019s chief risk officer and other senior leaders report regularly to our Board of Directors about climate change risks and opportunities.\n\nClimate strategy & risk management\n\nIn December 2022, Allstate announced a commitment to achieve net zero emissions for direct, indirect and value-chain greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 in alignment with the Paris Agreement. By the end of 2025, we will establish a goal for our financed emissions. We will also continue to evaluate emerging methodologies associated with GHG emissions from underwriting activities. Allstate\u2019s Sustainability team guides and develops the strategy to meet these goals. In addition, the Sustainability team develops the annual Sustainability Report, responds to ratings and rankings questionnaires, drives employee awareness and engagement, and reports monthly to the ESG Steering Committee. The Sustainability team also supports regular ESG updates to the Board of Directors.\n\nAllstate manages climate risks using our integrated Enterprise Risk and Return Management (ERRM) Framework, which applies risk and return principles, modeling and analytics, governance and transparent dialogue to proactively manage the company\u2019s highest-priority risks. The Enterprise Risk and Return Council (ERRC) evaluates climate change risk in coordination with the ESG Steering Committee. For a detailed review of Allstate\u2019s approach to climate risk, see our 2022 TCFD Response.\nPolicies and practices\n\nClimate policy\nManaging climate risk is also foundational to Allstate\u2019s financial and operational success. Early in 2023, Allstate developed a climate policy that covers relevant business practices relating to decarbonization and biodiversity.\n\nClimate change modeling\nAllstate\u2019s Catastrophe Modeling and Analytics team and pricing groups assess climate change information and update product and risk leadership as needed. The team uses information from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and the Actuaries Climate Index (ACI). The IPCC and USGCRP evaluate research by climate scientists around the world and conduct reviews to provide reliable information to decision-makers. The ACI provides an objective measure of extreme weather and sea level rise over time through quarterly updates. To help inform Allstate\u2019s approach to increased insurance risk, we use Verisk, a hurricane modeling software that looks at data from years with above average sea surface temperatures and the resulting landfalls of hurricanes. The Responsible Investing Committee and the Investments Risk Committee assess Allstate\u2019s portfolio for potential short- and long-term exposures to climate change. Finally, Allstate is partnering with our reinsurance brokers to understand future changes to the hazard component of catastrophe models prompted by climate change.\n\nPhysical climate risk adaptation\nAllstate adapts to changes in weather and helps develop solutions for risk areas. We use reinsurance and third-party products to continue providing protection to customers. We hold sufficient capital to remain viable as a business and withstand extreme scenarios beyond the 1-100 probability level. Allstate creates and analyzes scenarios to explore events that may not be well represented in historical data, including extremely low frequency scenarios (ELFS). The scenarios we create and analyze vary widely and include combinations of economic turbulence, financial market stress, pandemics, severe weather and catastrophe events.\n\nPartnerships to advance resiliency\nAllstate is an active member and financial supporter of the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety (IBHS). IBHS translates scientific data into actionable recommendations that prevent avoidable suffering, strengthen our homes and businesses, inform the insurance industry and support thriving communities. Allstate partners with IBHS to promote more durable homes and buildings through better building practices and stronger codes.\n\nIn 2022, Allstate partnered with the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies (NAMIC) to advance climate resiliency efforts, including measures contained in the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Allstate also worked with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on climate risk and resiliency efforts. These efforts include supporting the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and continuing to advocate for long-term reauthorization of the National Flood Insurance Program. Allstate is also a member of the Business Roundtable, which prioritizes climate risk and resiliency.\n\nAdvocating for disaster prevention, preparedness and risk response\nAllstate is fighting for more resiliency for property owners facing catastrophic events such as wildfires, floods and hurricanes. We support additional federal resources for climate change mitigation and adaptation, including for programs like FEMA\u2019s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC), which offers grants for mitigation and related activities. Allstate is a champion for pooled solutions to protect consumers in high-risk areas, such as establishing a Florida-style catastrophe fund to help stabilize California\u2019s homeowners market, along with other reforms and mitigation funding. We have also helped create public risk sharing pools in Florida, Texas and California to provide customers with affordable protection for uninsurable risks.\nGreenhouse gas emissions\n\nTo understand Allstate\u2019s impact on climate and our work to manage that impact, we have measured our annual GHG emissions since 2007. We quantify our GHG emissions in units of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e), which includes the emissions from various greenhouse gases and converts them, on the basis of their global-warming potential (GWP), to the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide. See our 2023 CDP Climate Change report, once published, for our measured and verified emissions from calendar year 2022. At the time of publishing this report, our most up to date, complete emissions inventory was from calendar year 2021. In 2021, as in every year since 2014, we measured and verified our Scope 1 and 2 emissions and measured Scope 3 emissions for categories 1-7 (see below) and verified Scope 3 Category 6, business travel.\n\n| Scope 1 (mt CO2e) | Emissions from sources Allstate owns and has operational control over, like burning natural gas in our facilities or gasoline in our fleet of vehicles. |\n|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 20,932            |                                                                                                                                  |\n\n| Scope 2 (mt CO2e) | Emissions associated with Allstate\u2019s purchased energy use that occur in locations we do not own or control, like the electricity that powers our facilities. |\n|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 69,332            |                                                                                                                                  |\n\n| Scope 3 (mt CO2e) | Emissions not produced or owned by Allstate that we\u2019re indirectly responsible for, up and down our value chain. Of the 15 Scope 3 categories, Allstate measures and reports emissions for categories relevant to our supply chain where data is currently available. |\n|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 523,313           |                                                                                                                                  |\n\n- Category 1 - Purchased goods and services\n- Category 2 - Capital goods\n- Category 3 - Fuel- and energy-related activities\n- Category 4 - Upstream transportation and distribution\n- Category 5 - Waste generated in operations\n- Category 6 - Business travel [verified]\n- Category 7 - Employee commuting\n\nEmissions displayed in this image are also depicted in Allstate\u2019s CDP Climate Change reports, which are available to view at CDP.net and AllstateSustainability.com. CDP reports disclose emissions and climate-related activities from the full calendar year prior to the year of publishing. Thus emissions data from calendar year 2022 will be publicly available when CDP reports are published in Q3 of 2023. Changes we made to our real estate portfolio, facilities management and fleet composition and use have generally resulted in year-over-year reductions in Allstate\u2019s Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Scope 3 emissions are more nuanced, and Allstate has been working to refine our calculation methodologies. Recent refinements, particularly to our purchased goods and services calculations, make our 2020 and 2021 Scope 3 emissions more comparable to one another than to those in years prior.\nClimate strategy, disaster resiliency and operational footprint\n\nScope 3 emissions\n\nEmissions displayed in this image are also available in Allstate\u2019s CDP Climate Change Reports, which are available to view at CDP.net and AllstateSustainability.com. CDP reports disclose emissions and climate-related activities from the full calendar year prior to the year of publishing. Thus emissions data from calendar year 2022 will be publicly available when CDP reports are published in Q3 of 2023.\n\nMeasuring these GHG emissions gives us data to develop and prioritize reduction strategies. The practices and programs described below have already led to GHG emissions reductions paired with improved client and employee satisfaction. With our recent net zero commitment and forthcoming climate strategy, we expect to further accelerate our emissions reductions.\n\nTotal Scope 3 Emissions in (MT CO2e)\n(categories below)\n\n1. **Purchased goods and services**\n   Emissions associated with the goods and services Allstate purchases to operate our business.\n\n2. **Capital goods**\n   Emissions associated with the capitalized assets Allstate acquires to operate our business.\n\n3. **Fuel- and energy-related activities**\n   Emissions associated with the upstream extraction, production and transportation of the fuel and energy that Allstate eventually uses to power our business activities.\n\n4. **Upstream transportation and distribution**\n   Emissions associated with Allstate\u2019s third-party logistics, postage, shipping, warehousing and storage providers.\n\n5. **Waste generated in operations**\n   Emissions from waste disposed via landfilling, recycling and composting at a subset of our facilities for which we have access to detailed waste data.\n\n6. **Business travel**\n   Emissions from air travel, car rental, hotel stays and employee mobile expense claims when traveling for Allstate business.\n\n7. **Employee commuting**\n   Emissions from employee commutes to and from work at Allstate, as well as from electricity and natural gas used by employees when working from home.\nReal estate emissions reductions\n\nAs part of Allstate\u2019s multi-year strategy, during 2022 we reduced our real estate footprint of owned and leased Allstate and National General facilities from over 9 million square feet to under 7 million square feet. This downsizing of real estate reduced our operational energy and water usage, GHG emissions and waste production.\n\nIn 2022, lighting updates saved an additional 211,167 kWh of electricity.\n\nWe reduced our energy consumption further by recapturing heat energy as a byproduct of Allstate\u2019s data center operations and using energy-efficient equipment and systems. In 2022, lighting updates in some of our remaining facilities saved an additional 211,167 kWh of electricity.\n\nLEED\n\nLEED provides a framework for the implementation of sustainable, healthy and equitable elements in building design, construction and remodeling. The LEED certification helps recognize \u201cgreen\u201d buildings that have achieved high standards in these areas. As of Dec. 31, 2022, Allstate leased or owned more than 694,000 square feet of LEED-certified space. As Allstate builds or purchases new spaces, we strive to build to LEED standards or lease LEED-certified spaces. In 2022, we added more than 229,000 square feet of LEED-certified space to our portfolio, compared to year-end 2021. As noted above, due to our square footage reduction efforts, our overall footprint decreased despite this increase in LEED-certified space.\n\nRenewable Energy Credits (RECs)\n\nAllstate\u2019s priority in terms of GHG emissions is to prevent them from happening. Our real estate reductions, reuse and recycling partnerships and sustainable procurement decisions work together with continued focus on limiting our emissions where possible. Until the electrical grids in our operating locations fully decarbonize, however, providing power to our facilities will continue to produce GHG emissions. To compensate, we purchase renewable energy credits (RECs). In 2021, Allstate purchased RECs to cover 100% of the 44,319 MWh of electricity use from our Illinois and Texas facilities. This represents 26% of our total U.S. electricity use from owned and leased facilities in that year and is equivalent to 20,579 metric tonnes of CO2e emissions. For an update on Allstate\u2019s use of RECs in 2022, keep an eye out for our 2023 CDP report in Q3, available at CDP.net and AllstateSustainability.com.\n\nPrograms and performance\n\nIn addition to managing risk from the changing environment broadly, we are reducing our contributions to the climate crisis in both our internal operations and along our value chain. Below are a few highlights.\n\nClimate strategy\n\nOver the past decade, Allstate has reduced its Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions through efforts including energy efficiency, occupied building reductions and increased use of hybrid vehicles in Allstate and National General fleets. To achieve our ambitious targets, we are developing our decarbonization strategy in 2023. This strategy will outline the levers and opportunities of focus needed to achieve our commitments. We will estimate the emissions reductions achieved by each lever in order to prioritize our emissions reduction initiatives. Key reduction levers will likely include renewable energy, increased energy efficiency, supply chain engagement, fleet electrification and commuting strategies. Allstate plans to expand its Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) report in the future to reflect the work done on measuring both operational emissions and financed emissions.\n\nSustainable sourcing\n\nAllstate\u2019s chief procurement officer (CPO) incorporates sustainability initiatives into Allstate\u2019s purchasing practices. The CPO implemented a sustainability program as part of Sourcing & Procurement Solutions to assess the environmental risks and opportunities within Allstate\u2019s supply chain and purchasing operations enterprise-wide, including the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nCDP performance\n\nCDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) is a not-for-profit organization that oversees a global disclosure system for investors, companies, cities, states and regions to manage and report environmental impacts. Allstate has been disclosing emissions in our CDP submission since 2010. In 2022, Allstate achieved a \"C\" score for our CDP Climate Change submission, indicating awareness-level engagement on environmental stewardship. In 2023, we aim to improve this score through our increased efforts on decarbonization for internal operations and supply chain. Allstate's historical CDP responses can be viewed at AllstateSustainability.com or at CDP.net.\n\nIn 2022, Allstate requested that select companies in our supply chain disclose their environmental data through CDP Supply Chain. In 2022, we received emissions data from 157 suppliers, for a 93% response rate. Both the number of responses as well as the response rate represent increases over 2021. Estimated annual CO2 savings was 46 million mtCO2e, and annual monetary savings from emissions reductions was $10 billion; 59% of responding suppliers reported active climate targets.\n\nAllstate\u2019s vehicle fleet\n\nAllstate operates a fleet of vehicles to support business travel requirements across the company. Allstate\u2019s goal is to have 100% hybrid vehicles by 2025 and to incorporate fully electric vehicles thereafter. At the end of 2022, Allstate\u2019s legacy fleet was 85% hybrid, and the company\u2019s total fleet, which includes Avail and National General vehicles, was 52% hybrid. Avail is moving to a zero-fleet model through peer-to-peer car-sharing, and each time a National General vehicle is no longer serviceable, it is replaced with a hybrid.\n\nPaper reduction\n\nTo prevent waste, Allstate reduces printing and paper use and instead encourages electronic documents and communications whenever possible. In 2019, record retention for claim files was reduced from 25 to 7 years, shrinking our Record Center footprint and minimizing Record Center operating costs from $6.2 million in 2016 to approximately $2.1 million in 2022. From 2019-2022, we reduced mailings by 21% (32 million mailings reduction), paper use by 23% (1.55 billion pounds of paper reduction), and envelope use by 27% (54 million envelope reduction). In addition to reducing our use of paper, we recycled approximately 470,800 pounds of paper in 2022.\n\nAllstate has made significant progress toward eliminating paper consumption by digitizing the procurement process. In 2022, our e-signature system executed 3,566 electronic contracts with suppliers. In addition, Allstate offers paperless billing and up to a 10% discount for customers who go paperless. Allstate has invested $12.5 million in improving customers\u2019 digital, paperless experience since 2015.\n\nWindshield recycling partnership\n\nAllstate partners with Safelite to provide customers with windshield glass replacement and recycling services. Safelite recycles the damaged windshield that it removes, separating the glass and vinyl interlayer, which is then converted into new products such as fiberglass insulation and carpet backing. Safelite reports that 1 ton of CO2 emissions is prevented for every 6 tons of glass recycled, and through this partnership, Allstate recycled 3,604 tons of glass during 2022. The long-term benefits of our valued partnership include the reduction of waste to landfills, energy conservation and the creation of eight jobs for every 1,000 tons of glass recycled.\n\nVehicle reuse and recycling partnership\n\nWhen extreme weather events produce thousands of repairable flood-damaged vehicles, Allstate partners with Copart\u2019s recovery services and online auction to retrieve, resell and remarket these vehicles. Extending the life of vehicles and parts has a positive effect on Allstate\u2019s bottom line, reduces the carbon emissions and costs associated with manufacturing and keeps scarce materials in use in support of a more circular economy.\nElectronics reuse and recycling partnership\n\nAllstate works with Danlaw Inc., HOBI International and Reconext (formerly Clover Wireless Inc.) to keep electronics in circulation and operating efficiently and to recycle them. Our customers\u2019 recovered Milewise and Drivewise devices are digitally wiped and tested for functionality by Danlaw. Danlaw then sends them to Arity for redeployment or buys back retired but resellable devices, reconditioning them and providing Arity with a credit on new device purchases.\n\nDevices that are not able to be resold are recycled by HOBI or Danlaw in partnership with Allstate and Arity. Allstate facilities nationwide dispose of IT and mobile assets using certified women-owned business enterprise HOBI International Inc. In 2022, Allstate\u2019s partnership with HOBI kept 39,249 electronic devices in circulation through reuse, and recycled 7,101 more, recovering precious metals that could be reused without compromising sensitive information.\n\nReconext has also provided its services to Allstate since 2017, salvaging small electronic devices, such as cellphones and tablets, that cannot be repaired or restored, simplifying collection/shipping, reporting/payment and customer support.\n\nManaging supplier impacts\n\nThe Sourcing & Procurement Solutions team oversees the Allstate Sustainable Procurement Program to mitigate corporate risks and align procurement decisions with environmental and social sustainability. The Responsible Procurement team oversees our sustainable procurement strategy, which increases visibility in the supply chain and evaluates, tracks and mitigates risk exposures.\n\nAll suppliers doing business with Allstate must adhere to our Supplier Code of Business Conduct. In 2022, we updated the code\u2019s Environmental Stewardship section to include expectations relating to our suppliers\u2019 climate action, environmentally preferred products and services, CDP disclosure, and the measurement and public disclosure of their climate activities. As of 2022, Allstate also expects suppliers to implement their own codes of conduct, in addition to adhering to Allstate\u2019s. To support suppliers who have not yet met this expectation, Allstate shares resources to help them develop their code of conduct.\n\nAlso new in 2022, Allstate implemented a Diversity and Sustainability Contract Governance Standard Process. Contractual sustainability language was added as a rider to existing contracts and now appears in all new contract templates. The language establishes ESG expectations of suppliers and holds suppliers accountable for their ESG performance and actions, which can cause risk to Allstate\u2019s brand and reputation.\nResponsible investing\n\nAs responsible investors, we consider ESG an essential component of comprehensive investment risk assessment. We have developed teams, policies, training and goals to guide Allstate investment decisions accordingly. We continue to increase the percentage of our portfolio allocated to responsible investments, actively evaluate how ESG issues influence investment performance and pursue investment strategies that capture additional risk-adjusted return from the transition to a lower-carbon economy.\n\nAccountability\n\nAllstate\u2019s Responsible Investing Committee (RIC) includes representatives from a cross-functional group drawn from Allstate Investments, with the chairperson of the RIC also a member of Allstate\u2019s ESG Steering Committee. The RIC monitors ESG investing trends, evaluates ESG investing best practices, supports the work of the ESG Steering Committee and periodically reports about its activities to other senior leaders within Allstate as well as to the Allstate Board of Directors. In conjunction with Allstate\u2019s Investments Risk Committee, the RIC monitors our investment portfolio for potential exposures to climate change risks or impacts.\n\nWe classify sectors based on exposure to environmental risks, including climate change, and incorporate environmental risks in the sizing and maturity profile of our positions. Sectors with higher potential exposure are primarily invested in through public markets, providing flexibility to adjust exposures. We classify commercial real estate investments based on their modeled exposure to catastrophe risks and incorporate these risks in our underwriting and insurance practices. We continue to evolve our risk management processes regarding climate risk.\n\nPolicies and practices\n\nSince its adoption in June 2020, our Responsible Investing Policy has outlined our expectations for investment professionals to incorporate and consider ESG factors when making investment decisions subject to client requirements. We request that our external money managers do the same. The policy applies across all asset classes in our investment portfolio. We revisit the Responsible Investing Policy each year. In addition to the Responsible Investing Policy, our Investment Management Guidelines state that investment managers\u2019 analyses and decision-making should consider ESG issues alongside Allstate\u2019s values and reputation when assessing the risk/return trade-off of an investment.\nOur investment professionals participate in annual training, as outlined in the Responsible Investing Policy. In 2022, training was captured in part by an Allstate Climate Summit, with industry-diverse speakers presenting on climate topics such as climate risks and modeling, climate opportunities, regenerative agriculture, carbon pricing and more. We incorporate tools for ESG and climate-related data into our processes and train the Investments team on their use. By the end of 2025, we will establish a goal for our financed emissions.\n\n**Restricted securities**\n\nAllstate expects our investment professionals to refrain from investing in companies, funds or assets that are fundamentally inconsistent with Allstate\u2019s values or are likely to result in significant risks. The company does not invest in companies whose primary business is civilian firearms, or majority ownership interest or control of companies that (either directly or through a subsidiary) operate a coal or other mine or provide services to those mines.\n\n**Programs and performance**\n\nAllstate has historically incorporated ESG considerations broadly across the entire portfolio. We\u2019re a founding member of Impact Community Capital, which will celebrate its 25th anniversary this year. As of Dec. 31, 2022, we managed a $61.8 billion investment portfolio, with $7.5 billion in responsible investment categories such as education, sustainability, affordable housing, health care, green bonds, diverse sponsors, natural capital and renewable investments. We integrate ESG considerations within our investment analysis and decision-making processes and have established climate change and IDE as two pillars important to our investing approach. We do so while continuing to meet expectations to have a positive financial impact.\n\nWe announced a goal in 2021 to expand climate-related investment capabilities and relationships, striving for at least $375 million in commitments between 2021 and 2022. We achieved this goal, and by year-end 2022, we had committed $469 million in climate-related opportunities. After an above average investment year of $408 million in 2021, we intentionally moderated our investment activity in 2022, impacting our goal of investing $300 million in new commitments to low-income housing tax credits for the year. Nonetheless, we committed $255 million in low-income housing tax credits, bringing our book value of capital to benefit underserved communities to $1.4 billion in 2022. We also exceeded our 2022 goal of maintaining 2% of trading volumes with minority, women and veteran banking enterprises. In doing so, we achieved 2.3% of total trading volume with these diverse brokers \u2014 a more than 4x increase relative to historical volumes of 0.5%. We aimed for $180 million in new commitments with diverse investment sponsors and managers in 2022, nearly three times our historical annual average. While we fell short during the year at $112 million (nearly twice our historical average) due to market dynamics, we closed an additional $65 million in commitments in January 2023 for a total of $177 million in new commitments.\nInclusive Diversity & Equity\n\nThe Board of Directors actively supports Allstate\u2019s Inclusive Diversity & Equity (IDE) strategy that is championed by Allstate\u2019s IDE team, Sustainability team and ESG Steering Committee. Allstate\u2019s performance in workforce diversity meets or exceeds external benchmarks. In 2022, women made up approximately 58% of our workforce, and 42% of our employees were racially or ethnically diverse. For more on our company demographics, please see our EEO-1 report.\n\nAccountability\n\nAllstate strives to be a differentiated IDE leader among major corporations by eliminating inequities in our business practices, culture and communities. Allstate\u2019s multi-year IDE strategy builds on existing efforts around hiring, talent development, investing and supplier diversity. We focus on diverse perspectives, experiences and engagements that contribute to a more inclusive and equitable workforce.\n\nGoals\n\nWe strengthen our commitment and accountability to drive greater results through our enterprise goals.\n\nPeople\n\n- Allstate strives to increase female and racially and/or ethnically diverse workforce representation and has set multi-year targets to achieve this goal.\n- We accelerate development, advancement and retention of diverse talent through sponsorship, mentorship and leadership development programs.\n- We advance Allstate\u2019s commitment to the OneTen initiative by broadening the path for Black talent without a four-year degree into the talent pipeline and creating a more equitable environment to attain family-sustaining jobs.\n- We engage our diverse network of Allstate agents across the country to mirror the communities where they live and serve.\n- Allstate\u2019s talent management strategies aim to improve the skills and capabilities of all employees.\nInclusive Diversity & Equity\n\nBusiness practices\n\n\u2022 Allstate integrates IDE into our core policies, processes and decision-making.\n\u2022 Allstate is committed to spending with diverse suppliers and investing with diverse sponsors and managers as an integrated part of our business practice.\n\nCulture\n\n\u2022 IDE is one of Allstate\u2019s core values and a foundation of Our Shared Purpose. We\u2019re creating a culture of inclusivity and equity.\n\u2022 We measure Allstate\u2019s culture of inclusivity and employee sentiment through annual and quarterly engagement surveys.\n\u2022 We encourage and foster IDE mindsets and behaviors through learning experiences and engagement with Employee Impact Groups (EIGs).\n\nCommunity\n\n\u2022 Allstate advances racial equity by contributing to funds through The Allstate Foundation to close the racial opportunity gap.\n\u2022 We create and strengthen ongoing relationships with diverse external organizations, including minority-serving institutions such as historically Black colleges and universities and the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities.\n\nPolicies and practices\n\nEmployee Impact Groups (EIGs)\n\nIn 2022, Allstate renamed its Employee Resource Groups as Employee Impact Groups to focus on their impact on integrating IDE into business practices as well as culture. Allstate\u2019s EIGs are diverse communities that enhance the employee experience through engagement, development and collaboration. As of January 2023, Allstate had nine EIGs. We also have Business Impact Groups (BIGs), voluntary employee-led groups that create opportunities for employees to work together to create business solutions. In 2022, more than 7,700 employees participated in an EIG or BIG, with 47% of those employees participating in two or more groups.\n\nSupplier inclusion\n\nAllstate\u2019s diverse suppliers must provide certification as a minority-, woman-, veteran-, LGBTQ- or disabled-owned business. In 2022, our supply chain partners included 2,500 diverse suppliers, a 25% increase from 2021, and we spent $386 million with diverse suppliers, compared to $366 million in 2021. We are especially proud of this outcome because we started the year with a $100 million deficit as a result of two diverse suppliers selling their businesses to new owners that do not meet our diverse supplier criteria. In 2022, we also extended our focus on creating economic equity through women-owned suppliers in India. Through that expansion, we identified $4 million in spending that is being directed toward women-owned businesses.\n\nIn 2022, Allstate also revised its approach to contracting. Instead of distributing formal requests for proposals, we identified diverse suppliers, built relationships with them, assessed their capabilities, contracted with them and shared their core competencies with key decision-makers. A recent analysis indicated that $1 spent with Allstate\u2019s diverse suppliers drives $1.80 in total economic production. This means the economic impact of Allstate\u2019s purchases with diverse-owned suppliers in 2022 is estimated at over $694 million, which supports jobs and wages/benefits within that supply chain and the communities where those businesses operate.\n\nIn 2022, our supply chain spent\n\n$386M\nwith 2,500 diverse suppliers\nBuilding ties with diverse groups through memberships\n\nAllstate works with select organizations to conduct national benchmarking, connect with diverse suppliers and identify successful practices in supplier diversity. In 2022, Allstate\u2019s senior vice president of Sourcing & Procurement Solutions became a member of the Board of Directors of Women\u2019s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC). We also sponsored its Women of Color (WOC) Student Entrepreneurial Program at Florida A&M University to help develop the next generation of female entrepreneurs of color.\n\nIDE integration\n\nIn addition to pursuing IDE in our workforce and among our suppliers in 2022, we now consider how every aspect of our business can benefit from this work. We launched the Allstate IDE ACT (Accountability, Clarity, Transparency) Framework to integrate IDE strategy, goals and collaboration across Allstate. This model ensures joint accountability, drives lower-cost execution, reduces complexity by clarifying roles and creating an IDE ecosystem of sharing and business area partnership with IDE leadership.\n\nPrograms and performance\n\nAllstate\u2019s inclusive culture and emphasis on diversity and equity are strengthened through day-to-day activities and practices that encourage us to focus on our values.\n\nTalent planning*\n\nIn 2022, Allstate implemented a monthly IDE Talent Scorecard to track progress against our vision of becoming a differentiated leader in IDE and to develop a workforce that mirrors the diversity of the communities and customers Allstate serves. Our IDE Talent Scorecard holds leaders accountable for strategic people and culture change. It assesses the gender and racial/ethnic diversity of Allstate\u2019s current talent pool, as well as the diversity within each phase of the talent lifecycle (i.e., hiring, promotion, departure, etc.). The first of these monthly scorecards was produced in June, and they have continued since. In 2022, we established roadmaps for using data and technology to help select the right talent for roles while eliminating bias from the process. A vendor for a talent intelligence platform will be selected in 2023, with implementation in 2023 and 2024.\n\nInclusive hiring\n\nWe partner with our Employee Impact Groups and external organizations to encourage a more diverse referral pipeline. These recruitment efforts are also supported by initiatives including:\n\n- Our apprenticeships in Human Resources, Cybersecurity and Allstate Technology.\n- Our Returnship program, which focuses on mid-level software engineers returning to the workforce after a gap in employment due to caregiving.\n- The Asset Manager Diversity Accelerator (AMDA) program we launched with William Blair and LGIM America in 2022. This two-year rotational development program supports diverse and under-represented job seekers in the asset management field.\n- Our work with programs like Junior Achievement and One Million Degrees that encourage youth empowerment through education initiatives, including career programming and mentorship.\n- Our support of Bottom Line, an organization that partners with degree-aspiring students of color from under-resourced communities to get into and through college and successfully launch a career.\n- The Externship program we hosted in 2022 with Bottom Line students, which included job shadowing, professional development and skill building.\n\n*Allstate has not made, and will not make, any hiring or contracting decisions on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, disability, age, or any other protected characteristic. Rather, as this document reflects, Allstate is committed to achieving its goals to increase diversity, and the representation of underrepresented groups, by recruiting diverse talent into its candidate pipeline.\nPerformance and pay practices review\n\nIn 2022, we increased our minimum wage to $17 - $20 per hour, depending on location, the second increase in the last two years. We analyze pay equity every year, comparing the pay of men and women, and non-minorities and minorities in similar jobs. If we identify statistically significant gaps in pay, we make adjustments. In 2022, we added pay ranges to 100% of our job listings, and diverse workforce representation targets were added as one of the Performance Stock Award measures for leaders.\n\nWorkforce Inclusive Diversity & Equity training\n\nAllstate educates recruiters, managers and hiring managers to foster inclusive hiring and ensure diversity and equity are valued in the workplace. We require all new employees to complete IDE training. In 2022, Allstaters completed more than 31,000 IDE courses. In 2022, we did an audit of our existing IDE training and launched a new IDE education strategy to build intercultural competence and an inclusive culture. We measure the impact of course offerings on our employees and our business.\n\nTraining the next generation of diverse suppliers\n\nIn 2022, we expanded the Supplier Diversity Exchange and renamed it the Business Diversity Summit. The weeklong intensive training event had over 2,100 attendees, 30 sessions and dozens of speakers. We expanded the audience to include Allstate employees, diverse and prime suppliers, and individuals from academia and government. Recognizing the overlap in third parties contracting across the insurance industry and Allstate\u2019s power to drive change, we also invited Allstate peers. While these companies are competitors in the traditional business sense, we appreciate the value of their collaboration toward a diverse and sustainable supply chain.\n\nSince 2004, Allstate has spent a total of $5.6 billion with diverse suppliers. Currently, we\u2019re taking a more holistic approach to impacting our supply chain, going beyond recruiting, supporting and increasing our spending with diverse tier 1 suppliers (the companies we purchase from directly). We\u2019re finding ways to enhance the diversity of our majority-owned tier 1 suppliers. We encourage all suppliers to hire diversely and to increase the diversity of their suppliers (our tier 2 suppliers). For suppliers that need extra support launching diversity programs, we offer free consultation services from our business diversity team. With this expanded approach, we revised the way we describe our work, from \u201csupplier diversity\u201d to \u201cbusiness diversity.\u201d\n\nIn 2022, Allstate deepened its work with historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs). Allstate awarded Sales Leadership scholarships to students at 27 HBCUs. This is the first step in a multiyear program where HBCU students can apply for additional scholarships and internships, become licensed salespeople and eventually join the company full time. In December 2022, Allstate Government and Industry Relations and our Inclusive Diversity & Equity team hosted a meet and greet with Rep. Nikema Williams of Georgia, Allstate leaders and select HBCU scholarship recipients. Allstate is a long-standing sponsor of the HBCU Celebration Bowl and is embarking on a new partnership as a presenting sponsor of the 2023 HBCU All-Star Battle of the Bands.\nOrganizational culture and employee well-being\n\nAn engaged, empowered and diverse workforce is critical to Allstate\u2019s success. In 2022, Allstate\u2019s People Experience and Culture teams gathered employee feedback, assessed employee journeys and developed employee personas to revise our Employee Value Proposition. Allstate also devotes resources to occupational health and safety and benefits programs to support employees\u2019 physical health, financial security, personal well-being and work-life balance.\n\nAccountability\n\nOur Human Resources team ensures a strong commitment to culture through a focus on Allstate\u2019s Culture and Employee Experience. Learn more about succession planning and Board review in the 2023 Proxy Statement. Allstate\u2019s Enterprise Workforce Safety Committee meets regularly to discuss safety issues and includes representatives from several departments.\n\nPolicies and practices\n\nAs we accelerate Transformative Growth, we are focusing on how we recruit, retain, develop and engage employees. Organizational culture is included as a key risk category overseen by the Board. In 2022, Allstate\u2019s Culture and Employee Value Proposition team continued the work to formalize our approach to culture change and provide a research-based view of improving the employee experience.\n\nThe Learning and Performance teams delivered live training sessions to more continuously connect goal setting and feedback to performance approaches. Pilot teams helped us test and revise a decision clarity framework. The new framework, called DRIVE, enables faster and clearer decision-making and is being supported with monthly live learning sessions, on-demand e-learning, videos, reference documents and tools to support transparent decision-making. In 2022, a community of practice was established to enable employees to learn from each other.\nOrganizational culture and employee well-being\n\nSafety training and education\nSafety training is tailored to each employee\u2019s role. In 2022, employees participated in online training for workplace violence prevention. Allstate provides employees annual training that exceeds requirements set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. In 2022, Allstate provided targeted safety training to 584 employees, and we conducted 19 safety risk assessments. Additionally, our communications center, service centers, record center and engineering employees require specific training.\n\nPrograms and performance\n\nPlanning and recruitment\nBefore an Allstater joins our team, we use data and technology to know when, where and who we need to hire. With the rise of remote work, our online learning platforms for hiring and onboarding have been critical to our success in planning and recruitment. In 2022, we developed roadmaps for the use of talent identification technology to ensure we are selecting the right talent for roles and eliminating bias from the process.\n\nGood Start\nBased on feedback from new hires, we revised the new employee orientation, Good Start, to ensure a consistent experience, sense of belonging and connection for new Allstate employees. Good Start includes resources that help employees connect to the company\u2019s culture, business strategy and learning and development from the onset of an employee journey. New employee engagement increased from 80% in 2021 to 87% in 2022.\n\nInspire Survey\nAllstate and its family of companies received the Inspire Survey in 2022, and 71% of eligible employees responded. We examined the Inspire Survey results by race/ethnicity, gender and tenure to identify opportunities to support specific groups. Based on results from the Inspire Survey, in 2022, 83% of employees reported that senior leaders are role models for Allstate\u2019s values, an increase from the reported 79% in 2021, and in 2022, 92% of employees reported that their immediate managers create an environment of trust, a slight increase from the reported 91% in 2021.\n\nSpring Health\nIn 2022, Allstate launched Spring Health, a free mental health and emotional well-being benefit integrated into its medical plans. Spring Health also provides confidential services to each family member. Spring Health offers unlimited access to in-network coaching and medication management for up to six therapy sessions beyond the six Allstate-sponsored sessions.\n\nAllstate Good Life\u00ae\nThrough our Good Life well-being programs, we have a network of approximately 200 Well-being Champions who help create a culture of well-being. Allstate\u2019s Well-being Champion Community provides a grassroots approach to well-being and in 2022, they supported 42 Thrive Book Clubs. Our Well-being Champions ensure employees are educated and empowered to access well-being benefits.\n\nEnergy for Life (EFL)\nEnergy for Life is centered on purpose, resilience and stress management programs to improve employee mental and physical well-being. The program is offered companywide and includes Allstate India and Allstate Northern Ireland employees, in addition to employees located in the United States. In 2022, Allstate added two hourlong EFL courses, and Allstaters in the United States, Northern Ireland and India completed 11,639 EFL courses. As of Dec. 31, 2022, 48% of active employees and 58% of active managers had completed at least one Energy for Life course.\nOrganizational culture and employee well-being\n\nAll Mama\nAllstate India offers a motherhood benefit, All Mama, to support its female employees during and after pregnancy. Facilitated by an external vendor, Allstate India\u2019s 18-month program facilitates a smooth transition into motherhood followed by a return to work.\n\nVirgin Pulse and RethinkCare\nAs part of our Virgin Pulse partnership, Allstate provides access to the resilience and stress management tool RethinkCare, which has digital programs to improve employee well-being. In 2022, Allstate expanded access to the RethinkCare library from less than 30 to more than 2,000 resources across a broader range of topics. This resulted in a 128% increase in sessions completed in 2022 compared with 2021. In 2022, Allstaters completed 186,468 RethinkCare sessions, with 1.6 million minutes spent in RethinkCare training.\n\nThrive programs\nOur Thrive programs promote dialogue, engagement, connection, awareness and behavior change related to holistic well-being with an emphasis on mental health. In 2022, more than 4,993 unique employees participated in our live Thrive Talk self-care programming. Many employees participated on more than one occasion, totaling 16,336 attendees of Thrive Talk sessions throughout the year. We saw an average of 67 employees participate in our free weekly virtual yoga and meditation classes in 2022.\n\nEnterprise learning and development\n\nContinued learning\nIn 2022, our Degreed program continued to provide Allstaters with learning opportunities to support Transformative Growth. Based on feedback from employees and leadership, the launch of Degreed and the rollout of core capabilities helped employees develop professional skills and better understand what skills are needed for the future. In 2022, Allstaters completed 1,130,062 courses, with 35,882 unique learners, and 469,172 hours of learning.\n\nIn 2022, we launched Degreed pathways to help employees learn and apply market-ready skills: Innovation, Change Agility, Customer Focus, Agile Work, Virtual Work, Data Analysis and Introduction to Programming Languages. Allstaters completed 596 micro-credential courses in 2022, 46% more than in 2021.\n\nTuition assistance\nAllstate offers tuition reimbursement to all employees for undergraduate, graduate and doctoral college degree programs. In 2022, Allstate provided $2.6 million in financial assistance to 720 employees who participated. To support engagement with this program, there were 971 academic advising sessions held to help participants select the right school and degree to meet their career objectives and financial needs.\n\nFree for Me\nAllstate\u2019s Free for Me program prepays tuition expenses for participants to ensure employees have zero out-of-pocket expenses. After a successful start at two of Allstate\u2019s largest call center departments in 2022, the pilot program ended, and the Free for Me program will subsequently be fully implemented in 2023. All active full-time and active regular part-time employees may apply to take courses eligible for tuition assistance.\n\nDepartment-specific development\nAs a founding partner of the Asset Manager Diversity Accelerator (AMDA), Allstate hosts a two-year rotational development program to support diverse and under-represented job seekers. In 2022, Claims Learning and Development (CLD) continued offering courses for auto estimating and property estimating.\nAllstate Enterprise Solutions (AES) created learning adviser roles to deliver plans for key skill development in artificial intelligence and machine learning. By Dec. 31, 2022, more than 6,000 AES global employees representing 97% of AES had completed all eight Power Skills in the Outcome-Based Delivery Power Skills Series. This represented a total of more than 51,000 Power Skills completed, with an estimated 76,000 hours of learning focused just on skills needed for the future.\n\n**Live and on-demand seminars**\n\nIn addition to formal training, Allstate provides a variety of in-house learning and development seminars \u2013 streamed live and recorded throughout the year. In 2022, 459 employees attended the Skill Builders series created to help provide leaders with resources to continuously develop their teams on crucial skills for the future. Enterprise Learning and Development hosted a Global Learning Festival to promote a culture of learning and empower employees to learn skills with perspectives from industry experts, Allstate leaders and their peers. In 2022, 1,674 employees participated live in Allstate\u2019s Global Learning Festival.\n\n**Talent pipeline programs: leadership and mentoring**\n\n- The Accelerated Leadership Experience (ALX) provides participants with a mentor and career coach. ALX\u2019s foundational curriculum guides participants\u2019 learning and development as they collaborate and contribute to an IDE culture. The next ALX cohort, projected to launch in June 2023, will recruit both internal and external talent for participation.\n\n- In 2022, employees were offered more experiential learning through Allstate\u2019s Essentials of Leadership and Management (ELM) program, in which 1,550 employees accessed the curriculum. When surveyed, 59% of employees who participated in the ELM My Leadership Evolution program and 90% of employees who participated in the ELM Leader of the Future program were likely to recommend them to other Allstaters.\nOrganizational culture and employee well-being\n\n- The **Ezra Mobile Coaching** tool was designed to expand accessibility of a customized development tool to more leaders and reduce the cost of executive coaching. When launched in 2022, over 200 coaching sessions were delivered and 27 mid-level leaders were served. When participants were asked \u201cWould you recommend your coach to others?\u201d using a 5.0-point scale, the average response was 5.0/5.0. When asked, \u201cHow would you rate how Ezra is contributing to your professional development?\u201d the response was positive, 4.9/5.0.\n\n- McKinsey\u2019s **Connected Leaders Academy** is a series of leadership programs to help organizations demonstrate progress on inclusion and equity, improve talent pipelines and unlock the full potential of employees. The African American Working Network (AAWN) pioneered Allstate\u2019s participation in the academy in 2021, and participation expanded in 2022 with 50 participants in the Management Accelerator Program. This program will expand our 2023 participation to 155 participants.\n\n- In 2022, Allstate partnered with **Bonfire**, an external development program for women, and nominated 296 high-potential Allstate women leaders to participate. The program helped place more women in the executive succession pipeline, addressed gender disparity among leadership and provided leaders with valuable allyship tools.\n\n- In partnership with external organizations **Torch** and **Menttium**, Allstate offered mentorship opportunities to an additional 242 employees through three programs. Torch integrates coaching, mentoring and group learning to fuel professional development by engaging with Torch\u2019s Manager and Senior Leader mentoring programs. Menttium offers mentorship that accelerates learning and helps key talent realize their true potential.\n\n- Allstate\u2019s Power of Mentoring for Inclusive Diversity (MInD) program provides a network of internal mentoring relationships, builds capabilities, and facilitates knowledge sharing. In 2022, Power of MInD engaged 61 high-potential managers within Allstate, including senior managers and directors, women, ethnically and racially diverse employees and members of the LGBTQIA+ community.

Since its inception, the program has matched over 700 new employees with more than 300 Culture Guides. In 2023, we hope to grow the Culture Guide Program by 5%.\nSocial impact and community leadership\n\nFor more than 70 years, Allstate has driven social impact through The Allstate Foundation. We partner with national organizations and offer grants to nonprofits to create innovative, long-term solutions for those in need. The Allstate Corporation complements the work of The Allstate Foundation through corporate giving and employee and agent volunteering.\n\nIn 2022, 44% of The Allstate Foundation's giving to nonprofits went to organizations led by a person of color, compared with 29% in 2021.\n\nAccountability\n\nThe Allstate Foundation is governed by a Board of Trustees that approves the Foundation\u2019s priority issues, programs, strategic direction and desired impacts. They review the Foundation\u2019s financial position and investment strategy and approve the annual budget in conjunction with their review of outcomes and strategy revisions. Further, the Board of Trustees appoints a Grant Committee that is charged with considering and approving the Foundation\u2019s proposed grants to nonprofit partners in excess of $50,000. Additional approval levels are stated in The Allstate Foundation\u2019s Governance Manual. Foundation accountability is also bolstered by undergoing a rigorous internal audit process every three years.\n\nPolicies and practices\n\nThe Allstate Corporation and The Allstate Foundation work hand in hand to amplify our social impact and community leadership. Our corporate giving comes directly from Allstate\u2019s profits. The Allstate Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization whose activities and giving support social impact but are not tied to Allstate\u2019s business performance.\nIn 2022, The Allstate Foundation, The Allstate Corporation and Giving Campaign pledges from our agents and employees together invested more than $48M in communities.\n\nCorporate giving\n\nAllstate\u2019s corporate giving maintains and bolsters community partnerships that support business health and social impact. In 2022, Allstate gave over $8.4 million in corporate support to nonprofits. Allstate also provides disaster relief funding and committed $1.5 million to support affected communities in 2022.\n\nPrograms and performance\n\nWith the help of Allstate employees and agents, The Allstate Foundation works to make an impact across its three pillars \u2013 empowering youth to succeed and lead, disrupting the cycle and prevalence of relationship abuse and closing the racial opportunity gap for careers with thriving wages \u2013 all to help create a more equitable world where people and communities can thrive. In 2022, Allstate\u2019s Foundation provided $11 million in grants for youth empowerment, $8.2 million for disrupting the cycle of relationship abuse, and $7 million for advancing racial equity.\n\nYouth empowerment\n\nThe Allstate Foundation has been helping youth learn, grow and succeed for 17 years. First by reducing teen driving deaths and now by preparing youth for the future. In 2022, the Foundation invested more than $11 million in these efforts. The Allstate Foundation is a funding sponsor of Youth Service America and also funds advocacy programs by organizations like the Mikva Challenge. For more information on this work, see the Empower Youth page of our website.\n\nDisrupting the cycle of relationship abuse\n\nIn 2022, The Allstate Foundation awarded $8.2 million in grants to end relationship abuse, promote safe, healthy relationships, and empower survivors on the path to safety and security. We equip survivors with financial empowerment resources, providing $1.5 million in grants to domestic violence coalitions working on our Moving Ahead Curriculum, and supporting FreeFrom\u2019s cash assistance program for survivors.\nIn 2022, we began investing in culturally specific domestic violence organizations and awarded $800,000 to Ujima, Esperanza United, Asian Pacific Institute on Gender-Based Violence and Alliance of Tribal Coalitions to End Violence. For more information on this work, see the End Domestic Violence page of The Allstate Foundation website.\n\nAdvancing racial equity\n\nThe Allstate Corporation supports systemic change with more equitable opportunity for communities that are marginalized due to race. This starts within our own company through our policies and practices and is demonstrated through efforts such as The Allstate Corporation\u2019s founding membership of OneTen, membership with Second Chance Business Council and signing of the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion pledge.\n\nThe Allstate Foundation\u2019s work complements these efforts, investing in nonprofit organizations that help people overcome barriers to living-wage employment and entrepreneurs advancing equity through innovative workforce development strategies. At the close of 2021, the Foundation invested an initial $6 million total in six new nonprofit partnerships to support this issue: the Center for Employment Opportunities, Echoing Green, Cara, New Profit, REDF and Per Scholas. In 2022, the Foundation re-funded all six and added a seventh grant of $1 million for a total of $7 million awarded to organizations focused on racial equity. For more information on this work, see the Advance Racial Equity page of The Allstate Foundation website.\n\nAdvancing the nonprofit sector\n\nThe Allstate Foundation also empowers social impact leaders, Allstate agents and employees to accelerate our journey to a more equitable society through the following programs.\n\nNonprofit Leadership Center\n\nSince 2014, The Allstate Foundation has partnered with the Kellogg School of Management\u2019s Center for Nonprofit Management at Northwestern University. We make free development programs available to every nonprofit employee in the nation through our Nonprofit Leadership Center. In 2022, more than 8,000 nonprofit professionals from across the country developed skills through our resources, an 8% increase from 2021.\n\nOur Helping Hands\n\nIn 2022, Allstate employees and agents volunteered 81,515 hours, benefiting 1,361 nonprofits. Employees and agents who volunteer at least eight hours can apply for a Helping Hands Grant, a $500 grant to the eligible organization of their choice. More than $2.3 million in Helping Hands Grants were distributed in 2022. The Allstate Foundation also established processes for the first time this year to provide funding outside of the United States. We extended our Helping Hands Grants to Allstate Northern Ireland, providing more than $117,000 to five UK organizations.\nAllstate India employees, led by their Information Security team, conduct cybersecurity awareness training for children in local communities. The team identified that children are exposed to many cyber threats and developed the program to provide awareness to community members starting at a young age to promote their lifelong cybersecurity.\n\nIn November 2022, Allstate India\u2019s COO joined the Corporate Social Responsibility team to donate Make Your Lab kits to government school teachers in Pune. The project aims to empower educators to develop prototypes and experimental models to better engage students and kindle their scientific spirit.\n\nThe Allstate Foundation offers a match on qualifying charitable contributions from employees and agents. Employees, agents and staff can request a dollar-for-dollar match for their donations, up to $1,000 per person per year. In 2022, Allstate employees and agents pledged $3.4 million to charitable organizations, and The Allstate Foundation contributed $2.5 million in matching funds to those organizations.\n\nSkills-based volunteerism\n\nThe Allstate Foundation is mobilizing Allstate employees and agents to give back through skills-based volunteering. In 2022, Allstate employees participated in three skills-based volunteering Days of Service, generating more than $576,000 in social impact value for 57 nonprofits across the country.\n\nThe Days of Service build on the success of two other skills-based volunteering programs: Allstate Fellows and the Allstate Officer Nonprofit Board Program. Now in its 12th year, Allstate Fellows matches highly skilled Allstate employees with nonprofit organizations for long-term pro bono projects. In 2022, seven Allstate Fellows were paired with seven nonprofit organizations. Through the Allstate Officer Nonprofit Board Program, officers join the boards of nonprofits whose missions advance the Foundation\u2019s strategic social impact areas. In 2022, 43 Allstate officers served on boards across 46 nonprofit organizations.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-04-27", "created": "2025-04-27", "metadata": {"Source-File": "climate_reports/tp_reports/allstate_2022.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.1.59", "pdf-total-pages": 33, "total-input-tokens": 73096, "total-output-tokens": 17738, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 138, 1], [138, 643, 2], [643, 2630, 3], [2630, 6245, 4], [6245, 8088, 5], [8088, 11681, 6], [11681, 13470, 7], [13470, 15825, 8], [15825, 17815, 9], [17815, 20289, 10], [20289, 22971, 11], [22971, 26974, 12], [26974, 30581, 13], [30581, 32645, 14], [32645, 36616, 15], [36616, 40595, 16], [40595, 43264, 17], [43264, 45722, 18], [45722, 48856, 19], [48856, 50641, 20], [50641, 53874, 21], [53874, 57647, 22], [57647, 60944, 23], [60944, 62786, 24], [62786, 66240, 25], [66240, 69651, 26], [69651, 71614, 27], [71614, 74554, 28], [74554, 76192, 29], [76192, 78224, 30], [78224, 80987, 31], [80987, 82998, 32], [82998, 82998, 33]]}}
