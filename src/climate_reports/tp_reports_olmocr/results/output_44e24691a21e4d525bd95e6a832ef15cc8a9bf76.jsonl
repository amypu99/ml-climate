With each generation, technology has become more reliable, more affordable and lower in power, with semiconductors used by a growing number of customers and markets.\n\nOur founders had the foresight to know that building a great company required a special culture to thrive for the long term. For many years, we\u2019ve run our business with three overarching ambitions in mind:\n\n\u2022 First, we will act like owners who will own the company for decades.\n\u2022 Second, we will adapt and succeed in a world that\u2019s ever changing.\n\u2022 And third, we will be a company that we\u2019re personally proud to be a part of and would want as our neighbor.\n\nOur ambitions are foundational to ensuring that we operate in a sustainable, socially thoughtful and environmentally responsible manner. When we are successful in achieving these ambitions, our employees, customers, communities and shareholders all win.\n\nIn 2021, despite the ongoing global challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we maintained a focus on keeping our employees safe, supporting our customers and giving back to our communities when needs continued to be great. I continue to be proud of how TIers adapted and performed. We have learned through the decades that challenging years are when our ambitions are most critical in guiding our decisions.\n\nIt is a privilege to get to pursue our passion of creating a better world by making electronics more affordable through semiconductors. With our ambitions guiding our decision-making for the long-term and our products helping create a better world, we are confident that our collective efforts will be impactful and long-lasting.\n\nRich Templeton\nChairman, President and CEO\n\n2021 Highlights\n\nContinued to make progress on our per chip efficiencies \u2013\n\n- Reduced absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 18.6%\n- and energy intensity per chip by 33% both from a 2015 base year.\n- Reused or recycled 90% of our waste and surplus materials.\n- Donated (in partnership with the TI Foundation, TI employees and retirees) over $61 million to support needs in our communities, including more than $35 million to education.\n\nReceived a rating from the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index for the sixth year in a row.\n\nMade steady and consistent Black and Hispanic/Latino/x representation gains across the U.S. employee population.

Central to these ambitions is a belief that in order for all stakeholders to benefit, the company must grow stronger over the long term.\n\n\u2022 Second, semiconductors will play a critical role in creating a better world and helping reduce the impact on the environment.\n\nReport overview\n\nSince 2006, TI has published program information, goals, progress on goals and relevant data \u2013 including a focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) and sustainability priorities \u2013 as part of our commitment to being a good corporate citizen. As with previous years, our 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report provides insight into how we think about \u2013 and how we perform \u2013 in various ESG areas relevant to our business using these widely accepted reporting frameworks:\n\n\u2022 The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). 2\n\u2022 The Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). 3\n\u2022 The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). 4\n\nIn addition, we participate in the CDP Climate Change and Water Security questionnaires and make both available at TI.com/ccr.\n\nTo strengthen our reporting, we solicit input from internal and external stakeholders year-round, examine third-party sustainability assessments, and benchmark trends and best practices. We then compare these inputs to our company priorities to determine what topics and disclosures to include in our annual Corporate Citizenship Report.\n\n2The GRI is an independent, international organization that helps businesses take responsibility for their impacts by providing them with a global common language to communicate those impacts.\n3The Financial Stability Board established the TCFD to develop recommendations for more effective climate-related disclosures that could promote more informed investment, credit and insurance underwriting decisions.\n4The SASB is an independent nonprofit organization that sets standards to guide the disclosure of sustainability information by companies to their investors.\n5The CDP is a nonprofit that runs the global disclosure system for investors, companies, cities, states and regions to manage their environmental impacts.\nEnvironmental sustainability\nReducing environmental impact\n\nWe manufacture billions of semiconductors that we sell to more than 100,000 customers all over the world. We designed our long-term environmental sustainability program to conserve natural resources, reduce emissions and mitigate environmental impacts.\n\nWe have had a long-standing commitment to responsible, sustainable manufacturing. Our focus is on; improving energy efficiency; reducing GHG emissions; reducing waste; and reusing more water. Specifics on these areas can be found in the following pages.\n\nProgress\n\nAs part of TI\u2019s commitment to reducing environmental impact, TI sets goals to reduce GHG emissions, energy intensity per chip, waste and increased water conservation.\n\nOver the past several years, TI has made progress towards our long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and scope 2 absolute GHG emissions by 25% from a 2015 base year and will continue working towards the successful achievement of this goal by 2025.\n\nIn 2021 TI\u2019s production increased by ~20% compared to the prior year, due to high customer demand from the ongoing global challenges related to the pandemic and resulting supply chain disruptions. While we had year-over-year increases in key areas, they did not increase at the same rate as production. We remain committed to achieving our 2025 GHG emissions and energy intensity goals, and are investing in the actions listed within the report to reduce our environmental impact.\n\nAs a semiconductor company that manufactures billions of chips per year, we believe it is critical to drive efficiencies in our fabrication process. Measuring per chip improvements tells the greater story in our efforts to improve overall efficiency. On page 7, we include an overview of our actions, goals and progress in four key areas of environmental sustainability - GHG emissions, energy, water and waste \u2013 and we include an overview of the per chip efficiencies we\u2019ve recognized over the past 11 years. As we continue to expand our 300-millimeter (300-mm) manufacturing, and the advanced manufacturing technology in these wafer manufacturing plants, the efficiencies recognized will continue to positively impact our environmental footprint.\n\nIn 2021, TI once again received recognition for sustainable business practices:\n\n- Barron\u2019s 100 Most Sustainable Companies.\n- Dow Jones Sustainability Index, North America.\n- Newsweek\u2019s America\u2019s Most Responsible Companies.\n- The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Top Companies for Social Responsibility.\nEnvironmental commitments\n\nTo minimize environmental impacts, TI implements strategies to reduce water consumption, waste and greenhouse gas emissions. These are summarized below along with the progress we are making towards our reduction goals.\n\n**Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions**\n\n**Focus**\n- TI actions to reduce emissions:\n  - Use alternative gases and chemicals.\n  - Install emissions abatement devices.\n  - Purchase electricity from renewable energy sources.\n  - Optimize product manufacturing, shipping and distribution.\n  - Avoid unnecessary business travel and subsidize employee commuting at certain sites.\n\n**Goal**\n- By year-end 2025:\n  - Reduction in absolute scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by from a 2015 base year*: 25%\n  - Reduction of GHG emissions: 18.6%\n\n**Progress by year-end 2021**\n- Reduction in energy intensity per chip from a 2015 base year: 33%\n- Reduction in energy intensity per chip: 18.6%\n\n**Energy**\n\n**Focus**\n- TI actions to reduce energy consumption:\n  - Design and operate buildings and fabrication sites to optimize efficiency.\n  - Upgrade and refurbish tools and equipment.\n  - Use sensors and other automated controls.\n  - Implement routine energy conservation projects.\n\n**Goal**\n- By year-end 2025:\n  - Reduction in energy intensity per chip from a 2015 base year: 50%\n\n**Progress by year-end 2021**\n- Reduction in energy intensity per chip: 2.6%\n\n**Water**\n\n**Focus**\n- TI actions to reduce water consumption:\n  - Improving the efficiency of our deionized water plants through actions such as optimizing the recovery rates of our reverse osmosis filters.\n  - Reducing manufacturing tool water use by optimizing flow rates.\n  - Identifying additional manufacturing tools where water can be reused in other processes.\n  - Expanding the use of microfilters and ultrafilters to recover more wastewater.\n\n**Goal**\n- In 2021, conserve:\n  - Equivalent of 2020 total water usage in 2021: 2.6%\n  - Reduction in water use: 2.8%\n\n**Progress by year-end 2021**\n- Reduction in water use: 2.8%\n\n**Waste and materials management**\n\n**Focus**\n- TI applies a three-step approach to waste and materials management:\n  - Examine what we need.\n  - Reuse what we can.\n  - Recycle what is allowed.\n\n**Goal**\n- In 2021, divert:\n  - 90% of solid waste materials generated from landfills.\n  - 90% of materials diverted from landfills.\n\n**Progress by year-end 2021**\n- Materials diverted from landfills: 90%\n\n*Normalized, or per-chip efficiency data, is a way to develop a baseline and track changes in energy, water, GHG and material consumption based on the number of chips manufactured each year. We measure GHG emissions intensity to assess the overall GHG efficiency of our manufacturing processes. GHG emissions refer to the total GHGs emitted, which depend on the amount of production. GHG emissions intensity attempts to normalize usage by looking at GHG emissions per unit of output (by dividing our total GHG emissions by our total production). This same definition applies to water and water intensity per chip data.\n\n2021 per-chip efficiency improvements\n\nTI has been working for years to drive efficiencies in its fabrication processes and equipment to reduce materials consumption, water, chemical and energy use, and associated air and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. When comparing our per-chip data from 2010 to 2021, TI has reduced its manufacturing-related impacts and resource consumption.\n\n2010-2021: Per-chip* efficiency improvements\n\nMaking chips more efficiently\n\nBeing a manufacturer of billions of chips a year, it is critical that we do so efficiently and with a commitment to continued improvement. One way we measure our success is on a per-chip basis in four key areas of sustainability: energy, water, greenhouse gas emissions and waste. We also invest in 300-mm advanced analog manufacturing facilities. These investments will enable us to reduce emissions, and increase water and energy efficiency.\n\n\u00a9Texas Instruments 2022\nGreenhouse gas emissions\n\nOur commitment to reducing GHG emissions\n\nTI sets greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and energy reduction goals to reduce environmental impacts and improve efficiencies. By 2025, TI has a goal to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from a 2015 base year, including emissions from all manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sites greater than or equal to 50,000 square feet.\n\nScope 1 GHG emissions by type\n\n| Metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO\u2082e) | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Carbon dioxide (CO\u2082)                             | 76,574 | 79,622 | 78,731 | 75,190 | 84,904 |\n| Methane (CH\u2084)                                    | 44 | 46\u2078 | 46 | 44 | 39 |\n| Nitrous oxide (N\u2082O)                              | 20,872 | 24,438\u2078 | 23,440 | 28,452 | 31,557 |\n| Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)                        | 42,059 | 39,982 | 36,552 | 37,532 | 44,633 |\n| Perfluorocarbons (PFCs)                          | 850,379 | 830,018 | 669,757 | 622,526 | 665,457 |\n| Sulfur hexafluoride (SF\u2086)                        | 64,537 | 71,240 | 62,084 | 64,061 | 71,189 |\n| Nitrogen trifluoride (NF\u2083)                       | 108,869 | 113,839 | 94,853 | 110,701 | 142,671 |\n\nScope 2 GHG emissions by type\n\n| Metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO\u2082e) | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Carbon dioxide (CO\u2082)                             | 1,357,931 | 1,122,336 | 1,102,843 | 1,012,985 | 1,041,346 |\n| Nitrous oxide (N\u2082O)                              | 2,595 | 1,679 | 1,673 | 1,386 | 1,294 |\n| Methane (CH\u2084)                                    | 375 | 271 | 269 | 241 | 233 |\n\n\u00b9Apex Companies LLC provided limited assurance verification of TI\u2019s scope 1 and scope 2 market-based GHG emissions for 2021.\n\u00b2The 2018 increase in methane and nitrous oxide was caused by updated emission factors and the inclusion of this data from TI\u2019s international sites.\nACTIONS WE ARE TAKING\n\nFor years, we have taken steps to reduce GHG emissions in our operations, shipping and distribution, as well as through our supply chain.\n\nScope 1\nTI directly emits scope 1 GHG emissions from gases used in the manufacturing process and fuels consumed on-site, such as natural gas and diesel. We are working to reduce these emissions by:\n\n- Installing efficient manufacturing technologies.\n- Eliminating nonessential fluorinated gases and using alternative gases and chemicals.\n- Installing thermal point-of-use abatement devices on some tools that treat the exhaust gases used in semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nScope 2\nTI indirectly emits scope 2 GHG emissions from electricity purchased for manufacturing or other operations. We are working to reduce these emissions by:\n\n- Purchasing and securing renewable energy sources around the world.\n- Increasing the energy efficiency of our manufacturing systems, buildings and tools.\n\nScope 3\nTI\u2019s supply chain, employee travel and commuting, and product distribution network generate scope 3 GHG emissions. We lessen these impacts by:\n\n- Encouraging suppliers to optimize their production and operational efficiencies.\n- Shipping items in bulk from regional distribution centers to reduce the number of shipments and transportation-related emissions.\n- Limiting business travel and providing videoconferencing capabilities. We have significantly reduced employee travel and commuting emissions through compliance with government-mandated gathering restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n- Providing on-site electric vehicle charging stations, shuttles and biking infrastructure.\n- Subsidizing mass transit and carpooling at select sites.\n\nWe are in the process of estimating and calculating the value chain emissions that are significant to TI in line with the Corporate Value Chain (scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (a supplement to the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard). For more information about TI\u2019s GHG emissions reduction strategies, see TI\u2019s 2022 CDP Climate Change response.\n\nMonitoring potential risks\nTI faces potential risks and opportunities associated with environmental issues. To learn about our environmental-related risks and opportunities, governance, management strategies and emissions, see TI\u2019s 2022 CDP Climate Change response, the ESH Management Approach and Emissions Management Approach sections of the GRI Index, and our TCFD Index.\n\nClimate-rated scenario analysis\nIn 2021, TI hired Environmental Resources Management (ERM) to conduct a climate-related scenario analysis; they presented results of their analysis in early 2022. Over the next year, several working teams comprising subject-matter experts will review ERM\u2019s findings.\nEnergy\n\nTI\u2019s global operations, design, manufacturing, assembly and test sites focus on lowering energy consumption and associated GHG emissions by setting annual reduction goals and implementing efficiency projects.\n\n**ACTIONS WE ARE TAKING**\n\nWe focus most of our efforts on our manufacturing operations because they account for over 90% of our total energy use. We set annual reduction goals and implement efficiency projects to improve energy efficiency. Other ways that we save energy include:\n\n- Designing and operating buildings and fabrication sites to optimize efficiency.\n- Upgrading and refurbishing tools and equipment.\n- Using sensors and other automated controls.\n- Implementing energy conservation projects.\n- Improving control and optimizing set points of our chilled water plants.\n- Installing energy-efficient LED lighting.\n- Making our air handling systems more efficient by installing more efficient fans and drive mechanisms.\n\nFor more information about how TI manages energy use, see the ESH Management Approach and Energy sections of the GRI Index.\n\n**Optimizing efficiency**\n\nAnnually, TI implements projects aimed at reducing overall energy use throughout our operations. Without these projects and the projects implemented in prior years, energy use in a year when production increased by ~20% would have been higher than the 3.19 terawatt hour (TWh) we used in 2021. TI will continue to implement meaningful projects, ensuring we further improve our energy efficiency.\n\n- We implement more than 200 energy efficiency projects each year to reduce GHG emissions and energy costs.\n- Over the last five years, we conserved nearly 300,000 megawatt hours (MWh) of energy.\n\n**Our commitment to reducing energy intensity per chip**\n\nBy 2025, TI has a goal to reduce energy use per chip by 50% at worldwide manufacturing sites from a 2015 base year. At year-end 2021, we achieved a 33% reduction toward this goal.\n\nIn the U.S., TI voluntarily participates in the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Better Buildings, Better Plants program. After achieving our initial goal, we set a stretch goal to reduce normalized primary energy per pattern at U.S. manufacturing sites by 50% by 2020. We continued to make progress in 2021, reducing energy intensity by 42.3%, improving from 40.6% in 2020.\n\n---\n\n*We measure energy use per chip output, or intensity, to assess the overall energy efficiency of our manufacturing processes.\n\n*Primary energy is the energy content found in natural sources, such as coal or other organic material, that has not been subject to any conversion or transformation process. TI based its DOE goal on 80% production capacity and adjusted calculations for the startup and closure of its facilities.\n\n* TI began reporting energy use in terawatt hours (TWh) and megawatt hours (MWh) in 2021, whereas we previously reported energy in millions of British thermal units (MMBtu). This change aligns with industry and reporting best practices.\n\n---\n\n\u00a9Texas Instruments 2022\n## Energy use by type (MWh)\n\n|                      | 2017     | 2018     | 2019     | 2020     | 2021     |\n|----------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| **Total energy use** | 2,951,885| 3,022,109| 2,989,967| 2,974,061| 3,185,664|\n| **Total indirect energy use** | 2,547,174| 2,601,144| 2,564,248| 2,562,311| 2,714,003|\n| Electricity          | 2,530,941| 2,585,922| 2,550,193| 2,548,101| 2,698,718|\n| District heating      | 16,232   | 15,222   | 14,055   | 14,210   | 15,285   |\n| **Total direct energy use** | 404,711  | 420,964  | 425,719  | 411,750  | 471,661  |\n| Natural gas          | 351,973  | 367,200  | 372,359  | 363,413  | 414,254  |\n| Fuel oil (No. 6)     | 5,633    | 3,750    | 3,644    | 4,356    | 4,132    |\n| Diesel               | 11,723   | 13,087   | 9,718    | 7,376    | 16,905   |\n| Propane              | 34,601   | 36,167   | 39,230   | 35,791   | 35,646   |\n| Gasoline             | 782      | 761      | 768      | 814      | 723      |\n\n### Renewable energy\n\nTI is committed to increasing renewable energy use in the coming years as part of our GHG emissions reduction strategy. TI secures reliable energy supplies, including renewable resources where available, that are cost-effective and align with our business needs and objectives.\n\nIn 2023, our long-term contracts for 65 megawatts of wind and solar power from new-build projects in Texas are expected to come online and increase our overall percent of electricity consumed from renewable sources in future years.\nWater management\n\nBecause water is an essential part of manufacturing semiconductors, TI has a particular focus on using water responsibly and efficiently. Conserving process and potable water and treating and recycling wastewater enables us to reduce costs, protect water quality and promote long-term availability. We maintain and optimize our wastewater treatment systems to comply with regulations and permit limits.\n\n**ACTIONS WE ARE TAKING**\n\nAnnually, TI implements projects aimed at reducing overall water use throughout our operations. Without these projects and the projects implemented in prior years, water use in a year when production increased by ~20% would have been higher than the 7.57 billion gallons we used in 2021. TI will continue to implement meaningful projects, ensuring we further improve our water efficiency.\n\n**Conserving water**\n\nTo reduce water consumption, TI:\n\n- Invests in reduction, recycling and reuse projects.\n- Improves the efficiency of our deionized water plants, such as optimizing the recovery rates of our reverse-osmosis filters.\n- Reduces manufacturing tool water use by optimizing flow rates and identifying where water can be reused in other processes.\n- Uses additional microfilters and ultrafilters to recover more wastewater.\n- Maximizes the amount of condensate and microfiltration water directed to cooling towers.\n- Reuses water with high salt or mineral content (produced as a byproduct of our ultra-pure water system) for toilet flushing.\n- Reuses water in our cooling towers.\n- Purifies and recycles higher-quality production water back to the inputs of our ultra-pure water plants.\n\n**Managing wastewater**\n\nTI has internal standards, programs and procedures to ensure that stormwater and wastewater produced by all sites comply with local, state and national discharge requirements. Parameters evaluated by each site are standard for the semiconductor industry and typically include biological oxygen demand, total suspended solids, metals, pH and temperature. We also:\n\n- Restrict or remove substances such as metals, toxic organic compounds, nitrates and sulfides from wastewater before discharge.\n- Collect wastewater sludge containing solvents, concentrated metals or acid solutions and dispose of them off-site per regulatory requirements. In some cases, we send these compounds to reclamation facilities for reuse by other industries.\n- Conduct required wastewater sampling to make sure that we are operating within our permit limits.\n- Take additional precautions, in compliance with local laws, at sites in Malaysia, the Philippines and Japan because treated wastewater discharges directly into a water body in these countries instead of a municipal treatment facility.\n\n**Monitoring water quality**\n\nWater withdrawal quality is regularly monitored at all of our manufacturing facilities. To confirm water quality, regular testing is conducted to ensure internal standards are maintained. Water discharge quality by standard effluent parameters is tracked across our manufacturing facilities.\n\nTo learn more about our water and effluent management strategies, see TI\u2019s 2022 CDP Water Security response and the ESH Management Approach and Water and Wastewater Management Approach sections of the GRI Index.\nPerformance\n\nTI completed new conservation projects in 2021 that helped us exceed our water conservation goal. While overall water use increased 12% over 2020 as production increased to support business growth. We also reused 29%, or 2.2 billion gallons, of all water consumed in 2021.\n\nWater use by type\n\n| (Billion gallons) | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|-------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Total             | 6.66 | 6.81 | 6.36 | 6.76 | 7.40 |\n| Municipal         | 4.21 | 4.36 | 4.29 | 4.53 | 4.79 |\n| Well              | 0.40 | 0.40 | 0.37 | 0.37 | 0.48 |\n| Reused            | 2.03 | 2.02 | 1.69 | 1.86 | 2.12 |\n\nWastewater discharges total and by type\n\n| (Billion gallons) | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|-------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Total             | 8.15 | 8.26 | 7.72 | 8.26 | 8.95 |\n| Wastewater        | 4.08 | 4.13 | 3.860| 4.13 | 4.51 |\n| Municipal sewer   | 3.85 | 3.85 | 3.610| 3.87 | 4.15 |\n| Surface           | 0.22 | 0.28 | 0.250| 0.26 | 0.27 |\n\n\u00b9\u00b2To calculate water use, we compile municipal billing data and our production metrics. We also measure effluent rates and volumes and analyze industrial wastewater and stormwater samples using standard methodologies set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In 2017 and 2018, totals included estimated rainwater collection of 23 million and 35 million gallons, respectively.\nWaste and material management\n\nTI responsibly manages the use and disposal of materials and chemicals to protect the environment and reduce landfill waste.\n\n**ACTIONS WE ARE TAKING**\n\nWe properly dispose of waste and materials that we cannot recycle or reuse per applicable federal, state and local laws, and make every effort to:\n\n**Step 1: Examine what we need.**\n\nMost of the materials we need are for fabricating semiconductors. When purchasing materials and chemicals, we consider the resulting waste, and whether an opportunity exists to reuse existing materials, purchase recycled materials or use environmentally friendly items instead.\n\n**Step 2: Reuse what we can.**\n\nWe reuse materials and chemicals by:\n\n- Recovering metals from solids, liquids, scrap wafers and other materials.\n- Repurposing and reselling used and surplus chemicals, chemical containers and older manufacturing equipment.\n- Reusing wafer carriers and food service tableware.\n\n**Step 3: Recycle what is allowed.**\n\nOur recyclable material and chemicals come primarily from our offices and manufacturing sites. These are managed and regulated differently depending on local requirements.\n\n**Managing chemicals and gas use**\n\nManufacturing semiconductors involves using hazardous and nonhazardous chemicals and gases, which is why TI's product-management systems have stringent controls in place. We continually:\n\n- Identify and use the safest, lowest-risk materials in operations to protect TIers, site communities and consumers. Where possible, we use high-pressure water instead of chemicals in certain cleanup applications or replace chemicals with environmentally benign substitutes.\n- Screen all incoming materials and chemicals before incorporating them into semiconductor manufacturing processes to comply with regulatory and customer requirements. We also incorporate any chemical restrictions and standards into supplier contracts.\n- Assess potential ESH impacts of materials as new scientific information becomes available and new regulations go into effect.\n- Follow strict standards and protocols for responsibly purchasing, transporting, tracking and disposing of chemicals safely.\n- Provide specific procedures and training for the use, labeling, storage and disposal of chemicals or hazardous substances, including the proper use of personal protective equipment.\n- Use ventilation controls, abatement systems, leak detectors and appropriate treatment technologies.\n\nIf concerns about a material or chemical arise during our screening process, we elevate the matter to our review board, comprising internal subject-matter experts. In the rare event that a material or chemical is necessary for manufacturing but still raises concerns, our manufacturing leaders review the situation and, if necessary, seek a safer alternative or implement more stringent use controls.\n\n**Performance**\n\nTI reused or recycled 90.1% of the 45,667 metric tons of waste and surplus materials generated in 2021. We achieved this through reusing and recovering chemicals where viable; selling surplus chemicals; recycling certain wastes for use in energy recovery; and recycling scrap wood, paper, glass, metals and organic materials.\nPhasing out substances of concern\n\nOne challenge facing the electronics industry is reducing or eliminating the use of compounds that are essential but potentially harmful. These include:\n\n- Brominated and chlorinated flame retardants \u2013 while these compounds pose no risk in TI products as sold, their improper or unsafe disposal is of concern. Over the last two decades, we\u2019ve proactively removed these chemicals from 99% of our products.\n- Perfluorinated substances (PFOSs) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) \u2013 these oil and water repellants cause potential health effects. TI stopped using PFOSs in 2015, and successfully finished our phase-out of PFOA and PFOA-related compounds in 2021.\n\nTI, other chipmakers and some of their suppliers are participating in a new industry consortium to collect information to inform regulators about the broad spectrum of semiconductor uses of perfluoroalkyl substances.\n\nFor more information about how TI manages materials, see the ESH Management Approach and Materials sections of the GRI Index.\n\nTransparency on product substances\n\nWe give customers documents and tools that outline measures we take to ensure that TI parts comply with global material restrictions and regulations. These include:\n\n- Controlled Chemical and Materials Specifications.\n- List of TI-Restricted Chemicals and Materials.\n- TI\u2019s Approach to Environmental and Product Stewardship.\n- A search tool to find material content, download restricted chemical test reports, or locate product RoHS, REACH and green status.\n- Quality, Reliability and Packaging Data.\n- Lead-Free Conversions.\n- Low Halogen (Green) Statement.\n- Environmental FAQs.\n### Waste by composition (metric tons)\n\n|                      | 2017  | 2018  | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  |\n|----------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| **Hazardous waste**  |       |       |       |       |       |\n| Waste generated      | 24,421| 25,305| 26,734| 31,702| 14,142|\n| Waste diverted from disposal | 21,828| 22,305| 23,869| 28,396| 11,250|\n| Waste directed to disposal | 2,593 | 3,000 | 2,865 | 3,387 | 2,892 |\n| **Nonhazardous waste** |       |       |       |       |       |\n| Waste generated      | 12,295| 11,882| 10,345| 10,518| 29,675|\n| Waste diverted from disposal | 11,203| 11,028| 9,534 | 9,563 | 28,025|\n| Waste directed to disposal | 1,092 | 854  | 811  | 955  | 1,650 |\n| **Other waste categories** |       |       |       |       |       |\n| Waste generated      | -     | -     | -     | -     | 1,860 |\n| Waste diverted from disposal | -     | -     | -     | -     | 1,860 |\n| Waste directed to disposal | -     | -     | -     | -     | 0     |\n\n*In 2021, TI disclosed new data based on updated GRI 306: Waste 2020 standards, allowing hazardous waste to be reported separately from non-hazardous industrial waste. This methodology significantly reduced the amounts reported for hazardous waste.*\nAir emissions\n\nTI manufacturing processes create certain air pollutants that are emitted into the atmosphere. Our air pollution control systems enable us to comply with permit and regulatory limits that protect air quality and human health.\n\n**ACTIONS WE ARE TAKING**\n\nWe set site-specific chemical-reduction goals, and abate and treat air emissions using thermal oxidizers, catalysts and scrubbers before they are emitted from our facilities.\n\n### U.S. air emissions\n\n|                      | 2017  | 2018  | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  |\n|----------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Nitrogen oxide (NOx) | 94.52 | 81.04 | 79.72 | 82.37 | 75.87 |\n| Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) | 96.64 | 105.12 | 92.77 | 97.12 | 109.45 |\n\n**Note:** TI does not include nitrous oxide (N\u2082O) in its air emissions calculations because the company accounts for N\u2082O in its GHG emissions data.\nProduct quality\n\nWe are continuously improving our products and process technologies in order to deliver high-quality and reliable semiconductor solutions that meet our customers\u2019 needs. TI\u2019s holistic approach to quality permeates every aspect of the company\u2019s supply chain from process technology and design through manufacturing, packaging, test and delivery. To reduce environmental impacts and extend product longevity, we optimize the quality and reliability of our technologies.\n\nQuality and reliability\n\nEvery organization within TI works together to ensure quality and to deliver reliable products. We continuously improve our products and process technologies to build reliable technologies that meet stringent qualification standards for industrial (Joint Electron Device Engineering Council) and automotive (Automotive Electronics Council Q100) products. We use specialized materials and controls to build high-quality products, test silicon and package technologies and continuously monitor wafer-level reliability.\n\nBy the time we start product qualification, our goal is to have high, data-backed confidence that the product is fully reliable and will meet our customers\u2019 long-term quality needs.\n\nProduct longevity\n\nTo maintain product longevity and continuity of supply for our customers, we have life-cycle management policies and inventory and manufacturing strategies that enable us to sell and support products for a decade or more.\n\nTI\u2019s product life cycles are typically 10 to 15 years and often extend longer, consistent with many customers\u2019 requirements. We are committed to product longevity for our customers and have strategies and internal policies in place to uphold this commitment.\n\nOur commitment to quality and support\n\nWe measure customer returns, which assess our performance on both resolution cycle times and return parts per billion. These measures help maintain high levels of customer service and product quality and reliability. To drive continuous improvement, we assess, categorize and aggregate the reason for each return to identify systemic improvement opportunities. More than 85% of TI products have not had a single customer return in three years.\n\nQuality and reliability permeate every corner of TI\n\nOur:\n\n- **Quality System Manual** describes quality-management processes and systems.\n- **Quality policy and procedures** provide a framework to quickly identify and resolve quality issues. We incorporate industry requirements and standards, along with customer specifications and feedback, to mitigate risks and drive improvement throughout a product\u2019s life cycle.\n- Internal quality standards help us comply with numerous industry standards and quality specifications, including International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001, ISO 14001, ISO 45001, International Standard for Automotive Quality Management Systems 16949 and the Underwriters Laboratories rating.\n- **Reliability testing** enhances or accelerates potential fail mechanisms, helps identify the root cause and reveals how to prevent failure modes.\n\nWe measure several performance indicators of product and service quality to make continuous improvements.\nProduct logistics\n\nPacking and shipping\n\nWe pack and ship products efficiently in order to assure timely distribution to customers, comply with international shipping regulations and reduce environmental impact. For example, we:\n\n- Pack large quantities of products into each shipment to eliminate multiple deliveries. We also increase packing density to move actual weights closer to charged dimensional weights.\n- Use air pillows in packaging that are recyclable, reusable and contain recycled content.\n- Work with our customers to understand their delivery needs and ship in bulk when possible. This practice enables us to ship mutually agreed-upon low-priority freight when space becomes available on more affordable shipping options.\n- Require that suppliers ship all new 300-mm wafers in reusable containers. When empty, we return these containers to the supplier for reuse or use them internally. In 2021 alone, we reused 21,628 of these containers.\n- Reuse packing materials that protect products during shipment (such as bubble pack and foam), shipping materials (such as boxes, crates and pallets), cases that ship precious metal reclaimable items to suppliers, and plastic reels used in product distribution.\n- Comply with the European Union Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment and EU Packaging and Packaging Waste recycling programs for evaluation modules imported into that region.\n- Place our product distribution centers in regions close to customers to accelerate delivery times, improve efficiency and facilitate product deliveries in the event of a disaster.\n- Eliminate heavy and expensive custom-cut foam, nonrecyclable foam, and foam and cardboard waste.\nResponsible business practices\nEthics, compliance and code of conduct\n\nOur founders had the foresight to know that building a great company required a special culture to thrive for the long term. At TI, we refer to culture as Living Our Values \u2013 TI\u2019s ambitions, values and code of conduct, and it\u2019s how we operate daily. Every TIer plays a critical role in upholding these principles, which we reinforce through leader involvement, employee engagement and training.\n\nWe provide TIers, managers, and leaders the training and tools they need to help them make the right decisions, do business the right way and build a stronger company for the long term.\n\nEvery employee receives ethics and compliance training. The topics may vary, but over a multi-year cycle, they include TI\u2019s code of conduct, environmental, safety and health (ESH), confidential information protection, information technology security, avoiding workplace and sexual harassment, and other compliance topics.\n\nAdditionally, employees in specific roles are trained on topics such as human rights policies, export compliance, anti-corruption, insider trading, global competition law and the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct. We also engage managers on what it means to live our values and uphold our standards of ethical conduct by providing tools to reinforce our culture and ethics and compliance expectations within their organizations.\n\nOur GRI Index contains more information about TI\u2019s ethics, anti-corruption, anti-competitive and nondiscrimination practices.\n\nOur code of conduct\n\nEach TI employee is expected to understand our code of conduct, which translates our ambitions and values into the standards we must uphold, and provides clarity about the behaviors we will not tolerate.\n\nReporting concerns\n\nWhen a TIer sees behaviors inconsistent with our ambitions, values, code of conduct or policies, it is their responsibility to speak up. They can do so by talking to a manager or human resources, or contacting the TI Ethics department directly or anonymously.\n\nDirect contact:\n- Email ethics@ti.com.\n- Write to P.O. Box 830801, Richardson, TX 75083-0801\n\nAnonymous helpline:\n- Online at texasinstruments.alertline.com.\n- Call U.S. toll-free: 888-590-5465.\nGovernance\n\nAt TI, we believe good corporate governance is important to our long-term success. We've had written governance guidelines since 1973, refining them over the years to meet the needs of the company and our shareholders. Our ambitions and core values are integral to building TI stronger, and we demonstrate responsible and ethical business practices by adhering to our stated principles.\n\nTI's board of directors is dedicated to responsible and effective corporate governance and oversees our global business strategy. The directors are experienced and diverse in their backgrounds and thinking. The board discusses its governance practices annually to ensure they truly make sense for TI in today's business climate. TI's board has a majority of independent directors. Their combined strengths assist them as they oversee the company's current and future strategy, performance, and plans for the next generation of TI leaders, with the best interests of TI shareholders in mind.\n\nAbout TI's board of directors\n\nAt year-end 2021, TI had a unitary board system with 12 board members, 10 of whom were independent. The age limit to serve is 70.\n\nBoard diversity 2021\n\nLearn more about TI's corporate governance:\n\n- Board of directors and committees\n- Board Oversight of Environmental, Social and Governance Matters\n- Governance documents\n- 2022 proxy statement\n- 2021 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) form 10-K\n- 2021 Annual Report\nSupply-chain responsibility\n\nTI buys materials for fabrication processes; factory equipment and maintenance; logistics services; and nonproduction supplies and services from approximately 11,000 suppliers of various types and sizes. Our worldwide procurement team coordinates buying globally for various goods and services, including setting procurement strategies, identifying and vetting qualified suppliers, negotiating terms and pricing, and determining the best fulfillment methods. In the U.S., we also actively pursue business opportunities with minority- and women-owned business enterprises (MWBEs) to drive economic equity.\n\nResponsible sourcing\n\nTI invests in driving sustainable and responsible business practices throughout its supply chain to mitigate risks in suppliers\u2019 businesses, labor and environmental practices. For example, we:\n\n- Collect and carefully consider a supplier\u2019s human rights practices and environmental and safety records before making purchasing decisions. We will not knowingly engage with a supplier that violates our values, code of conduct or other governing documents.\n- Specify our performance requirements and expectations in our policies, contracts and purchase orders. Integrating responsible business practices into our supply chain helps mitigate risks.\n- Seek suppliers that will create long-term shareholder value by scaling growth; reducing total costs and waste; improving efficiencies; and delivering innovative services, materials and product support.\n\nOur supplier website includes more information about TI\u2019s sourcing strategies, supplier risks and management system; requirements for doing business, Anti-Human Trafficking Statement and our dedication to transparency. These documents also include content about how TI and third-party agencies annually evaluate supplier performance to ensure compliance with laws, standards and expectations. We disclose the findings of these audits in this Corporate Citizenship Report.\n\nPerformance\n\nIn 2021, TI assessed nearly 300 suppliers to determine their alignment with the RBA\u2019s code of conduct, and to evaluate their ethics, environmental and social risks, including human rights and forced labor. Of those assessments, we evaluated 163 production suppliers that support our manufacturing operations with 360 factory locations; 99% met our expectations. The remaining 1% required corrective actions, which included additional training, enhanced policies or an improved work schedule.\n\nRegardless of their respective risk rating, we require any supplier with actual or potential risks (such as those related to hiring activity, working hours, and wages and benefits) to take corrective actions. We monitor these actions through to completion.\n\n| Goals and results |\n|-------------------|\n| 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n| 85% | 85% | 87% | 90% | 95% |\n| 88% | 89% | 90% | 95% | 95% |\n| 90% | 90% | 99% | 99% | 99% |\n\nProduction suppliers rated as low risk for all facilities on environmental and social responsibility self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ) assessments.\n\nResponsible Business Alliance member\n\nTI is a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), an industry coalition dedicated to corporate social responsibility in global supply chains, and is compliant with the standards outlined in the RBA code of conduct. We also routinely engage with industry groups such as the Semiconductor Industry Association and Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International to discuss supply-chain best practices and standards.\nDoing business with diverse suppliers\n\nTI engages U.S. minority- and women-owned business enterprises (MWBE) to provide the company with unique, innovative and cost-effective products and services. Much of our contracts are with Texas-based MWBEs that support our company headquarters and major manufacturing facilities. Our business relationships with MWBEs facilitate regional economic growth.\n\nEach year, we set spend goals based on the types of projects we have planned and the availability of qualified MWBEs. Our percentage of spending with MWBEs includes support throughout our operations and projects such as our 300-mm semiconductor wafer fabrication plant expansion in Richardson, Texas. In 2021, our percentage of spending with MWBEs was 20.3%, and included both contracts related to day-to-day operations as well as our capacity expansion in Richardson. Excluding the contracts related to the Richardson expansion, our percentage of spending would have been 8.8%.\n\nOur commitment to supporting MWBEs\n\nFrom our initial involvement in the Dallas Together Covenant 30 years ago to our ongoing partnership with the Women\u2019s Business Council \u2013 Southwest and the Dallas/Fort Worth Minority Business Development Council, TI actively supports MWBEs. Annually, we:\n\n\u2022 Mentor local MWBE owners to sharpen such skills as bidding on contracts, managing inventory, building supplier partnerships and diversifying their client base.\n\u2022 Financially support the Lillie Knox Investment Award through the Women\u2019s Business Council \u2013 Southwest, which invests up to $20,000 per recipient for expansion and business growth.\n\u2022 Meet with existing MWBE owners to determine contract expansion opportunities and verify that they have a stable client base beyond our company.\n\u2022 Engage with organizations such as the Dallas LGBTQ+ Chamber to further diversify our supplier base.\nConflict minerals\n\nTI has processes to ensure that its products do not contain minerals derived from sources that finance or benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. These minerals include tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold.\n\n**ACTIONS WE ARE TAKING**\n\nWe work diligently with our supply chain, including subcontracted manufacturers, to identify and eliminate noncompliant material sources. Our standard operating procedures for Conflict Minerals Supply Chain Management conform with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance, which requires establishing policies, structures and procedures; risk management; and communications mechanisms. We distribute our Conflict Minerals Policy to both first- and second-tier suppliers and expect their full and prompt response to our information requests.\n\n**Performance**\n\nOver the past several years, we\u2019ve relied primarily on the findings of the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP) to ensure that our supply chain is conflict-free. The RMAP is a program in which an independent third party evaluates smelters\u2019 management systems and procurement practices and determines whether the smelter has demonstrated that all the materials it processed originated from conflict-free sources. TI has started taking steps to disclose the use of cobalt in its supply chain.\n\nTo date, none of the smelters evaluated from our research and information gathering are financing or benefiting armed groups. For more information about how TI manages conflict minerals, see our SEC form 10-K filing and Supplier Social Assessment in the GRI Index.\n\n---\n\n**Smelters potentially in the supply chain for TI\u2019s integrated circuits**\n\n|                | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|----------------|------|------|------|------|\n| Conflict-free  | 100% | 100% | 99.6%| 99.6%|\n| Under RMAP assessment | 0%   | 0%   | 0.4% | 0.4% |\n\n**Tracing chain of custody**\n\nTo gain insight into the country of origin, chain of custody and Conflict Status of the CMs in our supply chain, we relied primarily on the findings of the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP). RMAP is overseen by the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), which was established by members of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative. TI is a member of the RBA and working groups participating in both the Responsible Minerals Initiative and Responsible Labor Initiative.\n\n---\n\n**One of the smelters designated as active in this Conflict Minerals Report, Tin Smelting Branch of Yunnan Tin Co., Ltd., was certified by the RMI as conflict-free on March 18, 2022. This smelter held a conflict-free designation until the RMI changed its status to active on May 26, 2021 in order to address certain non-conformances with RMI standards that have now been resolved.**\nLabor and human rights\n\nRespecting and protecting human rights is fundamental to the viability of our society and to the success of our business.\n\nWe take steps to ensure that all employment is voluntary, and that work hours and pay are fair and consistent with local labor standards and laws. We do not use child labor in any area of our business. Employees have the freedom to associate, the right to collective bargaining or both, as provided by local statute. We also regularly conduct global employee surveys and virtual and in-person roundtable discussions to better understand site-specific work environments.\n\n**ACTIONS WE ARE TAKING**\n\nWe monitor human rights risks and eliminate violations by:\n\n- Conducting periodic risk assessments and due diligence with suppliers using the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n- Conducting third-party audits, on-site interviews and assessments in high-risk geographies to ensure the protection of employees\u2019 and contractors\u2019 rights.\n- Assessing labor standards, delivering training and awareness-building practices, enabling the freedom to associate, and providing incident reporting tools.\n\n**How we address concerns**\n\nEmployees have multiple ways to contact internal authorities to express workplace concerns and improvement opportunities. Anyone is encouraged to report allegations of human rights abuse, discrimination or other complaints through their direct supervisor, human resources, our ethics office or anonymously by contacting our ethics line. When we learn of concerns, we immediately evaluate the situation and work to address it.\n\nFor more information about how TI manages human rights, see the Human Rights Assessment and Human Rights Security Practices sections in the GRI Index.\nRisk management and business continuity\n\nTI continuously monitors, plans and trains for both unanticipated and emerging operational risks, such as cyberattacks, natural disasters, extreme weather events, pandemics, geopolitical issues, social unrest, terrorism, or supply-chain or product-distribution delays. Our internally owned and regionally diverse manufacturing footprint includes 11 wafer fabrication plants, seven assembly and test sites, and multiple bump and probe facilities across 15 sites worldwide. In addition to our internal capacity, we have strong partnerships with external foundries and subcontractor partners to offer supply continuity.\n\nWe mitigate disruptions to our business by continuously:\n\n- Monitoring risks, developing and modifying plans to address those risks, and training employees on crisis response.\n- Assessing changes to environmental conditions, supply continuity, and the global regulatory and political landscape.\n- Operating a 24/7 year-round security communication center.\n- Owning much of our manufacturing to provide customers with a greater assurance of supply.\n- Maintaining six months to two years of inventory for catalog products built ahead of demand and positioning the inventory globally at product distribution centers and hubs near customers\u2019 manufacturing locations.\n\nResponding to emergencies\n\nDepending on the nature and severity of an incident, we activate our emergency response system. Our emergency response team assembles to quickly identify the appropriate resources, services and infrastructure required to mitigate potential losses and coordinate our response and communications.\n\nConducting business modeling, scenario and impact analysis to develop and refine management strategies, policies and standards, and contingency plans helps us determine:\n\n- Critical business processes that make up our operations and the people accountable for ensuring their viability.\n- Possible threats and risks, and whether controls are in place to manage them.\n- Process recovery times to ensure that we respond and recover efficiently and with the right resources.\n- Contingency strategies for all critical business processes that pose a high risk to people, revenue and reputation.\n- Comprehensive recovery strategies to cover all aspects of response and recovery, prioritizing the continuation of products and services.\n\nOur Readiness 2 Recover program helps us measure the effectiveness of and compliance with our business continuity management requirements. Every two years (or as needed), we conduct risk assessments to identify and rectify existing controls and gaps. To engage our leaders in enterprise risk planning, we regularly:\n\n- Teach them how to assess and prioritize risks based on severity and potential impact on our people or products.\n- Ask them to evaluate and update contingency strategies based on lessons learned from either real events or scenario-based exercises.\n- Conduct drills, training, tabletop exercises and site-level exercises to prepare for unforeseen events.\n\nFor more information, see our SEC form 10-K.\n\nPreparing for various scenarios\n\nAs a global corporation, TI faces unexpected global events that occur without warning, from earthquakes and pandemics to severe weather events. The impact of these types of incidents can be minimal or substantial. When challenges arise, we aim to prevent human, environmental, financial and reputational effects while maintaining production and distribution.\n\nOur business continuity and emergency response planning includes creating realistic scenarios and guiding leadership teams through various exercises in order to learn, refine and improve our responses to actual incidents.\n\nOur business continuity management framework is modeled after the ISO 22301 business continuity management standard, which helps us plan, implement, monitor and protect against business interruptions.\nInformation protection\n\nTI works continuously to identify and eliminate potential threats to its IT infrastructure, proprietary technologies and confidential information. This protection is key to business growth and profitability, and maintaining compliance with relevant regulations.\n\nReducing cybersecurity risks\n\nOur cybersecurity risk management process is based on best practice management and governance frameworks, such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology.\n\nUsing guidance from these organizations and information collected from our assessments, we develop cybersecurity plans, policies and protocols to reduce our risks and strengthen our security posture to protect our company, technology and intellectual property (IP). Our policies include defining the acceptable use of our information assets, access requirements for specific IP or technologies, protecting personal information and privacy, and complying with regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation and the China Cybersecurity Law.\n\nOur global information security team identifies and responds to potential threats and works with our business units and support teams to improve security. As part of this, we take these types of actions:\n\nDefend\n\n- Restrict access to data on our computers, servers, networks and other IT systems.\n- Implement technical measures to protect TI\u2019s web presence from external attacks, including protections for ordering products online at TI.com.\n- Deploy industry-standard protections, such as multifactor authentication, malware defenses and access review processes.\n- Conduct risk and compliance assessments of third parties that request access to our IT resources and information.\n\nMonitor\n\n- Monitor and limit the use of USB or thumb drives and external hard drives.\n- Monitor IT systems and respond to alerts regarding inappropriate activity.\n\nTrain\n\n- Send simulated phishing and spear-phishing emails to employees and accompanying education and awareness communications when needed.\n- Deliver cybersecurity awareness and confidential information protection training to all TIers and specialized security training to our IT team.\nPublic policy\n\nWe advocate for policies that help us attract talent, drive innovation and promote competitiveness. Our specific areas of policy interest include tax, trade, talent and racial equity.\n\nWe collaborate with many associations on various policy objectives. We are more active in some organizations than others and may not align on all positions. For more information about our advocacy process, see Public Policy in the GRI Index.\n\nTI's Government Relations website has more information about the company's political activities, TI's political action committee (PAC), the political activity of employees, and related policies and expectations.\n\nTI's PAC is 100% employee-funded, regulated, transparent and nonpartisan. The TI PAC enables certain employees to voluntarily join together to support federal, state and local political candidates whose positions align with the company's business objectives.\n\nPolitical expenditures\n\n| Year | Corporate contributions | Political action committee (PAC) |\n|------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| 2017 | $0                      | $113.0                          |\n| 2018 | $7.5                    | $101.2                          |\n| 2019 | $0                      | $101.0                          |\n| 2020 | $0                      | $78.0                           |\n| 2021 | $1.0                    | $96.5                           |\n\n*TI chose not to make any corporate contributions to local ballot initiatives in 2017, 2019 and 2020. 2020 PAC contributions were impacted due to COVID-19.\nWorkplace\nWorkplace\n\nOur people, known simply as TIers, are living our values every day to make our company passion a reality \u2013 to create a better world by making electronics more affordable through semiconductors.\n\nOur values\n\nTrustworthy\nWe start by being trustworthy. We act with integrity and do the right thing, every time. We operate in a socially responsible way. Being trustworthy is foundational for us as a company and as individuals.\n\nInclusive\nWe thrive by being inclusive. We create an environment that unlocks everyone\u2019s potential, where we treat one another with respect, value our differences, and are encouraged to put our thoughts and ideas on the table.\n\nInnovative\nWe win by being innovative. We imagine new technologies that produce compelling products, open new markets and improve our competitiveness. We are curious, persistent and determined to overcome barriers.\n\nCompetitive\nWe embrace a competitive world. We hate to lose, so we continuously challenge ourselves to perform at our best. We invest in the best opportunities for sustainable growth. To stay competitive, we attract, develop and retain the best people.\n\nResults-oriented\nWe are results-oriented and hold ourselves accountable. Our customers have choices, and we act with urgency and deliver on our commitments. We improve our performance every day to help our customers succeed.\nWorkforce representation\n\nWhile there is always more work to do, the progress we\u2019ve made regarding diversity and inclusion is encouraging. For decades, TI has remained committed to diversity and inclusion. As part of that ongoing commitment, we regularly assess our workforce relative to availability across gender, race and ethnic demographics to understand where we have gaps and where we need to place more emphasis to continue our progress toward having diverse representation at all levels.\n\nWomen and underrepresented minorities are not reflected in engineering majors and careers at the same levels as men and non-minorities. For this reason, we are focused on growing the engineering pipeline through partnerships with high schools, universities and nonprofit organizations.\n\nOur workforce data includes gender representation (for worldwide and U.S. populations) and race/ethnicity representation (for U.S. population) for these groups of employees: worldwide, technical, manager and vice president and above. This composite view best reflects the progress of our diversity efforts in hiring, career progression and retention across our workforce.\n\n*We define Other URM (underrepresented minorities) as Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, American Indian or Alaska Native, or two or more races. For more information, see our EEO-1 report. Any data differences less than 100% are attributable to a small percentage of undisclosed data.\nDiversity and inclusion\n\nEmployee resource groups (ERGs)\nFor more than 30 years, the TI Diversity Network has helped educate employees and elevate topics that matter to employees through 15 employee-led ERGs that include thousands of members. The journey started in 1989 with the women's and Hispanic/Latino/x ERGs. All TI ERGs have goals and objectives that align with and support our company values and business objectives. A team of employees lead each ERG, with at least one TI executive sponsor.\n\nERGs hosted hundreds of programs, panels and events in 2021 that engaged TIers in many ways. For example:\n\n- The Black Employee Network formed a Black Engineering Collective to support TIers who aspire to the TI Tech Ladder and build their technical leadership skills. They also hosted programs to build awareness about the significance of historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), Juneteenth and the impact of colorism.\n- The Chinese Heritage Network collaborated with the Dallas Holocaust and Human Rights Museum to raise awareness and combat anti-Asian violence.\n- The Pride network launched an on-demand course that provides TIers around the world foundational knowledge on sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, pronouns usage and important, and simple tips for promoting LGBTQ+ workplace inclusion as an ally.\n\nFor more information about how TI champions diversity and inclusion, see Diversity and Equal Opportunity in the GRI Index.\n\nConversations that matter\nOne of the ways that TI is co-creating an inclusive culture is through regular group-based dialogue teams with Catalyst, a global nonprofit that helps to build better workplaces for a diverse workforce. The goal of these dialogue teams is to build self-awareness by learning to identify both personal and systemic barriers to inclusion, and how to interrupt exclusionary behaviors and challenge stereotypes. The sessions encourage candid, constructive dialogue with employees across all levels, from all backgrounds. In this way we are encouraging employees and leaders to share their experiences and bring their own courageous conversations to conference rooms across the company.\n\nOur commitment to an inclusive environment\nWe are focused on reducing bias within our processes when interviewing candidates, reviewing job performance, and making compensation and advancement decisions by:\n\n- Requiring our hiring and development managers to complete unconscious bias training.\n- Making unconscious bias content available in performance management workshops and directly to TIers through our learning and development system.\n- Training leaders how to understand and recognize unconscious bias before conducting talent reviews. For example, leaders use specific and objective criteria to assess professional growth and gather independent feedback from multiple sources when assessing job performance.\nRecruitment\n\nTI\u2019s ability to grow and thrive depends on recruiting and retaining the best talent in the industry. The company takes a multifaceted approach to hiring employees with diverse experiences and backgrounds to drive innovation and growth.\n\nWe actively engage and recruit top engineering and business students for internships and full-time positions through career fairs, information sessions, networking and career preparation events, and partnerships with various student associations.\n\nWe are focused on growing the diverse pipeline of talent through industry organizations. As an example:\n\n- We continue to grow the pipeline of female engineers and business leaders through partnerships with universities, our women\u2019s ERG and industry organizations, such as the Society of Women Engineers.\n- We also partner with veteran services offices at U.S. universities and two-year technical institutions, military bases, and organizations such as RecruitMilitary to hire skilled veterans.\n\nCandidates choose TI because we offer:\n\n- Exciting and impactful work.\n- The opportunity to collaborate with some of the world\u2019s smartest minds in technology.\n- Competitive pay and benefits packages to help our employees live their best lives.\n- Career development opportunities where employees feel empowered to own their career paths.\n- An inclusive and diverse culture where all employees can be themselves and bring their best to work.\n- Flexible work options to help TIers and their families get the most out of their personal life.\n\nLiz, a planning manager in one of our 300-mm wafer fabs, was inspired to join the Army by her family who has been in the military for generations. After the Army, she interviewed at one of our wafer fabrication plants in Dallas. Liz reflected on how TI and the military have a similar way of approaching challenges:\n\n\u201cBoth focus on working the problem and relying on a team to create a solution. The military and TI have taught me about leadership and understanding that sometimes you have to put the needs and goals of your team ahead of yourself. As a TIer, veteran and working mom, I draw on the lessons I learned in the Army about integrity, duty, honor and respect. Those same qualities carried over into my role at TI.\u201d\n\nFor more information about how TI manages recruitment, see indicator 401-1 and the Labor/Management Relations section in the GRI Index.\nDevelopment\n\nWe help employees set aspirational goals and create personal development plans to map the skills they need to succeed. We encourage all employees to discuss development and performance with their managers at least three times a year to receive feedback, document progress and determine any necessary refinements.\n\nAdditionally, we offer formal learning and development opportunities at all levels to help every TIer \u2013 new and experienced \u2013 continuously evolve. Employees can access our internal hiring and learning platforms at any time to explore careers and chart development paths or complete mandatory training and other learning modules. A virtual format enabled TIers to complete nearly 44,500 courses in 2021.\n\nWe customize learning opportunities to facilitate professional growth from internships to retirement.\n\nInterns\n\nInternships at TI provide an opportunity to put education into practice on interesting projects that matter. From day one, our interns receive hands-on, meaningful work that can make a real impact. Our internship program provides access to key leaders, and enables each to network and learn from TIers at all levels of the company.\n\nEarly career\n\nRecent college graduates can participate in:\n\n- Make an Impact, a yearlong program that enhances job performance and accelerates career growth using case studies, group projects and assessments, as well as boot camps that provide intensive training on tools, processes and fundamental skills.\n- Global rotation programs that help graduates transition from student to professional and gain experience in various roles.\n- Early career pivotal learning roles, which expose nominated employees to new roles or skill sets by working closely with leaders, technical experts and talent across TI. Since 2014, we promoted 30% of this program\u2019s participants to management.\n\nManagement\n\nWe equip TIers to succeed in management by:\n\n- Strengthening their leadership capability.\n- Developing critical mindsets.\n- Recognizing and reducing unconscious bias.\n- Transitioning from leading a team of individuals to coaching managers.\n- Moving into more complex roles by understanding their leadership impact, how to build relationships with key stakeholders, and how to create and communicate strategies.\n\nTechnical leaders\n\nTI has tailored development to help engineers sharpen their technical abilities, share best practices, and develop soft skills such as leadership, communications and influence. Technical leaders can pursue election to TI\u2019s prestigious Tech Ladder, which represents the top 24% of our technical leaders.\n\nFor more information about how TI manages employee development, see the Training and Education, Employment and Labor/Management Relations sections in the GRI Index.\n\nAverage learning hours per TIer in 2021 37.1\nAccelerating the development of technical women\n\nTI\u2019s Women for Technical Leadership (WFTL) program provides coaching, formal training, roundtables and relationship-building opportunities to inspire a more diverse pool of talent for the Tech Ladder and to help retain, develop and move women into leadership roles. WFTL has helped increase the number women elected to TI\u2019s Tech Ladder by nearly 50% since its formation in 2016.\n\n\u201cWhen Women for Technical Leadership was formed in 2016, we were seeing women participate in elections at roughly half the rate of men,\u201d said Yesenia Moore, vice president of diversity and inclusion. \u201cWe have seen marked improvement in the participation rates of women in the Tech Ladder election over the past five years. This is encouraging for progress yet to come.\u201d\n\nAmos Tang, a member of the 2021 cohort, was recently elected to the Tech Ladder and looks forward to inspiring other women to apply.\n\n\u201cThe training sessions and roundtables with leadership gave me a new perspective as a technical leader,\u201d she said. \u201cThis program is about self-confidence, how we express ourselves and how we connect with others. It also inspires us to continue mentoring and advocating to lead others to succeed.\u201d\n\nKiki Schuck participated in WFTL and was elected to Tech Ladder early in her career. She said, \u201cParticipating in WFTL and being elected to the Tech Ladder helped me to find my voice and have more confidence. Having this recognition from my peers and being elected into this group of technologists gave me self-confidence as I approach new opportunities, solve problems and innovate.\u201d\nCompensation and benefits\n\nWe offer competitive compensation designed to ensure that our most talented employees, who will drive future growth, will remain at TI. Our compensation philosophy is based on pay for performance. Both the employee's contribution to TI's success and company performance determine an individual's compensation.\n\nOne of the unique aspects of TI's compensation strategy is a global profit-sharing program that rewards all TIers for contributions to the company's financial success. TI makes payouts as a percentage of eligible earnings based on profitability each year.\n\nOur profit-sharing formula is based on profit from operations (PFO) and begins when TI reaches 10% PFO. The maximum payout is 20%, when PFO reaches 35%. All TIers receive a payout based on the same percentage of eligible earnings. Our profit-sharing plan has paid out at the maximum level possible for the last six years, equating to a 20% bonus for all eligible employees. For more information about how TI manages compensation, see the Market Presence and Nondiscrimination sections and indicators 202-1, 405-1 and 405-5 in the GRI Index.\n\nOur commitment to equitable pay\n\nWe pay our employees fairly and equitably. TI has had competitive and equitable compensation policies regardless of gender, race, ethnicity or other protected characteristics, and we have designed checks and balances into our compensation system, including regular in-depth analyses, to ensure that we achieve it.\n\nIn 2021, we conducted a separate compensation analysis examining gender and race pay parity (including base, and bonus pay and equity), that considered job type, job level and country. Our analysis confirmed that within the U.S. and worldwide, TI pays women as much as men, and in the U.S., TI pays minorities as much as non-minorities.\n\nCompetitive compensation and benefits\n\nRetaining employees with institutional knowledge, technical and operating expertise, and relationships is a top priority for TI. We also recognize that retaining women and underrepresented minorities is critical.\n\nTI takes a multidisciplinary approach to retention by offering:\n\n- Competitive pay and benefits.\n- Tailored career development plans, mentoring programs and executive interaction to develop and encourage professional growth.\n- Connection to peers through our ERGs.\n- Unlimited opportunities to refine skills.\n\nWe also offer and encourage employees to take full advantage of various programs to reduce daily stressors that can interfere with well-being, workplace satisfaction and productivity, such as:\n\n- Flexible work arrangements.\n- Concierge services for vacation planning, making reservations or other personal transactions.\n- On-demand resources and referrals for child care and elder care through our Employee Assistance program.\n- Confidential counseling sessions and tools to support well-being.\n- Adoption support and reimbursement.\n- Parental/maternity leave.\n\nTo refine work-life program offerings, we engage employees and audit our programs annually to remain competitive and improve services. In 2021, Glassdoor recognized TI in its annual Best Places to Work ranking for the company's culture, atmosphere and great employees.\n\n---\n\n18 Some countries, such as France and Mexico, have statutory requirements for their local profit-sharing programs. Employees receive bonuses in accordance with those requirements.\nSafety and health\n\nWe believe that every workplace injury or illness is preventable, which is why we invest in and incorporate safe and healthy practices and controls into our employees\u2019 daily routines.\n\nACTIONS WE ARE TAKING\n\nSafety\n\nWe have a safety-oriented culture that includes implementing safety requirements and best practices globally to provide a safe and healthy work environment for all of our employees.\n\nTo maintain one of the industry\u2019s best safety records, we:\n\n\u2022 Create and operate safe worksites.\n\u2022 Maintain proper safety and ergonomic protocols and controls.\n\u2022 Develop and maintain internal standards, which in many cases exceed regulatory requirements.\n\u2022 Design and build inherently safe buildings and engineer out equipment risks.\n\u2022 Require relevant safety training.\n\u2022 Provide personal protective equipment.\n\u2022 Inspect our equipment.\n\u2022 Continuously audit our processes to assess compliance and performance.\n\nHealth\n\nTo reduce exposure to health risks, TI applies rigorous industrial hygiene standards that establish the minimum requirements necessary for the safe use and proper storage of hazardous chemicals and other materials. These standards include hazard communication and training, chemical labeling, and hazardous waste management.\n\nAdditionally, we eliminate or limit the use of potentially harmful materials, install ventilation and isolation controls, and conduct general hygiene and individual assessments.\n\nThe resources that we offer to TIers to take control of their health vary by country, depending on the extent of government health benefits available. In the U.S., we provide free on-site flu vaccines and preventive screening programs, fitness and nutrition programs, employee assistance programs, and counseling and education services.\n\nOur health management service provides coaching and oversight to improve the well-being of TIers who have experienced a significant medical event; have extended work absences; or are dealing with multiple diagnoses, treatments and providers. Our benefit advocacy service helps estimate the costs of medical procedures and assists with locating affordable and quality health providers. For more information, see the Occupational Health and Safety section in the GRI Index.\n\nSafety goals\n\nWe set safety goals that include a days away, restricted or job transfer (DART) case rate of 0.08 or less, and a recordable case rate of 0.20 or less.\nPerformance\n\nIn 2021, we nearly met both our recordable case rate and DART goals. TI\u2019s DART rate was 0.13, while the industry average was 0.6 in 2020 (2021 industry data is not yet available). Our DART and recordable rates continue to be among the lowest in the U.S. semiconductor industry, according to the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nEmployee and supplemental contractor safety and health data\n\n| Description | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|-------------|------|------|------|------|\n| Recordable cases (employees) | 0.15 (48 cases) | 0.16 (48 cases) | 0.14 (41 cases) | 0.19 (55 cases) |\n| Recordable cases (contractors) | 0.36 (6 cases) | 0.27 (5 cases) | 0.19 (3 cases) | 0.65 (10 cases) |\n| Fatalities from work-related injuries (employees) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Fatalities from work-related illness (employees) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Fatalities from work-related illness (contractors) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| High-consequence injuries (employees) | 0.007 (2 cases) | 0.007 (2 cases) | 0.01 (3 cases) | 0.003 (1 case) |\n| High-consequence injuries (contractors) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Hours worked (employees) | 58,253,519 | 59,425,882 | 59,410,887 | 57,376,381 |\n| Hours worked (contractors only) | 3,335,737 | 3,658,678 | 3,084,874 | 3,076,776 |\n| Recordable cases from work-related illness (employees) | 4 | 9 | 10 | 10 |\n| Recordable cases from work-related illness (contractors) | 1 | 0 | 1 | 4 |\n\n19 Additional data provided according to GRI\u2019s definitions (including supplemental contractors and other data).\n20 Refers to supplemental contractors, who receive daily work instruction from TI managers.\n21 The high-consequence work-related injury metric uses recovery time, instead of lost time, as the criterion for determining the severity of an injury. Lost time is an indicator of the loss of productivity for an organization as a result of a work-related injury; it does not necessarily indicate the extent of harm suffered by a worker.\n22 Hours reported are worldwide. TI employees do not include turnkey or supplemental contractors.\nGiving and volunteering\nGiving\n\nOne of our three ambitions is to be a company that we\u2019re personally proud to be a part of and would want as our neighbor. For decades, TI has worked to build stronger communities where the company has operations.\n\nOur giving and volunteering programs:\n\n1. Engage TIers globally through giving campaigns and volunteering programs.\n2. Improve our global communities through contributions to nonprofit organizations where TI operates.\n3. Combine monetary investments with employee involvement for the greatest impact.\n\nWe seek to improve the quality of life and strengthen our site communities across the globe. TI and the TI Foundation make well-considered and well-measured investments in several areas.\n\nEducation\nTI targets its largest area of philanthropic giving at improving education. Since 2010, the TI Foundation has invested more than $50 million specifically in STEM education to improve math and science learning outcomes and opportunities for Black and Hispanic/Latino(x) students in North Texas who historically face economic and educational barriers. Globally, we aim to improve access to educational resources in TI\u2019s international site communities.\n\nHuman services\nWe aim to strengthen programs and services for critical needs among racially and economically marginalized populations. We also provide emergency funds for site communities and employees devastated by natural or human-caused disasters.\n\nRacial equity\nWe support programs that dismantle barriers to racial equity, with an emphasis on police training and practices that reinforce accountability so that all people are policed equitably, and our communities are safer places to live and work.\n\nArts\nWe help sustain the arts that make Dallas culturally inclusive and vibrant through multi-year TI Foundation grants to organizations that emphasize the diversity their outreach efforts and programming, and through transformative grants to diverse groups that can become larger in scale and impact.\n\nPhilanthropic impact since 2010\n\n| TI and TI Foundation matching gifts, grants, and in-kind donations | $415m |\n| Our generous employees and retirees donated | $96m |\n| The amount of hours volunteer hours by employees and retirees | 1.6m |\n\nTIers across the globe embody the philanthropic spirit our company founders set for TI. Their generosity \u2013 especially during a time when so many are in great need \u2013 is humbling, inspiring and gives us one more reason to be proud employees of Texas Instruments.\n\nANDY SMITH, DIRECTOR OF GIVING & VOLUNTEERING\nNew TI Biomedical Engineering and Sciences Building will advance patient care\n\nWith a $15 million donation from TI, the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UT Southwestern) are collaborating to create the new Texas Instruments Biomedical Engineering and Sciences Building in Dallas. This $120 million research facility will accelerate collaboration between the two landmark institutions and the translation of biomedical technologies from ideas to treatment. The facility will enable UTD and UT Southwestern to leverage shared research strengths in basic and applied biomedical and engineering sciences to advance patient care.\n\n\u201cWhat were once two disparate fields \u2013 medicine and engineering \u2013 are now working together to make new discoveries about human life and health, and UTD and UT Southwestern are the ones doing it,\u201d said Rich Templeton, TI\u2019s chairman, president and CEO. \u201cWhat gets me personally excited is that semiconductor technology is at the center of it.\u201d\n\nHuman services\n\nWe awarded grants to various agencies that provided emergency housing and services to unsheltered people in North Texas during severe winter storms. Outside of the U.S., TI and its employees helped fund hospital infrastructures and donated personal protection equipment to assist with COVID-19 relief efforts. For example:\n\n- Grants from TI, TIer donations and TI Foundation matching gifts totaling almost $1 million helped extend COVID-19 patient care at the Rajeev Gandhi Government Hospital\u2019s Institute of Chest Diseases in Bangalore. This amount supplemented another $400,000 from TI for COVID-19 relief in India since the pandemic began in 2020.\n- TI Taiwan provided front-line health care workers at Shuang-Ho Hospital with ventilators, N95 masks, non-woven fabric protection smocks, hair and shoe covers, face shields and gloves at a value of approximately $125,000.\n- TIers in Germany collected donations for the St. Klara Children\u2019s Home Christmas Appeal, held a charity run for a program supporting children with cancer - raising nearly $11,000, and raised almost $27,000 in disaster relief and volunteered to help rebuild bridges after historic flooding devastated parts of Europe.\n\nRacial equity\n\nThe TI Foundation granted $2 million to the University of North Texas at Dallas to create the Active Bystandership for Law Enforcement (ABLE) Project Center of Excellence at the Caruth Police Institute. ABLE provides peer-intervention training for police officers to handle situations safely before they escalate by equipping them with the skills and support they need to address daily and often stressful law enforcement challenges.\n\nArts\n\nThe TI Foundation awarded $1.5 million in grants to Dallas arts organizations, including $575,000 to organizations that reflect the diversity of Dallas\u2019 neighborhoods and visitors and bring cultural and racial diversity to their programming. Funding also included support for the Dallas Holocaust and Human Rights Museum for programming that confronted anti-Asian hate and bigotry.\n\nEducation\n\nTI and the TI Foundation made $27.9 million in education grants and matched nearly $3.8 million in employee and retiree donations toward education. The TI Foundation continued supporting public school districts in southern Dallas County, as the COVID-19 pandemic widened economic and educational gaps for students and families in an area where more than one-third of residents live in poverty. The TI Foundation also provided:\n\n- $3.35 million in grants for the Urban Teachers and Teach for America programs to recruit and retain effective math and science teachers in urban areas of Dallas and in Santa Clara County, California.\n- A $2 million grant to expand the National Math and Science Initiative\u2019s College Readiness Program to the Grand Prairie independent school district and KIPP-DFW charter schools in North Texas. This program trains math, science and English Advanced Placement\u00ae (AP) teachers to be more effective and to increase students\u2019 qualifying AP scores.\n- A nearly $900,000 grant for a new social-emotional education program for students in two southern Dallas County school districts experiencing COVID-19 learning loss.\n\n2021 giving highlights\n\nHuman services\n\nWe awarded grants to various agencies that provided emergency housing and services to unsheltered people in North Texas during severe winter storms. Outside of the U.S., TI and its employees helped fund hospital infrastructures and donated personal protection equipment to assist with COVID-19 relief efforts. For example:\n\n- Grants from TI, TIer donations and TI Foundation matching gifts totaling almost $1 million helped extend COVID-19 patient care at the Rajeev Gandhi Government Hospital\u2019s Institute of Chest Diseases in Bangalore. This amount supplemented another $400,000 from TI for COVID-19 relief in India since the pandemic began in 2020.\n- TI Taiwan provided front-line health care workers at Shuang-Ho Hospital with ventilators, N95 masks, non-woven fabric protection smocks, hair and shoe covers, face shields and gloves at a value of approximately $125,000.\n- TIers in Germany collected donations for the St. Klara Children\u2019s Home Christmas Appeal, held a charity run for a program supporting children with cancer - raising nearly $11,000, and raised almost $27,000 in disaster relief and volunteered to help rebuild bridges after historic flooding devastated parts of Europe.\n\nRacial equity\n\nThe TI Foundation granted $2 million to the University of North Texas at Dallas to create the Active Bystandership for Law Enforcement (ABLE) Project Center of Excellence at the Caruth Police Institute.

In 2021, the TI Foundation provided nearly $11.2 million in matching gifts.\n\n*The TI Foundation is our company\u2019s 501(c)(3) philanthropic organization. It makes grants primarily in North Texas, and the U.S.\n\nImproving the lives of our neighbors\n\nThe annual United Way campaign is a cornerstone of our company giving and volunteering efforts. In 2021, we gave the nonprofit $6.8 million through more than 4,000 TIer and retiree donations, company sponsorships and TI Foundation grants and matching gifts.\n\nIn North Texas, United Way of Metropolitan Dallas plays a significant role in creating lasting change through programs that ensure all of our neighbors have access to education, income and health \u2013 the building blocks of opportunity. Together with its partner agencies, United Way works hard to bring about lasting change to improve the lives of neighbors suffering from such disparities as loss of income, food insecurity and a lack of health care.\nVolunteering\n\nOur employees have a passion for giving back and improving the quality of life in their communities. TI has more than 20 global community involvement teams and other civic-minded employees who work hard to solve local needs. Together, they mentor STEM students, coach robotics competitions, volunteer at food banks and homeless shelters, clean up parks, plant trees and give valuable time to serve their communities in other ways.\n\n2021 contributions\n\nDespite limited in-person opportunities because of the pandemic, TIers donated 119,547 hours of their time at a value of $3.6 million. In the U.S., the TI Foundation matches the value of employees\u2019 volunteer hours up to $1,000 per year, which added $357,088 of additional support for their favorite causes.\n\nWhile precautions due to COVID-19 drove how and where TIers gave their time and talent, the pandemic did not change why they did so \u2013 to build stronger communities. For example, employees and community involvement teams from:\n\n- U.S. sites participated in virtual volunteering projects to support United Way nonprofit partner agencies in their efforts to fight poverty, hunger and financial insecurity.\n- Dallas, the Philippines, Japan and Malaysia held food drives and distributed food to needy families.\n- Germany, Dallas and the Philippines virtually mentored and tutored students and showed them what it\u2019s like to be an engineer at TI.\n- Europe and Asia addressed environmental concerns and helped clean up parks and neighborhoods during World Cleanup Day.\n- Human resources partnered with Girl Scouts of Northeast Texas to support the organization\u2019s increased emphasis on diversity and inclusion with three skills-based volunteering projects focused on recruiting, onboarding and employee engagement.\n\nFor more information about how we manage community citizenship, see Local communities and indicator 201-1 in the GRI Index and Education engagement.\n\nAfter historic flooding devastated parts of Europe in July 2021, employees from our Freising site came together quickly to help their neighbors by raising relief funds, building temporary infrastructure and providing calculators to students who lost theirs in the flooding. Their actions embody our commitment to building \u2013 and sometimes rebuilding \u2013 stronger communities.\n\nAdditionally, TIers in Freising who volunteer with Germany\u2019s Federal Agency for Technical Relief (THW) provided on-site assistance \u2013 together with THW specialist groups \u2013 to build a bridge over the Ahr River as a temporary replacement for an original bridge that was swept away during the flooding. Constructing the temporary bridge was a crucial step in getting communities in the area moving again, allowing relief and infrastructure efforts to reach them.\n\n**Values are based on Independent Sector, an independent organization that estimates the value of each volunteer hour in 2021 at $29.95.**\nGlobal week of impact\n\nTI\u2019s employee-led community involvement teams joined together during the holiday season, focused on gratitude and giving, to volunteer and give back to build stronger communities. Across the globe, they expressed thanks to those who keep us healthy and safe, and made life a little easier for those facing hardships, helping our neighbors in areas many of us take for granted.\n\nEssential workers at hospital systems and fire stations in northern California and in Dallas, Texas, were shown appreciation through meals, thank you notes and goody bags for the \u201csuperhero\u201d efforts they made throughout the year to keep our communities safe and healthy.\n\nGlobal volunteering efforts focused on our most vulnerable neighbors \u2013 children, the elderly, the hungry and the unsheltered. TIers worked with local partners to ensure that hundreds of children and young adults in Germany, the Philippines, Texas and Utah received gifts, books and meals. Senior citizens in Portland, Maine, and Sugarland, Texas, received basic home and hygiene items and notes of encouragement from our employees.\n\nIn Japan, teams collected food items for food-insecure families near our Miho manufacturing site. In Sherman, Texas, TIers fulfilled wish-list items for local charities who work with previously incarcerated youth and victims of domestic abuse. And in Tucson and Dallas, TIers and their families transformed more than 600 rocks into messages of kindness and encouragement for schools and homeless shelters.\nNotice regarding forward-looking statements\n\nThis communication includes forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

We have a broad portfolio of approximately 80,000 products and have generated $18.34 billion in revenue (see SEC form 10-K, Part I, Item 1, pages 2-12). The percentage of revenue by region was Asia, 67%; Europe, 15%; the Americas, 10%; Japan, 5%; and other, 3%. See SEC form 10-K, Item 8, Note 1, page 30). |\n| Indicator | Description | Response |\n|-----------|-------------|----------|\n| 102-8     | Number of employees and workers by age, gender and type | See employee data in the Workplace section of TI's 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report. TI does not track the number of employees by employment contract and its part-time workforce is negligible. Full-time employees perform the majority of work and are supported by supplemental contractors when needed (supplemental contractors receive daily work instruction from TI managers). The number of these contractors varies throughout the year. |\n| 102-9     | Supply-chain description | See the Supply-Chain Responsibility section in TI's 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report, Anti-Human Trafficking Statement and our supplier website for more information about our supply chain. We spend roughly 80% of procurement dollars with approximately 300 suppliers, of which about 180 are critical to supporting semiconductor manufacturing. We define \u201ccritical suppliers\u201d as those essential to the supply strategy of a category procurement team that could cause a major disruption to be manufacturing or design output. When needed, we outsource the manufacturing of wafers or product assembly and testing. |\n| 102-10    | Significant changes to the organization and its supply chain | Over the past several years, we have invested in new capabilities to build closer direct customer relationships. Closer direct relationships with our customers help to strengthen our reach of market channel advantage and give us access to more customers and more of their design projects, leading to opportunities to sell more of our products into each design. For example, in 2021, about two-thirds of our revenue was direct, and transactions on TI.com grew to about 10% of our revenue as customers valued the convenience of purchasing online. Additionally, broader and deeper access gives us better insight and knowledge of customer needs. We expanded the reach of our TI.com e-commerce channel by offering a localized online experience in many countries, with convenience features such as immediate availability, local currency, payment methods, invoicing and importer of record. For more information, see SEC form 10-K, Part I, Item 1, pages 6-7. |\n| 102-11    | Precautionary principle or approach | TI applies precautionary principles in many aspects of its operations to reduce or avoid negative environmental impacts where scientific evidence is insufficient or uncertain. For example, our aggressive chemical and material screening process assures that we do not use materials whose hazards are not fully understood and may not be fully controllable. |\n| 102-12    | External initiatives | TI's governance documents guide its business practices, which apply to all sites worldwide and evolve based on changing business needs. We also voluntarily subscribe to industry and international standards to improve our ESG performance. These include:  \n  \u2022 The International Organization for Standardization (ISO).  \n  \u2022 The GRI reporting framework to measure and report our citizenship progress.  \n  \u2022 The Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to improve and increase reporting of climate-related impacts.  \n  \u2022 The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) to disclose the financial impacts of sustainability.  \n  \u2022 The Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), which has a specific code of conduct to help ensure worker safety, protection, fairness, environmental responsibility and business efficiency in the electronics industry.  \n  \u2022 The U.S. Green Building Council's LEED Green Building Rating System to design and operate efficient and low-impact manufacturing facilities.  \n  \u2022 The CDP, which helps investors, companies and cities act to build a sustainable economy. |\n### General responses cont'd...\n\n| Indicator | Description | Response |\n|-----------|-------------|----------|\n| 102-13    | Membership of associations | TI belongs to many associations with which it works on various policy objectives. We are more active in some organizations than others and do not work on all association issues. We may not align on all positions. We also collaborate with other outside groups and coalitions, such as the RBA and Semiconductor Industry Association, to advance policies that drive growth; promote competitiveness; and support our shareholders, customers, employees and the communities in which we operate. |\n| 102-14    | Statement from senior decision-maker | See the CEO letter in TI's 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report to read about our commitment to citizenship and sustainability. |\n| 102-16    | Values, principles, standards and norms of behavior | TI's policy is to conduct business in accordance with the highest ethical standards. We published our first ethics guide in 1961, which is a historic foundation of our business practices. In our Living our values \u2013 TI's ambitions, values and code of conduct, we describe our:  \n  - Ambitions: what we desire and are determined to achieve.  \n  - Values: principles that define who we are and how we behave.  \n  - Code of conduct: standards we commit to uphold.  \n  - Policies: rules to govern our decisions and behavior.  \n  A core group of leaders developed Living our values \u2013 TI's ambitions, values and code of conduct, while TI's management committee and executive officers provided oversight, input and direction. The TI board of directors approved the directive and Rich Templeton, TI chairman, president and CEO, signed. This document is available in multiple languages. All TI leaders are accountable for conducting business according to the code.  \n  Responsibility for Living our values \u2013 TI's ambitions, values and code of conduct begins with Chairman, President and CEO Rich Templeton and our board of directors. Leaders at every company level are accountable for modeling our ambitions and values, upholding Living our values \u2013 TI's ambitions, values and code of conduct and holding their organizations accountable. Our chief compliance officer, senior vice president of human resources, and ethics and compliance directors collaborate with other stakeholders to oversee and coordinate ethics and compliance programs across TI. They periodically share updates and results with the board of directors' Audit Committee, senior managers and other executives to drive continuous and effective improvement.  \n  TIers are encouraged to raise questions or concerns about conduct that may be inconsistent with Living our values. TI will not tolerate retaliation against those who have reported an issue in good faith. Anyone who retaliates against an employee for these activities is subject to disciplinary action, including termination. |\n| 102-18    | Governance structure | Read more about TI's governance structure, roles and responsibilities on the Governance overview web page and Board Oversight of ESG Matters.

Governance: TI takes a holistic approach to risk management to build a culture that minimizes risk exposures and protects shareholder value. TI's Audit Committee has oversight responsibility for financial risk (accounting, finance, internal controls and tax strategy). Our board of directors' committees share oversight responsibility for compliance risk. TI also has a Business Continuity steering team that oversees its business continuity strategy, policy, program and plans. Team members meet regularly to discuss risks, best practices and implementation plans and take a lead role if disruptive events occur. They also provide an annual update to the chief financial officer. Monitoring risks: All TI organizations and teams are expected to identify potential risks to employees, business practices, the supply chain and the environment. They conduct formal risk assessments and invest in controls that benefit our company, customers and communities. We then validate and monitor findings until actions are complete. Each quarter, we report risks and mitigation plans to senior managers. We also annually disclose risks in [SEC form 10-K](#). Grievance channels: Stakeholders can contact [ti.com/support](#) or their account managers with any risk-related questions, concerns or grievances. |\n| 102-40    | List of stakeholder groups | TI's stakeholders include employees, customers, shareholders, communities where we have operations, academia, public officials, trade associations, regulatory agencies, nongovernmental organizations, analysts, suppliers, contractors, TI retirees and potential employees. |\n| 102-41    | Collective bargaining agreements | Employees at our global operations have always had the freedom to associate and the right to collective bargaining as provided by local statutes; therefore, we do not track the percentage of employees covered by such agreements. |\n| 102-42    | Identifying and selecting stakeholders | We engage with stakeholders who directly influence or are interested in our operations. |\n| 102-43    | Approach to stakeholder engagement | We tailor our dynamic engagement strategies, methodologies and communications to the unique interests of the people and organizations that directly influence or have an interest in our operations. Engagement mechanisms generally include meetings, calls and emails and vary in frequency. Our senior leaders regularly share stakeholder feedback on ESG matters with the executive team and board of directors. Stakeholders can ask questions or share opinions through our website ([TI.com](#)), email address ([citizenshipfeedback@list.ti.com](#)) and social media channels. We have an accounting and audit hotline for addressing accounting- and audit-related topics and relate all inquiries received on the hotline to the Audit Committee chair of our board of directors. |\n### General responses cont'd...\n\n| Indicator | Description | Response |\n|-----------|-------------|----------|\n| 102-44    | Key topics and concerns raised | Through informal engagement with stakeholders in 2021, we learned that their top questions or issues were greenhouse gas emissions reduction strategy and goal setting, addressing environmental-related risks, renewable energy goals, water conservation, labor and human rights, and employee experience including compensation, recruitment and retention. |\n| 102-45    | Entities included in consolidated financial statements | TI has two reportable segments: Analog and Embedded Processing. We report the results of our remaining business activities in Other (see SEC form 10-K, Part I, Item 1, pages 2-4). TI's Corporate Citizenship Report covers ESG topics for all TI-owned entities and facilities included in our financial statements. |\n| 102-46    | Defining report content and topic boundaries | We solicit input from internal and external stakeholders throughout the year through regular engagement. We also examine third-party sustainability assessments and benchmark disclosure trends and best practices. We then compare these inputs to our company priorities to determine what topics and disclosures to include in our annual Corporate Citizenship Report. |\n| 102-47    | List of material topics | Following the release of TI's 2020 Corporate Citizenship Report, we conducted extensive peer, customer and competitor benchmarking to determine where we should consider updating disclosures to support the work we are doing on environmental, social, and governance topics. We also met with leaders to review opportunities and discussion topics for our 2021 report. Those discussions led to including the following topics and some expanded disclosures in our 2021 report. These topics may include additional disclosures not related to material topics in some instances. |\n|           |             | \u2022 Business continuity and risk management. |\n|           |             | \u2022 Environmental impact (air and greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption and use of renewable sources, and water and wastewater). |\n|           |             | \u2022 Materials and chemical management. |\n|           |             | \u2022 Volunteering and giving. |\n|           |             | \u2022 Workplace (diversity and inclusion, recruitment and retention, development, compensation, and employee health and safety). |\n|           |             | \u2022 Supply-chain responsibility (including labor and human rights and conflict minerals). |\n|           |             | \u2022 Ethics. |\n|           |             | \u2022 Public policy. |\n| 102-48    | Restatements of information | We included any restatements of information in footnotes within TI's 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report. |\n| 102-49    | Changes in reporting | TI's 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report tells the company's citizenship story and elaborates on goals and progress in key focus areas.

For all U.S. employees (those who choose to opt into and contribute to a 401(k), we match 100% of their contributions, up to 4% of annual eligible earnings. We match half of that for employees who also contribute to our pension plan. Also, eligible and highly compensated employees can defer a portion of their base pay, year-end bonus and profit-sharing. We offer a global profit-sharing program that rewards all eligible TIers for contributing to our financial success. Some countries, such as France and Mexico, have statutory requirements for their local profit-sharing programs, which we meet. |\n| 201-4     | Financial assistance received from the government | TI receives tax-benefit incentives from federal, state and local governments worldwide. These incentives are commonly available to manufacturing companies with investments in equipment and facilities, employment, and R&D. See SEC form 10-K, Part II, Item 8, Note 4, pages 36 to 39 for additional details. |\n\n### Market presence\n\n| Indicator | Description | Response |\n|-----------|-------------|----------|\n| 103-1 to 103-3 | Disclosure of management approach | See the Compensation and benefits section of TI\u2019s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report and Employment Disclosure of Management Approach in this GRI Index to learn more about our compensation management approach. |\n| 202-1     | Ratios of standard entry-level wage by gender compared to local minimum wage | TI does not maintain a standard entry wage for every country. However, we verified that we are paying employees above the local minimum wage in every country in which we operate. We compensate each employee based on their experience, performance, roles and responsibilities, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity or other protected characteristics. |\n| 202-2     | The proportion of senior management hired from the local community | TI\u2019s strategy is to invest in employee development and hire the best and brightest individuals to work at the company. We hire externally or promote from within for the majority (90% or more) of senior management positions (vice presidents and above) within our communities. |\n## Procurement practices\n\n| Indicator | Description | Response |\n|-----------|-------------|----------|\n| 103-1 to 103-3 | Disclosure of management approach | See the Supply-Chain Responsibility section of TI's 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report and TI's supplier website to learn more about the company's management approach. |\n\n**Governance**\n\nTI's vice president of worldwide procurement and logistics, who reports directly to the chief financial officer, leads supply-chain management. Together, they oversee supply-chain policies, performance and risk management. TI's director of supply-chain responsibility oversees supplier social responsibility and manages supplier diversity.\n\n**Codes of conduct**\n\nTI suppliers must adhere to TI's Supplier Code of Conduct, which uses the Responsible Business Alliance's (RBA) code of conduct as its foundation and includes environmental standards specifically applicable to TI's suppliers.\n\n**Engagement**\n\nWhen initiating relationships with suppliers, we educate them about our standards and expectations for safe, humane and ethical labor practices, as well as human trafficking, forced labor and workers\u2019 rights. We communicate these guidelines in meetings; on our supplier website; and in purchase orders, supplier contracts and other related documents. We also routinely engage and collaborate with industry groups such as the RBA, the Semiconductor Industry Association, and Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International to discuss and create supply-chain standards and share best management practices.\n\n**Training**\n\nWe deliver online and in-person training on our Supplier Code of Conduct, standards and expectations. We also leverage RBA's training programs to help suppliers understand the alliance's code of conduct, labor risks, respecting workers' rights, hiring migrant workers and more.\n\n**Conflict minerals**\n\nTI is an early member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), created by RBA/Global E-Sustainability Initiative members, that works to advance effective policies that address conflict mineral concerns. TI works diligently with our supply chain, including subcontracted manufacturers, to identify and eliminate noncompliant sources of material.\n\n**Grievance mechanisms**\n\nTI has established grievance mechanisms to ensure that its buyers or procurement representatives meet with suppliers to address any questions or concerns. Our Supply-Chain Management team can also assist with identifying and addressing issues inconsistent with our ethics and values. If suppliers (or employees or contractors of suppliers) prefer, they can contact our Ethics Office to ask questions or discuss issues anonymously.\n\nOur Supplier Code of Conduct requires our suppliers to establish and maintain programs that ensure the confidentiality, anonymity and protection of supplier and employee whistleblowers unless prohibited by law. Suppliers must have a communicated process for their personnel to raise any concerns without fear of retaliation.\n\n**Resources**\n\nTI allocates extensive financial, human, training, information and engagement resources to help suppliers understand its policies and expectations, roles and responsibilities, performance and ethics expectations, and environmental, safety and health (ESH) and labor protections.\n\n---\n\n*Developed by TI.*\n\nIn 2021, our percentage of spending with diverse suppliers was 20.3%, and included both contracts related to day-to-day operations and as well as our capacity expansion in Richardson, Texas. Excluding the contracts related to Richardson expansion, our spending percentage would have been 8.8%.\n### Anti-corruption\n\n| Indicator | Description | Response |\n|-----------|-------------|----------|\n| 103-1 to 103-3 | Disclosure of management approach | See the Ethics, Compliance and Code of Conduct section of TI's 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report and Living our values \u2013 TI's ambitions, values and code of conduct to learn more about our management approach to anti-corruption. We assess all manufacturing sites for corruption and ethics risks annually using the RBA's self-assessment tools. Additionally, we leverage an industry-leading anti-corruption and third-party management system to assess our external engagements. |\n| 205-1 | Operations assessed for risks related to corruption | TI's anti-corruption compliance program assesses its worldwide operations and suppliers for risks related to corruption. TI operates in China, India, Mexico, Malaysia, the Philippines and Russia/Eastern Europe, which are considered at higher risk for corruption. However, the semiconductor industry is relatively low risk compared to construction, extractive or other industries where conducting business requires considerable interaction with government officials. We have policies in place and conduct focused training for certain high-risk countries and functions to address and mitigate these risks. |\n| 205-2 | Communication and training about anti-corruption policies and procedures | TI provides ethics and compliance awareness training that includes anti-corruption topics to all employees, select suppliers and third parties. Additionally, our anti-corruption policy and code of conduct are available to all employees and translated into multiple languages. We periodically assess and revise training programs and related efforts to reflect legal changes and support continuous compliance improvement. |\n| 205-3 | Confirmed incidents of corruption and actions taken | TI investigates all reports for review and action. In the event of any confirmed incidents, we would take appropriate remedial actions. For confidentiality reasons, we do not publicly report the number or nature of such incidents. |\n\n### Anticompetitive behavior\n\n| Indicator | Description | Response |\n|-----------|-------------|----------|\n| 103-1 to 103-3 | Disclosure of management approach | See the Ethics, Compliance and Code of Conduct section of TI's 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report and Living our values \u2013 TI's ambitions, values and code of conduct to learn more about the company's management approach to anticompetitive behavior. Our code of conduct sets forth these principles:  \n  \u2022 We compete fairly.  \n  \u2022 We follow the laws, rules, and regulations where we operate and require our suppliers to do the same.  \n  \u2022 We are committed to win, but we'll never break the rules in order to win.  \n  \u2022 We promise to respect all regulations and laws that promote fair competition. |\n| 206-1 | Legal actions for anticompetitive behavior, antitrust and monopoly practices | See SEC form 10-K for material legal proceedings involving TI. |\nEnvironment standards \u2013 ESH\n\n| Indicator | Description | Response |\n|-----------|-------------|----------|\n| 103-1 to 103-3 | Disclosure of management approach | See the Environmental Sustainability section of TI's 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report and the associated ESH indicators in this GRI Index to learn more about how TI manages ESH. |\n\n**Governance**\n\nSee Board Oversight of ESG Matters.\n\n**Management system**\n\nOur ESH management system facilitates the planning, execution, evaluation and management oversight of activities and strategies. It meets certification requirements set by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 (environmental management system criteria) and ISO 45001 (occupational health and safety management system criteria). Our management system also contains programs, policies, controls, processes and measurement tools based on industry best practices and international standards. It helps us mitigate risks, improve our performance, fulfill compliance obligations and achieve our objectives. Programs include extensive chemical and material screening, material sourcing, waste profiling, emissions management, and responsible recycling and disposal. We require 100% of our employees and supplemental contractors at all TI manufacturing and assembly/test sites to adhere to management system requirements. Other personnel not managed by TI are responsible for following their companies' ESH management procedures and applicable regulatory requirements.\n\n**Goals**\n\nTI sets company wide and/or site-specific GHG emission reduction, landfill diversion, water conservation and energy reduction goals. We track and report the effectiveness of these initiatives to senior leaders quarterly.\n\n**Policies**\n\nTI's ESH Policy is available in multiple languages: English, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Malay, Spanish, German and Korean. TI's Living our values \u2013 TI's ambitions, values and code of conduct also includes sections on protecting human health and the environment.\n\n**Engagement**\n\nWe evaluate the potential positive and negative impacts of a proposed project on a community by conducting environmental impact assessments before site selection.\n\n**Assessment**\n\nTo ensure that our internal management system is effective, the Worldwide ESH Compliance Support team and independent third parties perform audits at each facility every three years; in interim years, the facilities perform self-assessments. They examine compliance with legal and TI standards and training effectiveness. Additionally, we:\n\n- Survey employees and external stakeholders.\n- Conduct legally required inspections and monitor incident rates.\n- Benchmark against the RBA's self-assessment disclosure and its code of conduct and against peers and members of the Semiconductor Industry Association.\n- Have select sites third-party audited under the RBA's Validated Audit Process.\n\nWe communicate gaps and best practices to other sites so that similar issues will not occur. Each manufacturing site also reports performance using a scorecard that measures energy use, water efficiency and landfill diversion. We share scorecards internally for transparency and best-practice awareness and as an accountability mechanism. We have not made significant adjustments to our corporate-level ESH management system because of audit findings.\n\n**Grievance channels**\n\nWe offer several channels through which internal and external stakeholders can submit ESH questions, concerns or grievances. All employees and supplemental contractors have \"stop work\" authority to remove themselves from work situations that they believe could cause injury, illness or environmental harm. They also can contact their supervisor, site ESH staff or anonymously contact the TI Ethics Office. Customers can contact ti.com/support or direct all other ESH-related inquiries to citizenshipfeedback@list.ti.com.\n\n**Resources**\n\nTI allocates extensive financial, human, training and communication resources to help Tiers monitor and control potential ESH impacts, protect employee health and safety, understand specific ESH roles and responsibilities and drive improvements. We provide our ESH team with extensive training and tools to implement appropriate industry best practices and comply with regulatory requirements. To guide these efforts, we require employees and supplemental contractors at all manufacturing and assembly/test sites to adhere to our ESH Policy and Principles.\n### Environment standards \u2013 Energy\n\n| Indicator | Description                                      | Response                                                                                                                                 |\n|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 302-1     | Energy consumption within the organization      | See the Energy section in TI's 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report.

Our 2021 energy intensity ratio was 0.30. We divide the total energy consumption by the number of wafer chips (not including external manufacturing) produced each year when calculating energy intensity. We then compare this to a 2005 base year to report a ratio based only on internal energy consumption. The energy types included in the ratio are natural gas, gasoline, diesel, electricity, propane, fuel oil, liquid petroleum gas and district heating. |\n| 302-4     | Reduction of energy consumption                  | See the Energy section of TI's 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report for reduction data. Energy conservation savings are based on electricity, fuel and heating projects. The basis for calculation is the estimated annualized reduction for each project, with the total reported as the sum of all annualized savings estimates. We validate energy conservation savings for capital investments over $50,000 by taking additional pre- and post-project consumption measurements. |\n| 302-5     | Reductions in energy requirements of products and services | TI does not have data collection processes to track, record and report this information exactly this way.                                    |\n\n### Environment standards \u2013 Water\n\n| Indicator | Description                                      | Response                                                                                                                                 |\n|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 103-1 to 103-3 | Disclosure of management approach | See the Water Management section of TI's 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report, ESH Disclosure of Management Approach in this GRI Index and TI's 2022 CDP Water Security Response to learn more about water management. TI's global ESH water-management standard outlines requirements of wastewater programs, sewage treatment programs, stormwater pollution prevention and water reduction activities at each site. Additionally we:  \n\u2022 Visually inspect our onsite wastewater treatment plants regularly to ensure they operate properly and do not leak.  \n\u2022 Periodically clean the plants and inspect the treatment basins for integrity.  \n\u2022 Hire trained or certified operators as required.  \nWe calculate consumption data from water utility bills at sites that we financially control and that are larger than 50,000 square feet. Each year, we voluntarily report our water footprint to the CDP and in this report.  \n**Water sources**  \nOur water sources include surface water from local municipal supplies and groundwater. Our water footprint comprises three types of water:  \n\u2022 Nonmanufacturing \u2013 used in restrooms, irrigation, drinking fountains and cafeterias.  \n\u2022 Manufacturing \u2013 used to rinse wafers after chemical processing or for other fabrication processes.  \n\u2022 Manufacturing support \u2013 used in exhaust abatement and cooling systems. |\n### Environment standards \u2013 Water con'td...\n\n| Indicator | Description | Response |\n|-----------|-------------|----------|\n| 303-1     | Interactions with water as a shared resource | There have not been water impacts directly attributed to discharges and runoff at any TI site. We sustain this by maintaining compliance with discharge limits in our permits, following TI standards, and ensuring that sites follow good housekeeping practices and actively collaborate to continuously improve and minimize exposure to water pathways. See the Water Management section of TI's 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report and TI's 2022 CDP Water Security response to learn more about how TI interacts with water and collaborates with stakeholders regarding this shared resource. All of TI's main manufacturing and assembly/test facilities set annual water reduction goals based on projects they identified as part of the company's ongoing energy and water reduction program. Sites decide which projects to pursue based on various factors, including economic payback and impact on process system stability and reliability. Public policy and water stress factor into these decisions indirectly. Public policy and water stress impact the cost and availability of water, making water reductions more attractive from a financial standpoint or if they are necessary for system reliability. |\n| 303-2     | Management of water discharge-related impacts | See the Water Management section of TI's 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report and TI's 2022 CDP Water Security response to learn more about wastewater management. Local regulatory agencies set minimum quality standards for effluents, which all TI sites manage to permissible limits. Some regulators incorporate sector-specific standards to set their requirements. Our internal water-management standard includes guidelines that ensure compliance with wastewater, stormwater and sewage discharge permits and other requirements. Sites monitor water quality and have procedures to manage spills or other abnormalities. We report wastewater discharges and the portion of total water discharged through regulated wastewater treatment points to local, state, federal and international regulatory agencies. |\n| 303-3     | Water withdrawal | See the Water Management section of TI's 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report for water withdrawal data. Municipal sources and groundwater supply our water. We calculate consumption from sites TI fully controls and that are larger than 50,000 square feet. |\n| 303-4     | Total water discharge and priority discharges of concern for which discharges are treated | Federal, state or local regulators create wastewater permits that define and determine priority substances that must meet discharge limits. We comply with these limits by treating water in onsite treatment plants, separating concentrated metals and solvents from waste streams, and other measures. See the Water Management section of TI's 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report for discharge data. TI participates in several industry workgroups to anticipate substances that government entities may regulate in the future. Together, we research and assess data of chemicals used in production using both standard sampling methodologies and analytical methods and those developed by member companies. |\n| 303-5     | Water consumption and storage | See the Water Management section of TI's 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report for consumption and storage data. We calculate consumption data from total water usage and site-specific factors, such as evaporation, irrigation, boiler use or cooling tower use. We verify this data by examining site water balances and discharge flow rates from our wastewater and sewage treatment systems. TI reports water usage data to local, state, federal and international regulatory agencies. |\n## Water use\n\n| (Megaliters) | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|-------------|------|------|------|------|\n| Change in water storage (megaliters) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Water withdrawal (total megaliters) | 18,155 | 17,664 | 18,560 | 19,977 |\n| Surface | 132 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Ground | 1,517 | 1,409 | 1,408 | 1,838 |\n| Sea | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Produced | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Third party | 16,506 | 16,255 | 17,152 | 18,139 |\n| Fresh (\u22641,000 mg/L total dissolved solids) | 18,155 | 17,664 | 18,560 | 19,977 |\n| Other (\u22641,000 mg/L total dissolved solids) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Water withdrawal in water-stressed regions (total megaliters) | 3,352 | 2,674 | 2,692 | 2,518 |\n| Surface | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Ground | 40 | 44 | 35 | 27 |\n| Sea | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Produced | 3,312 | 2,630 | 2,658 | 2,490 |\n| Third party | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Fresh (\u22641,000 mg/L total dissolved solids) | 3,352 | 2,674 | 2,692 | 2,518 |\n| Other (\u22641,000 mg/L total dissolved solids) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Water discharge (total megaliters) | 15,643 | 14,617 | 15,646 | 16,750 |\n| Surface | 1,068 | 953 | 989 | 1,039 |\n| Ground | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Sea | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Third party | 14,575 | 13,664 | 14,658 | 15,711 |\n| Fresh (\u22641,000 mg/L total dissolved solids) | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown |\n| Other (\u22641,000 mg/L total dissolved solids) | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown |\n| Water discharge (water-stressed areas, megaliters) | 2,860 | 2,278 | 2,310 | 2,132 |\n| Fresh (\u22641,000 mg/L total dissolved solids) | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown |\n| Other (\u22641,000 mg/L total dissolved solids) | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown |\n| Water consumption (total megaliters) | 2,512 | 3,047 | 2,914 | 3,227 |\n| Water consumption (water-stressed areas) | 491 | 396 | 382 | 386 |\n\n---\n\n25 There is a small amount of water storage (relative to overall usage) in facilities systems, but the year-over-year change is not significant.\n26 This does not include once-through cooling water, which is pumped from on-site wells at our Freising, Germany, site and sent only for heat rejection. This water returns to the original aquifer.\n27 TI does not monitor total dissolved solids continuously at all sites.\n28 TI calculates consumption as water withdrawn minus water discharged.\n### Environment standards \u2013 Biodiversity\n\n| Indicator | Description | Response |\n|-----------|-------------|----------|\n| 304-1     | Operational sites owned, leased, managed in, or adjacent to protected areas and areas of high biodiversity value outside protected areas | TI's worldwide semiconductor design, manufacturing and assembly/test sites are located in industrial areas, inner-city areas, suburban areas and areas surrounded by agricultural farmlands. One 69-acre fabrication site in South Portland, Maine, is located in the Long Creek Watershed Management District. TI complies with state and federal regulations protecting this terrestrial and freshwater ecosystem. Other TI sites also adhere to rigorous air emission, water and wastewater goals, and requirements to manage the company's impact on biodiversity. We contribute to biodiversity by planting indigenous trees where we have sites and participating in community cleanup events in locations worldwide. |\n\n### Environment standards \u2013 Emissions\n\n| Indicator | Description | Response |\n|-----------|-------------|----------|\n| 103-1 to 103-3 | Disclosure of management approach | See the Air Emissions and GHG Emissions sections of TI's 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report, ESH Disclosure of Management Approach in this GRI Index and TI's 2022 CDP Climate Change response to learn more about how we manage emissions. We conduct routine monitoring and audits to comply with air quality and GHG emission regulations and reporting requirements that vary by country, state and municipality. We must report U.S. GHG emissions to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to comply with its mandatory reporting requirements. The EPA requires that the semiconductor industry (among other industries) measure and report annual fluorinated GHG emissions (such as sulfur hexafluoride, perfluorocarbons [PFCs] and hydrochlorofluorocarbons) as well as GHG emissions from combustion sources. We also voluntarily report our GHG emissions data to the World Semiconductor Council (as part of the U.S. industry report), the CDP and in our annual Corporate Citizenship Report. TI reports U.S. air emissions data to federal and state regulators. We also report chemical releases and pollution prevention activities to the EPA's Toxic Release Inventory. **Boundaries** We measure scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from TI-owned and leased sites larger than 50,000 square feet. This accounts for 97% of our total square footage and more than 99% of our equivalent carbon dioxide emissions. We do not report data from subcontractors, supplier manufacturing facilities or facilities smaller than 50,000 square feet. |\n| 305-1     | Direct (scope 1) GHG emissions | See the GHG Emissions section of TI's 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report for scope 1 data. The gases included in our data calculations include carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), methane (CH\u2084), nitrous oxide (N\u2082O), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HFCs), PFCs, sulfur hexafluoride (SF\u2086) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF\u2083). We calculate scope 1 GHG emissions using relevant guidelines from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the EPA's Mandatory Reporting Rule and published emission factors. Our methodology includes accepted quantification methods, emission factors and global warming potential. For more information, see TI's 2022 CDP Climate Change response. |\n### Environment standards \u2013 Emissions cont\u2019d...\n\n| Indicator | Description | Response |\n|-----------|-------------|----------|\n| 305-2     | Energy indirect (scope 2) GHG emissions | See the [GHG Emissions](#) section of TI's 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report for scope 2 data and our response to indicator 305-1. The gases included in our data calculations include CO\u2082, CH\u2084, and N\u2082O. We have not made any significant emissions changes that triggered base-year emissions recalculations. The EPA's GHG Mandatory Monitoring and Reporting Requirements (MRR) Final Rule is our source of the emissions factors and global warming potential rates. Scope 2 location-based electricity emission factors are from the U.S. EPA eGRID for U.S. sites and the International Energy Agency for all international sites. Scope 2 market-based factors are Green E residual mix for U.S. locations and AIB Residual mix for our Freising location. All calculations for scope 2 emissions follow either U.S. EPA MMR or IPCC Tier 2 requirements. For more information, see TI's 2022 CDP Climate Change response. |\n| 305-4     | GHG emissions intensity | Our normalized GHG emissions intensity ratio in 2021 was 0.27. The ratio equals the emissions intensity in 2021 divided by the emissions intensity in 2005. We calculate the intensity using both scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, with CO\u2082, CH\u2084, N\u2082O, HFCs, PFCs, SF\u2086 and NF\u2083 as the numerator and the number of chips produced within TI as the denominator. |\n| 305-5     | Reduction of GHGs | TI's normalized scope 1 and scope 2 emissions were down by 12.9% from 2020 to 2021.

Most of the materials we need are for fabricating semiconductors. When purchasing materials and chemicals, we consider the resulting waste and whether an opportunity exists to reuse existing materials, purchase recycled materials or use environmentally friendly items instead. See the [Waste and Materials Management](#) section of TI's 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report for information on our waste diversion goal and activities. We also follow strict standards and protocols for responsibly purchasing, transporting, tracking and disposing of chemicals safely. We have an established process to review, assess and select waste management facilities according to legal requirements. Each TI site is responsible for monitoring and collecting waste data. |\n| 306-3     | Waste generated                                  | See the data table on the following page for waste generated data.                                                                                                                                       |\n| 306-4     | Waste diverted from disposal                     | See the data table on the following page for waste diverted from disposal data.                                                                                                                        |\n| 306-5     | Waste directed to disposal                       | See the data table on the following page for waste directed to disposal data.                                                                                                                         |\n### 306-4: Waste diverted from disposal by recovery operation\\(^{15}\\) (metric tons)\n\n|                      | Hazardous waste | Nonhazardous waste | 2021 |\n|----------------------|-----------------|--------------------|------|\n| Preparation for reuse| Preparation for reuse |                     |      |\n| Onsite               | 4,000           | Onsite             | 826  |\n| Offsite              | 2,285           | Offsite            | 263  |\n| **Total**            | **6,285**       | **Total**          | **1,089** |\n| Recycling            | Recycling       |                     |      |\n| Onsite               | 0               | Onsite             | 0    |\n| Offsite              | 2,323           | Offsite            | 28,013 |\n| **Total**            | **2,323**       | **Total**          | **28,013** |\n| Other recovery operations | Other recovery operations | | |\n| Onsite               | 0               | Onsite             | 0    |\n| Offsite              | 2,642           | Offsite            | 783  |\n| **Total**            | **2,642**       | **Total**          | **783** |\n| Waste prevented (landfill diversion) | 11,250 | Waste prevented (landfill diversion) | 29,884 |\n\n\\(^{15}\\) In 2021, TI disclosed new data based on updated GRI 306: Waste 2020 standards.
