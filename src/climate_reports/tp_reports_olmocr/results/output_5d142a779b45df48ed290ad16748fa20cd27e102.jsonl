The Energy Efficiency Engagements explore how to reduce energy use, electricity costs, and emissions within our refrigeration, lighting, and charging systems. As a result, we implemented several new protocols, including a demand response program to reduce energy use during peak demand hours through management practices and training for associates. We will conduct similar studies at additional locations in FY23.\n\nPFG is committed to incorporating energy-efficient solutions as we build new facilities. For instance, the Performance Foodservice facility being constructed in Richmond, Va., underwent an energy analysis and sustainability review. The facility received accolades for excellent energy-efficient designs and systems included in the plans. The refrigeration system in Richmond will include an energy-efficient, state-of-the-art central ammonia system. The HVAC systems are highly efficient and expected to outperform comparable electric heating systems by about 45% in worst-case loading. And the lighting systems, using modern LED technologies, are exceptionally efficient and expected to consume 59% less energy than a typical lighting system.\nRENEWABLE ENERGY\n\nGOAL: SECURE 10% OF PURCHASED ELECTRICITY FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES BY 2030.\n\nWarehousing and distribution of food products is an energy-intensive business. Electric power is used for refrigeration, heating, ventilation, HVAC systems, and lighting. During Fiscal 2022, PFG consumed 458,000,000 kilowatt hours (kWh) of non-renewable electric power and 89,744 kWh of renewable electric power across our enterprise.\n\nPFG has been focusing on implementing strategic energy efficiency projects throughout our facilities by investing in energy-saving technologies and optimizing operations and maintenance practices. We continuously explore renewable power purchasing agreements and leverage national and state tax incentives.\n\nSOLAR INSTALLATION\n\nAt PFG, we have already taken the next steps in delivering on our commitment to expand renewable energy procurement throughout the organization. All new PFG buildings will be equipped to accommodate solar power in the future. We are confident that a combination of growing tax incentives and more expansive renewable infrastructure will enable PFG to power its facilities while significantly reducing the carbon emissions associated with its daily operations.\nGREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS\n\nGOAL: REDUCE SCOPE 1 & 2 GHG EMISSION INTENSITY BY 15% BY 2030 FROM A 2021 BASE YEAR.\n\nLast year, PFG conducted an analysis of our greenhouse gas emissions and established an emissions baseline as the foundation for developing a carbon reduction roadmap and determining the best pathways for reducing our emissions across our operations. In Fiscal 2022, PFG continued expanding the greenhouse gas inventory of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. As a result, PFG commits to reducing 15% of our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emission intensity by 2030 from a 2021 base year.\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS INVENTORY*\n\n|                      | BASELINE: FY21 | FY22\u00b2 |\n|----------------------|----------------|-------|\n| **SCOPE 1** (METRIC TONS) | 663,670        | 793,343 |\n| **SCOPE 2: LOCATION BASED** (METRIC TONS) | 149,896        | 168,188 |\n| **SCOPE 2: MARKET BASED** (METRIC TONS) | 150,403        | 174,584 |\n| **SCOPE 1 & 2 INTENSITY\u00b3** | 1.23           | 1.12   |\n\n*Data Provided by a third party\n\u00b2FY22 GHG data includes Core-Mark and Merchants, which were not part of FY21 data.\n\u00b3Intensity is measured by MTCO2e/1,000 cases.\nFLEET FUEL MANAGEMENT\n\nRENEWABLE & ALTERNATIVE ENERGY\n\nWe continue to explore and evaluate technology for powering tractors and trailer refrigeration with electric and alternative fuel solutions. PFG actively monitors the evolution of low-carbon technologies for powering freight transportation and has implemented our first electric trailer refrigeration technology for reducing fuel usage and carbon emissions associated with fleet refrigeration in Fiscal 2022. We anticipate implementing our first battery electric vehicles in Fiscal 2023.\n\nFLEET LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT\n\nPFG diligently manages the lifecycle of the vehicles within its fleet and implements a comprehensive strategy for vehicle replacement \u2014 incorporating fuel-efficient vehicles that improve the overall fuel economy and operational efficiency of our fleet.\n\nROUTE OPTIMIZATION\n\nWe also implement route optimization best practices and training initiatives using leading industry technology. This enables PFG to select the most efficient routes for product distribution. Route optimization, in conjunction with strategically located redistribution centers, allows us to minimize our miles traveled, time spent on the road, fuel usage, and our carbon emissions on a per-case basis.\n\nDue to current extended lead times on new and replacement vehicles, we have had to extend the life of current vehicles in order to serve our customers. This has delayed some of the fuel economy gains from newer equipment, but we expect this to eventually catch up. Our fuel economy performance will likely see a boost in future years.\n\nALTERNATIVE FUEL EXPLORATION\n\nPFG follows the advancement of low-carbon technologies for powering freight transportation to decrease fuel usage and emissions related to fleet refrigeration. We are in the process of analyzing technology to power tractors and trailers with electric and other alternative fuel solutions.\n\nIn Fiscal 2022, PFG introduced 10 net-zero emission refrigeration trailers to our fleet at the distribution center in Gilroy, Calif. These Transport Refrigeration Units (TRUs) are solar-powered electric refrigeration solutions that reduce our dependence on diesel fuel, overall reducing PFG\u2019s carbon footprint.\n\nSince the introduction of the net-zero emission TRUs, PFG estimates the elimination of more than 6,500 gallons of diesel fuel, reducing the Gilroy distribution center\u2019s carbon footprint by 73 tons. The all-electric TRUs have accumulated more than 13,000 hours of run time, 100,000 driven miles, and 1,000 completed routes with more than 12,000 deliveries. Over the next two years, PFG plans to continue these carbon footprint reduction efforts by introducing additional all-electric TRUs to our fleet.\nWASTE MANAGEMENT\n\nGOAL: ACHIEVE AN 80% DIVERSION RATE FOR OPERATIONAL WASTE BY 2030.\n\nPFG monitors operational waste to ensure we divert as much waste as possible from landfills. We utilize a third-party Utility Bill Management Program to support our efforts in capturing operational waste and recycling. We actively track the recycling of our pallets, stretch wrap, and corrugate, and we plan to consolidate waste spend to a couple of suppliers that will pick up corrugated, stretch, and organic waste generated from the distribution centers. PFG will continue to explore recycling and reuse programs, including for the disposal of used oil and other chemicals.\n\n|                          | FY21  | FY22  |\n|--------------------------|-------|-------|\n| TOTAL POUNDS RECYCLED    | 297,183,146 | 403,050,478 |\n| (STRETCH, CORRUGATED, AND PALLETS) |       |       |\n| TOTAL WASTE POUNDS       | 407,658,946 | 520,527,028 |\n| (INCLUDING RECYCLED)     |       |       |\n| TOTAL DIVERTED FROM LANDFILL | 73%  | 77%   |\n\nSUSTAINABLE PACKAGING & NON-FOODS\n\nWe have a strategy for reducing our contribution to packaging pollution and environmental degradation throughout the value chain by expanding our branded non-foods sustainable product offerings. We partner with select suppliers that provide recyclable, biodegradable, and compostable foodservice items and have packaging design processes based on product lifecycle analysis and management.\n\nThis includes carry-out containers free of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), sustainable cutlery, paper hot and cold cups, and paper bags. Our supplier partners may also have systematic approaches to reducing water use, energy use, landfill waste, and greenhouse gas emissions. Our strategy will mitigate both our risks and our customers\u2019 risks and support our competitive advantage by providing a solution to a fundamental sustainability challenge in the restaurant, hospitality, and foodservice industries.\n\n4 FY21 waste data includes Eby-Brown and Customized.\n5 FY22 waste data includes Convenience (Eby-Brown and Core-Mark) and Customized which were not in the FY21 data and excludes FY22 acquisitions and National Foodservice.\nThe heart of PFG is our commitment to serving communities across the nation. Our mission is to make a positive difference in the lives of our associates, customers, and communities. We have established initiatives to prioritize responsible sourcing, food quality, diversity and inclusion, health and safety, and community engagement.\n\nRESPONSIBLE SOURCING\nESG SUPPLIER SURVEY\nPREFERRED PURCHASING POLICY\nFOOD TRANSPARENCY\nFOOD SAFETY\nOCCUPATIONAL HEALTH & SAFETY\n- PFG Behavior-Based Safety (BBS) Program\n- Onboard Telematics Solution\n- Driver Safety Training\n- Truck Driver Hall of Fame\nHUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n- Associate Benefits, Wellness, & Compensation\n- Training & Development\nBUILDING A CULTURE OF INCLUSION\n- Associate Resource Groups\n- Women\u2019s Foodservice Forum (WFF)\n- Heritage & Cultural Month Programming\n- Supplier Diversity\nCOMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT\nRESPONSIBLE SOURCING\n\nGOAL: ENSURE 90% OF PFG-BRANDED BEEF, PORK, POULTRY, SEAFOOD, COFFEE, & TEA ARE PRODUCED WITH VERIFIED ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE & SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE PRACTICES BY 2025.\n\nPFG partners with Beef Marketing Group (BMG) to supply Braveheart Black Angus Beef and Surety Beef as exclusive beef products for Performance Foodservice. BMG ensures that the beef is produced with controls over the animals and operations, particularly monitoring animal welfare, food safety, the administration of technologies, and animal feed and water, as well as energy for operations. All these efforts are part of the Progressive Beef\u2122 third-party verified program and are designed to provide assurances and increase confidence in the high-quality, sustainable beef BMG produces for PFG and our customers.\n\nIn the past fiscal year, BMG implemented a new, innovative process to collect and measure additional production data such as cattle performance, feed ration formulations, manure management practices, and water, energy, and fuel use. This process allows BMG to calculate its operations\u2019 key environmental metrics like greenhouse gas emissions and identify efficiency and reduction opportunities. BMG is among the first to benchmark this information. PFG is proud to partner with them and source our Braveheart and Surety Beef with BMG\u2019s pioneering, sustainable solutions.\nPFG established an ESG Supplier Survey program to facilitate deeper insights into areas of alignment with suppliers across a variety of ESG matters. The survey asks suppliers about their policies, strategies, and efforts in the following topics:\n\n- Environmental Management\n- Human Rights and Labor Management\n- Animal Welfare\n- Health and Wellness\n- Ingredient Transparency and Traceability\n- Supply Chain Management\n- Farming and Production Methods\n\nIn Fiscal 2022, we completed the first phase of our survey, which included 100% of the vendors that produce branded products for our broadline foodservice business and satisfied our goal to cover 95% of suppliers of PFG-branded products. We are using the responses to assess our suppliers\u2019 ESG performance, determine opportunities for collaboration, and identify potential supply chain risks. The survey will be incorporated as a requirement in our RFP process in the future. In addition, we will conduct the second phase of our ESG Survey in Fiscal 2023 focusing on our largest suppliers, based on vendor spend.\n\nWe also developed a Preferred Purchasing Policy that rewards suppliers with mature ESG performance to ensure that we remain committed to sourcing from responsible vendor partners. We recognize that procuring from vendors with mutual ESG commitments and efforts will improve environmental, ethical, and economic performance while creating a culture of sustainability. Under our Preferred Purchasing Policy, we will purchase products and services that have a reduced effect on people and the environment when compared to competing products or services that serve the same purpose \u2013 all while remaining fiscally responsible. Our Preferred Purchasing Policy will strengthen our supply chain in a way that integrates fiscal responsibility, social equity, and community and environmental stewardship whenever possible.\nFOOD TRANSPARENCY\n\n**GOAL:** PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY ON 85% OF PFG BRANDED FOOD ITEMS BY 2030.\n\nIn alignment with growing consumer demand for greater transparency across the food industry, PFG is committed to increasing the transparency of its branded portfolio items. We have implemented a Supplier Compliance Campaign that requires our suppliers to provide predefined information about their products\u2019 ingredients, claims, and attributes. We are identifying items with 80% nutritional attributes or those with content sourced through the Global Data Synchronization Network (GDSN), an internet-based network of synchronized product-identification data. By doing so, we aim to provide transparency on 85% of our branded food items by 2025.\n\nIn an effort to increase publication through GDSN and improve our nutritional claim information, the Master Data Management (MDM) team has been hosting webinars with branded and non-branded vendors to communicate the enhanced data-sharing requirement. We work closely with vendors to ensure PFG\u2019s ingredient transparency expectations are met and have developed implementation guides to assist suppliers in meeting our requirements.\n\nFOOD SAFETY\n\nFood safety is a top priority at PFG. All PFG locations undergo an independent third-party food safety audit each year and must maintain a minimum acceptable score. PFG\u2019s Quality Assurance (QA) conducts annual internal food safety audits, which are used either as preparation for the third-party audit or as a follow-up. PFG QA also reviews Standard Operating Procedures twice per year and annually updates our Hazardous Analysis of Critical Control Points Plan.\n\nAll PFG production facilities operate under a unique program, including product-specific hazard analyses, which address the potential for chemical hazards in food. Based on the hazard analyses, we implement control points within our production process flow to reduce chemical risks. Our produce suppliers follow USDA and FDA standards for agriculture. We continue to expand our offering of organic and greenhouse-grown produce. Both will contribute to the reduction of pesticides and herbicides.\nOCCUPATIONAL HEALTH & SAFETY\n\nThe safety and well-being of our associates is important to PFG and is a vital component of our success. We are committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment for every associate \u2013 from the moment they join PFG and throughout their careers with the company.\n\nWe have established comprehensive health and safety programs and an organizational structure to ensure all operations are aligned with the expectations set within PFG\u2019s Health & Safety Policy. This policy is provided to all associates during their onboarding process at PFG and establishes the norms and requirements for managing all activities in accordance with safe and healthy practices for preventing injury and loss of life.\n\nFiscal 2022 was a year of integration. As we introduced the Convenience operating companies into the safety metrics, we saw a 3.5% increase in our Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) and an increase of approximately 23% in both Lost-Time Case Rates (LTC) and Auto Liability Accident Rates (AMM). Some of the increase may be attributed to the addition of the new entities, while much of the increase is due to heavy onboarding and continued training opportunities as we increase staff post-COVID. We continue to focus on strategic health and safety programs, initiatives, and associate training as we apply best practices from the integrated companies into the PFG safety platform.\n\nPFG employs a variety of approaches to continually enhance our safety performance, including behavior-based safety, hazard identification and control, and the implementation of cutting-edge technological safety solutions.\n\nPFG BEHAVIOR-BASED SAFETY (BBS) PROGRAM\n\nThis program creates a safety partnership between team leaders and associates that focuses on the reduction and elimination of risky behavior through targeted observation and coaching. Safety improvement is achieved primarily by changing the behavior of associates and encouraging a strong safety culture. In Fiscal 2022, approximately 26,500 BBS observations were conducted, allowing for real-time coaching and ongoing safety feedback for associates.\n\nONBOARD TELEMATICS SOLUTION\n\nWe continue to enhance and utilize Artificial Intelligence Enabled Camera Systems to help proactively reduce incidents. The system provides immediate alerts to our drivers to allow them to self-correct, but also provides a dashboard for management to identify and document coachable opportunities. Various risky behaviors such as speeding, inattentive driving, and harsh breaking have seen meaningful reductions. The Camera Telematics platform will be installed in all business segments by the end of Fiscal Year 2023. This includes an additional 2,030 cameras in the Core-Mark and Merchant\u2019s operating companies.\n\nCoaching safe driving behaviors aids in the reduction of accident rates. These dashcams provide real-time audio alerts when detecting risky behavior (i.e. in-cab distractions, critical distance, lane departure, etc.). In addition, recorded events and metrics captured by this technology are used to identify coaching and feedback opportunities to improve safe driving skills and behavior. This program has led to improved safety behavior behind the wheel, a core component for our journey toward zero collisions and zero injuries.\n\n| SAFETY KPIs                  | FY21  | FY22  |\n|-----------------------------|-------|-------|\n| INCIDENT RATE (IR)          | 6.78  | 7.02  |\n| IR Formula = (No. of OSHA Recordable Cases X 200,000) / No. of Employee Labor Hours Worked |\n| LOST-TIME CASE RATE (LTC)   | 2.29  | 2.81  |\n| LTC Formula = (No. of Lost Time Cases X 200,000) / No. of Employee Labor Hours Worked |\n| ACCIDENTS/MILLION MILES (AMM)| 4.77  | 5.85  |\n| AMM Formula = (No. of Transportation Accidents / (Transportation Miles/1,000,000)) |\n\nFY21 results do not include Convenience or Performance Merchants locations.\nOCCUPATIONAL HEALTH & SAFETY CONT.\n\nDRIVER SAFETY TRAINING\nAll PFG drivers are required to complete a defensive driver training program to enhance safe driving habits and hazard perception. The training focuses on areas such as reduced involvement in potential collisions and decreased self-induced driving stress.\n\nTRUCK DRIVER HALL OF FAME\nEight of PFG\u2019s truck drivers were recently named to the 2022 International Foodservice Distributors Association (IFDA) Truck Driver Hall of Fame. This program honors the foodservice industry\u2019s top drivers for their outstanding records of service and safety. To be eligible for IFDA\u2019s Truck Driver Hall of Fame, drivers must have at least 25 years of employment with an IFDA member company and have no moving violations or chargeable accidents within the last five years. Together, the PFG inductees have more than 226 combined years of safe and reliable driving.\n\n\u201cAT PFG, WE UNDERSTAND AND RECOGNIZE THE ESSENTIAL ROLE OUR DELIVERY PROFESSIONALS PLAY IN TRANSPORTING PRODUCTS TO THE MANY CUSTOMERS WHO RELY ON US EVERY DAY. OUR TRANSPORTATION TEAM VALUES A COMMITMENT TO SAFETY AND TEAMWORK, AND THESE EIGHT INDIVIDUALS (INDUCTED INTO THE TRUCK DRIVER HALL OF FAME) LIVE THOSE VALUES EVERY DAY. WE ARE PROUD TO CELEBRATE THEIR SUCCESSFUL CAREERS AND ACKNOWLEDGE THIS INCREDIBLE ACHIEVEMENT.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Jeff Williamson\nSenior Vice President, Operations\nPerformance Food Group\nHUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\nGOAL: ENHANCE PFG\u2019S CULTURE & PROMOTE ENGAGEMENT BY USING FEEDBACK & RESULTS FROM ENTERPRISE ASSOCIATE ENGAGEMENT SURVEYS.\n\nASSOCIATE BENEFITS, WELLNESS, & COMPENSATION\n\nAt PFG, our associates are our number one resource. Based on responses collected through our Associate Engagement Survey, we expanded programs in the past year with the theme \u201cDesigned with YOU in Mind.\u201d\n\nOur benefits programs are designed to provide a wide range of services and financial protections across our diverse workforce. Associates are eligible for benefits from day one. We offer multiple medical insurance plans, funded health savings accounts, pharmacy savings programs, wellness reward opportunities, dental, vision, disability, and life insurance. In addition, we provide programs that offer free health coaching, diabetes support, and weight loss programs.\n\nNew this past year, we implemented a program for all medical plan participants that provides no-cost education, coaching, and exercise therapy for joint and back pain. The program includes an online therapist, wearable sensors that provide feedback to an app, and support throughout the recovery process. We also have a special program for drivers to support healthy sleep and overall safety.\n\nWith all the challenges of today\u2019s environment, we provide a multitude of programs to support our associates and their needs. PFG continues to offer our Employee Assistance Program to all associates and eligible dependents for prevalent concerns such as mental health, depression, financial needs, substance abuse, and stress management. Our program provides five free face-to-face counseling sessions or virtual phone app appointments, with relaxation and stress reduction techniques available via a separate application.\n\nWe enhanced our education assistance policy, providing associates with faster eligibility, increased annual maximums, and reimbursement for GED testing. We also launched a scholarship for the children of associates and a backup child and elder care support program, which includes center-based and home care at a low cost.\n\nFinancially, PFG provides associates with competitive salaries and incentive-based pay across the organization. We offer substantial time off programs with the opportunity to recharge and sick time when our employees need it most. Our 401(k) program offers dollar-for-dollar matching up to a limit, and our Employee Stock Purchase program provides a 15% discount on company stock, which allows associates to share in the company\u2019s successes.\n\nOur Richmond headquarters earned the Direction Award from the Richmond Times-Dispatch\u2019s 2022 Top Workplaces program. The Direction Award is a special honor awarded to the company whose employees feel the most strongly about their company\u2019s strategic direction. We were the highest-ranked company in this category out of 87 corporate participants in the 2022 Top Workplaces survey.\nHUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT CONT.\n\nGOAL: BUILD PFG\u2019S CENTER FOR LEARNING MODEL TO HELP ALIGN ASSOCIATE GOALS WHILE DRIVING BUSINESS RESULTS THROUGH DELIVERY OF TRAINING & DEVELOPMENT CURRICULUMS & OPPORTUNITIES.\n\nTRAINING & DEVELOPMENT\n\nOVER 30,000 PFG ASSOCIATES COMPLETED MORE THAN 366,000 TRAINING COURSES\n\nOur goal is to build a lifelong learning culture by focusing on attracting, developing, retaining, and preparing our current workforce for success while developing future leaders. We empower associates with the right training at the right time throughout their career journey. Using a blended approach of instructor-led and self-paced training, we provide our associates with role-specific training that is just-in-time, accessible, and personalized.\n\nOur E3 Leadership Development program is in place to provide leadership training opportunities for all levels of leadership, from entry level to executive, advancing leadership skills at every point of their career. In the past year, PFG launched the third component of our E3 Leadership Development program and created the framework for our Center for Learning.\n\nThrough our Learning Management System (LMS), we deliver a variety of required and optional on-demand learning modules that are linked to an associate\u2019s role with the company, including those modules tied to safety and compliance, such as our Code of Business Conduct.\nBUILDING A CULTURE OF INCLUSION\n\nPFG is committed to providing a culture of inclusion where every associate and customer feels a sense of belonging. Our Vice President of Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging developed a framework focused on critical components that help us enable and achieve this experience. Our framework clearly defines and outlines the following relevant components to engage and activate diversity, inclusion, and belonging:\n\n- Diversity and Inclusion Strategy\n- Leadership Commitment\n- Talent Acquisition\n- Inclusive Performance Management\n- Equitable and Inclusive Culture\n- Marketplace and Community Impact\n\nOUR COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY, INCLUSION, & BELONGING IS GUIDED BY THREE KEY STRATEGIES:\n\n1. Promote an inclusive culture and sense of belonging to engage our workforce.\n2. Increase the diversity of our workforce to reflect the communities we serve.\n3. Support underrepresented groups and suppliers to drive economic development in our communities.\n\nASSOCIATE RESOURCE GROUPS\n\nAssociate Resource Groups (ARGs) are company-sponsored, associate-led networks that foster inclusion and build community, enhance career and personal development, and promote cultural awareness. ARGs are a key component of our framework and strategy because they help us cultivate an inclusive workplace, recruit and retain top talent, develop associates\u2019 skills and capabilities, and recognize and reward high performers.\n\nEarlier this year, we launched our first enterprise-wide ARG, Women of PFG. The group\u2019s focus is on building an inclusive community and advocating for the development and advancement of all women at PFG. Women of PFG is the first of eight ARGs that will help lead PFG into the future. Additional PFG ARGs will support our associate population across dimensions of diversity, including:\n\n- Black/African American\n- Hispanic\n- LGBTQ+\n- Asian American and Pacific Islander\n- Veterans\n- Associates with Disabilities\n- Young Professionals\n\n\u201cASSOCIATE RESOURCE GROUPS ARE A KEY COMPONENT OF OUR ASSOCIATE ENGAGEMENT FRAMEWORK AND STRATEGY. THESE COMMUNITIES ARE A POWERFUL WAY TO FOSTER INCLUSION AND EMPOWER ASSOCIATES. POSITIONED AS CRITICAL BUSINESS PARTNERS, THEIR COLLECTIVE VOICE OFFERS US A DIVERSE AND MORE COMPLETE PERSPECTIVE IN KEY ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS THAT HELP INFORM AND GUIDE OUR DIRECTION.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Claudia Mills\nVice President, Diversity & Inclusion\nPerformance Food Group\nBUILDING A CULTURE OF INCLUSION CONT.\n\nWOMEN\u2019S FOODSERVICE FORUM\n\nPerformance Food Group is a proud advocate and sponsor of the Women\u2019s Foodservice Forum (WFF). WFF\u2019s mission to accelerate the advancement of women leaders in the food industry aligns with our commitment to building an inclusive, diverse, and engaged workforce. This year, to support their development, we sponsored a record 152 associates to attend the WFF Limitless Leadership Conference. Our associates came back inspired and ready to do more.\n\nHERITAGE & CULTURAL MONTH PROGRAMMING\n\nOne of the ways we broadly engage associates is our Heritage and Cultural Month programming to build an inclusive culture, create awareness, and help our associates learn through relevant discussions and shared experiences. Building an equitable and inclusive culture also means ensuring everyone can access and participate in such programming \u2013 including our offline or frontline associates. In addition to encouraging all associates to participate, we try to ensure these events are available to all associates through event recordings or other online options. Our 2022 Heritage and Cultural Month programming included:\n\n- Black History Month\n- Women\u2019s History Month\n- Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month\n- Juneteenth\n- Pride Month\nBUILDING A CULTURE OF INCLUSION CONT.\n\nGOAL: INCREASE SPEND WITH MINORITY-, WOMEN-, & VETERAN-OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE (MWVBE) SUPPLIERS BY 25% BY 2030.\n\nPFG became a corporate member of the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC) to support global supply chain diversity and foster strategic partnerships, and we will continue to pursue additional partnership opportunities. This past year, PFG also joined three organizations that provide minority certifications, funding, and guidance to business enterprises. The corporate membership will allow us to broaden our supplier base and support our commitment to diversity and inclusion.\n\n- **WOMEN\u2019S BUSINESS ENTERPRISE NATIONAL COUNCIL (WBENC):** WBENC was founded in 1997 to develop a national standard for women-owned business certification. Since then, the organization has become the largest third-party certifier of businesses owned, controlled, and operated by women in the United States and a leading advocate for women-owned businesses in corporate and government supply chains.\n\n- **NATIONAL LGBT CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (NGLCC):** The NGLCC is the exclusive, third-party certification body that verifies eligible businesses are majority owned by LGBT individuals and subsequently grants Certified LGBT Business Enterprise\u00ae (Certified LGBTE\u00ae) designation to such companies as part of its LGBT Supplier Diversity Initiative.\n\n- **NATIONAL VETERAN-OWNED BUSINESS ASSOCIATION (NAVOBA):** NaVOBA\u2019s mission is to create contracting opportunities for America\u2019s Veteran Business Enterprises (VBEs) and Service-Disabled Veteran Business Enterprises (SDVBEs) through certification, advocacy, outreach, recognition, and education.\n\nIn April 2022, we initiated our Diversity Supplier Spotlight and National Announcements to promote new and existing suppliers that are MWVBE, LGBTQ, veteran owned and other diverse groups. We spotlight suppliers on our Yammer diversity website. We also have an MWVBE Champions Program that consists of 17 Performance Foodservice, Core-Mark, and Vistar associates who meet monthly to discuss the best business practices for supplier diversity.\nCOMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT\n\nGOAL: EXPAND ADVOCACY, VOLUNTEERISM, & CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS WITH ORGANIZATIONS COMMITTED TO FIGHTING FOOD INSECURITY, SUPPORTING HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES, ADDRESSING HUMAN TRAFFICKING, & PROVIDING DISASTER RELIEF.\n\nIN FISCAL 2022, PFG CONTRIBUTED MORE THAN $3.7 MILLION IN CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS.\n\nOur community engagement strategy aligns with the approach we take in our business \u2014 providing support at the enterprise level, as well as fostering meaningful local partnerships in the communities where we operate and where our associates and their families live. PFG has national philanthropic partnerships with Feeding America\u00ae, the American Red Cross\u00ae, and Truckers Against Trafficking\u00ae. Locally, PFG engages with more than 175 organizations. PFG partnered with the American Heart Association\u00ae as the Nutrition Security Sponsor for the 2022 Richmond Heart Walk and launched an American Red Cross disaster relief fundraising campaign. Our business segments and operating companies continue to support local non-profit partners in a way that builds and grows strong relationships.\nPFG stands on a foundation of integrity for how we carry out our business. The success and resilience of our business depends on our trusted, quality relationships with our customers, suppliers, and communities. We not only strive to ensure legal and regulatory compliance, but we also carry out high standards of ethics throughout our business and integrate ESG into our overall risk management and governance practices.\n\nGOVERNANCE STRUCTURE\nDATA PRIVACY & SECURITY\nCODES OF CONDUCT\n- Code of Business Conduct\n- Business Partner Code of Conduct\n- Environmental Policies\n- Human Rights Policy\nGOVERNANCE STRUCTURE\n\nFIVE OUT OF 11 MEMBERS OF THE BOARD REPRESENT GENDER & ETHNIC DIVERSITY.\n\n- Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for overseeing our ESG efforts. In addition to our Board Committee, we have developed a C-suite ESG Executive Committee that consists of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Legal Officer, who meet with our ESG leader and who provide direction on our ESG efforts. This includes ensuring that the ESG program has the resourcing and support needed to deliver on our ESG goals and strategies.\n\n- Our internal governance structure also oversees a series of cross-functional ESG committees that include Supply Chain, Operations, Reporting and Culture, Engagement and Communications. The committees meet regularly to establish goals, review action plans, and advance efforts intended to achieve the goals specific to each area.\nDATA PRIVACY & SECURITY\n\nPFG adopts a layered defense with an in-depth, risk-based approach to identifying and addressing data security. PFG\u2019s Information Security Training Program proactively assesses security trends, current gaps, and our business strategy to manage a three-year rolling cybersecurity strategy. This strategy considers existing risks or potential encounters based on our industry, company profile, and business objectives. The strategy also considers shifting technology trends that could have a material impact on our security infrastructure (e.g. third-party hosted/dependent and a mobile workforce).\n\nPFG maintains several administrative and technical controls and capabilities to both prevent and detect associated security risks. Our security capabilities and controls include a combination of internally defined policies and standards, technical solutions, operational processes, and staff training to address potential operational, reputational, financial, and regulatory risks. PFG\u2019s control environment and strategy are aligned with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Security.\n\nPreventative and detective controls are augmented by both technical and administrative capabilities to identify gaps in existing controls or vulnerabilities in information systems. PFG uses independent service providers at least annually to test PFG\u2019s network and select applications for vulnerabilities. PFG also maintains an internally managed vulnerability program, which regularly assesses PFG systems and reports to our IT team and business leadership for awareness, action, and/or acknowledgment/acceptance of associated risks. PFG also maintains a Risk Management program to identify and track information risks from many different sources and adjudicates them based on severity, including third parties, technology projects, acquisitions, ad hoc risk assessments, and external audits.\n\nPFG is subject to external audits related to Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting (ICOFR), which includes yearly Information Technology General Control Testing and periodic reviews of risks/controls related to cybersecurity that may impact financial reporting control objectives.\n\nPFG maintains an Information Security Training Program that combines several forms of training across user types. Training methods include general ad hoc advisories, computer-based training/e-learning, and mock phishing exercises. Computer-based training is tailored for general end users, as well as targeted training for users in inherently higher-risk positions, which include those subject to specific regulatory requirements or enrolled based on performance of mock phishing exercises.\nCODES OF CONDUCT\n\nCODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT\n\nIntegrity is a part of our heritage and informs our perspective toward business. We express our commitment to the highest ethical standards in our Code of Business Conduct. The Code addresses expected behavior with our fellow associates, shareholders, suppliers, customers, and communities. Our code commits PFG to operate honestly, ethically, and in good faith, ensuring that PFG and its stakeholders are compliant with all laws, rules, and regulations. It sets forth our policies and expectations on several topics, including conflicts of interest, confidentiality, anti-bribery, business conduct, insider trading, safety, nondiscrimination, and unlawful harassment. The code also provides an anonymous hotline and multiple channels for reporting violations to the code and employs an anti-retaliation policy to protect all who in good faith come forward with a report or complaint. All associates and board members receive training on our code.\n\nBUSINESS PARTNER CODE OF CONDUCT\n\nPFG prioritizes working with business partners that share our commitment to conduct business responsibly, sustainably, and in alignment with our ESG goals. Our Business Partner Code of Conduct defines the conduct expectations we have for our supply chain partners. The Business Partner Code addresses material issues such as conflict of interest, anti-bribery, corruption, and money laundering, as well as international legal compliance, human rights, workforce standards, health, safety, the environment, and food safety. Our Business Partner Code of Conduct also highlights PFG\u2019s right to audit compliance and verify ESG business performance by vendors we work with and articulates our right to terminate our relationship with vendors that violate the provisions of this code. Through our code, we aim to cultivate transparent, fair, and ethical relationships with suppliers.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES\n\nPFG recognizes the vital balance of minimizing our impact on the environment while maximizing value to all stakeholders. Our Environmental Policy and Climate Change Policy establish our commitments and guide our efforts to reduce operational impacts on the environment and build our resilience against climate change.\n\nHUMAN RIGHTS POLICY\n\nAt PFG, we are committed to upholding and promoting the human rights of our stakeholders throughout our operations and within our supply chains. In addition to our codes of conduct, we have an Enterprise Human Rights Policy that is aligned with internationally recognized conventions and frameworks, including the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n\nThe PFG Enterprise Human Rights Policy establishes the expectations we extend to our associates and business partners (suppliers, distributors, and other third parties) with respect to:\n\n- Society and Stakeholder Engagement\n- Diversity and Inclusion\n- Safety and Healthy and Secure Workplaces\n- Forced Labor, Child Labor, and Human Trafficking\n- Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining\n- Access to Nutritious Food and Water\n\nWe believe that associate engagement and education are key to the full implementation of our Enterprise Human Rights Policy across the organization and our supply chain.

We market and distribute approximately 250,000 food and food-related products. Headquartered in Richmond, Va., we operate from 142 distribution centers to more than 300,000 customer locations across the United States. Our more than 35,000 associates serve a diverse mix of customers, from independent and chain restaurants to schools, business and industry locations, hospitals, vending distributors, office coffee service distributors, retailers, convenience stores, and theaters. We work to build lasting relationships with our customers for the success of all.\n\nPFG understands that the nature of our business exposes us to climate-related risks, both physically and as we transition to a low-carbon economy. We are committed to strategizing climate risk mitigation and adaptation while providing transparency to our stakeholders regarding our climate-related risks and opportunities. This includes having scenario plans in place to address severe weather events, diversifying our supply chain, and reducing emissions throughout our business. This report demonstrates our governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets related to climate change impacts across our entire value chain.\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nBOARD\u2019S OVERSIGHT\n\nPFG\u2019s Board Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for overseeing our ESG efforts. The committee provides direct guidance to the company\u2019s senior executives on our ESG strategy and helps to ensure that there are active measures in place to mitigate risks and safeguard business continuity. The Board\u2019s Audit and Finance Committee is responsible for providing oversight on enterprise risk management, including guidance on ranking and evaluation of specific enterprise risks.\n\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S ROLE\n\nIn addition to our Board, we have developed an Executive ESG Steering Committee that consists of our Chief Financial Officer and our Chief Legal Officer. The committee meets regularly with our ESG leader and provides regular direction on our ESG efforts while supporting our ESG program to ensure we deliver on our ESG goals and strategy, particularly to mitigate climate risks.\n\nOur internal governance structure also oversees a series of cross-functional ESG committees that include Supply Chain, Operations, Reporting and Culture, Engagement and Communications. These committees meet regularly to review action plans and advance efforts intended to achieve the ESG goals specific to each area. Our Supply Chain and Operations committees directly engage in supporting efforts to identify and address climate risk. They determine our baseline emissions, set our carbon reduction and renewable energy goals, assess our supply chain\u2019s ESG performance, and identify and address any other specific risks or concerns.\nGOVERNANCE CONT.\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nWe recognize that climate change will impact every community, industry, and company on the planet, including PFG. That is why we are evaluating the different types of risks posed by climate change and how they could impact our business, operations, and supply chain. The key risks of climate change fall into two main categories: physical and transition risks.\n\nPhysical risks are the risks generated by the effects of a changing climate, including both acute and chronic indicators (see below). Physical risks may impact our operations directly based on the geographical location and type of facility. Impacts on infrastructure could affect our workforce\u2019s ability to work safely and the reliability of our supply chain. Increased water scarcity in high-risk areas due to rising temperatures may increase water input costs and availability. Physical risks ultimately have the potential to disrupt operations across our value chain.\n\nTransition risks are risks related to the global transition to a low-carbon economy. These risks can be grouped into three categories: 1) policy and legal, 2) market and technology, and 3) reputational risk. Policy constraints on GHG emissions in our operations and supply chain have the potential to impact the cost of doing business. Failure to adapt to changing customer preferences around food products may impact overall sales. Supply chain continuity can disrupt operations and our bottom line. We must mitigate our impacts on and from climate change to protect our reputation as a trusted leader in the foodservice industry.\n\nAs part of PFG\u2019s strategy to address climate-related physical and transition risks, we have set out to develop a comprehensive Climate Risk Analysis, which will help us identify the most material climate risks, assess their current and future impact on our operations, and develop adaptation and mitigation strategies. In this report, we provide selected insights from our preliminary analysis and key strategic activities to address these issues. We will continue to evaluate potential risks to our business and update their expected time horizon so that we can take appropriate mitigation measures.\n\n| ACUTE          | CHRONIC                        | TIME HORIZON     |\n|----------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|\n| HURRICANES     | Increasing Average Temperatures | Short Term: 1-3 years |\n| WILDFIRES      | Rising Sea Levels              | Medium Term: 3-5 years |\n| FLOODING       | Extended Droughts              | Long Term: > 5 years |\n| STORMS         | Precipitation Variability      |                 |\n| EXTREME HEAT DAYS | Water Stress                  |                 |\nPHYSICAL RISKS\n\nACUTE\n\nINCREASING FREQUENCY OF EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS, NATURAL HAZARDS, & DISASTERS\n\n| RISK | STRATEGY |\n|------|----------|\n| Global temperature rise due to greenhouse gases has led to the increasing frequency of extreme weather events such as cyclones, hurricanes, heat waves and storms, as well as natural hazards like floods, wildfires, and earthquakes. The United Nations warned in September 2021 that the world was on track to reach 2.7\u00b0C warming by the end of the century unless countries act to significantly reduce GHG emissions and transition to low-carbon and renewable energy. | A third party has been supporting PFG to analyze the company\u2019s carbon footprint. Based on the results of the analysis, PFG set an enterprise-wide carbon reduction target, covering Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions. PFG also has a strategic plan for expanding the purchase of renewable power. The company is implementing programs to reduce its carbon intensity by improving the energy efficiency at its facilities and fleet fuel management. These programs include low-carbon technologies and strategically located distribution centers. Any new PFG buildings will also be equipped for solar power if installed in the future. |\n| The increasing frequency of extreme weather events and natural hazards could cause significant damage or business interruptions to our distribution centers, routes, supply chain, and customers\u2019 facilities. For example, according to the EPA Climate Resilience Evaluation and Awareness Tool (CREAT), 102 of PFG\u2019s distribution centers and offices are predicted to have more than a 10% increase in storm intensity by 2035 (under the \u201cmoderately stormy\u201d scenario). | PFG must not only do our part to reduce emissions, but also plan for extreme weather events and hazards. Our comprehensive business continuity and disaster recovery readiness strategy prepares our business to react to a wide range of man-made and natural events that threaten our business and those of our suppliers and customers. Our strategy includes: |\n| Such events also pose risks to the safety and well-being of our associates and local communities, which are critical to our continued business success. Negative impacts on our infrastructure, supply chain, and workforce could result in additional operational costs. | \u2022 Developing, implementing, and constantly reevaluating the effectiveness of our business continuity and emergency preparedness plans for both seasonal and unexpected extreme weather events across the country (i.e. hurricane season) |\n| | \u2022 Monitoring the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) alert systems and reports for geographies with high climate change risk exposure to inform our own logistical response and community support efforts when disaster strikes |\n| | \u2022 Standardizing enterprise protocols for facility preparation, associate welfare check-ins, customer and supplier contingency plans for distribution, and the evacuation of people and products |\n| | \u2022 Implementing systems for controlled shutdown of facility operations and power sources, damage assessment for facilities, product and surrounding infrastructure, and facility startup and repair personnel notification |\n| | \u2022 Continuing to advance our backup power strategy to include fixed generators with automatic transfer switches in geographies prone to outages, as well as mobile generators strategically located across the US to allow us to reach all locations within 16 hours when needed |\n| | \u2022 Rerouting training for our distribution operators to ensure those on the front lines of delivering products, especially in times of extreme need, can leverage their skill set in rerouting distribution when infrastructure damage poses an immediate and unanticipated threat |\n| | \u2022 Enhancing neighboring operating company collaboration on business continuity responses will strengthen our ability to manage threats across geographies, product categories, and stakeholder groups |\n\nSHORT TO LONG TERM\nPHYSICAL RISKS CONT.\n\n### CHRONIC\n\n#### SHIFTING CLIMATE PATTERNS\n\n| RISK | STRATEGY |\n|------|----------|\n| Long-term shifts in sea levels, precipitation patterns, and average temperatures will impact all parts of the globe, including our living and operating areas. For example, two PFG distribution facilities are already facing a baseline extremely high-risk exposure to riverine flooding, according to the World Resources Institute\u2019s Global Aqueduct mapping. Such shifting climate patterns will make it difficult to predict supply stability and reinforce the need to diversify our supply chain. Failure to accurately predict and plan production, sourcing, and the purchasing of raw materials could result in distressed inventories or delays in meeting customer requirements. These climate issues could also have a negative impact on distribution, the stability of the electric grid, and overall business continuity. These risks could result in operational strain, losses due to unfulfilled deliveries, and employee overtime pay to rectify unforeseen issues. Our operational costs may also rise due to increasing energy and refrigeration, as needed, to maintain food safety due to rising temperatures. | PFG is actively working to set minimum and maximum thresholds for single-source products and seeks to diversify products across food/commodity categories to multi-source wherever possible. PFG has been focusing on implementing strategic energy efficiency projects throughout our facilities by investing in energy-saving technologies and optimizing operations and maintenance practices. We continuously evaluate technology for powering tractors and trailer refrigeration with electric and alternative fuel solutions. We implemented our first electric trailer refrigeration technology to reduce diesel fuel usage and overall carbon emissions. PFG anticipates implementing our first battery electric vehicles in Fiscal 2023. Route optimization is a key to maximizing efficiency and minimizing operational costs. We conduct training programs on leading industry technology used to select the most efficient routes for product distribution. Moreover, strategically located redistribution centers allow us to minimize our miles traveled, time spent on the road, fuel usage, and carbon emissions on a per-case basis. As we build new facilities, PFG strategizes to incorporate energy-efficient solutions. We have been performing Energy Efficiency Engagements at Performance Foodservice locations to consider operational improvements. As a result, we established new protocols, including a demand response program, to reduce energy use during peak demand hours. |\n\n### CHRONIC\n\n#### INTENSIFYING WATER STRESS & SCARCITY\n\n| DESCRIPTION | STRATEGY |\n|-------------|----------|\n| Water stress and scarcity caused by climate change are intensifying, including extended droughts and heat waves. Increased water scarcity due to extended drought and increased water demand can impact our distribution capabilities, suppliers, revenues, and the livelihoods of our people. Currently, 28 of PFG distribution centers, offices, and warehouses are in areas already facing an extremely high risk of baseline water stress according to the World Resources Institute\u2019s Global Aqueduct. These facilities are mainly located in Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. | Due to the nature of our business, water usage is not material to our operations. However, PFG has started tracking water and sewer bills in collaboration with a third party to analyze and develop our water management program. We plan to explore water-saving efforts across our enterprise as we recognize the importance of transforming our operations to be more water efficient and less exposed to risk of water commodity changes. Lastly, we engage with our suppliers and look for ways to support water-related programs. |\n\n### MEDIUM TO LONG TERM\n\n| DESCRIPTION | STRATEGY |\n|-------------|----------|\n| | |\n## TRANSITION RISKS\n\n### POLICY & REGULATIONS\n\n**GROWING REQUIREMENTS AND TARGETS ON GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS AND CLIMATE DISCLOSURES**\n\n| RISK | STRATEGY |\n|------|----------|\n| To reduce global GHG emissions and slow global warming, governments at the federal and state levels are proposing and implementing climate-related disclosure requirements and emissions targets, which can increase operational costs and litigation exposure. | PFG has taken a proactive position on ESG and climate risk reporting, using both the Sustainable Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) frameworks annually. The company is also working to proactively reduce emissions and its reliance on traditional fossil fuels. This includes:  \n- Monitoring regulatory developments at the federal, state, and local level  \n- Assessing emission levels to set climate goals and implement the ESG strategy  \n- Deploying renewable energy through on-site installations  \n- Reducing carbon intensity through active Energy Efficiency Engagements and operational improvements  \n- Expanding access to more sustainably sourced products |\n\n### MARKET & TECHNOLOGY\n\n**IMPROVING ENERGY EFFICIENCY**\n\n| DESCRIPTION | STRATEGY |\n|-------------|----------|\n| Technological improvements are needed to transition to a lower-carbon economy. Solutions that improve energy efficiency, expand renewable energy, and reduce waste have all been identified as necessary pathways to reducing global warming and mitigating climate change. The substitution of existing products and services to transition to lower emissions technology can result in increased costs. | PFG continuously considers renewable energy purchasing options, both on-site opportunities and power purchasing agreements. The company has set a goal of procuring 10% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030. We conduct Energy Efficiency Engagements by partnering with third-party energy management consulting firms to explore efficiency opportunities for reducing energy use, electricity costs, and emissions within our lighting and charging systems. We are exploring opportunities to implement solar infrastructure at our facilities, and all our new buildings will be equipped to accommodate solar technology. PFG also closely monitors the evolution of low-carbon technologies for powering fleet transportation and refrigeration. We actively manage the lifecycle of the fleet vehicles and implement a comprehensive strategy for vehicle replacement. We continue to use routing technology to optimize efficiency and implement best practices and training initiatives. Over the next two years, PFG plans to continue to introduce additional all-electric TRUs to our fleet. We are developing a program to provide recyclable, biodegradable, and compostable non-food items, including PFAS-free carry-out containers, sustainable cutlery, paper hot and cold cups, and paper bags. Our strategy will reduce both our risks and our customers\u2019 risks and support our competitive advantage by providing a solution to a fundamental sustainability challenge in the restaurant, hospitality, and foodservice industries. |\n\n### SHORT TERM\n\n### SHORT TO LONG TERM\nAs the economy transitions to a low-carbon economy, the demand and supply for different goods and services, as well as their prices, will fluctuate as well. The ways that markets could be affected by climate change are complicated and difficult to predict. For example, customers have been seeking responsibly sourced foods and transparency with food labels.\n\nPFG has set a goal for 90% of PFG-branded beef, pork, poultry, seafood, coffee, and tea to be produced with verified environmentally sustainable and socially responsible practices by 2025. We conducted a survey using a third party to evaluate our present state of product certification that received more than a 90% response rate. We also conduct customer satisfaction surveys twice a year to evaluate changing attitudes and purchasing requirements. These insights are then used to help drive strategic decisions around customer engagement and product development. The PFG ESG Supplier Survey also evaluates the potential impact of our supply chain to identify areas of opportunity, as well as risks, to mitigate.\n\nPFG is committed to increasing the transparency of our branded portfolio items. We implemented a Supplier Compliance Campaign that requires our suppliers to provide predefined information about their products\u2019 ingredients, claims, and attributes. We also host webinars with branded and non-branded vendors to communicate our enhanced data-sharing requirement to improve our nutritional claim information. We work closely with vendors and developed implementation guides to ensure suppliers meet PFG\u2019s ingredient transparency expectations.\n\n| RISK | STRATEGY |\n|------|----------|\n| As the economy transitions to a low-carbon economy, the demand and supply for different goods and services, as well as their prices, will fluctuate as well.

Customer and consumer perception could shift in favor of companies that are mitigating their climate change impact. | Our ESG commitments and strategies show our investors and customers how we plan to act on climate change. We will continue to report on our progress, successes, and learnings throughout our ESG journey, which includes progress toward our climate change goals. This information is readily available in our annual ESG Report found on our website. |\n## OPPORTUNITIES\n\n| OPPORTUNITY | STRATEGY |\n|-------------|----------|\n| **EFFICIENCY** | PFG has goals to reduce power consumption intensity by 20% by 2030 against our Fiscal 2020 baseline and achieve an 80% diversion rate for operational waste by 2030. These goals guide our strategy and efforts to explore and evaluate technology to optimize our operations, transportation, and distribution. We consider low-carbon technologies for our fleet transportation to reduce fuel usage and carbon emissions associated with fleet refrigeration. Over the next several years, PFG plans to continue carbon footprint reduction efforts by introducing additional all-electric TRUs to our fleet and implementing our first battery electric vehicles in Fiscal 2023. We will resume monitoring operational and food waste to divert waste from landfills and actively track our recycling. |\n| **RENEWABLE ENERGY** | It is essential for PFG to diversify its energy sourcing to combat both evolving climate policy and to mitigate potential pricing concerns and availability and consistency of fossil fuel service. We set a goal to secure 10% of purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2030, and we are in process of setting an enterprise-wide carbon reduction target, covering Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions. PFG has been focusing on implementing strategic energy efficiency projects throughout our facilities by investing in energy-saving technologies and optimizing operations. We are continuously exploring renewable power purchasing agreements and leveraging national and state tax incentives to procure more wind and solar energy across our enterprise. These efforts and implementation will enable PFG to power its facilities while significantly reducing the carbon emissions associated with our daily operations. |\n| **PRODUCTS AND SERVICES** | PFG has a goal to ensure 90% of PFG branded beef, pork, poultry, seafood, coffee, and tea are produced with verified environmentally sustainable and socially responsible practices by 2025. We are also developing an environmentally preferable purchasing program for PFG branded non-food products by 2023, expanding sustainable offerings for our customers. PFG completed a baseline analysis of Scope 1 and 2 emissions and set a GHG target that covers both scopes. PFG also completed our first phase of the ESG Supplier Survey to evaluate the ESG maturity of our suppliers, leverage responsible sourcing opportunities, and mitigate ESG risks. Our ESG goals, strategy, and efforts show our climate progress and meet the consumer demand for lower emissions and responsibly sourced food products. |\n\n## SCENARIO PLANNING\n\nPFG recognizes that scenario analysis is critical to determine the resilience of our strategies for climate-related risks and opportunities. A scenario describes a potential future, the path leading to that outcome, and its impact on an organization. We plan to evaluate our ERM system to involve more climate-related risks that impact us, the global food supply chain, and the foodservice industry. PFG is also in the process of completing a Climate Risk Analysis that will include scenario planning. The risks, opportunities, and our corresponding strategies discussed in the preceding tables highlight the initial findings from our qualitative scenario planning. The Climate Risk Analysis identifies which risks and opportunities will impact PFG over various time periods and strategizes our response to them. As our scenario analyses become more sophisticated, so will our risk and opportunity response plans. This process will allow us to identify where our strategies may be affected by climate change and how we should adjust to address the potential risks, opportunities, and impact of climate-related issues on our enterprise.\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n\nPFG has an ERM tool to identify categorical risks, rank those risks, and monitor progress of mitigating them. The risk analysis process assigns each risk as green, yellow, or red, which indicates escalating levels of risk to the company. PFG uses the analysis to update a dashboard that tracks the risk severity and risk mitigation progress.\n\nThe ERM analysis identified two categories that specifically included climate-related risks:\n\n- Supply Chain, including environmental and logistics/transportation disruption\n- Macroeconomic\n\nPFG\u2019s ERM process includes updates on the climate-related risks identified above to the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board at least twice a year. In addition, cross-functional teams within PFG are actively monitoring the challenges and opportunities represented by these risks and are creating strategic plans designed to ensure business continuity and an ability to maintain the consistency of operation required by our customers.\n\nThe dashboard is produced quarterly as part of an effort to regularly reassess risk levels and force rank the risks to ensure that the company is prioritizing significant concerns. The dashboards and the underlying ERM analysis ensure that PFG is actively engaged in effective risk management broadly.\n\nThe ERM efforts are combined with PFG\u2019s ESG program, which further assesses challenges, concerns, and risks associated with the issues that fall within the ESG program, including:\n\n- Sustainability and Environmental Performance\n- Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy\n- Responsible Sourcing\n\nIn Fiscal 2022, PFG completed the first phase of an ESG-focused supplier survey designed to assess how PFG\u2019s branded vendors are performing on ESG issues. Environmental Management is one of the core survey topics in which suppliers provide details on their commitments and comprehensiveness in environmental stewardship, including goals, systems, and oversight measures. PFG evaluated the survey responses and ranked the supply chain to identify who is leading and lagging regarding ESG performance. For suppliers in the leading category, PFG is developing collaboration opportunities to enhance the efficacy of our supply chain partners\u2019 efforts. For the lagging suppliers, PFG is identifying potential risks, which will be added to the larger risk analysis and addressed through PFG\u2019s ESG management and the ERM risk mitigation efforts.\nMETRICS & TARGETS\n\nPFG measures and monitors our climate-related risks and opportunities across the enterprise. We publicly report on these metrics annually in our ESG Report to allow stakeholders to assess our progress in adapting to climate-related issues.\n\nIn Fiscal 2022, PFG\u2019s Scope 1 and Scope 2 market-based emissions were 967,927 metric tons of CO2e. PFG has set an enterprise-wide carbon reduction target and commits to reducing 15% of our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emission intensity by 2030 from a 2021 base year.\n\nTo capture the opportunities pertaining to resource efficiency and the adoption of low-emission energy sources, PFG has established the following goals:\n\n- Reduce power consumption intensity by 20% by 2030.\n- Secure 10% of purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2030.\n- Achieve an 80% diversion rate for operational waste by 2030.\n- Develop an environmentally preferable purchasing program for PFG branded non-food products by 2023, expanding sustainable offerings for our customers.\n- Ensure 90% of PFG branded beef, pork, poultry, seafood, coffee, and tea are produced with verified environmentally sustainable and socially responsible practices by 2025.\n\nPFG is also actively tracking product-specific, climate-related risk through a contracted third party that provides daily, weekly, and monthly updates on food commodity risks on a global scale. This data is used to make decisions about the need to diversify sources and/or shift purchasing and product options to meet consumer demand. Changing climate conditions and severe weather disruptions are contributing factors included in the regular risk analysis.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nOur ESG strategy is committed to mitigating physical and transition risks from climate change to protect our planet, people, and performance. We understand the urgency to identify and monitor climate-related risks to our business. We will continue to measure and evaluate our impact on climate change and explore opportunities to reduce our operating costs and boost our resiliency. It is our mission to deliver high-quality, sustainably sourced products for our customers and our communities.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-04-27", "created": "2025-04-27", "metadata": {"Source-File": "climate_reports/tp_reports/performance_food_group_2022.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.1.59", "pdf-total-pages": 44, "total-input-tokens": 83438, "total-output-tokens": 20211, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 2071, 2], [2071, 5206, 3], [5206, 7268, 4], [7268, 9226, 5], [9226, 10989, 6], [10989, 13980, 7], [13980, 17199, 8], [17199, 17859, 9], [17859, 19365, 10], [19365, 20582, 11], [20582, 21721, 12], [21721, 24439, 13], [24439, 26634, 14], [26634, 27495, 15], [27495, 28875, 16], [28875, 30754, 17], [30754, 32899, 18], [32899, 36800, 19], [36800, 38211, 20], [38211, 41148, 21], [41148, 42540, 22], [42540, 44952, 23], [44952, 46254, 24], [46254, 48390, 25], [48390, 49496, 26], [49496, 50090, 27], [50090, 50976, 28], [50976, 53726, 29], [53726, 57191, 30], [57191, 57378, 31], [57378, 60143, 32], [60143, 63345, 33], [63345, 63596, 34], [63596, 66489, 35], [66489, 69198, 36], [69198, 73202, 37], [73202, 77174, 38], [77174, 80396, 39], [80396, 84337, 40], [84337, 88124, 41], [88124, 90549, 42], [90549, 92699, 43], [92699, 92699, 44]]}}
