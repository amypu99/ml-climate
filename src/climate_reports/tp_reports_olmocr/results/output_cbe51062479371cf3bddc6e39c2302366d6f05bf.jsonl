Mackay, Jr., Senior Vice President, Ethics and Enterprise Assurance\n\n\u201cAt Lockheed Martin, sustainability intersects with our Core Values \u2013 Do What\u2019s Right, Respect Others and Perform with Excellence. These words guide our actions and inspire how we pursue our future goals.\u201d\nLeadership Perspectives\nChairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Letter\n\nAt Lockheed Martin, we recognize the long-term success of our stakeholders is tied inextricably to the sustainability of our operations and the enduring relationships we have with global customers and in communities where we live and work. The rapidly evolving challenges of the 21st century compel us to accelerate innovation and deliver the advanced solutions our customers need to promote security, enhance international cooperation, and advance scientific discovery.\n\nOur commitments to providing innovative products and services and to operating as a sustainable enterprise stem from our Core Values \u2013 Do What\u2019s Right, Respect Others and Perform with Excellence. Achieving progress requires that we identify priorities among environmental, social and governance issues and direct investment and resources so our teams are empowered and focused.\n\nOne important action we are taking in this effort is harnessing the full benefits of digital transformation to increase the efficiency of our operations and processes. We\u2019re investing heavily to introduce new ways to digitally design, test, manufacture, and sustain our products so we can deliver more capable solutions more quickly and more efficiently.\n\nOur transformation efforts are reflected in Lockheed Martin\u2019s 2025 Sustainability Management Plan (2025 SMP), which is our five-year sustainability roadmap to carry out our vital mission. Our 2025 SMP includes four core priorities:\n\n- Advancing Resource Stewardship: We strive to use resources in the most efficient way possible and to minimize the environmental footprint of our operations.\n- Elevating Digital Responsibility: We protect data, privacy, and intellectual property and use artificial intelligence (AI) in an ethical manner.\n- Fostering Workplace Resiliency: We maintain an inclusive and safe environment in which we value individual employees\u2019 unique contributions to the success of our team and provide ample opportunities for their professional development and career growth.\n- Modeling Business Integrity: We operate ethically and ensure that everyone who works with us \u2013 both inside and outside Lockheed Martin \u2013 adheres to the same high ethical standards.\n\nDuring 2021, we completed the first full year of implementation for our 2025 SMP. We completed our first Zero Waste Challenge to minimize waste throughout our operations. We also committed $2 million to The Nature Conservancy as part of the Department of Defense\u2019s (DoD) Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration Challenge, contributing to the resiliency of the DoD\u2019s vital infrastructure nationwide. And we published our inaugural Human Rights Report, showing how our company is committed to upholding human freedom and well-being throughout our operations and supply chain.\n\nLockheed Martin was honored to be acknowledged globally for our commitment to sustainability. We once again earned a spot on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index and North American Index based on best-in-class sustainability practices. For the third year in a row, Forbes and JUST Capital recognized us as one of America\u2019s Most JUST Companies. We were selected as a 2021 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Sustained Excellence Award winner. We also received the Gold Brandon Hall Excellence Award for Best Advance in Social Impact Innovation.\n\nLooking ahead, we plan to expand training to our AI developers to further the incorporation of ethical principles into their system engineering approaches. We will continue to engrain responsible data usage into our company\u2019s culture by providing new data literacy training and engagement to at least half of our workforce. We also intend to double our level of corporate giving tied to specific United Nations Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.\n\nIn the pages that follow, you will find more detailed information about our progress in implementing our 2025 SMP and how it drives value for our company, our shareholders, and our communities. I am proud of our team\u2019s tremendous accomplishments in 2021. As we look to the future, I am confident that Lockheed Martin will continue to demonstrate how sustainable business practices enable better solutions for our customers and stewardship of our vital operations for generations to come.\n\nJames D. Taiclet\nChairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nLockheed Martin Corporation\nThe mission of Lockheed Martin\u2019s sustainability program is to foster innovation, integrity and security to protect the environment, strengthen communities and propel responsible growth. We integrate sustainability throughout our business strategy, including operations and product and service innovations. Our sustainability management plan provides the framework for this integration, and our efforts are guided by our corporate Sustainability policy.\nSustainability Governance\n\nThe Lockheed Martin sustainability governance structure is comprised of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee chartered by the Board of Directors, the Executive Leadership Team, the Sustainability Leadership Council and the Sustainability Management Team.\n\nOur Senior Vice President, Ethics and Enterprise Assurance leads all sustainability programs and serves as Lockheed Martin\u2019s Chief Sustainability Officer. This role reports directly to the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and provides regular updates to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.\n\nWe link incentive compensation for Lockheed Martin executives to performance on certain sustainability factors. See our 2022 Proxy Statement for more information.\n\nOur Sustainability Governance Structure\n\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee: This committee oversees performance in corporate sustainability, employee safety and health, environmental stewardship, ethical business practices and diversity and inclusion\u2014all inextricably linked to our sustainability commitments. Annually, members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee review company performance against the sustainability management plan and the sustainability report.\n\nExecutive Leadership Team: This team oversees the sustainability program, supporting the Lockheed Martin strategic plan by enabling personnel in business areas and functions to pursue and implement opportunities and practices that support the corporate Sustainability policy. The Executive Leadership Team reviews sustainability management plan performance twice per year.\n\nSustainability Leadership Council: This council guides sustainability efforts and provides input for sustainability management plan execution. The council is chaired by the Senior Vice President, Ethics and Enterprise Assurance and consists of functional leaders with direct reporting relationships to the Executive Leadership Team. It convenes twice per year to review Lockheed Martin\u2019s sustainability progress. The Sustainability Leadership Council also provides guidance during the core issues assessment and goal setting process.\n\nSustainability Management Team: This team convenes quarterly to review sustainability management plan progress, review opportunities for program enhancement and share internal and external insights and best practices. It is chaired by the Senior Manager, Corporate Sustainability Office.\n\nAbout this Report\nOur Company\nOur Sustainability Approach\nOur Sustainability Priorities\nBeyond the SMP\nESG Performance Index\n\nwww.lockheedmartin.com\n\n2021 Sustainability Report\nSustainability Governance\n\nThe Nexus of Sustainability and Enterprise Risk Management\n\nPrior to 2017, our enterprise risk management and sustainability programs reported through different functional leadership and followed distinct processes. As the programs matured, and with executive insight, it became apparent that the two functions ultimately sought to achieve a central goal, which could be enhanced under a single reporting structure to maximize efficiencies and to enable collaboration on shared outcomes. Our currently integrated Enterprise Risk and Sustainability organization reports to the Senior Vice President, Ethics and Enterprise Assurance and receives oversight from our Board of Directors.\n\nLockheed Martin\u2019s enterprise risk management program includes completion of two key risk assessments. Annually, we conduct an enterprise risk assessment to determine the most critical operational, growth and strategic risks to Lockheed Martin and its global operations. This assessment is based on independent feedback gathered from the Executive Leadership Team, the Corporate Internal Audit organization and surveys of more than 1,500 senior leaders from across our business.\n\nEvery other year, we conduct a compliance risk assessment. The risk universe of this assessment focuses on compliance and regulatory topics. This assessment is based on independent feedback gathered from the Corporate Internal Audit organization, our Ethics and Business Conduct organization and surveys of compliance subject matter experts from across our business.\n\nSimilarly, the completion of a core issues assessment is foundational to our sustainability program. Our sustainability core issues assessment is conducted every five years by engaging internal and external stakeholders to determine the most relevant sustainability issues to our business.\n\nThe results of each of these assessments are compared for common themes and trends. Two examples include:\n\n- **Chemical Stewardship**: As the global chemical landscape changes and materials are restricted and/or banned, companies face increased regulatory pressure and costs associated with replacement materials. They may also face supply chain risks if suppliers stop producing certain products or pass along increased compliance costs. Proactively researching sustainable alternatives and replacing hazardous materials can help us avoid and mitigate these risks.\n\n- **Supply Chain Vulnerability**: Supplier facilities like Lockheed Martin\u2019s may face increased frequency and intensity of physical climate events, such as hurricanes and floods, depending on their geographic location. A supplier\u2019s ability to mitigate associated risks and quickly recover directly impacts a company\u2019s ability to deliver quality products on time to its customers.\n\nLeveraging our integrated enterprise risk management and sustainability programs, we are well positioned to identify and understand such overlapping risks, evaluate and monitor mitigation strategies and report on performance through our governance structure.\n\n---\n\n6 Please reference our [2019 Sustainability Report](https://www.lockheedmartin.com) located on our [ESG Portal](https://www.lockheedmartin.com) for more information about our latest sustainability core issues assessment.\n2025 Sustainability Management Plan\n\nOur corporate Sustainability policy establishes a standard approach for integrating sustainability practices across Lockheed Martin. Our sustainability management plan defines our goals and drives our sustainability progress.\n\nTo create the sustainability management plan, we first develop core sustainability issues through extensive engagement with internal and external stakeholders and an analysis of industry trends. The core issues ultimately selected for the sustainability management plan represent those most material to our stakeholders and our business. After the core issues are established, we work with internal stakeholders to create specific sustainability goals for which we track our performance. These goals can be retired and/or updated, if necessary, based on our progress and the changing needs of our business. We also continually monitor environmental, social and governance risks and opportunities to stay informed of shifting and emerging trends.\n\nIn 2020, we developed our 2025 Sustainability Management Plan to guide our sustainability efforts over the following five years and, for some efforts, longer. Our 2025 Sustainability Management Plan comprises four sustainability priorities that contain individual core issues and goals.\n2025 Sustainability Management Plan\n\nAdvancing Resource Stewardship\n\nCounterfeit Parts Prevention\nAchieve 100% completion rate of applicable training on the identification and reporting of counterfeit parts by 2025.\n\nEnergy Management\nIncrease square footage of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)- and/or Building Research Establishment\u2019s Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM)-certified/rated facilities by 2025.\nBy 2030, reduce Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions per dollar of gross profit by 70% to outperform the science-based target to prevent 1.5 degree Celsius warming.7\nBy 2030, match 30% of electricity used across Lockheed Martin global operations with electricity produced from renewable sources.8\nAnnually increase carbon removal technology installation, investment and support through 2025.7\nOffset 100% of carbon emissions resulting from business-related travel by 2025.\n\nHazardous Chemicals/Materials\nAnnually reduce the amount of Lockheed Martin Priority Chemicals10 used per unit sold of Lockheed Martin\u2019s top five (by sales) programs through 2025.\nAnnually reduce the amount of Lockheed Martin Priority Chemicals10 used per dollar of sales revenue across business areas through 2025.\n\nResource and Substance Supply Vulnerability\nIncrease traceability of critical mineral resources, and substances used in the supply chain, through data analysis and mitigation for signature programs by 2025.\n\nTotal Cost of Ownership\nAll business areas meet or exceed annual customer savings goals as defined in business area executive vice president scorecards through 2025.\n\nElevating Digital Responsibility\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nBy 2025, 100% of artificial intelligence developers will have been trained in system engineering approaches to artificial intelligence ethical principles.\n\nData Privacy and Protection\nBy 2025, 50% of Lockheed Martin employees will have been trained in data literacy and data-centric practices.\n100% of data objects identified for common definition in the Lockheed Martin data strategy (Tier 1 Data) and 100% of certified data sources have data stewards assigned by 2022.\n\nIntellectual Property Rights\nBy 2022, an intellectual property protection hierarchy has been deployed with tiered protection of intellectual property data assets based on their classification within that hierarchy.\n\nFostering Workplace Resiliency\n\nHarassment-Free Workplace\nAll Lockheed Martin employees participate in at least one bystander intervention training workshop by 2025.\n\nInclusion and Equity11\nAll leaders have an inclusive leadership experience or complete one diversity and inclusion-associated action annually through 2025.\nIncrease hiring of protected veterans and people with disabilities to meet or exceed annual Department of Labor targets through 2025.\nIncrease representation of women and people of color enterprise-wide by 2021.\n\nWorkplace Safety\nReduce the number of days away from work due to occupational injury or illness through 2025.12\nEstablish a risk-based approach to serious incident and fatality prevention programs by 2025.\n\nModeling Business Integrity\n\nEthical Business Practices\nScore at or below 35% of the total percentage of employees who observe misconduct within the past 12 months, but neither report it nor take action to address it by 2025.\n\nAnti-Bribery and Corruption\nAchieve 100% completion of required employee training on gifts and business courtesies and international business practices annually through 2025.\n\n7 We set our ambitious carbon emission reduction target using a methodology established by the Center for Sustainable Organizations to exceed science-based target requirements. The Paris Agreement\u2019s goal is to limit global warming by the end of the century to well below 2\u00b0C of pre-industrial levels and preferably to 1.5\u00b0C. Our carbon emissions target is expected to outperform the Center for Sustainable Organizations model criteria for aligning with a 1.5\u00b0C outcome in the long-term.\n8 Via a combination of on-site or off-site generation, and excluding large hydropower in alignment with the Green-e Renewable Energy Standard for Canada and the United States.\n9 Examples include afforestation/reforestation, direct air capture and habitat restoration.\n10 Lockheed Martin Priority Chemicals are defined as chemical substances that are prohibited from use in Lockheed Martin\u2019s products and processes and/or cannot be used in new applications or programs, and are referenced in our internal corporate policy Restrictions on the Use of Chemical Substances in Products and Processes. Updates to these lists of chemicals are completed annually. A waiver process is included in the procedure for cases where the Lockheed Martin Priority Chemical cannot be substituted.\n11 An Inclusion and Equity goal previously introduced in our 2020 Sustainability Report has been removed from our 2025 Sustainability Management Plan and is not included in this report.\n12 Lost days severity rate is calculated as a function of the number of days away from work due to an injury or illness per 100 employees.\nOur Sustainability Priorities\n\nWe integrate sustainability throughout our business, including operations and product and service innovation. We focus our efforts in the areas that provide the greatest value and positive impact for our stakeholders.\n\n| Priority                                      | Page |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------|\n| Advancing Resource Stewardship                | 14   |\n| Elevating Digital Responsibility              | 25   |\n| Fostering Workplace Resiliency                | 31   |\n| Modeling Business Integrity                   | 39   |\nAdvancing Resource Stewardship\n\nOur commitment to sustainability includes a responsibility to operate our facilities efficiently and to proactively manage our business and our supply chain to reduce carbon emissions, mitigate risk and safeguard valuable resources.\n\nCounterfeit Parts Prevention\n\nEnergy Management\n\nHazardous Chemicals/Materials\n\nResource and Substance Supply Vulnerability\n\nTotal Cost of Ownership\nCounterfeit Parts Prevention\n\nSUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT PLAN GOAL\nAchieve 100% completion rate of applicable training on the identification and reporting of counterfeit parts by 2025.\n\n2021 PROGRESS\nIn 2021, we achieved more than a 99% completion rate on applicable training.\n\nMission success depends on providing products and services that have trusted reliability, performance and safety. Preventing counterfeit parts from entering Lockheed Martin\u2019s supply chain is one way we uphold this commitment to our customers.\n\nThe Vice President, Global Supply Chain Operations provides oversight of the counterfeit prevention program. Our corporate policy, Counterfeit Prevention, guides the prevention, detection and mitigation of counterfeit work across our company. Business areas can have additional procedures specific to their unique operations. Additionally, we have a Corporate Counterfeits integrated product team that includes quality assurance representatives from each business area to provide subject matter expertise and guide day-to-day prevention management.\n\nLockheed Martin purchase orders contain terms and conditions on counterfeit mitigation provisions, and we require all acquisitions to begin with original equipment manufacturers and authorized distributors. Please see our Supplier Code of Conduct for a summary of these counterfeit parts expectations. Counterfeit prevention is included in contract purchasing system reviews conducted annually at rotating facilities and during need-based customer quality audits.\n\nAs the dynamic global landscape evolves and our adversaries continue to insert new counterfeit parts into supply chains, Lockheed Martin is championing a preventative approach. Through our new sustainability management plan goal to achieve a 100% completion rate of applicable training on the identification and reporting of counterfeit parts by 2025, we not only build awareness of the topic, but equip our employees with the tools needed to identify counterfeit parts and take appropriate action if a suspect part is detected. Appropriate actions may include notification, quarantining of parts and investigations.\n\nOur customers depend on our mission-critical products and services. Including counterfeit parts prevention in our sustainability management plan gives our customers confidence in our efforts to prevent substandard and unreliable parts from entering our supply chain and helps us retain their business now and into the future. Please visit the Frequently Asked Questions section of our Supplier Wire website for supplier resources on preventing counterfeit parts from entering our supply chain.\nEnergy Management\n\nSUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT PLAN GOAL\nBy 2030, reduce Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions per dollar of gross profit by 70% to outperform the science-based target to prevent 1.5 degree Celsius warming.14\n\n2021 PROGRESS\nIn 2021, we reduced Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions per dollar of gross profit by 47%.\n\nGo Green Program\nOur Go Green program drives operational improvements by reducing carbon emissions through energy efficiency and use of renewable energy.13\n\nInvesting in capital and operational projects that improve resource efficiency is key to reducing emissions. This work is sanctioned by our Board of Directors, which receives performance updates at least twice per year from our Senior Vice President, Ethics and Enterprise Assurance and our Vice President, Environment, Safety and Health. Multiple corporate policies guide our approach to green building standards, energy efficiency, strategic energy procurement and use of renewable energy.\n\nOur ISO 14001-certified Environment, Safety and Health Management System drives continuous improvement and commits all business areas to operating in a manner that protects the environment, conserves natural resources, prevents pollution and reduces and actively manages associated risks.\n\nFor more information on our Go Green program, please visit our Environment, Safety and Health website and review our annual environment, safety and health performance reports located on the ESG Portal.\n\nSCOPE 2 ENERGY CONSUMPTION (MWH)\\textsuperscript{a}\n\n| Year | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Value | 1,561,454 | 1,592,353 | 1,577,544 | 1,521,042 | 1,493,057 |\n\nRENEWABLE ENERGY (MWH)\\textsuperscript{ab}\n\n| Year | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Value | 383,746 | 307,378 | 321,941 | 322,000 | 322,735 |\n\nNET GHG EMISSIONS (MT CO\\textsubscript{2}e)\\textsuperscript{ac}\n\n| Year | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Value | 844,373 | 819,548 | 771,435 | 790,535 | 688,950 |\n\n\\textsuperscript{a} Data is shown for our Go Green year, which runs November-October (e.g. Nov. 2020 - Oct. 2021)\n\n\\textsuperscript{b} Including solar, wind, geothermal and biomass from a combination of on-site generation, power purchase agreement contracts, renewable energy certificate procurement and applicable green tariffs.

The Paris Agreement\u2019s goal is to limit global warming by the end of the century to well below 2\u00b0C of pre-industrial levels and preferably to 1.5\u00b0C. Our carbon emissions target is expected to outperform the Center for Sustainable Organizations model criteria for aligning with a 1.5\u00b0C outcome in the long-term.\nEnergy Management\n\nEmissions Reduction\n\nTo achieve emissions targets, the Environment, Safety and Health and facilities teams conduct on-and off-site engineering assessments to identify renewable energy and efficiency projects. Findings are used to develop annual tactical plans and an iterative strategic plan with a three-year outlook, against which actual progress is measured and compared. This is called our Go Green gated capital cycle. In 2021, the Environment, Safety and Health and facilities teams completed 64 energy efficiency projects that resulted in annual savings of 40.0 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and 17,200 MMBTU of natural gas, and the avoidance of $3.8 million in utility and maintenance costs. This Go Green gated capital cycle is a centerpiece of our energy reduction and renewable energy strategy whereby projects that meet certain performance and financial thresholds are added to each business area\u2019s overall capital plan. To encourage ideas and actions that reduce emissions, we educate employees about Go Green through internal and external communications, educational webinars and Earth Day and Energy Action Month celebrations. We recognize employee projects that contribute to our reduced impact on the environment through awards programs, including our Environment, Safety and Health Excellence Awards and Facilities Leadership Awards. We also seek external recognition through partner organizations, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s ENERGY STAR program and the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Better Plants program.\n\nRECOGNITION FOR OUR SMART BUILDINGS INITIATIVE\n\nOur smart buildings initiative was recognized by peer ENERGY STAR partners as a 2021 Top Project. Smart buildings is a data analytics effort that integrates heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment, sensors and software to enable predictive maintenance and continuous commissioning. This, in turn, delivers energy use and cost savings, and greater asset reliability and occupant comfort. Our data-driven approach aligns with our broader digital transformation strategy and improves the efficiency of cooling and heating infrastructure, which represents a significant portion of our energy use. Thirteen Lockheed Martin facilities are currently implementing smart buildings at different levels of completion. At the first four facilities to implement smart buildings within our Rotary and Mission Systems business area, over 150 no- and low-cost projects that avoid approximately $250,000 in maintenance and energy costs annually have been discovered. These projects were identified by sensors that provide 3.6 million data analytics transactions daily.\n\nRECOGNITION FOR CENTRAL UTILITY PLANT OPTIMIZATION\n\nThe Lockheed Martin Sikorsky Stratford, CT, facility garnered an internal Facilities Excellence Award along with external awards from the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Better Plants Program and Energy + Environmental Leader for improved operational performance of its cogeneration system and its central utility plant. The site installed new steam turbine-driven equipment and electrical infrastructure and can now export electricity back to the grid, thanks to a newly established interconnection agreement with the utility. The project avoids approximately 10.3 million kilowatt-hours, or the equivalent of the electricity needed to power more than 1,200 homes for one year, and yields cost savings of approximately $1.5 million annually, achieving a payback in just over two years.\nEnergy Management\n\nSUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT PLAN GOAL\nBy 2030, match 30% of electricity used across Lockheed Martin global operations with electricity produced from renewable sources.15\n\n2021 PROGRESS\nIn 2021, we met expectations by using renewable energy for 22% of our total electricity across Lockheed Martin global operations.\n\nRenewable Energy\nRenewable energy strengthens the resiliency of our facilities, our relationship with our customers and our engagement with employees. In 2021, we ranked at number 28 on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Green Power Partnership\u2019s list of Top 30 on-site generators and at number 51 on their National Top 100 list for total renewable energy use. Since 2008, we have installed 13 on-site solar systems and one biomass facility, for a total of 10.3 megawatts of capacity.\n\nADVANCING SOLAR PROJECTS AT LOCKHEED MARTIN\nConstruction on a 20-megawatt, on-site, single-axis photovoltaic system at our Palmdale, CA, facility began in late 2021 and is expected to be completed in 2022. This project will be one of the largest privately-owned, ground-mounted, behind-the-meter solar farms in California. Additionally, the Titan Solar Project at our Fort Worth, TX, facility started in December 2021. We expect this 15-year power purchase agreement to provide approximately 22% of the facility\u2019s annual electricity needs. Lockheed Martin also installed its third solar carport at a Missiles and Fire Control facility in Orlando, FL. This two megawatt on-site project eliminates approximately $581,000 in utility costs annually and reduces our carbon footprint over 2,500 metric tons.\n\n15 Via a combination of on-site or off-site generation, and excluding large hydropower in alignment with the Green-e Renewable Energy Standard for Canada and the United States.\nEnergy Management\n\nSUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT PLAN GOAL\nIncrease square footage of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)-and/or Building Research Establishment\u2019s Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM)-certified/rated facilities by 2025.\n\n2021 PROGRESS\nAn expansion of a Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control building in Orlando, FL, earned LEED Silver certification in 2021. This added 22,000 square feet to the existing green building footprint.\n\nGreen Buildings\nGreen buildings reduce our impact on the natural environment, lower lifecycle operating costs and enhance occupant well-being. Lockheed Martin\u2019s corporate policy on green buildings requires the United States Green Building Council\u2019s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)\u00ae Silver certification as the minimum standard for new construction and major renovations. Where LEED isn\u2019t available internationally, Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) or Green Globes is required. For existing buildings, we seek ENERGY STAR certification to demonstrate operational energy efficiency. Currently, we have 25 LEED-certified, one BREEAM-certified and nine ENERGY STAR-certified buildings.\nEnergy Management\n\nSUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT PLAN GOALS\nAnnually increase carbon removal technology installation, investment and support through 2025.16\nOffset 100% of carbon emissions resulting from business-related travel by 2025.\n\n2021 PROGRESS\nIn 2021, we focused on strategy development for this goal and engaged with partner teams such as Lockheed Martin Ventures and Social Impact.\nIn 2021, we drafted our offset procurement guidelines, which will be finalized in 2022. The guidelines describe the criteria we will use to evaluate carbon offsets. Lockheed Martin will focus on projects that meet these criteria and the quality criteria set forward by third-party market participants such as World Resources Institute and relevant certification bodies.\n\nAddressing Climate Risk\nLockheed Martin is renewing our approach to climate risk with a focus on carbon removal and carbon offsets. We are committed to building a strong foundation now to support forward-thinking carbon-related projects in the future.\n\nLockheed Martin\u2019s Senior Vice President, Ethics and Enterprise Assurance has leadership oversight for these efforts and provides performance reporting to the Executive Leadership Team. Our corporate Sustainability policy provides overarching guidance, and is supported by our Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures Report published on our ESG Portal.\n\nCarbon Removal\nThe Corporate Sustainability Office has recently partnered with the Lockheed Martin Ventures team to analyze new technology investment opportunities through a sustainability lens. Lockheed Martin Ventures makes strategic investments in companies that are developing cutting edge technologies in core businesses and new markets important to Lockheed Martin. The Corporate Sustainability Office reviews opportunities against sustainability criteria and Lockheed Martin strategy elements to identify climate technology that aligns with our sustainability priorities, such as carbon removal. The goal is to integrate sustainability into the standard evaluation process of Lockheed Martin\u2019s potential investments to enhance value creation and climate innovation within our programs and operations. Additionally, the Corporate Sustainability Office is partnering with our Social Impact team to identify charitable donation opportunities that align with our sustainability strategy to increase carbon removal support, as well as ways to engage employees and enhance community resilience in locations where we operate.\n\nCarbon Offsets\nLockheed Martin is actively taking steps to increase visibility of and to develop a reduction strategy for our Scope 3 emissions. We are taking the initial step of addressing Scope 3 emissions that are within our control at this time. Our travel management partners provide us with our total business travel-related emissions annually, including emissions associated with flights and rental vehicles. We plan to offset these emissions through projects that meet robust internal quality and credibility requirements in addition to quality criteria from third-party market participants, such as the World Resources Institute and relevant certification bodies. Priority will be given to projects that align with one of the following technology areas: methane capture and combustion, energy efficiency, fuel switching or projects with co-benefits related to communities and the environment.\n\n16 Examples include afforestation/reforestation, direct air capture and habitat restoration.\nEnergy Management\n\nBIOFUEL APPROVED FOR S-92\u00ae HELICOPTER\nIn September 2021, Lockheed Martin Sikorsky approved the use of sustainable aviation fuel for the S-92 helicopter. The flight was carried out by the CHC Helikopter Service of Norway using synthetic paraffinic kerosene, which is a sustainable aviation fuel produced from waste and residual feedstock. This significant milestone supports the reduction of carbon emissions and the aviation industry\u2019s transition to sustainable aviation fuels. To learn more about the S-92, please visit our website.\n\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE READINESS AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION INTEGRATION CHALLENGE\nIn 2021, Lockheed Martin committed $2 million to a three-year partnership with the The Nature Conservancy in support of a project that will protect 4,000 acres of land along Maryland\u2019s Eastern Shore. The area contains the restricted airspace of the Atlantic Testing Range and the Naval Air Station at Patuxent River. It also includes more than 75% of Maryland\u2019s remaining tidal wetlands, which provide defense against coastal hazards stemming from climate impacts. The project is part of the Department of Defense\u2019s Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration Challenge, which aims to strengthen the resiliency of the Department of Defense\u2019s vital U.S. infrastructure.\n\nCLIMATE TECH SUMMIT\nIn the summer of 2021, Lockheed Martin hosted its first Climate Tech Summit. This internal meeting brought together technical leaders from across the corporation with the latitude to explore how we could apply our current product capabilities to a changing environment. The end result surpassed expectations, as the team presented Lockheed Martin-unique solutions based on existing technology reimagined for climate action. Applications related to topics including natural disasters, greenhouse gases, land cover change, geospatial data and climate intelligence. The Climate Tech Summit demonstrated the potential value Lockheed Martin can bring to climate conversations, and how collaboration between stakeholders can generate innovative solutions for positive impact and for new customers. Lockheed Martin plans to continue this effort in 2022 with additional events.\nHazardous Chemicals/Materials\n\nSUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT PLAN GOALS\n\n| Annually reduce the amount of Lockheed Martin Priority Chemicals used per unit sold of Lockheed Martin\u2019s top five (by sales) programs through 2025. | Annually reduce the amount of Lockheed Martin Priority Chemicals used per dollar of sales revenue across business areas through 2025. |\n\n2021 PROGRESS\n\nIn 2021, we enhanced our measurement of prohibited and targeted chemicals and collaborated with business areas and programs to establish Lockheed Martin Priority Chemical baselines.\n\nReducing hazardous chemicals in our products helps Lockheed Martin stay ahead of increasing global chemical regulations and restrictions. Through proactive management of hazardous chemicals in our products and manufacturing processes, we are reducing regulatory risks and protecting our employees, customers and the environment. We are also upholding commitments to our customers and maintaining a competitive position for future opportunities.\n\nLockheed Martin has two internal corporate policies, Restrictions on the Use of Chemical Substances in Products and Processes and Global Product Chemistry Regulations, that guide our chemical stewardship and chemical regulatory compliance efforts. The first policy includes lists of prohibited and targeted chemicals that are updated annually based on risk assessments, current use and regulations. Lockheed Martin Global Supply Chain Operations, Engineering & Technology, program management and Environment, Safety and Health organizations have roles in leading and managing these procedures across the enterprise. We also have three main employee engagement groups that drive the strategy and implementation of efforts to ensure compliance and reduce risk. These working groups include the Chemical Stewardship integrated process team, the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals/Global Product Chemistry Regulations integrated process team and the Design for Sustainability working group.\n\nA chemical stewardship focus area continues to be the establishment of a standardized process for collecting chemical data from suppliers on their parts and materials. In 2021, we implemented processes that align with the IPC-1754 Materials and Substances Declaration for Aerospace and Defense Standard, including incorporating the standard into our internal policies and subcontract flow-downs. The IPC-1754 standard includes requirements for aerospace and defense companies to collect chemical data in products and processes from suppliers. This facilitates improved data quality and comprehensiveness. Lockheed Martin is engaging members of our supply chain and collaborating with the International Aerospace Environmental Group on training and resources for this effort.\n\nAdditionally, we actively look to identify hazardous material replacement projects within our business areas and work with our customers to implement the resulting alternatives within our programs. We recently joined the International Aerospace Environmental Group Replacement Project working group and our engineers are participating in industry efforts to address identifying less hazardous alternatives to replace chromated bond primers and fuel tank coatings. These applications were selected as priorities by International Aerospace Environmental Group member companies due to regulatory restrictions on hexavalent chromium and the need to find alternatives that meet performance requirements.\n\nDESIGN FOR SUSTAINABILITY\u2014RESTRICTED CHEMICALS AVOIDANCE TOOL\n\nThe Design for Sustainability working group, led by employees from Engineering & Technology, collaborates across business areas and functions to develop capabilities that inform product design engineers about restricted chemicals during the product design phase. This effort is being funded as an emerging technology under the model-based engineering research portfolio. In 2021, the working group developed a prototype for a new restricted chemicals avoidance tool that will interface with product design tools. This tool enables engineers to evaluate parts and materials for new and revised designs in order to reduce the use of hazardous chemicals by building early awareness into Lockheed Martin\u2019s product design processes. This approach will help us meet regulatory and customer requirements, reduce risk and costs associated with redesign and increase the sustainability of our products. The restricted chemicals avoidance tool pilot efforts will continue through 2022 with Rotary and Mission Systems Sikorsky. We plan to expand the tool to other business areas following this pilot phase.\n\n17 Lockheed Martin Priority Chemicals are defined as chemical substances that are prohibited from use in Lockheed Martin\u2019s products and processes and/or cannot be used in new applications or programs, and are referenced in our internal corporate policy Restrictions on the Use of Chemical Substances in Products and Processes. Updates to these lists of chemicals are completed annually. A waiver process is included in the procedure for cases where the Lockheed Martin Priority Chemical cannot be substituted.\nResource and Substance Supply Vulnerability\n\n**SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT PLAN GOAL**\nIncrease traceability of critical mineral resources, and substances used in the supply chain, through data analysis and mitigation for signature programs by 2025.\n\n**2021 PROGRESS**\nIn 2021, we focused on building awareness of critical mineral resources, identifying the cross-functional team needed to achieve the goal and defining a charter to guide our efforts.\n\nThe objective of sustainable supply chain management at Lockheed Martin is to ensure alignment of our supplier\u2019s social, ethical, environmental and safety and health responsibilities with our own sustainability commitments. We focus on topics such as conflict minerals, chemical stewardship, environmental impact and counterfeit parts.\n\nAt a minimum of every three years, we conduct a supplier sustainability voluntary assessment to gain insight into our suppliers\u2019 environmental, social and governance programs to better understand risks and opportunities. In the off-years, we conduct various focus activities, such as our 2020 cybersecurity risk assessment and our 2021 model-based enterprise assessment.\n\nIn 2021, we elevated the importance of visibility into our complex supply chain. Our new sustainability management plan goal is dedicated to enhancing the tracking and traceability of critical mineral resources. As a downstream user of critical mineral resources, it is challenging to trace the upstream origins of all our product components\u2014from raw material extraction to manufacturers and suppliers to final integration into products at our facilities. Through knowledge of where the raw materials we depend on originate, we can make active purchasing decisions to reduce environmental and social risks in our value chain. This strengthens the long-term viability of our supplier base both domestically and globally. Ultimately, this helps us make sustainability-focused supplier decisions and mitigate the lifecycle impacts of our products.\n\nWe also focused on building internal awareness, identifying the teams required to provide and analyze resource data and defining our roadmap. We also started a pilot project with one of our signature programs. This pilot program consists of mapping out a selected set of critical mineral resources to their associated product components. We aim to gather lessons learned and expand the effort to other programs throughout the business areas by the end of 2022.\n\nAdditional information on sustainability within our supply chain can be found on our Supplier Wire website. Our Conflict Minerals Reports, U.K. Gender Pay Gap Reports, U.K. Modern Slavery Act Reports and supporting corporate policies can be found on our ESG Portal. Please visit the Human Rights page of this report for more information on how Lockheed Martin addresses human rights.\nTotal Cost of Ownership\n\nSUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT PLAN GOAL\nAll business areas meet or exceed annual customer savings goals as defined in business area executive vice president scorecards.\n\n2021 PROGRESS\nThe Supply Chain Council met both customer and Lockheed Martin program savings goals for 2021.\n\nMaintaining product and service affordability for our customers is crucial to the longevity of our programs. With approximately 60% to 70% of product cost living within our supply chain, tracking and improvement of savings by our supply chain team contributes to competitive positioning for Lockheed Martin\u2019s future procurement efforts.\n\nWe have a Supply Chain Council that meets monthly to guide affordability initiatives. The Supply Chain Council provides updates on enterprise-wide performance to our Chief Operating Officer, who reports periodically on Lockheed Martin\u2019s competitive position in the market to the Board of Directors. Furthermore, the business areas come together quarterly to collaborate and leverage skills to advance affordability efforts. Business areas have specific affordability guidelines unique to their customers and programs, and our supply chain negotiators complete training on affordability objectives/tools.\n\nTo engage our workforce, a monthly newsletter that includes affordability topics, such as lessons learned, best practices and analytic insights, is sent to supply chain, engineering and technology, program management, manufacturing engineering and finance teams to advance negotiation results. Program management training is offered to our domestic and international managers and includes sessions from supply chain strategy leadership on tools and techniques to drive affordability results.\n\nLooking to the future, Lockheed Martin plans to release additional user-friendly digital tools that assist with opportunity capture for each program, including opportunities for increased affordability.\n\nOur annual savings goal is comprised of two classes of savings: customer value savings and Lockheed Martin program value savings. At the end of each year, the business areas review their business plans and anticipated contracts to project savings, which are used by leadership to define the respective business area targets. The enterprise Global Supply Chain Operations team analyzes and consolidates these goals to report performance for sustainability and other corporate requirements.\n\n\"The Lockheed Martin supply chain team has continued to evolve their best-in-class affordability techniques and practices over the last several years across the corporation, which has enabled us to achieve customer and corporate savings objectives while mitigating, where feasible, supply network cost challenges.\"\n\n\u2014George Sanders, Corporate Affordability Sub-Council Lead\n\nRECOGNIZING EMPLOYEE SUCCESS\nOur employees are the primary source of innovation for cost reduction opportunities throughout our programs and operations. Recognition, through our NextGen Recognition program, is given to teams from all disciplines who come forward with impactful and validated ideas that support our affordability objectives. For example, in 2021, a large technology procurement initiative that was not part of our original Supply Chain Council milestone plan resulted in more than $10 million in savings. We recognized this accomplishment and communicated the initiative\u2019s success to our Executive Leadership Team and Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. We believe that celebrating our successes contributes to a culture of innovative thinking and encourages our teams to drive affordability.\nElevating Digital Responsibility\n\nBuilding a reputation for trust and integrity includes a strong commitment to digital responsibility. In an increasingly connected world, we remain committed to safeguarding data and setting standards for the use of artificial intelligence. We provide ongoing training and resources for our employees to support this commitment.\n\nArtificial Intelligence 26\nData Privacy and Protection 27\nIntellectual Property Rights 30\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nSUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT PLAN GOAL\nBy 2025, 100% of artificial intelligence developers will have been trained in system engineering approaches to artificial intelligence ethical principles.\n\n2021 PROGRESS\nIn 2021, we focused on defining our path and increasing awareness. A core team is working on artificial intelligence security and governance in collaboration with the Advanced Technology Laboratory. We mapped the principles and discussed how to integrate them within corporate policies. We also began building a playbook that contains the tools and information on how to ethically use artificial intelligence at Lockheed Martin. The training will be developed based on this playbook and is scheduled for beta testing in late 2022.\n\nLockheed Martin is committed to driving the use of artificial intelligence in an equitable and transparent way. We are ensuring that our actions have the appropriate defined ethical boundaries at the start to deliver aligned capabilities, meet customer requirements, protect the safety of stakeholders and avoid reputational risk.\n\nOne of Lockheed Martin\u2019s newest resources is the Lockheed Martin Artificial Intelligence Center. It was created to help centralize the application and scalability of artificial intelligence within the company, which we anticipate to have a heightened impact across all functions. Artificial intelligence drives competitiveness in the marketplace as it can speed the design process as well as the time to market for our products. Artificial intelligence tools are critical to future business success, and the ethical use of artificial intelligence represents a core, defining aspect of how we implement artificial intelligence tools in our organization.\n\nOur Code of Ethics and Business Conduct and our internal corporate policy Ethical Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence guide Lockheed Martin\u2019s ethical use of artificial intelligence. We created an Artificial Intelligence Ethics Subcommittee in 2020, under the direction of the Artificial Intelligence Executive Steering Committee, that oversees artificial intelligence design, development, deployment and internal use aligned to our adopted principles for the responsible use of artificial intelligence. These principles are: responsible, equitable, traceable, reliable and governable.\n\nLockheed Martin was one of the first large organizations to wholly adopt these principles, developed by the U.S. Department of Defense, and use them as the foundation for our artificial intelligence program. This reflects Lockheed Martin\u2019s strong history of ethical use of technology, our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct and our Core Values. The Artificial Intelligence Ethics Subcommittee includes representatives from all business areas, the Advanced Technology Laboratory, human resources, communications, legal, ethics and business transformation. It meets monthly and reports quarterly to the Artificial Intelligence Executive Steering Committee. Both Lockheed Martin\u2019s Chief Engineer and the Senior Vice President, Ethics and Enterprise Assurance review performance on a periodic basis and serve as the highest levels of leadership responsible for ethical use of artificial intelligence.\n\nCustomer engagement is an integral part of our program. Lockheed Martin was invited to an industry roundtable with the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which represents the customer in the use of responsible artificial intelligence. We also participated in the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center\u2019s transformational acquisition process. To strengthen our program, we invited the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to an Artificial Intelligence Ethics Subcommittee meeting and have asked for their third-party review of our policy.\n\nOur artificial intelligence sustainability management plan goal is focused on explaining and integrating ethical artificial intelligence across all of Lockheed Martin.\n\nIt encompasses the full artificial intelligence lifecycle\u2014from use and selection to training and testing to cross-checking and development to ultimate sustainment. As of 2021, we have approximately 850 employees identified as artificial intelligence developers who will be required to take the training.\n\nINDUSTRY COLLABORATION\nLockheed Martin leadership engaged with the U.S. Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in early 2021 and eventually launched the first cross-industry ethical artificial intelligence collaboration session in November 2021. The Deputy Director of the Defense Sciences Office of DARPA went through the Institute for Defense Analyses to coordinate and host the meeting with one representative from each of eight defense companies. The main focus areas were testing and verification challenges and defense acquisition business model challenges for continuous data/model updates of deployed artificial intelligence. Lockheed Martin intends to continue this level of transparent collaboration to encourage the ethical use of artificial intelligence to underpin U.S. national security imperatives and international leadership.\nData Privacy and Protection\n\nSUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT PLAN GOAL\nBy 2025, 50% of Lockheed Martin employees will have been trained in data literacy and data-centric practices.\n\n2021 PROGRESS\nIn 2021, we developed the written scripts and videos for our compliance training that is planned for release in 2022. We also worked with Lockheed Martin\u2019s Enterprise Learning & Development team to procure an online learning platform that focuses on data analytics, data science and artificial intelligence/machine learning for all skill levels and roles. Usage of the platform in 2021 more than tripled compared to previous years, demonstrating its growing adoption across our organization.\n\nLockheed Martin empowers employees to take a proactive role in protecting data. From documented privacy policies to annual internal assessments supported by a formal network of privacy leaders throughout the enterprise, our corporate privacy program continues to evolve to meet new challenges and address the changing regulatory landscape. For example, new hires complete privacy awareness training as part of the onboarding process and all employees complete sensitive information protection training each year as part of their compliance training plan.\n\nIn support of this commitment to the protection of data, Lockheed Martin is also focused on expanding data literacy and digital responsibility.\n\nData Literacy and Data-Centric Practices\nIn an increasingly data-driven world, we are helping Lockheed Martin employees understand their part in creating, using and managing data, and the impact their data decisions have on our business.\n\nEnhancing data literacy and data-centric practices is the first step in empowering a data-informed enterprise. We are providing the skills employees need to protect the value proposition of our digital initiatives and increase our competitive advantage.\n\nData literacy is connected to our data strategy and is included as a resource in our new internal corporate policy on data governance. Lockheed Martin\u2019s data strategy mission is to ensure our business processes, systems and mission solutions generate high quality data that can seamlessly flow between our core business systems and is easily accessible to enable business area interoperability, real-time analytics, data-driven decisions and efficient delivery of zero-defect data products to our customers. Our data literacy efforts are championed by our Chief Data & Analytics Officer and presented quarterly to the Lockheed Martin Data Council. Employees are engaged in multiple ways, including dedicated websites, a data literacy quiz to guide employees to further education resources and learning platforms that offer training on data topics. Our objective is to build a data-focused mindset, including skills and tools, through expanded learning opportunities available to all teams.\n\nTo achieve our sustainability management plan goal, we have a three pillar strategy:\n\n- We will develop and release training that will provide a strong foundation in data literacy and data-centric practices and mindset for our employees.\n- We will utilize learning solutions to enable employees to build data capabilities that are beneficial to their roles and professional growth.\n- We will continue to engage with business areas and functional teams, when requested, to develop targeted data-related training, including new cohort learning experiences.\n\nLockheed Martin is actively expanding data literacy and data-centric practices across the enterprise. We are leveraging data as a strategic asset to communicate more effectively, drive innovation and continue to deliver on our customers\u2019 missions.\nData Privacy and Protection\n\nHUMAN RESOURCES LEADERSHIP TRAINING\nIn February 2021, our Chief Data & Analytics Office hosted a virtual data literacy workshop for members of the Human Resources executive leadership team. The workshop focused on how leadership can support data literacy and data-informed decision making within each individual organization. Interactive learning materials with data-driven tactics were also shipped to their locations to elevate the experience. Given the team impact this type of training can have, we hope to expand leadership trainings in the future using this workshop as the model.\n\nPEOPLE ANALYTICS COHORT LEARNING\nAt the end of 2020, our Chief Data & Analytics Office collaborated with the human resources team to create a tailored, eight-week cohort learning experience on data and people analytics. It is a structured, self-paced training, complemented by weekly live office hours on specific human resources and people analytics topics where employees can ask questions and dive deeper into concepts applicable to their roles. Our Chief Data & Analytics Office helped design the original curriculum and led the first cohort of nominated human resources employees. In 2021, we launched our third cohort, and nearly 100 employees participated in the training. The human resources team now independently leads the effort. This experience will serve as our model for data literacy and data-centric cohorts moving forward.\nData Privacy and Protection\n\nSUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT PLAN GOAL\n100% of data objects identified for common definition in the Lockheed Martin data strategy (Tier 1 Data) and 100% of certified data sources have data stewards assigned by 2022.\n\n2021 PROGRESS\nWe achieved the following three major milestones in 2021:\n\u2022 Established the number of Tier 1 Data elements to include in our Lockheed Martin data strategy\n\u2022 Completed the definition of \u201cprogram\u201d Tier 1 Data\n\u2022 Established data steward committees for an additional three functions\n\nTier 1 Data\nLockheed Martin regards data as a strategic asset and is committed to its responsible governance and management. We are optimizing how we extract value from data by improving interoperability and data quality, while minimizing data sensitivity risk.\n\nTier 1 Data, which are a set of common and agreed upon definitions for terms and their data equivalents, are a key aspect supporting our transition to a model-based enterprise. Examples of such terms for Lockheed Martin include program, employee, customer and supplier. When we establish common, governing definitions for terms, it enables any employee creating an information technology system to align to the common definition. Once every system has adopted the definition, we can allow data to move through those systems while experiencing minimal translation issues. Additionally, Tier 1 Data is a significant enabler to digital responsibility since it improves our ability to identify, locate, govern, manage and protect sensitive data.\n\nOur new internal corporate policy on data governance includes our data governance standards and a data stewardship procedure. Our Chief Data & Analytics Officer and chair of our Enterprise Data Governance Board is responsible for creation of Tier 1 Data and their associated definitions. Our Enterprise Data Governance Board is comprised of the Chief Data & Analytics Officer from each business area, as well as senior leadership representatives from legal, cybersecurity and corporate security. This board, which meets once per month, is empowered to lead our data governance policy and drive decisions, and is a subset of our Data Governance Council that meets quarterly and guides our data strategy across the company. Aligning systems and adopting the standard, as well as empowering data stewards (individuals entrusted with effective control and use of data and information assets) will occur within all business areas.\n\nIn 2021, we determined our Tier 1 Data by balancing commonality with the effort required for Tier 1 Data management. This included setting data quality requirements. We then focused on software and systems integration, policy and target approval and developing an operating model that will guide us from idea to implementation. Looking forward, we will identify data stewards and establish data steward committees, coach these stewards through our operating model and work towards Tier 1 Data definitions.\n\n\u201cTier 1 Data underpins the digital threads that traverse our business processes enabling the transformation to a model-based enterprise. Our success allows Lockheed Martin to simultaneously deliver more business value and improve our ability to protect sensitive data\u201d\n\n\u2014 Mike Baylor, Vice President, Chief Data & Analytics Officer\n\n18 As stated in our enterprise reference architecture, a model-based enterprise is an organizational approach that connects and consumes product data seamlessly, eliminating functional and system silos and limiting the usage of transactional systems by leveraging data rich models.\nOur intellectual property sustainability management plan goal is focused on defining and implementing heightened categories of protection for critical types of Lockheed Martin Proprietary Information, which includes the new designations of Restricted Use Only and Restricted Internal Use Only. This increases our ability to protect intellectual property as a business asset throughout its lifecycle to maximize our competitive position.\n\nIt also drives value in the following two key ways:\n\n- Enhances data security and mitigates data spills: By implementing a process for identifying, protecting and controlling access to critical technology, we are reducing the possibility of inadvertent leaks or intentional disclosure.\n\n- Creates a flexible, nuanced proposal approach: Enables us to move away from traditional proposals to better balance Lockheed Martin interests in protecting our critical technology while delivering needed information to our customers.\n\nOur two internal corporate policies, Protection of Sensitive Information and Intellectual Property, provide the foundation for this intellectual property effort. We have a cross-functional working group for managing heightened protection categories for Lockheed Martin Proprietary Information that led the development of the new designation system. The working group is focused on creation of processes, tools and training, integration of the designations into our current Sensitive Information Protection Tool and collaboration with business areas and Intellectual Property Review Boards for effective implementation. The Intellectual Property Review Boards at each business area and at Enterprise Operations review categories designated by Lockheed Martin-funded technology development programs and provide any needed support. Concerns that arise can be elevated to the Enterprise Intellectual Property Strategy Board, which is led by our technology and business development functions.\n\nOnce fully established, we plan to conduct periodic internal reviews to revisit designated categories across all programs to ensure the information still qualifies for its specific designation or if updates are required. Looking to 2022, we plan to put the new designation system fully into practice across the company. With the first use cases we can determine best practices and make any needed refinements to better protect our intellectual property.\n\nDESIGNING NEW RESOURCES FOR SUCCESS\n\nTo enable success of this intellectual property goal, our cross-functional working group designed a comprehensive set of resources that are utilized by programs at different stages within the process. These include an enhanced data protection playbook, a protection standard, a protection form, confidentiality agreements and training. The training has been deployed in our formal enterprise-wide training system and is a self-paced, virtual course designed to familiarize employees who may be handling sensitive information with the tools needed to protect our valuable intellectual property.\nFostering Workplace Resiliency\n\nOur people are our greatest asset, and we strive to build a dynamic, engaging, safe and welcoming workplace that drives innovation, embraces diverse perspectives and encourages collaboration. We invest in our employees and cultivate an environment of belonging where people can bring their authentic selves to work every day, and have an opportunity to thrive in their roles and beyond.\n\nHarassment-Free Workplace 32\nInclusion and Equity 33\nWorkplace Safety 37\nHarassment-Free Workplace\n\nSUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT PLAN GOAL\nAll Lockheed Martin employees participate in at least one bystander intervention training workshop by 2025.\n\n2021 PROGRESS\nIn 2021, 2,700 employees completed a bystander intervention training workshop through our Upstander Campaign. Looking forward, we will increase the availability of workshops and the Upstander Campaign will be integrated into our new digital training platform, Atlas Learning, and assigned to 100% of employees globally.\n\nLockheed Martin takes pride in our Core Values to Do What\u2019s Right, Respect Others and Perform with Excellence. These Core Values are underpinned by our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct and corporate policies on Harassment-Free Workplace and Nondiscrimination and Equal Employment Opportunity. We require all employees to complete annual harassment-free workplace training. Additional related training is required for specific employees based on function and level.\n\nWe aim to live up to our values and to ensure employees feel heard and supported. In 2019, we began the first phase of developing dedicated bystander intervention training by incorporating elements into our annual harassment-free workplace course materials and our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct. We used guidance from respected external organizations to help build the content, including the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\nIn 2021, we formally released a dedicated bystander intervention training, which was branded the \u201cUpstander Campaign.\u201d This branding occurred because we believe there are two types of bystanders: an active bystander and a passive bystander. A passive bystander is one who witnesses harassment but does not act. An active bystander, also known as an upstander, is one who reacts with the intent to stop harassment, discrimination, retaliation or other inappropriate conduct. We empower our employees to be upstanders in these situations.\n\nWe promoted our Upstander Campaign through workshops and communications to encourage voluntary completion. In these workshops we taught the use of Green Dot\u2019s bystander intervention techniques, which emphasize the 3Ds: direct, distract and delegate. After each workshop we gathered feedback from participants to understand how we could improve our efforts. We also encouraged employees to take the Upstander Pledge to sustain an inclusive culture where there is a sense of belonging for all.\n\nSenior responsibility for this sustainability management plan goal is held by our Vice President, Global Diversity and Inclusion with director-level responsibility for implementation. Progress is reported on a monthly basis.\n\nUPSTANDER CAMPAIGN WORKSHOPS\nIn 2021, our Global Diversity and Inclusion organization conducted more than 40 Upstander Campaign workshops. These workshops provided the tools, skills and resources needed to identify and report harassing behavior. Content included educational resources to define harassment per Lockheed Martin policies and U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guidelines, and the type of behaviors that should be addressed when witnessed. Our feedback surveys showed that 96% of employees who completed the workshop reported they felt more prepared to intervene if they witnessed harassment or discrimination. The ultimate goal of the Upstander Campaign is for more employees to successfully intervene and report incidents they witness.\nInclusion and Equity\n\nSUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT PLAN GOAL\nAll leaders have an inclusive leadership experience or complete one diversity and inclusion-associated action annually through 2025.\n\n2021 PROGRESS\nIn 2021, 100% of leaders completed training on leading diverse teams.\n\nOur diversity and inclusion strategy is built into the fabric of our Core Values and is imperative to our success. We know that Lockheed Martin\u2019s diverse and inclusive workforce enhances our collective power, and our ability to recognize, value and draw upon unique perspectives and experiences to drive innovation and solve our customers\u2019 toughest challenges. Our strategy is underpinned by strong policies, which protect employees and exemplify the inclusive culture we strive to foster.\n\nInclusive Leadership\nOur focus on training our leaders on inclusion began over a decade ago when feedback from employees indicated this was an area for improvement. We believe inclusive teams produce the best work and are a key building block to a company culture where all employees feel belonging. Through our robust inclusive learning strategy, we seek to develop key inclusive behaviors in employees and leaders and address employee needs at every level of the organization. As a result, we developed a full suite of trainings and tools to educate our leaders on inclusivity and equip them to empower employees to perform their best. Along with our required annual Leading Diverse Teams training, we offer a multitude of learning experiences, such as our newly launched four-week pilot training program that embeds foundational principles and behaviors of inclusion. These efforts help us equip our leaders and employees with the tools they need to create an inclusive culture and reinforce its importance.\n\nDIVERSITY AND INCLUSION LEARNING SUMMIT\nIn November 2021, we held our first Diversity and Inclusion Learning Summit. For this virtual event, we invited Lockheed Martin internal stakeholders, external institutions and non-profit organizations that we partner with to join and speak about their areas of expertise. These included a global non-profit research and consulting firm dedicated to diversity outreach, the advancement of women and people of color, and cataloging diversity best practices in the workplace. This event included seminars on topics such as inclusion in a hybrid work environment, learning best practices for inclusivity and review of inclusion rating indices of top firms. It also included breakout workshop sessions with stakeholders to share deeper insights that will inform future Lockheed Martin diversity and inclusion strategies and solutions.\nInclusion and Equity\n\nSUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT PLAN GOALS\n\nIncrease hiring of protected veterans and people with disabilities to meet or exceed annual U.S. Department of Labor targets through 2025.\n\nIncrease representation of women and people of color enterprise-wide by 2021.\n\n2021 PROGRESS\n\nIn 2021, we exceeded U.S. Department of Labor hiring targets for protected veterans and people with disabilities.\n\nIn 2021, our representation of women remained at 23% and our representation of people of color increased to 29%.\n\nWorkforce Diversity\n\nWe actively pursue increasing the representation of underrepresented groups within our workforce. One challenge we face is the lower participation of certain groups in the U.S., overall, in science, technology, engineering and math occupations, which account for more than 50% of Lockheed Martin\u2019s employee occupations. For example, in the U.S., overall, 12.6% of aerospace engineers, 21.6% of software developers and 8.4% of mechanical engineers are women. However, we continue to work hard to increase representation within our workforce, including through scholarships, internships, fellowships and partnerships such as our five-year partnership with Girls Inc., our partnership with Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions and the Lockheed Martin Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Scholarship Program. We are currently within 2% of the 2021 Aerospace and Defense Workforce Study representation of women benchmark of 25% in our industry, and within 1% the Study\u2019s people of color representation benchmark of 30%. While we have made progress, we know that we still have work to do. Representation is one measurement of our overall progress toward a more diverse and inclusive workforce.\n\nWorkforce Demographics\n\nAs of December 31, 2021.

We partner with organizations such as: U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation\u2019s Hiring our Heroes Corporate Fellowship Program, Department of Defense SkillBridge program, U.S. Special Operations Command Wounded Warrior Internship Program and the military Career Skills Programs. Through our Heroes program our talent acquisition team is able to provide the resumes of individuals transitioning from active duty military members and military spouses to hiring leaders across Lockheed Martin as prescreened and recommended employee candidates. Each year, several thousand of these candidates are introduced to hiring teams. Once selected, transitioning service member candidates complete three- to six-month fellowships consisting of on-the-job training. Military spouse and caregiver candidates complete a six-week on-the-job training experience.\n\nROWAN UNIVERSITY PATH PARTNERSHIP FOR NEURODIVERSE STUDENTS\n\nIn 2021, Lockheed Martin continued its neurodiversity internship program in partnership with Rowan University\u2019s Preparation and Achievement of Transition to Hire program. Through this partnership, we aim to increase diversity in our workforce with qualified talent who are on the autism spectrum or have other brain differences, such as differing learning abilities. In 2021, we recruited and placed our second cohort of students in internship roles where we believed they would excel, while also bringing new perspective to our operations. Since its inception, the majority of participants in the program have gone on to return for future internships or receive permanent job offers upon graduation.\n\nDISABILITY:IN NEXTGEN LEADERS PROGRAM\n\nLockheed Martin is a long-standing and proud sponsor of Disability:IN, an organization that promotes the employment of people with disabilities in business settings. The Disability:IN NextGen Leaders program is a six-month program for college students and recent graduates with disabilities who have demonstrated talent and leadership in science, technology, engineering and math, finance and business fields. NextGen Leaders collaborate with corporate partners to prepare for employment through mentorship, networking and recruiting opportunities. In 2021, Lockheed Martin had a record number of employees serve as mentors to NextGen Leaders.\nPARTNERSHIPS WITH HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES\n\nLockheed Martin continues to work with Historically Black Colleges and Universities to foster and recruit top talent. In 2021, through targeted engagement and hiring events, 106 offers were accepted by Historically Black Colleges and Universities students to begin internships and full-time roles in the summer of 2022. In addition to Lockheed Martin\u2019s long-standing partnership with engineering departments within 16 Historically Black Colleges and Universities, our Finance & Business Operations team deepened their partnerships in 2021 with four business schools at Florida A&M University, Howard University, Morgan State University and Prairie View A&M University. The aim of these partnerships is to work with the faculty to guide academics, provide skills development for students and recruit for early career opportunities. In November, John Mollard, Vice President and Treasurer, gave a virtual presentation at an event hosted by Florida A&M University, where business students from all four partner schools learned more about career opportunities.\n\nBUSINESS RESOURCE GROUPS\n\nOur Business Resource Groups continue to be a strategic enabler of our diversity and inclusion strategy. Our Business Resource Groups are voluntary, employee-led groups that are open to all employees while focusing on workplace issues specific to racial/ethnic, gender, sexual orientation/gender identity, disability or veteran status. The Business Resource Groups foster a diverse and inclusive workplace aligned with our organizational mission, values, goals and business practices and drive awareness and change within our organization. Our commitment to the Business Resource Group program is demonstrated through our assignment of executive sponsors, our investments in programming and the formal policies and management we have established to support their governance.\n\n\u201cAt Lockheed Martin, we are dedicated to upholding our Core Values\u2014Do What\u2019s Right, Respect Others and Perform with Excellence. One of the most important expressions of our commitment to these core values is actively building a diverse workforce and inclusive environment. We know our strength is rooted in coming together so all our employees can bring their best selves to work each day.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Greg Karol, Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer\n\nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Partnerships\n\n- Alabama A&M University\n- Atlanta University Center Consortium\n- Florida A&M University\n- Hampton University\n- Howard University\n- Jackson State University\n- Morgan State University\n- North Carolina A&T State University\n- Norfolk State University\n- Prairie View A&M University\n- Southern University & A&M College\n- Tennessee State University\n- Tuskegee University\n- University of the District of Columbia\n- University of Maryland Eastern Shore\n- Virginia State University\n\n16 LOCKHEED MARTIN HBCU PARTNERSHIPS\n78 LOCKHEED MARTIN FINANCE & BUSINESS OPERATIONS HBCU ALUMNI\n86 LOCKHEED MARTIN HBCU INTERNS IN 2021\nWorkplace Safety\n\nSUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT PLAN GOALS\n\nReduce the number of days away from work due to occupational injury or illness through 2025.20\n\nEstablish a risk-based approach to serious incident and fatality prevention programs by 2025.\n\n2021 PROGRESS\n\nWe did not meet this goal in 2021. This goal is based on a three-year rolling average, which included data from years prior to the pandemic. An analysis showed that we would have been successful in achieving our target if occupational COVID-19 related days away from work were removed from the 2021 calculation.21\n\nIn 2021, we finalized our new serious incidents or fatalities management process, integrated it within our incident management system tool and conducted initial testing. Implementation across the company is planned for early 2022.\n\nOur safety and health program, called Target Zero, goes beyond compliance to ensure safe work conditions, promote workforce resiliency and enhance business value. We actively implement programs to reduce risk, prevent injuries and empower our employees in creating a safer work environment. This helps us protect the foundation of our business and our greatest asset: our people.\n\nLockheed Martin\u2019s enterprise Environment, Safety and Health Management System is certified to ISO 45001, with 25 sites certified to ISO 45001 in 2021.19 Additionally, five Lockheed Martin facilities are participants in the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u2019s Voluntary Protection Program.\n\nWe are actively involved with organizations such as the National Association of EHS&S Management, The National Safety Council, The Conference Board and industry working groups to share safety best practices and lessons learned. One example is our participation in the Z16 Standards Committee with more than 20 other organizations. The Z16 standard provides a broadened scope of metrics to help organizations better understand and improve safety and health performance, as well as the impact safety and health has on business success. Measuring workplace safety performance extends beyond employee injury and illness prevention to include topics such as fleet, property, reputation and resilience.\n\nPARTICIPATORY ERGONOMICS PROGRAM\n\nOur Participatory Ergonomics program allows employees from different areas to become part of an ergonomics team in charge of conducting assessments and implementing solutions in manufacturing areas identified as high and moderate risk for ergonomic stressors. Since 2011, eight teams have been established. In 2020, two Participatory Ergonomics teams implemented comprehensive and sustainable Participatory Ergonomics programs, completing approximately three dozen improvement projects that represented an estimated cost avoidance of almost $2.6 million. In 2021, a program enhancement train-the-trainer pilot initiative was implemented in our Missiles and Fire Control business area, which will enable and enhance ergonomic skills.\n\n19 While the enterprise Environment, Safety and Health Management System is certified, it does not mean that all of our facilities are automatically certified. Individual facilities apply for inclusion in the certification separately.\n\n20 Lost days severity rate is calculated as a function of the number of days away from work due to an injury or illness per 100 employees.\n\n21 The 2021 severity rate without occupational COVID illnesses was 4.32, which was within goal. The 2021 severity rate including occupational COVID illness was 5.81. No other identified trends impacted our 2021 performance. The 2020 severity rate without occupational COVID illnesses was 4.26, which was within goal. The 2020 severity rate including occupational COVID illness was 5.06. No other identified trends impacted our 2020 performance.\nWorkplace Safety\n\nWithin Lockheed Martin, we engage and empower employees through a suite of safety initiatives. Several of these include:\n\n- **Target Zero Structured Improvement Activities**: These continuous improvement events are designed to enhance safety and performance in identified opportunity areas. In 2021, our Corporate Environment, Safety and Health team sponsored three domestic and one international event, and our business areas sponsored an additional four events.\n\n- **Zero in on Safety**: This employee promotion campaign demonstrates leveraging the Zero in on Safety techniques, Identify, Evaluate and Act (IDEA), to recognize hazardous conditions, report injuries and close calls and implement corrective solutions.\n\n- **Safety Moments**: This video series is based on real Lockheed Martin situations and incidents. Safety Moments drives injury prevention and awareness through employee testimonials and stories.\n\n- **Ergo Cup**: This competition fosters innovation of new ergonomic practices and processes to minimize ergonomic stressors experienced in the workplace. We held our ninth annual Lockheed Martin Ergo Cup competition in 2021.\n\n- **Target Zero\u2019s Heroes**: This program, introduced in 2021, recognizes employees who demonstrate outstanding safety actions through a formal nomination and awards process.\n\nWe continually strive to improve our Target Zero program. An example of this is our recent effort towards risk-based management, with an enhanced focus on actual and potential serious incidents or fatalities. Focusing on this category of serious incidents allows us to dedicate resources to manage robust investigations, corrective actions and preventative strategies in areas that will have the greatest safety impact.\n\nOur Target Zero Committee developed Lockheed Martin\u2019s concept of prioritizing actual and potential serious incidents or fatalities and the new process for managing them through our incident management system. Our system is used to report and track all safety incidents, close calls and positive observations across the company. The Target Zero Committee published a guidance document defining actual and potential serious incidents or fatalities to include incidents that relate to one of seven high-risk categories. Actual and potential serious incidents or fatalities will be tracked in our incident management system and will require the incident investigator to complete a 5 Whys root cause analysis. The Target Zero Committee will analyze all actual and potential serious incidents or fatalities reported across the business areas to identify trends and opportunities for improvement. Performance will be reported on a quarterly basis to the Environment, Safety and Health Leadership Council.\n\nFor more information on our Target Zero and Environment, Safety and Health programs, please visit the Lockheed Martin Environment, Safety and Health website and review our annual performance reports located on the ESG Portal.\n\n---\n\n**U.K. TARGET ZERO STRUCTURED IMPROVEMENT ACTIVITY EVENT**\n\nLockheed Martin conducted its first Target Zero structured improvement activity at our Faslane, U.K., location in the summer of 2021. The focus was on identifying improvement opportunities for ballast maintenance operations, which consists of transporting and sand-blasting vessel ballasts. The original operation required heavy lifting, awkward positions and working at heights. The facility designed an innovative solution to transport, elevate, hold and roll the ballast in which the air transporter, a critical piece under the ballast, was able to be removed to avoid grit damage from sandblasting. This solution also eliminated the need to work at heights. The operation was further refined by the structured improvement activity team with an overhead arrestor to hold the hoses and blasting equipment, reducing operator safety risk. We plan to host a multi-week structured improvement activity event in the U.K., again in 2022, this time looking for safety opportunities at both manufacturing and office facilities.\nModeling Business Integrity\n\nEarning and maintaining the trust of our stakeholders is essential to our business. We are proud of our culture of integrity and work to create an environment that supports ethical behavior and empowers employees to speak up with concerns. We are deeply committed to doing business the right way and strive to strengthen our programs to ensure our employees and anyone who works with us adheres to the same high ethical standards.\n\nEthical Business Practices\n\nAnti-Bribery and Corruption\nEthical Business Practices\n\nSUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT PLAN GOAL\nScore at or below 35% of the total percentage of employees who observe misconduct within the past 12 months, but neither report it nor take action to address it by 2025.\n\n2021 PROGRESS\nSurvey results indicate 29% of employees who have observed misconduct in the workplace in the prior 12 months did not report or take action to address it. We continue to encourage employees to take action and provide multiple contact methods for guidance and reporting. Lockheed Martin does not tolerate retaliation and this is communicated in training, policies and during contacts to the Ethics Office.\n\nA core component of an effective ethics program is ensuring employees feel empowered to raise concerns to their leader or Ethics Officer for guidance or to report potential misconduct. Promptly responding to concerns promotes trust and accountability in the workplace. Lockheed Martin\u2019s sustained reputation for ethical conduct instills confidence in our customers and suppliers, and helps attract and retain high quality employees whose values and integrity align with the company.\n\nOur Code of Ethics and Business Conduct and corporate policy Ethics and Business Conduct provide the foundation for Lockheed Martin\u2019s ethics program, reinforcing our Core Values to Do What\u2019s Right, Respect Others and Perform with Excellence. Training and policies support the program, clarifying the expectation for behavior and compliance, while ensuring employees know how to raise concerns. Our Board of Directors provide program oversight, reviewing metrics, initiatives and project status three times each year. In addition, business area Ethics Steering Committees review similar information and provide oversight for their business. Our ethics program is reviewed annually as part of our entity level controls assessment. This assessment includes a comprehensive review of existing policies, procedures and business conduct compliance training to ensure the program is relevant, comprehensive and effectively managed.\n\nThe biennial 2021 Employee Insights Survey provides insights on employee perceptions of ethics, integrity and trust. Employees who do not take action when observing misconduct primarily believe no action will be taken, and/or they fear potential retaliation from peers or leadership. These concerns are addressed in multiple ways including Integrity Minute videos, business conduct compliance training, ethics awareness training and other leadership and local Ethics Office engagement.\n\nSurvey data helps gauge the health of our ethics program and provides tracking against the sustainability management plan goals. Employees are asked if they have personally observed misconduct in the workplace in the past twelve months. If they respond yes, they are asked if they reported it, took action or did nothing. The sustainability management plan goal is not to exceed 35% of employees who observe misconduct taking no action. Employees are expected to not only recognize misconduct, but take action to address it through Voicing our Values techniques or reporting. Lockheed Martin has seen a steady decline in observations of misconduct, as well as employees unwilling to take action.\n\nETHICS CONTACTS (PER 1,000 EMPLOYEES)\\textsuperscript{a,b,c}\n\n| Year | Guidances | Cases |\n|------|-----------|-------|\n| 2017 | 40        | 4     |\n| 2018 | 37        | 4     |\n| 2019 | 38        | 4     |\n| 2020 | 33.9      | 4     |\n| 2021 | 38.7      | 2.7   |\n\n\\textsuperscript{a} Ethics contact requests for an Ethics Officer to provide guidance or to investigate misconduct.\n\n\\textsuperscript{b} Ethics guidance information, advice and/or resources to clarify policy and resolve workplace questions on a wide-range of ethics and compliance topics.\n\n\\textsuperscript{c} Ethics case internal investigation into a good-faith allegation of misconduct.\n\n\\textsuperscript{d} Investigation feedback score perspectives of reporting party and subjects on the ethics investigative process.\nEthical Business Practices\n\nCAROL R. MARSHALL AWARD WINNER\nBlair Marks, recently retired Vice President, Ethics and Business Conduct, received the Carol R. Marshall Award for Innovation in Corporate Ethics from the Ethics and Compliance Initiative. This non-profit organization founded in 1922 and based in Vienna, VA, has helped build cultures of integrity. This prestigious award is named after the late Ethics and Compliance Initiative Fellows Chair and coincidentally the first Lockheed Martin Vice President, Ethics and Business Conduct. This award honors individuals who model Carol R. Marshall\u2019s leadership, achievement and innovation.\n\nETHICS IN ENGINEERING COMPETITION AWARD\nWe are honored to receive a Gold Brandon Hall Human Capital Management Excellence Award for Excellence in Human Resources for \u201cBest Advance in Social Impact\u201d for our 2021 Ethics in Engineering Case Competition. This event took place in February 2021 during Engineers Week. Twenty-four college and university teams, each with two undergraduate students and an accompanying faculty member, presented their solution to a fictional case involving ethical, business and engineering dilemmas with a focus on supersonics and hypersonics. Texas A&M University won; semi-finalists included Brigham Young University, University of Illinois and first-time competitor University of California-San Diego. More information about this competition can be found on our Ethics website.\n\nMISSILES AND FIRE CONTROL ETHICS WEEK\nMissiles and Fire Control hosted its fourth annual Ethics Week in March 2021. This effort raises awareness about the importance of workplace ethics, compliance and business conduct and serves as a reminder that we must all work together to embrace our Core Values. This year\u2019s theme was \u201cWho Wants to Be An Ethics Champion?\u201d where employees were encouraged to visit the ethics website homepage and select answers to common ethics questions for a chance to win a grand prize. Each day was based on a different topic. Day one focused on the ethics process, day two was about charging practices, day three was about gifts and business courtesies and day four focused on retaliation.\nAnti-Bribery and Corruption\n\nSUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT PLAN GOAL\nAchieve 100% completion of required employee training on gifts and business courtesies and international business practices annually through 2025.\n\n2021 PROGRESS\nWe achieved 100% completion of these two trainings for required employees.\n\nAt Lockheed Martin, we have zero-tolerance for bribery and corruption. We will walk away from business engagements associated with improper conduct and that would violate U.S. and other applicable anti-corruption laws.\n\nIncluded in our comprehensive approach to anti-corruption compliance are our Gifts and Business Courtesies and International Business Practices business conduct compliance training modules. These courses, required annually for employees with applicable roles and responsibilities, inform and deliver resources to employees about our expectations for ethical business practices, and support employee awareness of, and compliance with, applicable laws. Additional employee engagements about the importance of anti-corruption compliance are provided through a variety of topical spot briefings within functional teams. For example our legal team engages employees several times a year on the history, importance and risks related to corruption during our Doing Business Overseas course.\n\nIn 2021, we created two high-impact, supplemental modules with specific situational scenarios illustrating corruption risks and behaviors for employee awareness. These included:\n\n- Country-specific training: We created country-specific training for certain employee populations and locations, such as Saudi Arabia. We plan to create similar content for additional countries in the future.\n- \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d scenario training: This scenario training reflects real-world situations employees may encounter during international field deployments or travel, which may implicate bribe requests, including where personal safety may be at risk. We plan to release these trainings in 2022 through a variety of internal media resources.\n\nOur corporate policies Gifts, Hospitality, Other Business Courtesies and Sponsorships and Compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws provide specific guidance and procedures for the company. For example, the first policy outlines thresholds of permissibility, exception request processes and approval responsibilities associated with offering of certain business courtesies. We use an analytics tool to scan company data and flag questionable transactions for review and any policy violations that may occur are reported to business area legal teams for remedial actions, as well as to the Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary on a quarterly basis. Please refer to the Lockheed Martin Code of Ethics and Business Conduct for more information on our anti-corruption policies.\nBeyond the Sustainability Management Plan\n\nWhile our sustainability management plan provides the framework for the integration of sustainability within our business, we focus on additional topics that are critical to reducing our environmental footprint, positively contributing to our communities and upholding our commitment to integrity.\n\n| Supporting Sustainable Development | 44 |\n|-----------------------------------|----|\n| Human Rights                      | 45 |\n| Supply Chain Sustainability       | 46 |\n| Social Impact                     | 48 |\n| Waste Management                  | 50 |\n| Water Management                  | 51 |\n| Remediation                       | 52 |\nSupporting Sustainable Development\n\nAt Lockheed Martin, our commitment to sustainability extends to the communities where we operate. We developed goals aligned to four United Nations Sustainable Development Goals with underlying targets that relate to Lockheed Martin\u2019s mission and values. Our goal is to double our financial support to organizations that support these specific targets by 2030, including:\n\n- **Quality Education**: Substantially increase the number of youth and adults who have relevant skills, including technical and vocational skills, for employment and entrepreneurship.\n\n- **Gender Equality**: Enhance the use of enabling technology, especially information and communications technology, to promote the empowerment of women.\n\n- **Affordable and Clean Energy**: Expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries.\n\n- **Peace, Justice, Strong Institutions**: Substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms.\n\nIn 2021, we established a baseline of our existing support to organizations covering the selected Sustainable Development Goals targets. We collaborated with our finance team to centralize data on sponsorships and charitable contributions across all four business areas. We evaluated each organization receiving support against the four selected Sustainable Development Goals using a standard set of criteria to avoid double counting. We also ensured the organizations considered for this goal had a clear development-oriented mission. In 2021, Lockheed Martin provided approximately $12 million in support of organizations that supported Quality Education and Peace, Justice, Strong Institutions.\nHuman Rights\n\nAt Lockheed Martin, we believe good citizenship includes the protection and advancement of human rights.\n\nOur commitment to being a good corporate citizen and respecting human rights underpins our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct and our Core Values to Do What\u2019s Right, Respect Others and Perform with Excellence. This commitment applies to all employees, the Board of Directors and others who represent or act for us. Lockheed Martin\u2019s activities are conducted in compliance with the laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate, except where such laws conflict with U.S. law, and our compliance with them is reinforced by our robust integrated assurance program and Board of Directors oversight of our enterprise risk management process.\n\nWe published our first Human Rights Report in 2021 to further enhance the availability and transparency of information on our human rights approach and the progress of our initiatives on human rights. The report provides a comprehensive overview of our human rights related governance, including board and management oversight of human rights matters, policies, principles and due diligence processes that guide our approach, and has information on our progress toward associated programs and goals.\n\nASSESSING HUMAN TRAFFICKING RISKS IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN\n\nIn 2021, our Global Supply Chain Operations team continued to build on the human trafficking supply chain assessment completed in 2020. Along with updating the mapping of Lockheed Martin\u2019s human trafficking risk across our supply chain, available via an internal dashboard, the team established an annual engagement of supply chain executives and developed guidance and educational materials for internal distribution. Materials included a summary of high risk regions for human trafficking, any changes year-to-year in risk levels and data on changes in the number of Lockheed Martin suppliers in these regions. The goal of this effort is to guide decision making around purchases and other supplier engagement activity. In 2021, the number of suppliers in high risk human trafficking regions declined by more than 30%. In addition to engaging senior decision makers on this important issue, we continued to engage our more than 5,000 supply chain professionals to raise awareness of human trafficking and the resources available to them to understand this risk when making decisions.\n\nINTERNATIONAL INDUSTRY GROUPS SHARE BEST PRACTICES ON HUMAN RIGHTS SUPPLY CHAIN DUE DILIGENCE\n\nHuman rights due diligence is a growing area of importance across the aerospace and defense industry, and collaboration is a key element to making progress. Lockheed Martin is a member of several international industry and ethics groups such as the U.K.\u2019s Institute of Business Ethics Defence Practitioners Group, the ADS Business Ethics Network and the International Forum on Business Ethical Conduct. These groups focus on raising the overall integrity of the aerospace and defense industry via collective action, and produce toolkits, principles and template documents for members to adopt, including materials on human rights due diligence.\n\nDuring 2021, Lockheed Martin participated in industry panel discussions on human rights and supply chain due diligence facilitated by the Institute of Business Ethics Defence Practitioners Group, along with ADS Business Ethics Network and International Forum on Business Ethical Conduct members. The purpose of these events was to share best practices and examples of how participating companies were addressing the challenges of conducting diligence at sub-tier levels, setting expectations in supplier codes of conduct, conducting risk assessments and selecting appropriate human rights standards and frameworks, as well as improving company statements and obligations required by the Modern Slavery Act 2015. The key value of these discussions was the recognition that companies were at different stages in their journey to address human rights supply chain due diligence, and that information shared can be used for benchmarking and identifying best practices. There was also a realization that to understand and address this topic fully, a multi-disciplinary team of ethics, procurement and sustainability professionals across the industry is needed to drive toward common standards and frameworks for conducting the required due diligence from evolving legislation.\nSupply Chain Sustainability\n\nLockheed Martin has established sustainable supply chain programs that drive affordability and innovation across our value chain. In 2021, we focused on creating long-lasting, leading opportunities to enhance environmental stewardship and social responsibility.

Students in the program are placed on a team with other interns from across the business areas, and are assigned a sustainability challenge area. Each challenge is sponsored by a functional team at Lockheed Martin, such as Environment, Safety and Health or the Corporate Sustainability Office. The students work together to research the challenge and ultimately provide recommended solutions to the Supply Chain Council chair. The program sparks innovative ideas to improve our sustainable supply chain strategy, and provides impactful, real-world experience for students.\n\nIn 2021, we had 16 interns participate across six challenge areas. For 2022, plans are in the works to implement ideas that originated from the Supply Chain Sustainability Intern Program, including:\n\n- Supply Chain Sustainability Case Competition: Modeled after our successful Ethics in Engineering Case Competition, Lockheed Martin will host its first Supply Chain Sustainability Case Competition in 2022. This competition will bring students together each year to address a supply chain sustainability topic and provide solutions. The first competition is planned to focus on small businesses and disruptions, specifically how small businesses can proactively prepare for large disruptions in the future including climate change or pandemics. The judges will include small businesses from Lockheed Martin\u2019s own supply chain. The event is planned for fall 2022 and focuses on eight universities with strong supply chain programs.\n\n- Supply Chain Sustainability Forum: As a member of the International Aerospace Environmental Group, in 2021, Lockheed Martin partnered with other participating leaders in the aerospace and defense industry to build a business case for establishing a new working group that focuses on environmental, social and governance engagement. In 2022, the working group plans to launch a Supply Chain Sustainability Forum with an initial focus on climate change.\n\nModel-Based Enterprise Supplier Capabilities Assessment\n\nIn place of our supplier sustainability assessment in 2021, we reached out to approximately 1,700 suppliers to understand their model-based engineering capabilities and drive awareness of Lockheed Martin\u2019s efforts towards digital twin concepts. For each supplier that participated in the survey, we provided a benchmark report on where they stood in comparison to their peers. Engagement with our supply chain on this topic enables suppliers to proactively invest and prepare to align with Lockheed Martin\u2019s future requirements. Utilizing digital twin concepts will ultimately streamline our processes, reduce waste and strengthen operational efficiency.\n\nCybersecurity Small Business Pathfinder Program\n\nIn 2021, Lockheed Martin launched a new program providing cybersecurity support to an initial selection of small businesses based on specific criteria. This innovative, leading program includes 50 small businesses that will receive third-party expertise for one year in the areas of phishing attempts, training and perimeter vulnerability scanning. In 2022, we plan to launch a second round of services for these suppliers to continue to directly enhance their cybersecurity programs. After this initial cohort, we will look to expand the opportunity to additional suppliers based on risk and current cybersecurity posture.\nSocial Impact\n\nThrough charitable contributions, sponsorships and employee volunteerism, we can improve the lives of those who defend freedom, cultivate the future science, technology, engineering and math workforce and strengthen the resiliency of communities.\n\nIn 2021, we contributed nearly $32 million to:\n\n- Cultivate a science, technology, engineering and math workforce of the future from diverse backgrounds by partnering with non-profit organizations who equip students with knowledge, skills and access to science, technology, engineering and math education and career pathways.\n- Improve the lives of those who volunteer for military service and their families to ensure they are well-supported in facing hardships and enabled to thrive during and after military service.\n- Build resilient communities to strengthen preparedness, hasten recovery and suffer less disruption and long-term environmental and socially adverse impacts.\n\nCultivating the Future Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Workforce\n\nU.S. and partner nations rely on a highly trained, highly capable science, technology, engineering and math talent to counter threats to global security and maintain a technological advantage. Our company\u2019s entire value chain\u2014from upstream suppliers to global customers\u2014benefits from removing academic and financial barriers to student access to, and achievement in, science, technology, engineering and math fields, which includes improving representation from minorities, women and non-binary students.\n\nSupport for Military Service Members, Veterans and their Families\n\nThose enlisted in all forms of military service, and their families, represent a key stakeholder group for our company. Veterans comprise more than one-fifth of our total U.S. employee population. With our non-profit partners, we support the active-duty force and their families with programs that help improve their mental and economic well-being.\nSocial Impact\n\nLOCKHEED MARTIN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING AND MATH SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM\n\nLockheed Martin launched the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Scholarship Program in 2018 as part of investment in the next generation of science, technology, engineering and math talent, removing financial barriers to postsecondary education for students from diverse backgrounds. The program annually awards $10,000 to 200 recipients. To date, the program has awarded 596 student recipients at more than 80 schools. In 2021, nearly 50% of recipients identified as female and 60% identified with underrepresented racial and ethnic demographic groups.\n\nGIRLS INC.\n\nOur five-year partnership with Girls Inc., a non-profit organization, focuses on middle school and high school students and aims to inspire all girls to be strong, smart and bold to strengthen their interest and confidence in pursuing science, technology, engineering and math education and careers. Lockheed Martin helps provide year-round after-school programming, weekend activities and other hands-on experiences that expand upon and support girls\u2019 science, technology, engineering and math learning and engagement. Participating students interact with women and men in science, technology, engineering and math careers, including dedicated Lockheed Martin volunteers, and come to view these careers as realistic options for themselves and essential to improving our world.\n\nAFGHANISTAN RELIEF\n\nLockheed Martin moved swiftly with multiple non-profit groups to provide more than $555,000 to support military service members, veterans and their families and other individuals entering the U.S. following the military departure from Afghanistan. The American Red Cross Service to the Armed Forces supported evacuation efforts for service members, U.S. State Department members and their families and Afghan refugees. Another partner, Headstrong, provided free confidential mental health treatment for military members, veterans and their families through its network of 280 clinical providers in all 50 states.\nWaste Management\n\nOur goal for waste is to reduce waste per occupant by 11% by 2025 compared to a 2016 baseline. We can achieve this goal through source reduction, reuse and recycling. These efforts reduce waste sent to the landfill and for incineration. Waste streams contributing to the goal include hazardous and non-hazardous waste, universal waste and other waste streams such as office furniture. In 2021, we achieved a 5% reduction of waste per occupant.\n\nWaste management and disposal activities are governed by our internal corporate procedure Waste Disposal and Recycling. Performance is reported to our Vice President, Environment, Safety and Health on a quarterly basis and to the Board of Directors two times per year. A corporate-wide Waste Reduction Working Group meets monthly to collaborate on waste reduction efforts and share related best practices. For example, in 2021 the Waste Reduction Working Group initiated two landfill-diversion waste audits at our Waterton, CO, and Stratford, CT, facilities, and our first annual Zero Waste Challenge. For more information on waste management at Lockheed Martin, please visit our Environment, Safety and Health website.\n\nHazardous Waste\n\nLockheed Martin has a robust process for the management and disposal of hazardous waste generated by our operations. Our Waste Disposal and Recycling corporate procedure describes the minimum requirements for hazardous waste generation, storage, transportation and disposal, and is applicable to all Lockheed Martin operations. This procedure is implemented to protect the environment, ensure regulatory compliance and minimize risk. All Lockheed Martin operations are required to use hazardous waste transporters and disposal facilities that have undergone rigorous assessments and received approval by the Corporate Environment, Safety and Health team. These assessments look at factors such as hazardous waste disposal facility operations, design and environmental controls, permitting and regulatory compliance, management systems, financial and insurance data and transportation and safety metrics. Approved hazardous waste transporters and disposal facilities are reassessed on a regular basis.\n\nTOTAL WASTE GENERATED [POUNDS]a\n\n| Year | Total Waste Generated |\n|------|-----------------------|\n| 2017 | 59,578,521            |\n| 2018 | 60,631,125            |\n| 2019 | 61,546,290            |\n| 2020 | 57,872,526            |\n| 2021 | 55,574,947            |\n\n2021 WASTE BY DISPOSAL METHODb\n\n- Total Waste Recycled: 50%\n- Total Waste to Landfill: 29%\n- Additional methods including incineration (with energy recovery), incineration (without energy recovery) and other disposal methods: 21%\n\na Total waste generated includes regulated (hazardous), non-hazardous, universal and other waste streams.

Some regions are already experiencing water stress, while others have abundant water and are expected to continue to maintain a reliable supply into the future.\n\nIn 2019, we conducted a water supply risk analysis to identify our facilities in the highest water stressed regions and those predicted to be in stressed regions out to 2040. In 2021, we used this analysis, along with a ranking of our highest water using facilities, to prioritize and execute water balances and associated water conservation activities. We\u2019ve completed five water balance analyses at facilities in Fort Worth, TX, Waterton, CO, Palmdale, CA, Sunnyvale, CA, and Marietta, GA. In addition to mapping where water sources originate, how it is used in these facilities and how it is discharged, the analyses identify opportunities for efficiency. These opportunities will receive additional scrutiny, with an emphasis towards calculating water efficiency projections based on the true cost of water. This means considering not just the cost of the water, but also the cost associated with pre-treating, pumping, heating and disposing of the water.\n\nGo Green Gated Capital and Water Efficiency\n\nWater efficiency projects are also considered during the Go Green gated capital cycle discussed in the Energy Management section of this report. For example, in 2021 three water-saving Go Green projects were completed:\n\n- Cooling tower filtration system at our Missiles and Fire Control facility in Troy, AL, which avoids 6,307,200 gallons of water per year.\n- Ambient air nitrogen vaporizers at our Rotary and Missions Systems facility in Bridgeport, CT, which avoids 26,400 gallons of water per year.\n- Cooling tower upgrades at our Space facility in Sunnyvale, CA, which avoids 43,000 gallons of water per year.\n\nAdditionally, funding for an air scrubber project at our Aeronautics facility in Palmdale, CA, that will avoid an estimated 450,000 gallons of water annually, was earmarked for 2022.\n\nENVIRONMENT, SAFETY AND HEALTH EXCELLENCE AWARDS RECOGNIZING WATER CONSERVATION\n\nAs part of the Lockheed Martin 2021 Environment, Safety and Health Excellence Awards, an Aeronautics facility submitted an efficiency project with significant water savings. By installing an energy management control system that manages chlorine meter flush systems at specific building locations, the facility was able to maintain chlorine levels while eliminating unnecessary discharge into the sewer. The project saves approximately five million gallons of water, with a projected simple payback of nine months. The standard best practice going forward is to install these energy management control system-controlled stations at the facility where applicable.\n\n---\n\nData is shown for our Go Green year, which runs November-October (e.g. Nov. 2020 - Oct. 2021).\n\nThe Lockheed Martin Environment, Safety and Health Excellence Awards is an annual, company-wide program run by the Corporate Environment, Safety and Health team. The program aims to recognize projects or teams that have made a significant contribution to the business through their dedication to improving performance.\nRemediation\n\nWith heritage operations dating back to the early 20th century, Lockheed Martin has built its success on long-standing innovation and business excellence as well as strategic acquisitions.\n\nSome of our operations conducted over the years, although in compliance with relevant laws at the time, resulted in soil or groundwater contamination. Where remedial actions are warranted, Lockheed Martin works collaboratively with regulatory agencies and communities to remedy the effect of the contamination. Currently, we have 73 active remediation projects across our operations. You can read more about our commitment to remediation on our Lockheed Martin Remediation website.\n\nNot only are we committed to taking effective remedial actions, but we also aim to make our remediation projects sustainable wherever possible. We do this by using innovative technological solutions like disposing of contaminants with waste to energy incineration and renewing the activated carbon that acts as a filter in many of our treatment plants by safely burning off contaminants. At several of our remediation sites in water-stressed areas, in cooperation with regulators we treat contaminated groundwater to such a high standard that the local water agency can then direct it into the potable water supply, providing water to over half a million homes in those service areas.\n\nPROTECTING WILDLIFE IN POTRERO CANYON, CA\n\nFrom the 1960s and early 1970s, Lockheed Propulsion Company operated a facility at Potrero Canyon in Beaumont, CA. Cleanup operations began at the site in 1986 and evolved as regulation of new chemicals expanded the remediation needed. In 2002, 1,4-dioxane and perchlorate were in the process of becoming regulated chemicals in California, resulting in testing at the site. These compounds were identified in the groundwater as a result of this and subsequent testing and remediation planning was initiated. After considering several remediation alternatives, Lockheed Martin was able to propose an effective solution that minimized disturbance of the site. The California Department of Toxic Substances Control approved this solution. Lockheed Martin constructed a system to treat 1,4-dioxane from one groundwater extraction well, and natural biodegradation provided by the native wetlands habitat was deemed highly effective at treating perchlorate. The use of this natural remediation process provided environmental benefits of minimizing the environmental footprint when compared to more traditional remediation technologies and processes. Lockheed Martin also installed a solar-powered pump to direct water from a well into existing topographic depressions. These depressions can provide a permanent water source for the tricolored blackbird, which is native to the area and classified as threatened in California.\n\nINNOVATIVE REMEDIATION TECHNOLOGY\n\nIn New York, we are piloting a new treatment technology for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. This new treatment system consists of a portable, containerized, continuous water treatment system that relies on a natural phenomenon called foam fractionation to separate the per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances from impacted water. The natural physiochemistry of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances compounds allow them to adhere to fine air bubbles and be removed from the environment. The system can remove and concentrate per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances from 660,000 gallons of water to a single cup of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances concentrate, with no extra waste generated, making it a highly sustainable solution.\nOur ESG Performance Index contains relevant environmental, social and governance metrics to support the efforts highlighted throughout our sustainability report.
