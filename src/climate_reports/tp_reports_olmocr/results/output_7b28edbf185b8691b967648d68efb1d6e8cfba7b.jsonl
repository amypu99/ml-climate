We believe that the business of business is improving the state of the world. It starts with trust, our number one value. And the key to trust is transparency.\n\nThat\u2019s why each year we produce this comprehensive Stakeholder Impact Report so that our key stakeholders can stay informed and track our progress.\n\nAt Salesforce, we have a vision for how the future works. And it requires all of us to transform for the new world we\u2019re in.\nFY22 Report Highlights\n\nTech\nFor Good\nAddressed global challenges through new innovations, like Net Zero Cloud and Safety Cloud\n\n100%\nRenewable Energy Sourced\nAnd net zero residual emissions across our full value chain\n\n50.7%\nRepresentation\nOf U.S. employees as members of underrepresented groups\n(Women, Black, Latinx, Indigenous, Multiracial, LGBTQ+ employees, People with Disabilities, and Veterans)\n\n$1.87B+\nIn FY22\nContributed to the global community in donated and discounted technology\n\n$100M+\nIn FY22\nContributed to support our partners and communities around the world through grants and gifts\n\n43.5M\nTrees\nContributed to date toward our goal to conserve, restore, and grow 100 million trees by 2030\n\nExplore the comprehensive Stakeholder Impact Report at salesforce.com/stakeholder-impact-report\nEach year, we publish a comprehensive Stakeholder Impact Report so that our stakeholders can stay informed and track our progress on key environmental, social, and governance (ESG) topics.\n\nAs long-time proponents of stakeholder capitalism, we believe that organizations should have a mechanism to integrate ESG into their business practices and to communicate their impact, positive or negative, to their stakeholders. We believe that comparable, consistent, decision-useful, and verified ESG disclosure has the potential to accelerate markets toward stakeholder capitalism. We are encouraged by the growing convergence of ESG reporting frameworks and standards and are supportive of initiatives that push closer to a global standard.\n\nReporting Framework\n\nThe contents of this report are informed by regular ESG materiality assessments, which identify key topics that are most important to our stakeholders and to our success as a business. This report is also informed by leading ESG disclosure frameworks and standards. We incorporate the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into our existing reporting processes to demonstrate our active participation as a business in advancing these goals.\n\nESG Reporting Governance\n\nThis report is reviewed by our Legal and SEC Reporting teams to ensure it is consistent with our other SEC filings and that data contained in the report can be traced back to internal or external records. The SEC Reporting team reviews this report using the same procedures as they do with our 1934 Securities Exchange Act filings. Our ESG Steering Committee oversees our overall ESG disclosure strategy. Our Board of Directors provides oversight over ESG issues overall at Salesforce.\nThird-Party Verification\n\nWe believe building trust with our stakeholders includes a credible ESG reporting process that will deliver actionable, transparent, consistent, re-performable, and verifiable metrics. Since FY18, we have engaged Ernst & Young LLP (EY), an independent third party, to provide a limited assurance review over selected ESG data. The scope of EY\u2019s review has expanded over time and in FY22 includes our Schedules of Environmental, Equality, and Social Value Metrics. We will continue to identify and explore opportunities for expanded third-party review, and we encourage others to do the same. For complete FY22 and historical ESG metrics with references to frameworks and standards we support, please see ESG Metrics and Indicators.\n\nESG Metrics and Indicators\n\nWe enhance the trust of our stakeholders by transparently disclosing our ESG policies and metrics.\n\nOur voluntary reporting is informed by the following frameworks:\n\n- The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Sustainability Accounting Standard for the Technology & Communications Sector, Software & IT Services industry (Version 2018-10)\n- The Financial Stability Board Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\n- The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) GRI Standards\n- The Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC)\n- The World Economic Forum \u2013 International Business Council\u2019s Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics (SCM)\n\nSalesforce supports the continued convergence of ESG standards, frameworks, and principles to promote increased corporate transparency and comparability.\n## ESG Metrics and Indicators\n\n### Company Overview\n\n| Performance Indicator                  | FY22   | FY21   | FY20   | Framework

We recognize the diversity in our global workforce, and ensure we create a strong corporate culture based on our core values: Trust, Customer Success, Innovation, Equality, and Sustainability. We operationalize these values through specific measurable actions around accountability, alignment, transparency, integrity, and experience. Our employee code of conduct, goal planning process, employee surveys, town halls, workforce analytics initiatives, and more allow us to manage and measure our culture and workforce, at scale, while developing local talent pools and reducing risks related to visa controls, relocations, and other business factors that we would face with a workforce tied to a single country or region. Our government affairs teams are also engaged at the local, state, and country levels to lobby for policies that are aligned to our values and business continuity. | TC-SI-330a.1 |\n| Percentage of employees covered by an independent trade union or collective bargaining agreements\u00b9 | 0% | 0% | 0% | GRI 102-41 |\n| **Talent Development** |      |      |      |           |\n| Programs for upgrading employee skills | We offer our employees various talent development programs to create a culture of continuous learning.
