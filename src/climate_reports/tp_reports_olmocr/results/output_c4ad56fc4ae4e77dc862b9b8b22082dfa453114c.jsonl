We also used three relevant sector standards from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, the Principles for Responsible Banking, the United Nations (UN) Global Compact and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights frameworks to guide our reporting. (See related indexes.)\n\nWe have embedded the UN Sustainable Development Goals into relevant sections of the report where Citi plays a direct role in making progress toward specific goals. Additionally, we include an index that indicates where report content is specifically aligned to the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board\u2019s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. Finally, this report supplements information published in our 2021 Annual Report.\n\nAll reporting and performance data are limited to information for the owned and operated facilities of Citigroup Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless stated otherwise.

Refer to page 16 for our definition of material issues in the context of this report.\nIn This Section\n\n5 Letter from Our CEO\n8 Our ESG Strategy\n10 ESG Governance at Citi\n13 Our Material ESG Issues: Citi in a Global Context\n16 Citi and the Sustainable Development Goals\n17 Stakeholder Engagement at Citi\nLetter from Our CEO\n\nAs I write this note in late April, a war is raging in Ukraine with significant global ramifications.\n\nFrom the beginning, we have prioritized the humanitarian crisis, doing everything we can to help the people in Ukraine, including our own colleagues, whilst keeping our business there operating so we can support critical supply chains and the NGOs delivering essential aid. We are also helping our multinational clients who have decided to wind down their business in Russia.\n\nAlthough it might be too early to predict the war\u2019s long-term impact on the world order, it\u2019s not too soon to begin asking what it means for the issues at the heart of our ESG agenda \u2014 and the ESG agendas of so many other companies.\n\nI recently returned from seeing clients in Europe and the Middle East, and it is security \u2014 be it energy, food, defense, cyber or operational \u2014 that\u2019s now consuming their attention. The challenges facing our society have not only reinforced the need for businesses such as Citi to step up, but also the critical importance of collaboration on a global scale.\n\nConsider the climate crisis. At Citi, we\u2019ve been proud to play a leading role in our industry\u2019s drive to a more sustainable future, and in recent months, we released our initial plan for reaching net zero emissions by 2050. But Russia\u2019s role as a major energy producer is forcing governments to reevaluate their energy security and supply. Ultimately, combating climate change cannot be done by any company or country alone; we need businesses making the right investments to achieve the necessary shift in supply, and consumers joining companies in advocating for governments to create the policy frameworks that will be essential to stimulating demand for clean technologies and providing the foundation for the clean energy transition.\n\nThis tension, of course, is not new. While Citi plays an enabling role in the transition to a net zero economy, we understand that it cannot occur overnight. We have to be thoughtful with the transition, meeting our clients where they are in their efforts, and then helping and pushing them to accelerate their low-carbon transitions.\n\nSimilarly, our efforts to expand financial access and opportunity have also gained new urgency. We have engaged every level of our business to think and act in support of equity and the goal of helping close the racial wealth gap and increase economic mobility in the United States. In order to effectively do this work and serve our clients and communities, we\u2019ve set \u2014 and recently exceeded \u2014 talent representation goals to further diversify our own workforce and make progress toward pay equity at Citi.\n\nWe also continue to advance financial inclusion in underserved communities globally, expanding the scope of our work to areas such as healthcare, education, affordable housing and basic infrastructure. These efforts have become even more important amidst surging inflation and an emerging global food crisis that could be devastating for the world\u2019s poorest countries, which import much of their food and where households spend more than half of their income on food.\n\nThere are, of course, lessons to learn and apply to these challenges, particularly from the pandemic. COVID-19\u2019s disregard for borders underscored the interconnectedness of society. It also reminded us that global challenges demand a global, collective response. As the world becomes more fragmented, it is even more important for our global community of business to come together to confront the big challenges of our time.\n\nAt Citi, this sense of responsibility is something that continues to shape our decisions, business strategy, and firm-wide goals and commitments. We continue to be focused on action and partnering with like-minded organizations that are also doing the work. And for us, it\u2019s not just about the big numbers; it\u2019s the small number \u2014 helping society get closer to zero. Zero pay gap. Zero poverty. Some might say this is idealistic, but having ambitious goals is what helps us make meaningful progress. And it\u2019s going to take all of us, working together, to make sure we continue to go in the right direction.\n\nI invite you to learn more about these initiatives in the pages that follow. Our ESG agenda is not a separate layer that sits above what we do day-to-day. It is an effort that we began at Citi many years ago that has become core to who we are as a company and our daily worth as a bank. While our efforts will continue to evolve to reflect new global challenges, our commitment to transparency and accountability will remain constant. We will continue to share our progress and lessons learned, and we will continue to innovate and push to use our core capabilities, expertise and talent to lead by example and demonstrate how Citi is truly a bank with a brain and a soul.\n\nJANE FRASER\nChief Executive Officer\nESG at Citi\n\nAt Citi, our ESG agenda reflects the role and responsibility we feel as a global bank to help solve many of society\u2019s toughest challenges. It\u2019s a part of our business model, and embedded in the products and services we offer. As we continue to evolve our ESG priorities to address ever-changing realities around the world, we remain committed to sharing our progress \u2013 as we believe transparency and accountability are key to success.\n\n2021 Highlights\n\nFurthered the acceleration to a sustainable, low-carbon economy that supports the needs of society\n\n- Committed $1 trillion in sustainable finance by 2030, including $500 billion for environmental finance and $500 billion for social finance\n- Financed and facilitated $222 billion in sustainable finance activity in 2020 and 2021\n\nPlayed a leading role in driving the transition to net zero\n\n- Unveiled initial plan to reach net zero emissions by 2050, including 2030 targets for our Energy and Power loan portfolios\n- Co-founded the Net Zero Banking Alliance, which will help establish an industry framework for decarbonizing the banking sector\n\nMaximized positive social impact and advanced financial innovations in emerging markets\n\n- Issued a first-of-its-kind $1 billion social finance bond to expand access to essential services in emerging markets\n- Announced a new commitment, through which we aim to invest in opportunities for 15 million low-income households, including 10 million women, globally by 2025\n\nDeepened our efforts to help close the racial wealth gap and increase economic mobility in the U.S.\n\n- Invested $1 billion in strategic initiatives as part of Citi and the Citi Foundation\u2019s Action for Racial Equity commitment in year one of a three-year commitment\n- Launched the Diverse Financial Institutions Group to lead and expand firm-wide engagement with minority depository institutions, diverse broker-dealers and diverse asset managers\n- Worked exclusively with five Black-owned firms to syndicate a $2.5 billion bond issuance\n- Directed 68% of the Citi Impact Fund\u2019s 2021 asset allocation to women and/or racially/ethnically diverse founders of companies\n\nIncreased affordable housing in the U.S.\n\n- Provided $5.6 billion in loans for affordable housing projects in 2021, making Citi the largest U.S. affordable housing development lender for the 12th consecutive year\n\nContinued transparency around pay equity and increased diverse representation\n\n- Disclosed annual, public update on our pay equity review, highlighting progress on median pay for women globally and U.S. minorities\n- Exceeded our three-year representation goals set in 2018 to increase representation for women globally and for Black talent in the U.S.\n- Promoted one of the largest and most diverse Managing Director classes in recent years\nCiti\u2019s mission is to serve as a trusted partner to our clients by responsibly providing financial services that enable growth and economic progress. Our core activities are safeguarding assets, lending money, making payments and accessing the capital markets on behalf of our clients. We have over 200 years of experience helping our clients meet the world\u2019s toughest challenges and embrace its greatest opportunities. As an institution, Citi is connecting millions of people across hundreds of countries and cities.\n\nWe protect people\u2019s savings and help them make the purchases \u2013 from everyday transactions to buying a home \u2013 that improve the quality of their lives. We advise people on how to invest for future needs, such as their children\u2019s education and their own retirement, and help them buy securities such as stocks and bonds.\n\nWe work with companies to optimize their daily operations, whether they need working capital, to make payroll or to export their goods overseas. By lending to companies large and small, we help them grow, creating jobs and real economic value at home and in communities around the world. We provide financing and support to governments at all levels, so they can build sustainable infrastructure, such as housing, transportation, schools and other vital public works.\n\nWe have an obligation to act responsibly. We also know that acting responsibly and sustainably will help to drive value for our different stakeholders and for our company. If we fall short, we will take action and learn from our experience.\n\nWe strive to earn and maintain the public\u2019s trust by constantly adhering to the highest ethical standards. We ask our colleagues to ensure that their decisions pass three tests: They are in our clients\u2019 interests, create economic value, and are always systemically responsible. When we do these things well, we make a positive financial and social impact in the communities we serve and show what a global bank can do.\n\nCiti at a Glance\n\nUnparalleled global network that enables us to connect and do business in 95 countries\n\nIconic brand with 200+ years of experience\n\nSupporting clients in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions\n\nDigital and mobile at the core of a simpler, better client experience\n\nScaling efficiencies through common processes, common platforms and common data\n\nUnique presence in faster-growing emerging markets\nOur ESG Strategy\n\nThrough our business, we address some of society\u2019s greatest challenges. In recent years, we have continued to advance our leadership and partnerships across the industry as we further hone our environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategy and approach to managing ESG issues and opportunities.\n\nHelping to close the racial wealth gap in the United States ranks among our top priorities, and in 2021, we made tremendous progress on our Action for Racial Equity commitment, working across our businesses to identify ways we can help address the racial wealth gap. As of November 2021 \u2013 one year into our three-year commitment \u2013 Citi and the Citi Foundation had already invested $1 billion in strategic initiatives to help close the racial wealth gap and increase economic mobility in the United States. We committed to conduct a third-party racial equity audit to evaluate our Action for Racial Equity goals and launched the Diverse Financial Institutions Group, a centralized team within Citi that is serving as a hub to lead and expand firm-wide engagement with minority depository institutions (MDIs), diverse broker-dealers and diverse asset managers. Read more about our racial equity initiatives in the Equitable and Resilient Communities section.\n\nAdditionally in 2021, we announced two significant, new ESG commitments: a pledge to achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 and a commitment of $1 trillion in sustainable finance by 2030 to address the impacts of climate change and other pivotal environmental and social issues that align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These followed our most recent Sustainable Progress Strategy, which we launched one year earlier. Our ESG strategy is a central element of our business model and critical to our strategy for growth.\n\nTo help us achieve our $500 Billion Social Finance Goal, we broadened the focus of the Citi Social Finance team (formerly Citi Inclusive Finance) to develop platforms and client solutions to help expand financial inclusion, accelerate access to basic services, boost job creation and scale social infrastructure development in emerging markets.\n\nWe believe that global financial institutions like Citi have the opportunity \u2013 and the responsibility \u2013 to play a leading role in helping to drive the transition to a low-carbon economy. We are prepared to implement the significant changes needed in our business, and to support the substantial changes that will be required for the world to transition and align with the goals of the Paris Agreement.\nNet zero involves rethinking our business and helping our clients rethink theirs. We can have the biggest impact by reducing Scope 3 financed emissions, particularly for carbon-intensive sectors such as Agriculture, Aluminum, Cement, Coal, Commercial Real Estate, Iron and Steel, Oil and Gas, Power Generation and Transport. To reach our net zero target, we will need to work closely with our clients on their own transitions.\n\nFollowing our net zero announcement, we formed an internal Net Zero Task Force to help determine a framework, scope and the methodologies to guide our progress toward this commitment. For our Energy and Power loan portfolios, we conducted an initial assessment of baseline emissions, set interim 2030 emissions reduction targets, and developed initial transition plans. Learn more in the Climate Risk & Net Zero section and in our 2021 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Report: Citi\u2019s Approach to Climate Change and Net Zero.\n\nESG Across Our Business\n\nOur ESG focus is essential to our firm-wide business strategy, and many of our business units have expanded their capacity and capabilities to serve the growing ESG-related needs of our clients. Across the firm, our business units are prepared to support and work with our clients through sustainable finance, providing a variety of products and services with environmental and/or social themes.\n\nWe have ESG specialists in Banking, Capital Markets and Advisory; Global Markets; Treasury and Trade Solutions; and Citi Global Wealth. We have expanded our global Social Finance specialist group and formed new teams to engage with clients on ESG goals and targets. Together, these businesses contribute to our $1 trillion sustainable finance commitment.\n\nESG Principles and Guidelines\n\nIn response to the increasing need for clients to see how we are addressing ESG \u2013 and in step with global best practices \u2013 we have aligned our reporting with the frameworks and guidance of the Global Reporting Initiative and UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework. We are also using three relevant sector standards from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, and we\u2019re addressing the Principles for Responsible Banking. We also include examples of our work that align with the UN SDGs and the UN Global Compact. In addition, we recently released our 2021 TCFD Report, which further illustrates how climate-related risks and opportunities are central to our business.\n\n1. Financed emissions are the GHG emissions generated by the operations and entities that financial institutions lend money to or invest in.\nESG Governance at Citi\n\nGood governance is a fundamental principle at Citi, and we work to ensure that we are at the leading edge of best practices. We strive to maintain the highest standards of ethical conduct \u2013 reporting with accuracy and transparency and complying with the laws, rules and regulations that govern Citi\u2019s businesses.\n\nCorporate Governance\n\nOur governance structures, policies and processes serve employee, client and community needs; promote a culture of accountability and ethical conduct across our firm; and support our commitment to address global challenges through our core business.\n\nCiti\u2019s Board of Directors plays an important role in providing oversight of our efforts to ensure responsible business practices. For example, the Personnel and Compensation Committee reviews all compensation programs, including incentive compensation, so that they do not, among other things, encourage imprudent risk taking. The Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee (NGPAC) oversees Citi\u2019s global ESG activities and performance. Our Ethics, Conduct and Culture Committee reflects our commitment to promote a strong culture of ethical conduct. The Risk Management Committee also provides oversight of climate risk.\n\nStanding committees of our Board include:\n\n- Personnel and Compensation\n- Risk Management\n\nIn addition, the Board formed the Transformation Oversight Committee, an ad hoc committee to provide oversight of management\u2019s remediation of the issues identified in the consent orders with the Federal Reserve Board and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.\n\nSee our website for more information about Citi\u2019s corporate governance, including our Board committee charters. See our 2021 TCFD Report for details on our governance for climate change specifically.\n\nESG Governance\n\nThe NGPAC oversees our ESG activities. This committee\u2019s responsibilities include reviewing our policies and programs for sustainability, climate change, human rights, diversity and other material ESG issues, as well as advising on engagement with external stakeholders. For more information on the roles and responsibilities of this committee, see the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee charter.\n\nIn July 2021, we formed a new Global ESG Council to provide a senior management forum for oversight of our ESG commitments and ambition. The formation of the Council highlights our commitment to ESG matters, including our climate-related strategies, at the highest level of our organization. Chaired by our CEO, the Council meets on a near-monthly basis and includes members of the Executive Management Team as well as internal\nsubject matter experts. Steering groups, including the Climate Risk Steering Group, the Net Zero Task Force and Global Sustainability Steering Committee, continue to operate, and the leads of those steering groups are members of and provide reports to the Global ESG Council. Learn more in our 2021 TCFD Report.\n\nSustainability and Climate Change\n\nCiti\u2019s Board of Directors and senior management continue to expand the governance of climate risk and integrate climate considerations into their priorities. In 2021, in addition to the announcement of our net zero commitment and the creation of our new Global ESG Council, we accomplished the following:\n\n- Grew our dedicated Climate Risk team with additional expertise in credit risk, scenario analysis, stress testing and regulatory engagement\n- Rolled out our first training module on climate risk\n- Created the Natural Resources & Clean Energy Transition team to combine our Energy, Power and Chemicals businesses in order to assist our clients across these sectors as they transition\n- Established our Net Zero Task Force, a cross-functional group to support the development and launch of our net zero plan. The Task Force is led by our Chief Sustainability Officer and includes leaders from diverse business units such as Independent Risk Management; Banking, Capital Markets, and Advisory; Global Markets; Personal Banking & Wealth Management; as well as Global Public Affairs, Enterprise Operations & Technology, Legal and Finance.\n\nThe Board and senior management have also increased the frequency and depth of conversations regarding climate matters. Citi\u2019s Board has ultimate oversight of Citi\u2019s approaches to considering, evaluating and integrating climate-related risks and opportunities throughout the organization. The Board receives reports from key personnel on Citi\u2019s progress and key issues on a periodic basis. In addition to reporting to the full Board, the NGPAC provides oversight of sustainability activities and performance generally and the firm\u2019s climate change efforts specifically, and the Risk Management Committee (RMC) provides oversight of climate change risk.\n\nThe NGPAC receives periodic updates from Citi\u2019s Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) and the head of Community Investing and Development. The NGPAC also reviews Citi\u2019s governance and significant policies and programs for sustainability and climate change issues and advises management on our engagement with investors and external stakeholders on these topics. For more information on the roles and responsibilities of the NGPAC, please see our NGPAC Charter. The RMC provides oversight of Citi\u2019s Risk Management function and reviews Citi\u2019s risk policies and frameworks. For more information on the roles and responsibilities of this committee, please see our RMC Charter.\n\nIn 2020 into 2021, the NGPAC reviewed and discussed investor and market developments related to net zero, including a shareholder proposal pertaining to net zero, and considerations for Citi as it deliberated on the implications of a potential net zero commitment. These discussions continued with the full Board throughout 2021. During 2021, the full Board participated in a climate education session facilitated by the Head of Climate Risk, the CSO and the Head of Corporate Banking. The full Board received reports from the CSO regarding sustainability activities and performance, including those related to climate change and Citi\u2019s net zero plan, and the RMC received reports from the Head of Climate Risk regarding emerging bank regulatory trends on climate risk and Citi\u2019s approach to meeting them. Members of the Board also participated in investor calls on a variety of governance, climate risk and environmental and social matters.\n\nSenior managers from Global Public Affairs, Risk, Finance, Legal, Operations & Technology and various business units from our Institutional Clients Group also contribute expertise to address the challenges presented by climate change.\n\nLearn more in the Climate Risk section and in our 2021 TCFD Report.\n\nCommunity Investing\n\nCiti Community Investing and Development (CID) is an integrated team that works across Citi\u2019s businesses and functions to catalyze positive social impact in communities around the world.\n\nCID comprises the following teams:\n\n- Citi Impact Fund invests in \u201cdouble bottom line\u201d companies that are addressing societal challenges, including workforce development, sustainability, physical and social infrastructure, and financial inclusion.\n- Citi Social Finance works across Citi businesses globally to catalyze scalable business platforms and client solutions that enable the bank, our clients and our partners to expand financial inclusion, accelerate access to basic services, boost job creation and scale social infrastructure development in emerging markets.\n- U.S. Business Partnerships leads Citi\u2019s relationships with national civil rights and consumer protection organizations to gain insights into issues affecting low- and moderate-income communities and communities of color, and catalyze product and service innovations that help expand financial access and close the racial wealth gap.\nThe U.S. Community Relations team, which includes Citi Volunteers, catalyzes social impact by engaging and partnering with local community leaders and organizations across the country. The team connects Citi\u2019s people, expertise, resources, products and services to help expand equitable opportunities for all.\n\nThe Citi Foundation is a separate legal entity funded by Citi to organize flagship community programming in three areas: youth economic opportunities, financial inclusion and community solutions.\n\nUnderlying our approach is the notion that complex societal challenges require multifaceted solutions. We strive to share our expertise with, and learn from, our partners and stakeholders about ways we can enhance impact. This approach contributes directly to the UN Sustainable Development Goal SDG 17, which seeks to strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development. In particular, Citi\u2019s efforts contribute to target 17.3, which seeks to mobilize additional financial resources for developing countries from multiple sources, including the private sector, to ensure that sufficient financing is available to achieve the SDGs.\n\n**Talent and DEI**\n\nCiti\u2019s Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Officer and Global Head of Talent oversees our efforts to promote diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace. Reporting to the Global Head of Human Resources, the Chief DEI Officer and Global Head of Talent works in partnership with senior management, particularly members of the Executive Management Team, who co-chair our Affinity groups. Our talent and DEI efforts are governed by the Citi Board of Directors.\n\n**Ethics and Business Practices**\n\nEthics and responsible business practices are among the most material ESG issues for Citi and our stakeholders. The Ethics, Conduct and Culture Committee of the Board oversees management\u2019s efforts to foster a culture of ethics within the company and receives regular reports from senior management on the progress of those efforts. To learn more about the responsibilities of the committee, download the Ethics, Conduct and Culture Committee Charter. The Ethics and Culture section of this report also provides more information about efforts to encourage a culture of ethics at Citi.\n\nAmong its responsibilities, the Board\u2019s Risk Management Committee reviews Citi\u2019s risk appetite framework, including reputational risk appetite, and reviews and approves key risk policies, including those focused on environmental and social risk.\n\n**Remuneration**\n\nThe Personnel and Compensation Committee of the Board holds senior executives responsible, and in turn senior executives hold their team members responsible, for managing our sustainability and other ESG-related efforts through incentive compensation decisions. Citi\u2019s incentive compensation program is discretionary, not formulaic. Management of sustainability efforts is taken into account in the program in two ways. First, senior executives are held accountable for business performance through specific metrics designated on a position-by-position basis.\n\nProgress on our $1 trillion sustainable finance commitment and milestones for our net zero plan are incorporated into the executive scorecards of our CEO, the CEO of Citi\u2019s Institutional Clients Group and our Head of Global Public Affairs.\n\nSecond, climate change strategy and risk management performance goals are incorporated into annual goals and performance review processes for a number of our senior managers and their teams who are responsible for developing and implementing our approach to climate change. These managers include the Chief Sustainability Officer, Head of Environmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM), Head of Climate Risk and the Head of Construction and Sustainability, whose team is responsible for our environmental footprint goals. Corporate performance against scorecard metrics and individual performance against annual goals are two factors, among others, that are taken into account in determining incentive compensation.\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion, including representation of women and U.S. Black colleagues at the Assistant Vice President to Managing Director levels, continue to be included in scorecards for our senior executives. Citi also incorporates shareholder and stakeholder input on executive pay into our Compensation Philosophy.\nOur Material ESG Issues: Citi in a Global Context\n\nIn 2020, we conducted a materiality assessment to identify our most relevant (or \u201cmaterial\u201d) reporting topics from an ESG perspective \u2013 which is a broader standard than that used in our financial disclosures. These topics are incorporated in the material issues table on the next page.\n\nBased on internal stakeholder interviews and external research, the ESG topics identified, which we refer to as \u201cmaterial ESG issues\u201d throughout this report, inform which issues we report on, which issues we consider raising to our Board of Directors, and how we establish our ESG priorities.\n\nWhen taken as a set, the issues that surfaced in the ESG materiality analysis indicate an increase in stakeholder expectations, in particular with regard to issues connected to climate change and social justice. The pandemic also placed increased emphasis on employee health and well-being. Most of the material ESG issues outlined on the following pages are not new to Citi nor to our stakeholders. What is new, however, is the magnitude and complexity of the changes required to rise to these challenges. For example, there is wide recognition that climate change is happening faster and with more impact than previously realized; in parallel, society is reacting to unacceptable levels of social inequity.\n\nThis assessment mirrors \u2013 and informs \u2013 our increased strategic efforts on these issues. It has also driven our increased reporting on these material topics.\n## Material ESG Topics*\n\n| Material ESG Topics* | Key Stakeholders |\n|----------------------|------------------|\n|

furthering the acceleration to a sustainable, low-carbon economy that supports the environmental, social and economic needs of society.\n\nAs the world\u2019s most global bank, Citi has a role to play in mobilizing capital to advance progress toward the goals.\n\nCiti is part of the Global Investors for Sustainable Development (GISD) Alliance, which includes 30 of the world\u2019s largest investors committed to accelerating the financing of the SDGs. The 30 members have committed to increase our collective efforts to align our businesses with the goals and to remove barriers to finance. Since 2010, Citi has also been a member of the UN Global Compact (UNGC), a global corporate sustainability initiative to align companies\u2019 strategies and operations with principles on human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption, and take actions that advance societal goals. We report on our progress to implement the 10 UNGC principles.\n\nThese 17 interrelated Sustainable Development Goals represent an ambitious agenda to achieve a sustainable future by 2030. Some examples of our work to advance specific SDGs can be found throughout this report.\nStakeholder Engagement at Citi\n\nAs a signatory to the Business Roundtable\u2019s Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation, Citi is committed to ongoing and extensive engagement with our stakeholders. We subscribe to a broad stakeholder capitalism approach, believing that we are best able to create business value when we serve the interests of a wide array of stakeholders, including our shareholders. We made a deliberate effort to continue stakeholder engagement in a pandemic environment.\n\nTo fulfill this approach, we regularly review our stakeholder partnerships across a range of functions, including Public Affairs, Investor Relations, Human Resources and Corporate Governance, as well as Sustainability, Government Affairs and other teams in Public Affairs.\n\nThe table below includes examples of our recent stakeholder engagement efforts.\n\n### AMERICA\u2019S MOST JUST COMPANIES\n\nIn recognition of our ESG performance, Citi was named among the Top 15 companies in JUST Capital\u2019s 2022 rankings.\n\n| Stakeholder Group | How We Engage | Examples from 2021 |\n|-------------------|---------------|--------------------|\n| **Clients and Customers** | \u2022 Meetings to share Citi\u2019s ESG performance and to understand our clients\u2019 approaches to climate change as well as managing environmental and social risks  \n\u2022 Social media, including our Customer Service Twitter handle (@AskCiti)  \n\u2022 Customer satisfaction survey  \n\u2022 Citi Blog | \u2022 Hosted a feedback session for stakeholders including clients, investors and NGOs to provide commentary on our TCFD disclosures and our approach toward setting net zero targets and measuring our baseline emissions.

The ambitious $1 trillion commitment will support innovation and collective action toward addressing the most significant global challenges that are outlined in the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nAnnounced in April 2021, the $1 trillion commitment extended our previous environmental finance goal from $250 billion by 2025 to $500 billion by 2030. Through this commitment, we will finance and facilitate a wide array of climate solutions, such as renewable energy, clean technology, water conservation and sustainable transportation. We have also committed $500 billion toward activities in social finance, which includes important investments in education, affordable housing and basic infrastructure, health-care, economic inclusion and food security. Together, these $500 billion targets for environmental and social finance make up our $1 trillion commitment, which aims to further accelerate the transition to a sustainable, low-carbon economy that supports society\u2019s environmental, social and economic needs.\nOur $1 trillion sustainable finance commitment aims to further accelerate the transition to a sustainable, low-carbon economy that supports society\u2019s environmental, social and economic needs. The commitment aligns with the ambitious agenda of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As the world\u2019s most global bank, Citi has a role to play in mobilizing capital to advance progress toward the goals.\n\nAdditional data related to our $1 trillion commitment can be found later in this chapter.\nWe believe that setting ambitious goals helps to drive innovation and accelerate progress. Reaching $1 trillion will require the development of innovative financing solutions. We will continue to focus on helping clients across all sectors, no matter where they are in their own sustainability journeys, to support their strategic goals and enable the development and integration of sustainable business practices.\n\nOver recent years, we have seen the development of financial products that were relatively new, or even nonexistent, when we set our very first $50 billion climate finance goal in 2007. Thematic bonds, sustainable supply chain finance and sustainability-linked bonds and loans that are tied to ESG performance are contributing to sustainable finance, and we expect to see further innovations in the coming years.\n\n**Tracking Progress**\n\nEach transaction we finance or facilitate must meet at least one of eight criteria for environmental finance or one of seven criteria for social finance to be counted toward the overall $1 trillion commitment. These criteria were informed by external standards and may therefore be subject to changes as industry guidelines are further developed.\n\nCredit for each eligible transaction is counted only once toward the $1 trillion commitment, even if the transaction meets multiple criteria. Transactions that meet both environmental and social criteria are evenly split between the $500 Billion Environmental Finance Goal and the $500 Billion Social Finance Goal \u2014 without double counting. Because of the interconnected nature of sustainable finance, we are already seeing an increasing number of transactions with both environmental and social benefits.\n\nWe track our sustainable finance activities using third-party financial league table credit, where applicable. The industry league tables track public financial activities and rank financial institutions based on their role (i.e. lead arranger, bookrunner, etc.) in each transaction. For financial products for which there are no league tables, we count the amount that reflects Citi\u2019s financial involvement in the deal.\n\nBeyond counting the financial credit, we also calculate the estimated environmental and social impacts associated with a subset of activities where feasible, such as avoided greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy capacity added, jobs supported and people impacted. We take a conservative approach to the estimation of impacts from the activities we finance and facilitate \u2014 including only deal activity for which reasonable methodologies and data sources are available, and excluding deals for which we have limited transparency and details. We estimate that since 2020, approximately 3.9 million metric tons (mt) of greenhouse gas emissions have been avoided as a result of our renewable energy, green affordable housing and energy efficiency financing activities. Additionally, we estimate that our financing activities supported approximately 1.8 million jobs, affected 26 million people globally and contributed to approximately $9.5 billion in U.S. GDP. We consider impact measurement an area of ongoing education and improvement, and we will continue to challenge ourselves in this area.\n\n**Sustainable Finance in Action**\n\nThe global market for sustainable finance has been growing rapidly over the last few years in response to the climate emergency and COVID-19. Investors and companies alike recognize the pivotal role that the financial services sector will play in facilitating a socially responsible economic recovery that also accelerates the transition to a more sustainable, low-carbon economy.\n\nThe volume of sustainable debt issuances, for example, broke records in 2021, surpassing $1.6 trillion \u2014 more than double the $762 billion of sustainable\n\n---\n\n1. Bloomberg NEF (BNEF), 1H 2022 Sustainable Finance Market Outlook.\n2. https://www.refinitiv.com/perspectives/market-insights/sustainable-finance-continues-surge-in-2021/.\ndebt issuances in 2020, which itself had set records. The sustainable mergers and acquisitions deal activity reached $197 billion in 2021, which was a 60% increase from 2020 activity.\n\nGrowth also continues to be seen in the markets for sustainability-linked financing, one of the fastest-growing innovations in sustainable finance. Sustainability-linked instruments are general corporate purpose transactions that use key performance indicators (KPIs) and sustainability targets to measure a company\u2019s progress, which result in a reduced financing rate if the target is met or a penalty if the company fails to meet the target. With momentum gained in recent years, the growth of sustainability-linked financing extended to the global leveraged finance markets in 2021: sustainability-linked transaction volumes increased significantly across leveraged loan and high-yield bond issuances, highlighting the popularity of tying sustainability performance to cost of financing. This innovation is also expected to grow in the derivative markets, with sustainability-linked derivatives. Acknowledging this momentum in the market, we count sustainability-linked instruments toward Citi\u2019s sustainable finance goal when they incorporate sustainability key performance indicators and targets that are aligned with at least one of the goal criteria.\n\nThe growth of sustainable capital markets has also been driven by corporations, sovereigns and supranational institutions focused on achieving their sustainability commitments, contributing to the SDGs and aligning with the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nMany of our business units across the bank contribute to our $1 trillion commitment. There are global industry specialist teams that focus on different sectors and industries, such as the recently formed Natural Resources & Clean Energy Transition team, which engages with our clients to support their low-carbon transition efforts, as well as the Citi Social Finance team, which partners with business units across Citi to help drive innovative efforts on social finance activities in emerging markets. In many instances, the deals have integrated and interrelated environmental and social elements and impacts. For additional information on new teams we created or restructured over the last few years to engage with clients on their sustainability and transition journeys, see the Sustainable Progress section.\n\nThe following are just some examples of innovative environmental and social finance transactions from 2021 that will be counted toward the overall $1 trillion commitment.\n\n---\n\n**INCENTIVIZING SUPPLY CHAINS: McCormick & Company**\n\n**Sustainable Agriculture**\n\nIn 2021, Citi partnered with McCormick & Company, a global leader in flavor, and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to provide McCormick\u2019s suppliers with financial incentives linked to improvements in measures of social and environmental sustainability. McCormick\u2019s supply chain spans over 3,000 agricultural products sourced from more than 85 countries.\n\nUnder the initiative, suppliers can qualify for discounted rates on short-term working capital financing when they achieve sustainability standards accepted by McCormick. These standards include performance on labor conditions, health and safety practices, crop management, environmental impact, farmer resilience and women\u2019s empowerment. The partnership included an advisory component in Vietnam, where IFC is helping McCormick build a more sustainable, traceable, certified and quality-compliant pepper supply chain through capacity development and the empowerment of women farmers.\n\n---\n\n2.

Citi was the sole coordinator on a $75 million transaction to expand access to off-grid solar energy in Kenya. The financing will support Greenlight Planet\u2019s ambitions to reach an additional 10 million households in low-income, off-grid communities over the next five years.\n\nGreenlight Planet Kenya is a group company of Greenlight Planet Inc., a leading designer, distributor and financier of rooftop solar home systems for off-grid and weak-grid homes. Through its network of 200 branches and 8,000 field agents, Greenlight sells its Sun King-branded solar energy systems directly to its off-grid residential clients and provides \u201cpay-as-you-go\u201d financing to facilitate their purchase.\n\nTo date, the company\u2019s Sun King products have saved customers more than $4 billion cumulatively, which would otherwise be used to purchase CO\u2082-emitting kerosene lanterns and to charge mobile phones.\n\nLINKING LOANS TO SUSTAINABILITY METRICS\nDiversity & Equity\n\nThe investment firm BlackRock has been a vocal leader in encouraging companies to set and meet environmental and social sustainability goals. In 2021, BlackRock amended its $4.4 billion revolving credit agreement to incorporate certain sustainability-linked metrics.\n\nCiti acted as joint lead arranger and co-sustainability structuring agent for the 5-year sustainability-linked loan that ties BlackRock\u2019s borrowing costs to its ability to achieve certain targets for increased representation of women in leadership and higher representation of Black and Latinx employees in its U.S. workforce, as well as increasing sustainable assets under management. Pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement, BlackRock\u2019s applicable borrowing costs are subject to upward or downward adjustments on an annual basis if BlackRock achieves, or fails to achieve, certain specified targets. The facility reinforces BlackRock\u2019s commitment and accountability to achieving certain sustainability goals by integrating a component of financial alignment through its liquidity management strategy.\n\nEXPANDING ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA\nHealthcare\n\nmPharma is working to expand access to healthcare across low-income communities in sub-Saharan Africa. By optimizing supply chains and increasing efficiencies, mPharma is able to bring high-quality, affordable medicines to communities most in need \u2013 the so-called \u201clast mile\u201d of distribution for pharmaceuticals and vaccines. mPharma also provides financing solutions for mom-and-pop pharmacies, clinics and patients in underserved areas such as Ghana, Nigeria, Zambia and Kenya.\n\nThanks to a line of credit from Citi under Scaling Enterprise, a partnership with the U.S. DFC and the Ford Foundation, mPharma will be able to serve more than 2 million patients in the countries where it operates. Health clinics that operate with mPharma report a decrease of up to 25% in medical-related complications.\nEMPOWERING WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN MEXICO\nEconomic Inclusion and Diversity & Equity\n\nWomen represent one-third of entrepreneurs in Mexico, yet they typically have few opportunities to access financial investments for their businesses. In 2021, Citi partnered with the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to provide $70 million to Banco Compartamos, the largest microfinance institution in Mexico.\n\nCompartamos, which translates to \u201clet\u2019s share\u201d in Spanish, is using the funding to support and empower more than 135,000 small businesses, approximately 90% of them women-owned. A portion of the loans is dedicated to the less developed regions of the country, including Chiapas, Oaxaca, Guerrero and Puebla. Learn more in this video.\n\nSUPPORTING COVID-19 RESILIENCE THROUGH UNICEF\nHealthcare\n\nThe global pandemic has exacerbated poverty rates and global inequality, affecting millions of children worldwide. The World Bank and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) were looking for new ways to accelerate funding to meet the increasingly urgent needs for their joint pandemic relief programs.\n\nCiti acted as sole structure and arranger for a first-of-its kind $100 million bond transaction from the World Bank\u2019s International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which allowed UNICEF to access capital markets funding to support its private sector fundraising activities. The bond gave institutional and high net worth investors an opportunity to support UNICEF\u2019s work with children, including COVID-19 resilience programs around the world. The cash flows on the bond are linked to future donations to UNICEF.\n\nThe bond proceeds will support two programs: $50 million will be used by the World Bank to finance its sustainable development programs, including projects targeting the health and socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19; the other $50 million will be allocated to UNICEF to expand programs in 18 countries, targeting future funding of up to $450 million.\n\nDEVELOPING MORE SUSTAINABLE RAIL LINES\nSustainable Transportation\n\nThe development of a 25-kilometer monorail line is one of the largest construction projects in Panama since the expansion of the Panama Canal. Citi acted as sole global coordinator and mandated lead arranger for $2 billion in green loans for the Panama Metro project on behalf of a consortium of Korean companies led by Hyundai Engineering & Construction.\n\nThe elevated train line will have initial capacity to transport 18,000 passengers per hour in each direction, with an ultimate goal of more than 30,000 passengers per hour in each direction. The monorail will incorporate Hitachi\u2019s B-CHOP system, which harnesses the train\u2019s regenerative energy to substantially reduce energy consumption while the train is in braking mode. The system is expected to cut back 20,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually while providing energy for future use.\nFINANCING RENEWABLE ENERGY WHILE INCREASING DIVERSITY\n\nRenewable Energy and Diversity & Equity\n\nIn November, Citi provided AES\u2019 Clean Energy business, a leading renewables development platform in the United States, with financing to fund the construction and operation of the Skipjack Solar Project outside Richmond, Virginia. The project is expected to provide 225 megawatts-DC (175 megawatts-AC) of renewable energy capacity; once online, the project will sell 100% of its solar energy output under a 14-year, fixed-price agreement to one of the largest power generator companies in the U.S.\n\nThe transaction also included a milestone: Citi\u2019s first execution of a sustainability-linked derivative for a construction project \u2013 a KPI-linked interest rate swap to support the financing of the project. Under the terms, AES commits to achieving key performance indicators linked to increasing gender diversity measured by employees who self-identify as female or nonbinary employees and increasing new hire employees who self-identify as members of an underrepresented group.\n\nCiti acted as coordinating lead arranger, lender, and swap syndication arranger on this transaction, providing a comprehensive financing package for AES, a company that is focused on accelerating the future of energy, together.\n\nSTRUCTURING A GREEN HYBRID BOND\n\nClean Technology\n\nCiti helped German chemicals company Evonik Industries, one of the world leaders in specialty chemicals, issue a \u20ac500 million green hybrid bond in 2021 \u2013 acting as sole green structuring advisor, joint structuring agent, joint global coordinator and joint bookrunner on the transaction.\n\nThe corporate hybrid bond structure can be attractive to issuers, particularly in Europe, that are looking for a stronger credit profile or financial flexibility. The green issuance followed the publication of Evonik\u2019s Green Finance Framework, which integrates sustainability into the company\u2019s financial strategy. Under the framework, proceeds from green financing instruments may be used for eligible projects in the areas of eco-efficient products, energy efficiency and renewable energy.\n\nProceeds of this green hybrid bond issuance will primarily be used to finance investments in Evonik\u2019s Next Generation Solutions \u2013 products and solutions with sustainability benefits that Evonik expects to grow significantly in the coming years.\n## $1 Trillion Sustainable Finance Commitment\n\n### Financial Data*\n\nIn billions USD\n\n| Sustainable Finance                  | 2020** | 2021  | $     | %

To estimate the environmental and social impacts of Citi-financed projects and activities we looked at the following metrics:\n\n- **Avoided GHG emissions** refers to the amount of GHG emissions avoided because of Citi\u2019s share of financing for renewable energy, green affordable housing and energy efficiency projects. GHG emissions avoidance is calculated by applying regional electric grid factors to Citi\u2019s share of financing across three types of activities, including a low-carbon source replacing energy use from the grid, energy efficiency upgrades and green housing units that are LEED-certified. Impacts reflect the per annum benefit as opposed to benefit over entire project life.\n\n  - For renewable energy projects, total project capacity for energy is calculated as the annual capacity factor applied to the total project size per annum and multiplied by the CO\u2082 emissions factor.\n  \n  - For energy efficiency upgrades, the average household energy savings is calculated as the average household energy use multiplied by the percentage of energy savings per thousand U.S. dollars invested. The result is multiplied by the total warehouse value and the CO\u2082 emissions factor.\n\u2022 For green buildings, the average household energy savings is equal to the average energy use of a non-LEED-certified building multiplied by the percentage of energy savings by a LEED-certified building. The result is multiplied by the number of square feet and the per square feet CO\u2082 emission factor.\n\n\u2022 **Renewable energy capacity added** refers to the size of new renewable energy capacity installed as a result of Citi\u2019s share of renewable energy project financings.\n\n\u2022 **People impacted** refers to the direct number of people benefiting from the use of Citi-financed lending activities for small businesses, renewable energy and energy efficiency projects, affordable housing, and underwritten municipal bond proceeds for transit, water and education projects.\n  \n  \u2022 For microfinance lending activities, people impacted is equivalent to the number of entrepreneurs and small farm holders receiving business loans as self-reported by Citi teams.\n  \n  \u2022 For renewable energy projects and energy efficiency finance, people impacted is equivalent to the number of people whose annual energy usage is supplied by the project. Estimated renewable energy generation annually due to Citi financing is divided by average energy consumption per capita in the country of the project to estimate number of people impacted.\n  \n  \u2022 For affordable housing, the number of people impacted is calculated using external reference data on average household size multiplied by the number of housing units constructed.\n  \n  \u2022 For municipal bond financing related to education projects, people impacted is estimated as the number of enrolled school children benefiting from new or repaired school buildings or purchases of equipment. External education data on average student enrollment by school, and the number of schools benefiting from funding as stated in issuance documents, was used for this calculation.\n\n\u2022 **Direct jobs supported** refers to the number of jobs supported by the uses of Citi-financed lending or underwritten municipal bond proceeds. Jobs supported are related to Citi\u2019s share of new financing for the projects. For microfinance lending, jobs supported are equal to the number of entrepreneurs and smallholder farmers that received loans. For projects involving new construction or maintenance and repair of affordable housing units, renewable energy generation, schools, transit or water systems in the United States, jobs supported are calculated as Citi-financed expenditures divided by output per worker supplied by the IMPLAN economic modeling system. For projects involving renewable energy generation in locations outside the United States, external data is used to estimate the share of project cost involving installation (labor), and this is divided by average compensation of workers in the country to estimate jobs supported.\nSustainable Progress\n\nIn This Section\n\n33 Financing the Low-Carbon Transition\n37 Climate Risk and Net Zero\n50 Sustainable Operations\nThe climate crisis has created not just an opportunity to lead \u2013 but an opportunity to partner: working with our clients to decarbonize their businesses as part of our journey to net zero.\n\nThe science is clear, as is the need to move urgently toward a low-carbon economy. The financial sector has a critical role to play in supporting other industries to reduce their environmental impacts and transition their business models in line with what is needed to keep global warming to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nOur Sustainable Progress Strategy builds on our decades-long track record in sustainability and environmental finance. To drive the transition to a low-carbon economy, we are drawing on our expertise, expanding our business unit capabilities and deepening our engagement with the carbon-intensive sectors that are of highest priority for transformation.\n\nThe strategy, which is integrated into our Environmental and Social Policy Framework, focuses on three areas: financing the low-carbon transition, deepening climate risk assessment and disclosure, and reducing the environmental impacts of our own operations. The environmental finance transactions that count toward our $1 trillion commitment to sustainable finance, which also includes a commitment to social finance, illustrate how Citi is contributing to the low-carbon transition.\n\nOne year after setting our Sustainable Progress Strategy, we took an important next step on the path toward a low-carbon future, pledging to achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for our financing (by 2050) and for our operations (by 2030).\n\n---\n\n**Sustainable Progress Strategy**\n\n**Low-Carbon Transition**\n\nAccelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy\n\nFinance and facilitate low-carbon solutions and support our clients in their decarbonization and transition strategies\n\n**Climate Risk**\n\nMeasure, manage and reduce the climate risk and impact of our client portfolio\n\nContinue our work on policy development, portfolio analysis and stakeholder engagement, as well as enhancing our TCFD implementation and disclosure\n\n**Sustainable Operations**\n\nReduce the environmental footprint of our facilities and strengthen our sustainability culture\n\nMinimize the impact of our global operations through operational footprint goals and further integrate sustainable practices across the company\nCiti's Sustainability Journey\n\nCiti has been engaging in sustainability and environmental initiatives for more than 20 years, and we continue to advance our leadership and partnerships across the industry.\n\n- **1997**: Joined the UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI)\n- **2000**: Published first Global Citizenship Report\n- **2003**: Structured first securitization of microfinance assets in the world\n- **2006**: Issued world\u2019s first local investment-grade microfinance bond\n- **2007**: First U.S. bank to publish Statement on Human Rights\n- **2008**: First U.S. bank to set CO\u2082 reduction target\n- **2010**: Launched 10-year $50B Climate Initiative\n- **2014**: Participated in the first-ever global IPO in microfinance\n- **2015**: Launched original Sustainable Progress Strategy and $100B Environmental Finance Goal\n- **2016**: Co-created The Green Bond Principles\n- **2017**: Commenced 2020 (3rd generation) environmental footprint goals\n- **2018**: Announced 100% renewable electricity by 2020 goal\n- **2019**: Issued inaugural \u20ac1B green bond\n- **2020**: Launched Action for Racial Equity $1B commitment\n- **2021**: Published 2021 TCFD Report, which includes our initial Net Zero by 2050 Plan, and 2030 interim targets for Energy and Power loan portfolios\n- **2022**: Co-founded the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA)\n\nCITI 2021 ESG REPORT\nFinancing the Low-Carbon Transition\n\nOne of the core elements of our Sustainable Progress Strategy is our commitment to finance and facilitate activities that accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. We doubled our previous commitment of $250 billion by 2025 and set an ambitious $1 trillion sustainable finance commitment by 2030 \u2014 half for environmental finance and half for social finance.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just about financing and facilitating transactions. Working collaboratively with our clients in decarbonizing and helping them in their transitions is a central focus of our net zero plan. We believe systemic collaboration is essential for the global economy to reach net zero emissions. We are already engaging with numerous clients with respect to their climate exposure profile. We intend to deepen our engagement with them to understand their transition plans in greater detail as those plans evolve and help them in their strategies to realize opportunities inherent in transitioning to a low-carbon world.\n\nTransforming Our Business to Support a Low-Carbon Economy\n\nClimate change has become a C-suite issue for clients in all sectors of the global economy, in terms of growth opportunities and risk management, and ESG considerations are increasingly part of our business conversations. To support client needs, we have expanded our client engagement offerings across our business to offer strategic sustainability and ESG services and solutions.\n\nOur business groups are focused on helping clients in all sectors, no matter where they are in their own sustainability journeys. We offer customized products and services to support clients in their transition to more sustainable business models and practices that will advance progress toward a low-carbon future.\n\nWithin Banking, Capital Markets and Advisory (BCMA), sustainability and ESG is being integrated into our businesses and client engagements. We engage with C-suite executives, boards of directors and treasury teams on strategic financing using a sustainability lens, providing insights about industry transformations, trends and sustainability risks and opportunities.\n\nIn early 2021, we created the Natural Resources & Clean Energy Transition (NRCET) team to drive client engagement efforts in the Energy, Power and Chemicals sectors. This team unites seasoned corporate and investment bankers with deep knowledge of these sectors under a single umbrella to assist our clients with the net\nzero transition. Our Sustainability and Corporate Transitions (SCT) team, founded in 2020, also engages with clients at the C-suite and senior levels across sectors to support the transition of their business models to a sustainable and low-carbon future, helping them identify their ESG challenges and opportunities to shape their strategy.\n\nIn 2021, Citi served as the exclusive financial advisor to South Korean conglomerate SK Holdings in a transaction noted as the largest investment ever in the hydrogen fuel cell space. The $1.6 billion deal gave SK Group a 9.9% stake in Plug Power Inc., a leading provider of hydrogen fuel cell and green hydrogen generation systems in North America. The two companies entered into a strategic partnership to provide hydrogen fuel cell systems, hydrogen fueling stations and electrolysers to the Korean and broader Asian markets in order to accelerate hydrogen as an alternative clean energy source throughout Asia.\n\nSouth Korea is one of the most important and developed markets for hydrogen. The government has set a roadmap with ambitious goals to build a hydrogen-based economy by 2040.\n\nAlso in BCMA, our Sustainable Debt Capital Markets (Sustainable DCM) team has technical expertise on green, social and sustainability bonds as well as sustainability-linked bonds (SLB), and works within debt capital markets and with industry bankers to originate and structure issuances for these types of bonds on behalf of clients around the world. The Sustainable DCM team also advises Citi Treasury on Citi\u2019s own sustainable debt issuance programs.\n\nThe Sustainable DCM team has helped numerous clients globally structure innovative sustainability-linked bonds (SLB) tied to sustainability goals. Such bonds are an example of KPI-linked instruments that commit the issuer or borrower to specific sustainability objectives, such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction or other key performance indicators (KPIs).\n\nCiti acted as SLB Structuring Advisor and Active Bookrunner on Johnson Controls International (JCI)\u2019s inaugural $500 million SLB in September 2021. As part of this transaction, JCI committed to (i) reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 35% and (ii) reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions from the use of sold products by 5%, all by 2025 from a 2017 baseline, supporting JCI\u2019s long-term net zero emissions by 2040 target. Failure to achieve these targets will result in a 25 basis point coupon step-up. JCI was also the first S&P 500 company to publish an integrated sustainable finance framework encompassing both use-of-proceeds bonds (green, social or sustainability) and sustainability-linked bonds, allowing JCI to issue any/all sustainable financing instruments.\n\nIn another first, Citi client Tesco became the first UK corporate and the first retailer globally to launch a SLB tied to ambitious GHG emissions reduction targets in January 2021. As the largest retailer in the United Kingdom, Tesco PLC has the ability to make a significant impact on the path to a low-carbon future. Tesco is aiming to become carbon neutral across its own operations by 2035 and\nnet zero across the value chain by 2050. Citi acted as structuring advisor and active bookrunner on the \u20ac750 million SLB. As part of this bond issuance, Tesco agreed to cut its Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 60% by 2025, relative to a 2015 baseline. Failure to achieve this target in Tesco\u2019s 2025 financial year will result in a 25 basis point step-up in the coupon in 2027, 2028 and 2029, reinforcing Tesco\u2019s climate commitments to both external and internal stakeholders.\n\nAlso in 2021, Citi served as sole structuring advisor and lead left bookrunner for a $2.8 billion green bond offering for Ardagh Metal Packaging, a global leader in sustainable aluminum packaging solutions. The offering was the largest-ever high-yield green bond completed to date. Ardagh has published a Green Financing Framework that provides details on the eligible use of proceeds.\n\nIn our Global Markets business, we recently established a dedicated ESG team to support our client engagement through the integration of strategic sustainability and ESG services and solutions. Global Markets provides clients with ESG thought leadership about trends, market evolution, themes, integration and data-driven analysis. We aim to lead our clients through the rapidly evolving landscape of ESG by partnering with clients to develop new solutions across fixed-income, securitized products, multi-asset strategies and sustainable real assets, in addition to our full range of solutions in equities. Using our strengths in primary issuance and secondary trading, we support the development of deep, liquid and efficient sustainable markets. Citi is also able to address origination and financing gaps for clean energy and energy-efficiency project developers and investors by working across banking, advisory, origination and markets teams for optimal client solutions.\n\nOur Clean Energy Finance group, for example, has expertise in providing full-service financing solutions for a broad spectrum of renewable energy technologies, serving as a one-stop shop for our clients, as well as financing to help clients implement energy efficiency projects.\n\nCiti Global Wealth, through its Investing with Purpose approach, offers managed opportunities, alternative investments and tailored exposure to capital markets to help clients pursue their sustainable investment objectives. As clients have been increasingly concerned with the impact their investments may have on society and the environment, the direction of sustainable investing is evolving past socially responsible investing, and Citi Global Wealth has updated its offerings to meet this growing area of client demand. The Investing with Purpose platform provides opportunities for private clients to invest alongside Citi\u2019s institutional clients. Multiple Citi Global Wealth clients have participated in differentiated capital markets solutions supporting the global green energy transition, an investment thesis reaffirmed by our investment strategy team. As the world goes greener, the opportunities for Citi Global Wealth investors are likely to multiply over the coming years, enabling us to build entire core and opportunistic allocations that reflect sustainable principles \u2013 a process we might describe as \u201cgreening your portfolio.\u201d\n\nOur Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS) business provides financing and cash management solutions to clients across the globe.\n\nWe have established a global, cross-functional ESG working group to develop holistic sustainable working capital, investment and cash management solutions. These include, but are not limited to, Sustainable Supply Chain Finance, Sustainable Trade and Working Capital Loans and Sustainable Deposits, as well as Money Market Funds with ESG principles embedded. Through\nour Export Agency Finance business, we enhance our clients\u2019 ability to access capital in higher risk markets by delivering financial solutions in partnership with Development Finance Intuitions, Export Credit Agencies and Multilateral Agencies designed to improve risk capacity. Read about the Panama Metro project and the Banco Compartamos project.\n\nIn November, we launched our first Sustainable Supply Chain Finance (SSCF) program in Asia Pacific with the aim of supporting clients as they advance their ESG priorities, improve the resilience of their supply chains and manage working capital needs. The program was implemented for Henkel, the German chemical and consumer goods company, and is targeted at existing or new suppliers that demonstrate strong or improving sustainability performance. Qualifying suppliers can access Citi\u2019s supply chain financing at preferential rates on a tiered basis, with rates improving as a supplier\u2019s sustainability score improves. Henkel, with the support of a global leading sustainability assessment agency, will assess the sustainability performance of suppliers.\n\nTTS\u2019s Liquidity Management Services support treasuries\u2019 goals with various cash investment products that have incorporated sustainability principles. Clients can invest their excess cash with Money Market Funds that have incorporated ESG principles. In December, we expanded our innovative Green Minimum Maturity Time Deposit, a sustainable cash investment product that gives clients the ability to invest their short-term liquidity in environmentally friendly projects. Investments in Citi\u2019s green deposits or new Green Minimum Time Deposits will be allocated to finance or refinance a portfolio of green projects that meet the rigorous environmental finance eligibility criteria defined in our Green Bond Framework. The new product also gives clients greater flexibility to extend the investment period.\n\nClimate and Biodiversity\n\nWe are continuing to learn about the complex dynamics between climate and biodiversity. These two topics are deeply interconnected, and there is an increasing awareness that climate change, along with other human-caused stresses on natural systems, is contributing to biodiversity loss and ongoing extinction events. \u201cNatural capital\u201d is a way to conceptualize the various resources and services that are provided by resilient ecosystems. This concept helps to inform the increasing focus on biodiversity, its impact on climate and the importance of disclosure.\n\nA recent Citi Global Perspectives & Solutions (GPS) report: Biodiversity: The Ecosystem at the Heart of Business explores why businesses and investors should care about biodiversity loss. The report explains that businesses rely on nature for their products and ecosystem services such as clean air, water, pollination and carbon sequestration. At the same time, their operations create direct and indirect impacts on nature that can, and often do, negatively affect their business. By failing to understand the dependencies and impacts on nature and biodiversity, companies open themselves up to biodiversity risk that could affect the profitability of their businesses. This in turn poses risks to their investors.\n\nThere is a growing realization that we are losing biodiversity at an alarming rate. This requires urgent action that is complementary to climate action. Global wildlife populations have fallen an average of 68% in just 46 years, and human activities threaten 1 million animal and plant species with extinction. At the same time, there is a financing gap of $598 billion to $824 billion per year for broad action on biodiversity, suggesting significant business opportunities. Additionally, nature-positive solutions can create $10 trillion in business opportunities and 395 million new jobs by 2030. These solutions could deliver up to 37% of CO\u2082 emission reductions by 2030.\n\nTo support our understanding and action on biodiversity, we are also a member of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) Forum, a global and multidisciplinary consultative network of institutional supporters who share the vision and mission of the TNFD.

This means that as we address and mitigate risks, we must take into account how we will protect and strengthen our business while ensuring that our clients become part of the solutions that are needed to transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nWe prioritize regular reporting about our progress and approach in relation to climate risk, as we believe transparently sharing our journey is an important contribution we can make both to the broader industry and to our clients. Citi has disclosed climate-related metrics and targets for our environmental finance activities and our operations for well over a decade, and we released our first Climate Change Position Statement in 2007. Since then, our commitment to this issue has only grown, as evidenced by our strategic approach, alignment with global standards and the continued evolution of our Environmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM) Policy in response to the changing risk landscape.\n\nFirst established in 2003, our ESRM Policy applies to all Citi entities globally and provides a framework for how we identify, mitigate and manage the potential risk to Citi associated with the environmental and social risks of our clients\u2019 activities. It guides our financing decisions for companies and projects within environmentally sensitive and/or high-carbon sectors. It also provides us with opportunities to advise our clients on climate-related risks. To learn more about our ESRM Policy and related due diligence, see the Environmental and Social Risk Management section.\n\nIn addition to establishing internal policies and practices, we also align with external standards to strengthen our processes, reporting and engagement.\n\nWe have supported the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) since they were released in 2017. Our objective is to understand the potential financial risks from climate change to Citi, our clients and communities; how Citi and our clients may be contributing to climate change; and how we can help our clients transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nFind out more about our implementation of the TCFD recommendations in our 2021 TCFD Report. In addition, this ESG Report includes a TCFD index indicating where climate-related content in response to TCFD recommendations can be found throughout this report and other public documentation.\n\nPARTICIPATION IN NET ZERO FRAMEWORKS\n\nCiti is a member of multiple industry groups that enhance our understanding of \u2014 and ability to act on \u2014 climate-related issues. These groups include the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF), the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ). Learn more about these in our 2021 TCFD Report.\nOur Net Zero Commitment\n\nIn 2021, we announced our commitment to net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, in alignment with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and prevailing climate science. Reducing Scope 3 financed emissions is widely recognized as the most significant contribution the financial industry can have to achieving a low-carbon economy. Our commitment will include interim financed emissions reduction targets for carbon-intensive sectors, as described by the UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) Guidelines for Climate Target Setting for Banks. To date, we have set 2030 emissions targets for our Energy and Power loan portfolios.\n\nFor our own operations, we are targeting net zero GHG emissions by 2030, which builds on our environmental footprint goals and the 100% renewable electricity goal that we achieved in 2020. (Learn more in the Sustainable Operations section.)\n\nThe approach and activities related to our net zero commitment are distinct from our management of climate risk for our firm. While our net zero commitment is keenly focused on Citi\u2019s impacts on the climate and reducing GHG emissions to net zero across our value chain, our climate risk management efforts are focused on Citi\u2019s safety and soundness, and thus on the integration of climate risk into our risk management governance, processes and strategies. Although these two priorities differ in their primary focus, they are related to and reinforce each other, leading to mutual benefits. As we execute on our net zero commitment, the resulting reduction in financed emissions will help to reduce our climate transition risk.\n\nCiti\u2019s net zero ambition builds on our commitment to the UNEP FI Principles for Responsible Banking, our leadership in climate disclosure in alignment with the TCFD and our ESRM Policy \u2013 specifically our Sector Approaches related to fossil fuels. Transparency and accountability are keys to success, and we will report annually on our net zero progress.\n\nOur commitment to net zero is significant, given the size and breadth of our portfolios and businesses. To achieve it, we must meet our clients where they are in their sustainability journeys and help accelerate their progress in this area. We will work with all our clients, including our fossil fuel clients, to develop credible plans that include the responsible retirement of carbon-intensive assets as we transition to net zero together. We will prioritize partnering with clients on transition strategies, and exiting client relationships is a last resort.\n\nBanks are facing growing pressure to divest from fossil fuels. In some instances, such as thermal coal mining, where there is credit risk from stranded assets in addition to climate risk, we have already established a transparent time frame for our transition expectations. However, we are cognizant that large-scale, rapid divestment could result in an abrupt and disorderly transition to a low-carbon economy, creating both economic and social upheaval on a global scale. For example, certain carbon-intensive companies may play critical roles in channeling the necessary capital expenditures and providing the raw materials to support new climate technologies or may provide necessary baseload power for developing countries.\n\nAn orderly, responsible and equitable transition, which accounts for the immediate economic needs of communities and workers as well as environmental justice and broader economic development concerns, is essential to retaining political and social support for the shift to a low-carbon economy. Under the goals of our net zero plan, we seek to balance these needs to facilitate this complex transition.\n\nInitial Net Zero Plan\n\nWe released our initial net zero plans for our Energy and Power loan portfolios in our 2021 TCFD Report. The plans for these portfolios build upon the calculation of our financed emissions and the setting of interim 2030 emissions reduction targets for these sectors. Our net zero plan incorporates a twofold approach: assessment of our clients\u2019 climate profiles and engagement to understand their transition opportunities. Additionally, we will employ a number of tools, phased in over time, to help move these portfolios toward our 2030 targets. Underlying the implementation of this plan is Citi\u2019s continued effort to expand our climate-related resources and engage directly with our clients.\n\n1. Financed emissions are the GHG emissions generated by the operations and entities that financial institutions lend money to or invest in.\nConsiderations for Loan Portfolio Assessments\n\nEnergy and Power Sectors\n\nThe first step of our net zero plan involves engagement, client by client, to understand each client\u2019s GHG emissions disclosure and their perspective and plans for transition. Additionally, we will review public disclosures, climate governance and the commitments and actions they have taken to date. We anticipate that this initial review phase will continue through the end of 2023. In the following table, we highlight some of the key considerations that will frame client engagement.\n\n| GHG Emissions Public Disclosure | Scopes 1 & 2 (absolute emissions & physical intensity) |\n|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                | Scope 3                                               |\n|                                | Baseline year                                         |\n|                                | Status of data verification                            |\n\n| GHG Emissions Reduction Targets | Net zero commitment or science-based targets |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n|                                | GHG emissions reduction targets              |\n|                                | Methane reduction targets                    |\n|                                | Flaring reduction/phase-out targets          |\n\n| Climate Risk Scoring | Transition risk assessment |\n|----------------------|---------------------------|\n|                      | Physical risk assessment  |\n\n| Decarbonization/Transition Plan | Scope 1 decarbonization plan |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                                 | Scope 2 decarbonization plan |\n|                                 | Evolution of energy sources  |\n|                                 | Product diversification and Scope 3 reduction |\n|                                 | Capital allocation           |\n|                                 | Governance \u2013 accountability, compensation links |\n\n| Client Asset Evaluation | Existing generation assets (carbon intensity analysis) |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n|                         | Existing reserves and assets                          |\n|                         | Comparative economics of assets                       |\n|                         | Carbon-intensive asset retirement schedule            |\n|                         | Resilience risks                                      |\n\n| External Climate Scores | PACTA Score |\n|-------------------------|-------------|\n|                         | CA 100+ Score|\n|                         | World Benchmarking Alliance                          |\n|                         | Carbon Tracker Initiative                            |\n|                         | Transition Pathways Initiative                       |\n\n| Other Data | Sustainable development factors |\n|------------|--------------------------------|\n|            | Country/regional regulatory environment |\nAchieving Our Targets\n\nWe will use a variety of approaches, many of which will run concurrently, to reach our financed emissions reduction targets for our Energy and Power loan portfolios. For further detail on these five areas of activity, refer to our 2021 TCFD Report.\n\nClient Transition Assessment, Advisory and Finance\n- Client engagement and assessment\n- Transition advisory and finance, including debt and equity underwriting and lending\n\nClean Tech Finance\n- Support existing and new clean technologies to accelerate commercialization\n\nPublic Policy Engagement\n- Support enabling public policy and regulation in the United States and other countries, including through trade associations and other industry groups\n\nRisk Management\n- Dimension climate risk exposure across our lending portfolios and review client carbon reduction progress\n- Ongoing review and refinement of ESRM Policy\n\nPortfolio Management\n- Active portfolio management to align with net zero targets, including considerations of transition measures taken by clients\n\nWhile our transition plans for each loan portfolio will be based on a rigorous net zero methodology, we are still in the early stages of plotting our net zero journey. We expect to modify our transition plans and targets as both the availability and quality of data improve and as climate scenarios are updated. We also recognize that there will be uneven year-on-year progress toward our 2030 targets, because clients and sectors differ in their capacity to transition and in the time frames in which their carbon reduction investments will be realized.\nEnergy and Power Baseline Emissions and Interim Targets\n\nDuring 2021, we used the PCAF methodology to conduct an analysis of our Energy and Power portfolios using 2020 data. In alignment with PCAF requirements, this analysis is based on funds outstanding (drawn and not yet repaid) by clients during the year to provide a view of financed emissions associated with our activities during that year.\n\n### 2020 Absolute Financed Emissions: Outstanding Exposure (MT CO\u2082E)\n\n| Scope   | Power       | Energy       |\n|---------|-------------|--------------|\n| Scope 1 | 4,261,747   | 17,308,063   |\n| Scope 2 | 164,059     | 518,594      |\n| Scope 3 | N/A**       | 40,113,950***|\n| Total   | 4,425,806   | 57,940,607   |\n\n* mt CO\u2082E = metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.\n** Omission of Scope 3 emissions for Power is explained in the \u201cScope 3 Calculation Methodology\u201d in Appendix A (page 71) of our 2021 TCFD Report.\n*** Scope 3, Category II: Use of Sold Product, for extractive and refining sectors.\n\nThe PCAF methodology is primarily focused on reporting financed emissions on an annual basis and relies on data of funds outstanding, not the total funds that a financial institution may have committed to the client in the reporting year. While we intend to continue disclosing per the PCAF requirements to provide this annual view of financed emissions associated with our activities, we are using \u201ccommitted funds\u201d data to more holistically attribute our clients\u2019 emissions for the baseline financed emissions figures in our net zero plan. Consequently, we undertook an additional analysis of our Energy and Power loan portfolios using total committed funds to calculate baseline emissions from 2020 and establish 2030 emission targets. The use of committed funds in this context provides a more accurate reflection of the maximum emissions-generating activity that Citi has agreed to finance and is therefore better suited for the purposes of forward-looking emissions management and target setting. This approach results in discrepancies between the metrics we report for PCAF and for our net zero targets, but we believe the committed funds approach is better aligned with the way we expect to manage our net zero targets.\n\n### 2020 Absolute Financed Emissions: Committed Exposure (MT CO\u2082E)\n\n| Scope   | Power       | Energy       |\n|---------|-------------|--------------|\n| Scope 1 | 11,464,654  | 33,847,434   |\n| Scope 2 | 485,784     | 1,434,241    |\n| Scope 3 | N/A*        | 108,478,743  |\n| Total   | 11,950,438  | 143,760,418  |\n\n* Omission of Scope 3 emissions for Power is explained in the \u201cScope 3 Calculation Methodology\u201d in Appendix A (page 71) of our 2021 TCFD Report.\n\nTo reach net zero, we must move from our baseline across a decarbonization pathway to our ultimate net zero target. Establishing 2030 targets are the first step in that journey. The next step is to develop an implementation plan to achieve targeted reductions in each relevant sector. We are evaluating a number of strategies and tools to drive towards the established goals, though they may not all be applicable for every sector or client. Some of the emissions reduction approaches and potential future tools include client engagement, capital allocation strategy and portfolio management tools.\n\nThe table on the following page summarizes our current 2030 emission targets for Citi\u2019s Energy and Power portfolios. These interim 2030 targets are a key component of our net zero plan for emissions in our client portfolio.\nMore information about the analysis we conducted to establish these targets, including scenario selection and the scope and boundaries of the targets, is available in our 2021 TCFD Report. In future years, we will conduct further analysis to facilitate target setting for additional sectors. In 2022, we plan to focus on the Auto Manufacturing, Steel, Thermal Coal Mining and Commercial Real Estate sectors for core analysis and target setting, in alignment with the NZBA guidelines. We will consider the remaining sectors, including Aluminum, Aviation, Cement and Agricultural subsectors in 2023 and 2024.\n\nCiti\u2019s Approach to Managing Climate Risk\n\nCiti\u2019s Risk Management function is responsible for identifying, measuring, managing, controlling and reporting risks to the company. We identify climate risk as an \u201cemerging risk\u201d in Citi\u2019s Enterprise Risk Management Framework. Within the framework, emerging risks are those that are new or rapidly changing, with high growth potential, and are characterized by data unavailability or other uncertainties. We do not view climate risk as a stand-alone risk category but as a transversal risk, capable of manifesting across each of Citi\u2019s seven risk categories in our risk taxonomy: Credit, Market, Liquidity, Strategic, Operational, Compliance and Reputation. Climate impacts may be either physical- or transition-related and may vary depending on the time horizon.\n\nDuring 2021, we strengthened our governance and deepened our expertise to advance effective management of climate risks and opportunities. Highlights include the following:\n\n- Formation of a new Global ESG Council, consisting of senior members of management, with the aim of providing enhanced oversight of our ESG activities and goals\n- Creation of the Natural Resources & Clean Energy Transition team to integrate our Energy, Power and Chemicals businesses, in order to assist our clients across these sectors as they transition\n- Growth of our dedicated Climate Risk team, with an emphasis on expertise in credit risk, scenario analysis, stress testing and regulatory engagement\n- Establishment of a Net Zero Task Force to support the development and launch of our net zero plan\n\nRegulatory Compliance\n\nInterest in climate risk management from regulators continues to grow globally. We are monitoring and responding to emerging regulatory obligations and engaging with regulators around the world about climate risk issues, especially related to risk management, strategy and scenario analysis requirements.\n\nAs we anticipate an increase in regulatory requirements, voluntary frameworks and mandated product classifications, we are strengthening our internal regulatory teams with subject matter experts. We are also improving our access to relevant, accurate data to sharpen our scenario analyses and building a standardized, global climate disclosure strategy that can monitor and manage requirements and provide consistent reporting across our operations.\nClimate Change Governance\n\nThe following climate change governance diagram illustrates our governance structure as of April 2022. For more about Citi\u2019s governance related to climate risk, see our 2021 TCFD Report.\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nEXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT TEAM\n\nCEO\n\nGlobal ESG Council\n\nNomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee\n\nRisk Management Committee\n\nGlobal Head of Public Affairs\n\nChief Risk Officer\n\nCEO of Institutional Clients Group\n\nManagement and Specialized Functions\n\nGLOBAL PUBLIC AFFAIRS\n\nINDEPENDENT RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nINSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS GROUP\n\nChief Sustainability Officer\n\nHead of Climate Risk\n\nHead of Environmental & Social Risk Management (ESRM)\n\nBanking, Capital Markets and Advisory (BCMA)\n\nGlobal Markets\n\nSustainability & ESG Team\n\nClimate Risk Team\n\nESRM Team\n\nSustainability & Corporate Transitions Team\n\nNatural Resources & Clean Energy Transition Team\n\nSustainable Debt Capital Markets Team\n\nMarkets ESG Team\n\nSteering Groups\n\nClimate Risk Steering Group\n\nClimate Risk Working Group\n\nNet Zero Task Force\n\nGlobal Sustainability Steering Committee\nEMPLOYEE TRAINING IN CLIMATE RISK\n\nWe are working to create a culture of sustainability across our company and raise our colleagues\u2019 literacy related to climate risk. In 2021, we created a new training module that covers key climate risk concepts, including the definition of climate risk, emerging climate risk standards, supervisory expectations, an overview of Citi\u2019s efforts in this area and our initiatives to enhance climate risk management. Our previous climate risk trainings were customized for specific groups of employees to raise awareness about particular climate-related topics. This new module is our first training for climate that allows us to provide consistent instruction for a broader audience and further support the integration of climate risk considerations into our risk management processes.\n\nClimate Risk in Our Maritime Shipping Portfolio\n\nThe Poseidon Principles, released in 2019, provide a framework for lenders, lessors and financial guarantors to integrate climate considerations into lending decisions with international shipping clients, to help the sector decarbonize in line with the goals of the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Citi was a founding signatory and also chairs the Steering Committee of the Poseidon Principles Association, the governing body of the Poseidon Principles.\n\nAs a part of our commitment, we provide yearly disclosures, which are published alongside those of other signatories in an annual report published on the Poseidon Principles website. Our most recent disclosure reflects updated data from the IMO\u2019s Fourth GHG Study, published in 2020, as well as an improved methodology for estimating carbon emissions and carbon intensity for a variety of vessel types and sizes, resulting in a more accurate representation of vessel emissions and the emissions reduction targets needed for the world\u2019s shipping fleet.\n\nOur reported alignment score this year (+11.7%) is notably further out of alignment compared with our reported score of last year (+6%). This change in alignment is due to a combination of factors, including the improved accuracy of the new methodology, as well as significant disruptions in shipping related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The disruptions were most notable in the Cruise segment, which saw dramatic decreases in efficiency (and therefore our alignment scores) driven by reduced cruising activity globally. This was however offset by the improvements in the accuracy of the methodology, resulting in an alignment score of +1.1% for the Cargo segment of Citi\u2019s Shipping portfolio only (excluding the Cruise segment). Further changes to the methodology may occur as data and industry practices evolve, and new IMO regulations come into effect.\n\nTo further advance progress in the maritime shipping industry, we are a member of the Getting to Zero Coalition, which is focused on the development of commercially viable, zero-emission vessels and other needed maritime infrastructure for scalable net zero-carbon energy sources, including production, distribution, storage and bunkering. The coalition was founded by the Global Maritime Forum, Friends of Ocean Action and the World Economic Forum. It has more than 190 member companies and nine knowledge partners and is supported by key intergovernmental organizations and governments.\nReducing Climate Risk in Our Financing\n\nClimate risk is one of the three pillars of our Sustainable Progress Strategy. When it comes to analyzing and reducing climate risk associated with our clients, we have identified the following three primary focus areas:\n\n- Policy development\n- Portfolio analysis and measurement\n- Engagement\n\nPolicy Development\n\nAs part of our work to integrate climate risk into Citi\u2019s risk policies and governance frameworks, we have updated our ESRM Policy Sector Approaches for carbon-intensive sectors to incorporate emerging best practices. One area where we have made significant progress is in our fossil fuel Sector Approaches for thermal coal mining and the generation of coal-fired power, which predated our net zero commitment. See the box on the right for more details on our targets and policy.\n\nPortfolio Analysis and Measurement\n\nCiti aims to understand the transition and physical risks that Citi and our clients are exposed to by conducting climate scenario analysis, measuring the GHG emissions associated with our financing portfolio and evaluating portfolio decarbonization pathways. During 2021, we conducted an analysis of our Energy and Power loan portfolios to establish baseline emissions and establish interim 2030 emissions targets as we work toward our net zero commitment. Learn more about this analysis and our targets in the Energy and Power Baseline Emissions and Interim Targets section.\n\nOur Commitment to Reduce Financing for Coal\n\nThermal Coal Mining\n\nOur ESRM Policy commitments related to coal mining began in 2009, with our first coal mining Sector Approach. Since that time, we have updated our policy, including updates focused on enhanced due diligence and continued reductions in our credit exposure to the coal mining industry. As of 2020, Citi has established a policy prohibition on project-related financing of new thermal coal mines and significant expansions. We have also committed to the following targets to reduce our exposure to companies that derive 25% or more of their revenue from thermal coal mining:\n\n- By the end of 2025: Reduce our credit exposure to these companies by 50% from a 2020 baseline\n- After 2025: No longer facilitate capital markets transactions or mergers and acquisition advisory and financing for these companies\n- By the end of 2030: Reduce all remaining exposure to these companies to zero\n\n| 2020 baseline* | Credit exposure as of Dec. 31, 2021 |\n|----------------|-----------------------------------|\n| $1.091B        | $759M (30% reduction from baseline) |\n\nCoal-Fired Power Generation\n\nOur ESRM Policy commitments related to coal-fired power generation have also been updated over time as the credit and reputation risk related to coal has increased. We have committed to not finance any new coal-fired power plants or expansions of existing plants. Our expectations have increased as we aim to help our clients transition to a future aligned with the Paris Agreement. A comprehensive summary of time-bound milestones for coal-fired power clients through 2040 is available in our Environmental and Social Policy Framework.\n\nIn 2021, we reviewed our coal-fired power clients\u2019 GHG reporting and low-carbon transition plans, including commitments to retire existing coal plants. Our analysis considered a combination of client disclosures, third-party ESG analysis, CDP disclosures and direct client engagement. Moving forward, this evaluation will be wrapped into our net zero engagement and progress towards our 2030 targets.\n\n* This figure has been updated as one metallurgical coal company was erroneously included in the baseline reported in our 2020 ESG report.\n\nRisk Exposure\n\nDuring 2021, we updated our climate risk heat-mapping framework to refine our understanding of the sectors we finance that are most sensitive to climate risk. The heat map on the following pages is based on a qualitative assessment of how transition and physical climate risk drivers are expected to impact different sectors. The results of this assessment will help us to prioritize portfolios when further evaluating risks.\nClimate Risk Heat-Mapping Framework: Vulnerability Rubric\n\nOur climate risk heat map (included on the following pages) categorizes sectors under one of four vulnerability scores, ranging from low to high. We have established subscores using the rubric in the following table for various aspects of transition and physical risks.\n\n| Vulnerability Score | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |\n|---------------------|---|---|---|---|\n| **Transition Risks** |   |   |   |   |\n| Regulatory          | No regulatory/policy changes are expected to meaningfully impact the sector financially such as through asset devaluation, increased expenditure (e.g., compliance costs) and/or loss of revenue | Minor impact to the sector expected from potential regulatory/policy changes (e.g., building efficiency) resulting in financial impact asset devaluation, increased expenditure (e.g., compliance costs) or loss of revenue; impact only on a subset of the sector, subset of geographies and/or only indirect impact | Moderate impact to the sector expected from regulatory/policy changes (e.g., carbon taxes) relating to the sector\u2019s carbon intensity; direct impact with noticeable economic implications on the sector through impacted asset valuation, increased expenditure (e.g., compliance costs) and/or revenue loss | Major impact to the sector expected due to expected regulatory/policy changes relating to the sector\u2019s carbon intensity; significant shift expected in the business model or economics of the sector impacting asset valuation, expenditures (e.g., increased compliance costs) and/or revenue loss |\n| Technology          | Outside of general modernization of technology, no technology shifts are expected for the sector | Minor impact to the sector expected from technology changes (i.e., impact only on a small subset of the sector, or only indirect impact through supply chain) that result in market share loss | Moderate impact to the sector expected from technology changes, resulting in some shift in the economics of some companies in the sector leading to market share loss | Major impact to the sector expected from technology changes, resulting in substitution of a significant portion of existing companies (i.e., market share loss) |\n| Stakeholder         | There is no expectation of stakeholder composition or preferences changing for the industry | Minor stakeholder impact due to expected shift in preferences, with minor financial consequences (e.g., revenue, vendor pricing) | Moderate stakeholder impact is expected for the sector in terms of stakeholder preferences and composition, with modest financial impact (e.g., revenue, vendor pricing) | Major stakeholder impact is expected in terms of both client preferences and composition of stakeholders, resulting in significant financial impact (e.g., revenue loss, vendor pricing) |\n| Legal               | No increased litigation concerns are expected to impact the industry that would lead to increased financial burden (e.g., legal fees, settlements) | Minor litigation concerns are expected to impact the sector, with modest financial consequences (e.g., legal fees, settlements) | Moderate litigation concerns are expected to impact the sector, with modest financial impact (e.g., legal fees, settlements) | Major litigation is expected to impact the sector, with significant financial impact (e.g., legal fees, settlements) |\n| **Physical Risks**  |   |   |   |   |\n| Acute Hazard        | Acute physical hazards have no impact on the day-to-day operations of companies in the sector | Sector would experience minor impact from acute physical hazards on operations (e.g., revenue loss due to business disruption), or minor damage to assets (e.g., asset devaluation) | Sector would experience moderate and protracted impact from acute physical hazards on operations (e.g., revenue loss due to business disruption), or moderate damage to assets (e.g., asset devaluation) | Sector would experience major and protracted impact from acute physical hazards on operations (e.g., revenue loss due to business disruption), or significant damage to assets (e.g., asset devaluation) |\n| Chronic Hazard      | Chronic physical hazards have no impact on the operations or valuation of assets/companies in the sector | Chronic physical hazards have minor potential impact on the operations (e.g., increased insurance cost) or valuation of assets/companies in the sector | Sector would experience moderate and sustained impact on the operations (e.g., increased insurance cost) or valuation of assets/companies in the sector | Sector would experience major and irreversible impact on the operations or valuation of assets/companies in the sector |\nClimate Risk Heat Map and Credit Exposure\n\nA comprehensive table of our credit exposures is provided below, including a breakdown of identified sectors into subsectors and, for each, the level of risk relating to physical and transition climate risk. By looking at the subsector level, we can further distinguish between the levels of risk within an individual sector. It is important to note that these risks are not expected to manifest in every sector immediately. For this reason, the table on this page and the next should not be interpreted as imminent risks to existing exposures, but rather, exposures we are proactively identifying to focus on, where we will work methodically in the coming years to better understand, analyze and manage our climate risk exposures in these sectors.\n\n| Sector                                      | 2020 Total $ Exposure | %

Participants provided input on Citi\u2019s TCFD disclosures and our approach to setting net zero targets and measuring our baseline emissions. Feedback from that session has been integrated into our 2021 TCFD report and will guide our progress as we continue to develop our net zero plan. See our 2021 TCFD Report for a summary of key takeaways from the session.\n\nTo advance progress, we have worked with organizations such as Rocky Mountain Institute\u2019s Center for Climate-Aligned Finance. The Center works with financial institutions on identifying 1.5\u00b0C-aligned emissions reduction pathways for sectoral portfolio measurement and target-setting and developing credible institutional transition plans. In addition, Citi contributed to the World Economic Forum\u2019s Financing the Transition to a Net-Zero Future report. The report reflects input from financial institutions and the public sector related to mobilizing investments in breakthrough technologies that will facilitate a more sustainable future.\n\nOur Sustainability & Corporate Transitions team and Natural Resources & Clean Energy Transition team engage with our clients to pursue opportunities and support their efforts to transition to net zero. Learn more in the Financing the Low-Carbon Transition section.\n\nSee the Stakeholder Engagement at Citi section for additional examples of our engagement efforts in 2021.\nSustainable Operations\n\nCiti has a history of prioritizing healthy buildings, along with two decades of measuring and reducing our environmental footprint. We are well-positioned to meet the dual challenges of climate change and COVID-19 head on, as we enable sustainable operations and healthy facilities for our customers and employees.\n\nNet Zero Commitment\n\nCiti\u2019s commitment to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050 includes both our financing and our own operations. For our operations, we are targeting net zero emissions by 2030. This includes GHG emissions related to our owned and leased facilities, employee commuting and business travel, and emissions associated with our supply chain.\n\nDuring 2021, we undertook a discovery and planning process to develop a strategy for reaching this commitment. This included broad engagement with employees from our Enterprise Operations & Technology group, and analysis to help us define the boundaries of the commitment, understand the potential challenges, and identify short-, medium- and long-term priorities to help us reach our goal.\n\nWith the announcement of our commitment to net zero GHG emissions, we broadened our engagement with employees across Citi, including those working in the areas of real estate, technology, supply chain, shared services, travel and facility operations. Our goal was to increase understanding and capabilities across our organization, while also gaining greater insight into the full scope of our GHG emissions. Employees in these groups helped evaluate their own processes to identify and map GHG emissions throughout Citi. We then engaged a third party to help us quantify those emissions. This engagement has set the stage for collaboration as we drive toward net zero in our operations.\n\nAs part of our discovery process, we also expanded our GHG inventory. We have been tracking Scope 1, Scope 2 and a portion of Scope 3 GHG emissions related to our own operations for many years. However, this was the first time we included broader Scope 3 emissions related to our supply chain, which is integral to grasping the total impact of our operations.\n\nDue to limitations in data availability and quality, we used spend data and industry emissions factors from the US Environmentally-Extended Input-Output Models as the basis for our GHG inventory. While this approach has its limitations, the insights we have gleaned from this analysis are nonetheless helping us identify priority areas that warrant additional investigation and suppliers we can meaningfully engage with to create the greatest impact. As supplier-specific data becomes available and methodologies improve, we will recalculate our supply chain emissions.\n\nThe GHG inventory is available in our 2021 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) report.\n\nWe are keenly aware that a balanced approach will be needed to drive emissions reductions for our operations. This might include a reduction in our consumption of supplier goods and services, while also engaging with suppliers to drive process improvements and innovations. We are also working toward our 2025 operational footprint goals (see following page), which aim to reduce GHG emissions and energy consumption for our operations. In addition, we are piloting zero-carbon building requirements for all new Citi buildings, targeting emissions from operations as well as embodied emissions in the materials used to construct the buildings.\n\nSee the Climate Risk and Net Zero section for an overview of our commitment to net zero GHG emissions, including as it relates to our financing.\nOperational Footprint Goals\n\nWe have been measuring our environmental footprint for two decades and began reporting on our direct operational impacts in 2002. This report marks our first disclosure on progress against our fourth generation of operational footprint goals, which we announced in 2020 and aim to achieve by 2025. These goals are aligned with a pathway to limit global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C and cover GHG emissions, energy use, water consumption, waste reduction and diversion, and sustainable building design.\n\nBecause of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our facilities were not used at full capacity in 2021, and our related resource consumption, waste generation and GHG emissions were lower than they otherwise would have been. We recognize that in some cases these impacts were simply moved to employees\u2019 homes and other non-Citi facilities. As a result of having fewer people using Citi buildings, our progress for 2021 indicates that we exceeded some of our goals during the year. That trend could briefly reverse in the coming years as our employees continue to return to the office, before progressing again toward meeting our goals.\n\n2025 Operational Footprint Goals\n\nThis is the first year we are reporting progress against our 2025 goals. We expect our progress to fluctuate as the number of people occupying our facilities varies during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn connection with our renewable electricity commitment, Citi is a member of RE100 \u2013 a global initiative led by the Climate Group and CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), which are both part of the We Mean Business Coalition. In recognition of RE100\u2019s requirements, we strive as much as possible to source 100% renewable electricity within the same market boundaries as our consumption.\n\n(MEASURED AGAINST A 2010 BASELINE)\n\n| Goals                                      | Progress through 2021 |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| GHG emissions                              |                       |\n| 45% reduction in location-based GHG emissions | 49.8%                 |\n| Energy                                     |                       |\n| 40% reduction in energy consumption        | 37.9%                 |\n| Maintain 100% renewable electricity sourcing | 100.0%*               |\n| Water                                      |                       |\n| 30% reduction in total water consumption   | 38.8%                 |\n| 25% of water consumed to come from reclaimed/reused sources | 7.0% |\n| Sustainable buildings                      |                       |\n| 40% of floor area to be LEED, WELL or equivalent certified | 34.7%**               |\n| Waste                                      |                       |\n| 50% reduction in total waste               | 55.8%                 |\n| 50% of waste diverted from landfill        | 22.8%                 |\n\n* 91% meeting RE100 market boundary criteria; 9% sourced from regionally aligned markets.\n** 2021 total includes 14 EDGE projects in Latin America.\nSustainable Building Principles in Action\n\nWhether undertaking new construction or renovating existing buildings, we prioritize efficiency and sustainability, to minimize the environmental impact of our facilities across the globe. Buildings are responsible for about 40% of global energy use and approximately one-third of GHG emissions. Since our own operations consist largely of buildings, we have developed and are piloting requirements for all new buildings to be zero carbon by 2030, in support of our net zero commitments. These requirements address both operational and embodied carbon emissions, inclusive of energy use, energy supply, integration with utilities and material use.\n\nCiti is currently renovating a facility in Gray, Tennessee, to align with our zero-carbon requirements. The plans for this facility include features to reduce energy use as much as possible and to meet any remaining energy needs with renewable sources. Aligning this building with our zero-carbon building requirements will also benefit the well-being of those using the building. For instance, a tight building seal will improve air quality and thermal comfort for those inside and will also improve energy efficiency.\n\nOne of our 2025 goals is to have 40% of our facilities, by floor area, LEED, WELL or equivalent certified. In 2021, we earned certifications for several sustainable building projects in pursuit of this goal:\n\n- **Guatemala (LEED Gold):** Reducing the environmental impact of the interior construction of our offices in Guatemala was instrumental in our ability to achieve LEED Gold for this site. Design features include high-efficiency fixtures and equipment to reduce water consumption by 41.5% and electrical\n\nIn 2021, Citi Tower Hong Kong installed our largest on-site renewable energy system to date. This hybrid system generates energy for water heating and electricity. The system includes 360 solar panels, which we estimate will generate over 85,000 kilowatt-hours annually, avoiding 70 metric tons of CO\u2082 emissions each year. The site also has a small wind turbine.\n\nWith the installation of solar panels for two more locations completed in 2021, we now have six bank branches in Mexico with on-site solar generation. These branches receive from 60% to 80% of their electricity needs from on-site solar power, including the branch pictured at right in Mexico City. The six branches have a total of 348 solar panels and a combined capacity of 115 kilowatts when operating at their peak output. In 2021, these sites produced 64,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity.\n\n---\n\n2. United Nations Environment Programme, \u201cEnergy Efficiency for Buildings,\u201d page 1, accessed November 2021.\nWELL Building Health-Safety Rating\n\nIn 2021, as a result of our health and safety practices, we received the International WELL Building Health-Safety Rating for all Citi facilities globally, including offices, operations centers, data centers and retail locations. This seal helps assure our employees and customers that our buildings are safe and healthy environments. The seal is awarded to businesses that meet rigorous scientific standards, maintenance protocols and emergency plans to address concerns related to COVID-19 and other infectious diseases now and into the future.\n\nWELL Portfolio Program\n\nBuilding on the success of the WELL Health-Safety Rating, Citi joined the WELL Portfolio Program \u2013 a benchmarking program for measuring and improving organizational health performance across facilities. The WELL Portfolio Program leverages the strategies of the WELL building standard, the leading health-focused building standard. As a participating organization, Citi will receive an annual portfolio score based on our work to support and enhance the health and well-being of employees and customers who work in and visit our buildings every day.\n\nconsumption by 15.7%. We also reused 77% of the facility\u2019s furniture to reduce waste, and we were able to effectively manage construction-related waste, capping the volume sent to landfill at 31.7 kg/m\u00b2, which is 15% below the industry standard.\n\n- **Paraguay (EDGE Advanced):** We earned our first EDGE Advanced Certification for our Agrovet Offices in Paraguay. The Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies (EDGE) certification system evaluates buildings in three resource categories: energy, water and materials. We earned Advanced Certification through the use of features that increase energy efficiency by 63% (mainly related to the building\u2019s heating and cooling systems), increase water efficiency by 20% through high-efficiency accessories in restrooms and reduce embodied energy of materials used for interior spaces by 89%.\n\n- **China, Taiwan, United States (LEED Volume Program):** We accomplished LEED v2009 certification for 11 bank branches through the LEED Volume Program and achieved LEED v4 Gold for our fourth retail prototype. All new and renovated bank branches will be LEED Certified based on this model.\n\nWe are also planning a significant renovation of Citi Tower in London, headquarters for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. For this project, which we expect to complete in 2025, we are prioritizing sustainable building principles and employee well-being in alignment with LEED, BREEAM and WELL standards. By renovating the existing building, rather than demolishing it to build a new structure, we will avoid releasing an estimated 100,000 metric tons of embodied carbon, equivalent to 21,748 passenger vehicles driven for one year. We are designing Citi Tower London for energy efficiency from top to bottom, within the constraints of an existing building, and are factoring carbon emissions into our decision-making process. The building will feature rooftop solar panels generating more than 52,000 kilowatt-hours per year annually \u2013 enough to power 18 average UK homes for one year. Efficient fixtures will reduce water consumption by 20% and a grey water\n\n---\n\n3. EPA Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator.\n4. Average electricity UK home 2021 resource, data from OFGEM.\n5. Against LEED baseline.\nreuse system will help us save an estimated 29.5 cubic meters of water each day, enough to fill 4.3 Olympic pools over the course of a year. During construction, we plan to refurbish and reuse materials on-site to reduce waste and embodied carbon, and we will work to significantly minimize waste sent to landfill.\n\n**Employee and Customer Well-Being**\n\nFor many years, Citi has prioritized the intersection of sustainability and employee well-being. When looking at how our buildings can affect the well-being of our employees, we manage air quality and acoustics, as well as providing ergonomic furniture, opportunities to stay active, healthy food options and a work environment that is both flexible and effective.\n\nAs a result of our efforts, we\u2019ve received WELL Silver certification from the International WELL Building Institute\u2122 for two facilities, one each in Hong Kong and India. Both facilities are going through the WELL recertification process, which is required every three years. We are also working toward WELL certification for our London headquarters renovation. The WELL Building Standard is a system for measuring, certifying and monitoring building features that impact the health and well-being of occupants. In recognition of how important it is to design buildings for employee well-being, we have included WELL certification as an aspect of our sustainable building goal for 2025.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic further emphasized the importance of employee well-being at our office facilities, in addition to the well-being of our employees and customers within our branches. With this in mind, we have instituted initiatives and protocols aligned with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. These measures include improved ventilation and air treatment systems; signage about effective handwashing; sanitizer stations; enhanced cleaning measures to reduce exposure to pathogens, allergens and harmful chemicals; and rules related to social distancing and masks. In addition, we have installed plexiglass barriers in our branches to provide increased protection for our employees and customers. To further support our colleagues, we are also providing employees with additional physical and mental health resources.\n\n**Employee Engagement**\n\nOur colleagues contribute to our culture of sustainability through volunteer efforts and awareness campaigns. Despite the challenges a remote working environment posed during 2021, Citi piloted an Earth Day initiative within its global Green Team Network of 18 teams. This initiative encouraged employees to live more sustainably and complete tasks to save water, reduce waste and energy consumption and learn more about climate change.\n\n---\n\n6. In one year, this equals 10,767.5 cubic meters. Olympic pool size: 2,500 cubic meters. 10,767.5/2,500 = approx. 4.3.\nBeyond Earth Day, employees across the company also contribute to sustainability initiatives as a part of their regular work responsibilities. For example, many of our employees have sustainability-related responsibilities as part of their day-to-day work, such as those involved in our climate risk, environmental and social transition efforts.\n\nEfficient Travel Options\n\nDue to COVID-19, employee commuting and business travel has dropped significantly since 2019. For many years, we have encouraged employees to use video and web conferencing technologies rather than traveling, whenever possible. With the onset of the global pandemic, we quickly transitioned the entire company to adopt use of these platforms for their daily interactions. As our employees return to the office, we are relying on the efficiency efforts we had in place before the onset of COVID-19. For instance, many of our offices are centrally located near public transportation, which reduces the need for employees to drive to work, and we provide U.S.-based employees pretax dollars to cover the cost of commuting by subway, bus, train, ferry and vanpool. We also offer bike storage and bike racks at several facilities and sponsor bike share programs, known as the Citi Bike\u00ae Program, in New York City, Jersey City and Miami. At our car park in the Citigroup Centre in London, we offer a dozen charging stations for those driving electric vehicles.\n\nDue to our global scale, we often need to meet with clients, partners, teams and other stakeholders across the world. Now that many colleagues across the firm have started traveling again, we are working to build awareness for how business travel impacts our carbon footprint. For example, when employees book travel reservations, they are able to see the emissions data related to their air travel. We plan to include emissions data for rail travel, hotels and rental cars in the future.\n\nManaging Climate Risk in Our Operations\n\nThe effects of climate change, particularly extreme weather events, pose a potential risk to our operations. Our Citi Realty Services (CRS) Group and our Crisis Management and Business Continuity teams help us to monitor, prepare for and respond to extreme weather events or other disruptions to our operations. In addition, CRS conducts due diligence for each proposed new location and reassesses the properties\u2019 structural resilience periodically, based on risk, as well as following significant events. These assessments take internal Citi standards, as well as local and international codes, into account.\n\nBecause Citi operates in nearly 100 countries, our facilities could potentially be exposed to a range of varied climate-related risks. To increase our resiliency, we have invested in climate adaptation solutions in a number of critical facilities. In addition, our crisis management team has developed action plans to address immediate risks and support our employees and customers before, during and after adverse events. Our business continuity team also has plans in place to help Citi resume business operations as quickly as possible in the aftermath of an extreme climate event.\n\nTransparent Reporting of Operational Climate Impacts\n\nCiti reports our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 GHG emissions in both this ESG report and in our CDP response. We began reporting on the direct environmental impacts of our operations in 2002 and have submitted data to CDP every year since 2003. We follow the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard and Scope 2 Guidance for measuring and reporting both market-based and location-based Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions.\n\nWe also report Scope 3 CO\u2082 emissions from air and train business travel in this ESG report, and we report Scope 3 electricity transmission loss and employee commuting data to CDP. In early 2022, Citi received the following scores from CDP related to 2020 data:\n\n- Climate change score: A-\n- Supplier engagement score: A\n\nOur GHG emissions and environmental data for our operations and business travel are verified and assured by SGS, a leading third-party inspection, verification, testing and certification company. For our SGS Assurance Statement, see the Assurance section.\nEnvironmental Performance for Operations\n\nOPERATIONAL FOOTPRINT GOALS (MEASURED AGAINST A 2010 BASELINE)\n\n| Goals

Throughout 2021, Citi and the Citi Foundation accelerated and expanded investments in communities around the world, helping to support a more inclusive recovery and more equitable future.\n\nBuilding on our longstanding leadership in financial inclusion, we expanded the scope of our social finance efforts to maximize our impacts and to help achieve the $500 Billion Social Finance Goal we set as part of our overall $1 trillion commitment to sustainable finance by 2030. We invested $1 billion in a broad suite of initiatives designed to help close the racial wealth gap in the United States and to increase economic mobility through Citi and the Citi Foundation\u2019s Action for Racial Equity commitment. And we increased our investments in the Citi Impact Fund, more than half of which went to minority-owned and women-owned companies.\n\nWe also continued to support COVID-19 relief and recovery efforts globally while staying focused on our long-term priorities, including affordable housing and the Citi Foundation\u2019s strategic grantmaking efforts.\n\nInvesting in Our Communities\n2021 Highlights\n\n- **Announced our $500B Social Finance Goal**\n- **Committed to reach 15M households, including 10 million women, by 2025**\n- **Issued Inaugural $1B Citi Social Finance Bond offering**\n- **$1B invested in initiatives to help close the racial wealth gap**\n- **$5.64B financed for affordable housing projects in the United States**\n- **68% of asset allocation directed to women and/or racially/ethnically diverse founders of companies through the Citi Impact Fund**\n- **$100+M in grants provided by the Citi Foundation**\nOur Commitment to Social Finance\n\nBillions of people around the world lack access to basic necessities \u2013 clean water, education, electricity, financial products, housing, medicine \u2013 hampering their economic progress and social growth.\n\nAs an institution with a longstanding history of driving positive social impact and financial innovations that benefit communities around the world, we took our commitment to a new level in 2021: announcing a $500 Billion Social Finance Goal as part of our $1 trillion commitment to sustainable finance by 2030 with corresponding criteria for activities related to affordable basic infrastructure, affordable housing, diversity and equity, economic inclusion, education, food security and healthcare.\n\nMany of our Citi business units \u2013 including Banking, Capital Markets and Advisory; Global Markets; Trade and Treasury Services; Citi Community Capital; and Citi Commercial Bank \u2013 are dedicated to delivering products and services that can contribute to the social finance goal. These include the issuance of social bonds and sustainability-linked bonds, financing and advisory services to companies with social missions, creation of municipal bonds with social use of proceeds (such as education or health), or loans and facilities with eligible social use of proceeds. We have broadened the focus of our global Citi Social Finance team, formerly our Inclusive Finance team, which works across Citi businesses globally to develop scalable business platforms and client solutions that enable the bank, our clients and partners to expand financial inclusion, accelerate access to basic services, boost job creation and scale social infrastructure development in emerging markets. As part of our social finance focus, we are aiming to invest in opportunities for 15 million low-income households, including 10 million women, globally by 2025.\n\nThe recent expansion of this team builds on our 15-year track record of developing new business models and partnerships that leverage market-based approaches to improve the livelihoods of low-income communities around the world. Since 2007, these efforts have reached 4.1 million unbanked and underbanked individuals in emerging markets \u2013 including 3.7 million women.\n\nThese efforts, which are focused on supporting emerging markets, are complemented by our social finance activities in higher-income countries, such as our work to finance affordable housing projects in the United States and to issue bonds that help advance a range of social solutions.\n\nRead some case studies of the deals that will contribute to our $1 trillion commitment later in this chapter and in the Sustainable Finance section.\n\nOur extensive work on social finance contributes to progress on SDG 8, which aims, among other things, to provide full and productive employment and decent work for all. For example, Citi\u2019s work on financial inclusion around the world contributes to target 8.3, which encourages productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and the formalization and growth of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises through access to financial services.\n\nOur approach also supports target 8.10, which aims to strengthen the capacity of domestic financial institutions to encourage and expand access to banking, insurance and financial services for all.\n\nSocial finance is also a key success factor for progress on SDG 9, which aims to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation, specifically enabling progress on target 9.3, which seeks to increase the access of small-scale enterprises, facilitating integration into value chains and markets.\n\nAnd our work on catalyzing the distribution of small loans in emerging markets \u2013 which typically benefits women \u2013 directly contributes to SDG 5, in support of gender equality and empowerment for all women and girls, and in particular target 5.a, which strives for a range of gender-related objectives, including giving women equal rights to economic resources.\nBond Offerings Advance Social Initiatives\n\nIn October 2021, we issued our inaugural Citi Social Finance Bond, a $1 billion bond offering to support social and economic development efforts or activities that increase opportunity and access to essential basic services. Proceeds from the bond will finance a range of projects, including those that expand access to financial services, affordable housing, basic infrastructure, healthcare and education in underserved and unbanked communities in emerging markets.\n\nThe bond offering followed the release of our Citi Social Finance Framework, one of the world\u2019s first global social finance frameworks focused on enabling financial inclusion, affordable housing and access to essential services in emerging markets. The framework, which was developed in line with the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) Social Bond Principles 2021,* details how projects and assets will be selected. We will report annually on the use of funds and related impacts.\n\nThe Citi Social Finance Bond follows the 2020 issuance of Citi\u2019s inaugural $2.5 billion Affordable Housing Bond, which was then the largest-ever social bond from an issuer in the private sector.

Other examples can be found in the Sustainable Finance section.\n\n**ENHANCING FOOD SECURITY FOR SMALLHOLDER FARMERS**\n\nIn Sub-Saharan Africa, more than 50 million families earn a living from small farms, which produce 80% of the continent's food. But harvests still lag far behind the rest of the world. The nonprofit One Acre Fund supplies smallholder farmers with everything they need to grow more food and earn more money, with the primary goal of enhancing food security. In partnership with the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), Citi structured a $10 million flexible working capital solution for One Acre Fund in Kenya and an additional $5 million working capital facility for the other seven African countries where One Acre Fund operates. Since 2015, farmers who participate in One Acre Fund's programs earn on average nearly 50% more than peer farmers who are not on One Acre Fund-supported activities.\n\n**EXPANDING ACCESS TO LOANS IN BANGLADESH**\n\nBasic Unit for Resources and Opportunities of Bangladesh (BURO Bangladesh) is a leading microfinance institution that offers high-quality loans, savings and insurance to small businesses, smallholder farmers and women. BURO Bangladesh currently serves more than 2.2 million low-income women, with average loans of approximately $850. In 2021, Citi was the sole arranger of $68 million in in equivalent local currency, which is expected to give 85,000 people \u2014 80% of them women \u2014 access to finance.\nIMPROVING LIVELIHOODS THROUGH CLEAN ENERGY SOLUTIONS\n\nd.light is a global leader and pioneer in delivering affordable solar-powered solutions designed for the 759 million people in the developing world without access to reliable energy. Through four hubs in Africa, China, South Asia and the United States, d.light has sold more than 20 million solar light and power products in 70 countries, improving the lives of over 100 million people. In 2019, Citi provided a $5 million working capital loan in local currency to enable d.light to provide clean energy solutions that improve livelihoods in Kenya. In 2021, Citi provided an incremental $3 million working capital facility.\n\nSUPPORTING LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN MEXICO\n\nBanco Nacional de Obras y Servicios P\u00fablicos, Sociedad Nacional de Cr\u00e9dito (Banobras) is a state-owned Mexican development bank that seeks to improve the quality of life of local populations while contributing to the country\u2019s sustainable development. Banobras provides financing to public and private investment projects focused on the delivery of essential infrastructure and public service projects. In September, Citibanamex acted as a joint bookrunner for an approximately $500,000 local sustainability bond linked to basic infrastructure projects \u2013 infrastructure damaged by natural disasters; renewables: wind farms, photovoltaic plants and/or hydroelectric plants; sustainable transportation; wastewater treatment plants; and hospitals and energy efficiency projects.\nAction for Racial Equity\n\nIn the midst of a global pandemic that disproportionately affected communities of color, we took a hard look at ourselves and our own contribution to the status quo. We saw how we could use our power \u2013 as individuals, as a company and as an industry \u2013 to drive a lasting transformative movement toward greater equity.\n\nThe result was Action for Racial Equity, a four-pronged commitment of Citi and the Citi Foundation to invest more than $1 billion by 2023 in strategic initiatives to provide greater access to banking and credit in communities of color, increase investment in Black-owned businesses, expand affordable housing and homeownership among Black Americans, and advance anti-racist practices in our own company and in the financial services industry.\n\nBy November 2021 \u2013 one year into our three-year pledge \u2013 we had already invested $1 billion into initiatives expanding economic opportunity for communities of color, putting us on track to exceed our original $1.1 billion commitment set in 2020.\n\nSince the launch of Action for Racial Equity, we have been engaged across our business to think and act in support of equity and our goal of closing the racial wealth gap and increasing economic mobility in the United States. Throughout 2021, we worked on one of our key measures of success \u2013 institutionalizing the commitment to racial equity across the firm. For example, we created the Diverse Financial Institutions Group, a dedicated team within Citi that is serving as a hub to lead and expand firm-wide engagement with minority depository institutions (MDIs), diverse broker-dealers and diverse asset managers. We\u2019re also diversifying our teams to better serve our communities. We started to develop a centralized Financial Inclusion and Racial Equity Segment Team within U.S. Personal Banking to develop targeted and integrated segment strategies, drive seamless customer-centric execution, and champion greater financial inclusion, racial equity and customer protection.\n\nWe\u2019re harnessing our influence to encourage our law firm and agency partners to join us in efforts to advance racial equity. We obtained detailed diversity data from the U.S. law partners who make up more than two-thirds of our U.S. legal spend, enabling us to identify opportunities to increase representation of diverse attorneys on Citi\u2019s legal matters. And we\u2019re working with advertising agency partners that comprise the largest portion of our marketing spend to increase diverse representation of agency teams, including senior leadership, to help ensure diversity in Citi marketing materials.\n\nWe recognize that to continue closing the racial wealth gap, we need an approach that sparks immediate change while also creating economic solutions that support systemic change for the long term. We also recognize the need to hold ourselves accountable, starting with being transparent about where we are and where we need to continue pushing to improve. That\u2019s why we committed to a third-party racial equity audit of our Action for Racial Equity commitments. Additionally, we were the first major Wall Street bank to participate in the Management Leadership for Tomorrow Black Equity at Work Certification, which was created to help guide companies and keep them accountable for making progress around Black equity. (Learn more about the certification in the Talent and Diversity, Equity & Inclusion section.)\n\nOur Action for Racial Equity commitments contribute to SDG 8, which aims, among other things, to provide full and productive employment and decent work for all and specifically contributes to target 8.3, which supports productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and the formalization and growth of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises through access to financial services. Our approach also supports target 8.10: to strengthen the capacity of domestic financial institutions to encourage and expand access to banking, insurance and financial services for all. The affordable housing components of Action for Racial Equity align with SDG target 11.1, which includes providing access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services.\nAction for Racial Equity: An Update on Our Progress\n\nAction for Racial Equity Goals\n\n1.

In that spirit, we committed to conduct a third-party racial equity audit to assess our efforts to help address the racial wealth gap in the United States through the design and implementation of Action for Racial Equity.\n\nCovington & Burling LLP, which has civil rights expertise and experience leading racial equity audits across various industries, is conducting the audit. The firm is gathering input from a range of stakeholders, including Citi employees involved in implementing Action for Racial Equity, financial institutions and other partners directly benefiting or involved in implementing the initiative, and civil rights organizations that can represent the views of the customers and communities the initiative is designed to support. Conducting an audit of Action for Racial Equity will help Citi assess our work and will show where we can adapt and grow to make an even more meaningful impact going forward. The audit represents another step in our efforts to strengthen Citi\u2019s policies and practices in order to become an anti-racist institution. The audit began in January 2022, and we look forward to sharing the findings following its expected completion at the end of 2022.\n\nBRIDGE BUILT BY CITI\u2120\n\nMany small- and medium-sized businesses in the United States find that securing a loan can be a time-consuming, manual process. Business owners are often limited to banks near their own locations, while local and community banks can have a tough time broadening their reach to potential borrowers.\n\nEnter Bridge built by Citi\u2120, a new lending platform that democratizes the loan process by matching small- and medium-sized businesses online with regional, local and community banks for loans up to $10 million. Launched in August 2021, the platform aims to expand access to capital for smaller businesses while widening the customer base for lenders. Twenty-nine banks, including nine minority depository institutions (MDIs), are participating in a pilot program in seven states in the Southeast and Rockies regions.\n\nLearn more about our engagement with other MDIs.\n\nHARTE THOMPSON,\nSENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, CO-CREATOR, BRIDGE BUILT BY CITI\n\n\u201cWhat began as a sketch on a whiteboard has now given many business owners the access to banks that they deserve.\u201d\n\nROHIT MATHUR,\nDIRECTOR, CO-CREATOR, BRIDGE BUILT BY CITI\n\n\u201cInnovation in financial technology forces you to create a new path without being able to rely on how things have always been done. We have leveraged the expertise of professionals at our bank to create a fintech solution.\u201d\nCollaborating with MDIs\n\nMinority depository institutions (MDIs) have long been the trusted source of banking and access to capital for communities of color. For generations, they have provided essential financial services, especially for Black Americans who have not had equitable access to the mainstream banking system and therefore had fewer opportunities to build generational wealth.\n\nResearch shows that, compared with other financial institutions, MDIs originate a greater share of mortgages to borrowers of color.* They also originate a greater share of small business loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration to entrepreneurs of color than other financial institutions.\n\nBut since 2001, the number of Black-owned and operated banks has declined by more than half.** As of September 2021, there were only 20 Black banking institutions, and only one of them held more than $1 billion of assets.***\n\nOne of the four goals of Action for Racial Equity is expanding banking and access to credit in communities of color, in part through collaboration with MDIs. During Citi focus groups with Black MDIs, leaders overwhelmingly prioritized access to capital and capacity-building investments to grow their revenue and operations, which would enable the MDIs to diversify products and expand services.\n\nOur collaboration with Unity National Bank is just one example of how we\u2019re offering expertise and guidance to MDIs. We have supported growth capital opportunities for Unity by providing an equity investment and inviting Unity in on select project-based affordable housing lending opportunities, including a loan for 381 affordable housing units in Texas.\n\nWe also onboarded Unity on the Bridge built by Citi\u2122 platform to help expand their customer base, and we have enabled Unity to gain contract-based revenue as a subcontractor on existing Citi federal business lines. In order to help Unity prepare for long-term growth, we\u2019re collaborating on shared media and client conversations and supporting talent acquisition by exposing high-achieving students of color to banking as a career. Further, pro bono technical assistance delivered in collaboration with Deloitte and the National Bankers Association is helping Unity to strengthen access to talent pipeline development initiatives and corporate board seats.\n\nIn 2021, we doubled down on our collaboration with Unity by piloting the Citi Rotational Program, which embedded a Citi executive at Unity with the mandate of supporting revenue generation through the New Markets Tax Credit Program and expanding their affordable housing work.\n\nDR. KASE LAWAL,\nCHAIRMAN, UNITY NATIONAL BANK\n\nLack of wealth generation opportunities and access to affordable housing continue to plague Black and Brown communities, and our mission is to create equitable access to capital to help fill that void. We\u2019re thrilled to have the continued support and partnership of Citi, including their equity investment and embedded senior counsel, to help grow our business. Together, we can find more opportunities to drive economic value and impact in the communities we serve.\u201d\n\n* Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, \u201c2019 Minority Depository Institutions: Structure, Performance, and Social Impact.\u201d\n** Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, \u201cMinority Depository Institutions List, Historical Data Year-by-Year 2001-2020.\u201d\n*** Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, \u201cMinority Depository Institutions List, Fourth Quarter 2020.\u201d\nCiti Impact Fund\n\nThe Citi Impact Fund is a $200 million venture capital fund with a mission of investing in \"double bottom line\" companies that are addressing societal challenges, such as reaching low- and moderate-income households with innovative financial and workforce services, delivering solutions for the climate transition economy, and addressing needs for inclusive healthcare and housing.\n\nVenture capital funding has historically been inaccessible to most start-up founders, but especially so for women and people of color.\n\nThe fund, which at its founding in 2020 was the largest impact fund ever launched by a bank using its own capital, focuses on companies that are led or owned by women or racial/ethnic minorities. We started the fund with $150 million in January 2020, adding another $50 million specifically to support businesses owned by Black entrepreneurs as part of Action for Racial Equity.\n\nCiti Impact Fund: Progress to Date\n\nCommitted to\n\n20 new investees in 2021 and Q1 2022, bringing total portfolio to 31\n\n$88.6M Total committed through Q1 2022\n\n22 companies founded by women and/or racial/ethnic minorities supported to date\n\nSupported 13 Black founders \u2013 most of which are seed or early-stage investments, accounting for 41% of the Fund\u2019s portfolio and 28% of the Fund\u2019s total equity invested\n\nIMPACT FUND FOCUS AREAS\n\nWorkforce Development\n\nSustainability\n\nPhysical and Social Infrastructure\n\nFinancial Inclusion\nMaking an Impact\n\nSince its launch in early 2020, the Citi Impact Fund made investments in 31 U.S.-based, double-bottom line companies with business models built around positive social and environmental impact and outcomes. Thirteen of those investments were in companies with Black founders who are working to help close the racial wealth, education, healthcare and connectivity gaps in the United States, directly impacting marginalized communities for the better.\n\nBelow are just some of the companies we have invested in. For the full list, visit our website.\n\n**Cityblock Health**\n\n**TOYIN AJAYI, CEO & CO-FOUNDER**\n\n\"For nearly five years, Cityblock Health has been radically transforming healthcare for underserved and marginalized communities across the country. The Citi Impact Fund\u2019s investment has helped us continue to scale our services and align business and clinical models around equitable and improved outcomes. Citi\u2019s partnership is strong validation of our mission and how critically important it is to democratize access to high-quality, comprehensive care in our communities.\"\n\n**Daylight**\n\n**ROB CURTIS, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER**\n\n\"The Citi Impact Fund\u2019s investment in Daylight was the springboard we needed to build legitimacy for our social impact work, improving the financial lives of the LGBTQ+ community, and helped us close our seed round almost immediately afterwards. Thanks, Citi, for supporting our work to close the LGBTQ+ wealth gap.\"\n\n**Flume**\n\n**BRANDON GIBSON, CO-FOUNDER**\n\n\"The events of the last two years have stressed the importance of high-speed, low-cost broadband availability for all Americans. The hardest hit communities have seen regression in education and remote job capabilities due to lack of broadband options. Through our valuable partnership with Citi, Flume has been able to build out its initial gigabit fiber network and connect thousands of underserved people, affordable housing units, new developments and suburbs. With the Citi platform allowing Flume to rapidly deploy its technology, we can make a substantial impact on closing the digital divide with our network deployment.\"\n\n**Full Harvest**\n\n**CHRISTINE MOSELEY, FOUNDER & CEO**\n\n\"Full Harvest is thrilled to have Citi Impact Fund as a new investment partner, given their aligned values with our mission to help solve the $2.6 trillion global food waste problem. Full Harvest tackles food waste at the farm level with the world\u2019s first online business-to-business produce marketplace specializing in imperfect and surplus produce. Our technology improves efficiencies for produce buyers and farms and captures market insights not previously available, all while reducing one of the largest contributors to climate change: food waste. With Citi Impact Fund\u2019s investment, Full Harvest is able to achieve even more impact and revenue by scaling our technology further, expanding into new geographies and commodities and growing our team. A win-win-win for farmers, food companies and the planet.\"\n\n**OhmConnect**\n\n**CISCO DEVRIES, CEO**\n\n\"Citi is helping fund OhmConnect\u2019s vision to make 100% clean energy accessible to everyone. With our nearly 200,000 California customers saving energy at critical times, we have helped prevent blackouts while paving the way for a more stable grid.\"\nCOVID-19 Relief and Recovery\n\nThroughout 2021, Citi and the Citi Foundation continued to address immediate needs for COVID-19 relief while staying focused on longer-term economic recovery. Many of our efforts were geared toward underserved communities around the world, which were facing disproportionate burdens from the global pandemic.\n\nBy the end of 2021, Citi and the Citi Foundation had contributed more than $160 million in COVID-19 and recovery efforts since the beginning of the pandemic. Total contributions included $3 million from Citi employees to date. Citi and the Citi Foundation provided support to organizations \u2013 small and large \u2013 all around the world: food donations and meal kits to help people facing food insecurity; support for housing stability loans; emergency child care programs; medical and personal protective equipment; COVID-19 screening and testing funds, and more.\n\nIn India, as cases surged in the spring of 2021, Citi pledged $27 million over three years toward recovery and relief efforts. Of the total pledged, $10 million was allocated immediately toward the procurement of oxygen supplies and other equipment for frontline healthcare workers. The funds also went toward food and hygiene supplies for approximately 200,000 low-income families.\n\nIn Asia, the Citi Foundation\u2019s grant to the Resilient Cities Network supports small- and medium-sized businesses while advancing the recovery of selected cities in the region. The Catalyzing City Resilience Solutions (CCRS) program is working with municipal governments to help local economies recover from the pandemic by identifying critical small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME) and empowering them to create and scale urban solutions that will enable greater resilience. CCRS is structured to include an initial assessment phase where cities can assess the impact of the pandemic on a particular sector and local economy; an accelerator phase where cities and the selected SME sector co-create solutions that address critical resiliency challenges; and a pilot project phase to demonstrate the potential of the selected solution.\n\nThe participating city of Melaka, Malaysia, for example, is exploring how to support the SME ecosystem along the Melaka riverfront, which was especially affected by a drop in tourism. The assessment phase revealed that SMEs in the area are facing gaps in knowledge and capacity to rebuild from the pandemic and that there is a lack of stakeholder communication to deliver on resilience initiatives. Based on these findings, Melaka will launch and test a platform to increase collaboration among key stakeholders through joint trainings and problem-solving sessions for government officials and local entrepreneurs.\n\nIn the United States, the Citi Foundation announced a $25 million investment to be distributed to nonprofit organizations that provide technical assistance to minority-owned businesses navigating the continued economic impacts of the pandemic. The 50 grant recipients, which each received $500,000 in unrestricted support, are local, community-based change agents that have the expertise, experience and relationships to provide tailored, on-the-ground support for affected businesses and the communities they serve.\n\nIn addition, Citi deepened our relationship with No Kid Hungry, an organization working to end childhood hunger in the United States, to help address the ongoing issue of food insecurity during COVID-19. In 2021, we provided $2.8 million in new funding to support various campaigns aimed at helping the rapid response to school and community needs in New York City. Learn more about our work with No Kid Hungry.\nGlobal Community Day\n\nEvery year, Citi colleagues, alumni, partners, clients, family and friends come together to participate in Global Community Day, our annual flagship volunteer initiative to give back in the communities where we live and work. For the second year in a row, we adapted in 2021 to find new ways of volunteering in lieu of in-person events.\n\n61,000+\nVolunteer Engagements\n\n37K+\nVolunteer Hours\n\n700+\nActivities\n\n81\nCountries and Territories\n\nGlobal Community Day was a little different this year, but the impact we made was no less meaningful.

The COVAX Facility developed a diversified, active vaccine portfolio management strategy to secure vaccine supply for all participating countries. Pooled procurement gave COVAX leverage to negotiate highly competitive prices, speedy deployment and better terms, especially for low- and middle-income countries.\n\nSince that appointment, Citi has been advising on credit, liquidity and operational and contractual risks, including planning and execution of mitigation strategies. The Facility is co-led by Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the World Health Organization.\n\nIn September 2021, Citi, in conjunction with the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), began providing a risk management solution to Gavi to enable the funding for COVID-19 vaccine purchases through the COVAX Facility.\n\nIn another effort to support equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, Citi and other leaders in the financial services sector joined CODE (RED) to help get vaccines and other vital defenses to hundreds of millions of people in the world\u2019s poorest countries. Citi provided eligible U.S. credit card members with the option to donate their points to the CODE (RED) campaign. Citi also donated $250,000 to (RED)\u2019s efforts.\nAffordable Housing\n\nCiti finances affordable and workforce housing in low- and moderate-income urban and suburban areas in an effort to ease the affordable housing crisis in the United States. We offer a range of housing finance solutions, including construction lending, tax credit equity and permanent financing through our balance sheet.\n\nCiti Community Capital, the bank unit through which we finance all types of affordable housing and community development projects, reported approximately $5.64 billion of lending to finance affordable rental housing projects in 2021. In fact, for 12 consecutive years, Citi has been the No. 1 affordable housing lender in the United States, as published by Affordable Housing Finance.\n\nAt Citi, being a leader in the affordable housing industry does not just mean making debt and equity capital available to expand the U.S. affordable housing supply; it also means being an innovator and market leader. Over the past several years we have worked with our clients to find new ways to lower the cost of building housing and increase the supply of housing for our most vulnerable populations. For example, Citi was among the first banks to provide construction loans to projects using modular, or factory-built, housing. In 2021, we provided $19.6 million in total financing for Oatsie\u2019s Place, a new modular housing project in Los Angeles, where 45 of 46 apartments are designated for homeless women. In an effort to promote long-term housing stability, eligible residents are provided with additional services to support their transitions from homelessness to permanent housing.\n\nCiti also recently provided a $3.89 million forward commitment for the permanent financing of Hayu Tilixam, a 50-unit apartment complex set to be built in Portland, Oregon. Through a partnership with Community Development Partners and the Native American Youth and Family Center, Hayu Tilixam will provide a welcoming and culturally sensitive home for Indigenous families and youth. All units will be reserved for residents with incomes between 30% to 50% of the area median income, and eight units will be reserved for formerly homeless residents.

That approach and support is more important than ever as the United States continues to address the root causes and impacts of income and wealth inequality.\n\nIn December 2021, the Foundation announced 50 nonprofit organizations as the newest recipients of unrestricted grants to advance social and economic opportunity for underserved communities. The $25 million grant initiative supports visionary organizations that are working to connect low-income communities and communities of color to greater social and economic opportunity in six cities: Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. Each Community Progress Maker will receive an unrestricted grant of $500,000 and access to technical assistance and a facilitated supportive learning community.\n\nThe recipients are working on a range of social issues, including the expansion of affordable housing and access, environmental sustainability, economic development, financial health and wellness, and workforce readiness/high-quality jobs. The Foundation will provide a supportive community network through which these organizations can connect to learn from each other, share best practices and strengthen their roles as social change agents. As part of the initiative, the Citi Foundation is engaging longtime grantee Urban Institute to provide technical assistance to the cohort, helping to measure their impact and track their progress.\n\nAccording to a recent report from Citi Global Perspectives & Solutions, there is a growing need for multiyear, unrestricted funding, which empowers nonprofits to invest in the financial sustainability of their organization and gives them the flexibility to adapt to evolving challenges. This kind of philanthropic support is even more urgent as local communities continue to face complex challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHarlem Stage is a performing arts center that is using support from the Citi Foundation to help bridge Harlem\u2019s cultural legacy to contemporary artists of color.\nTalent and Diversity, Equity & Inclusion\n\nIn This Section\n\n81 Return to Office and the Future of Work\n83 Diversity, Equity & Inclusion\n97 Using Our Corporate Voice to Drive Change\n99 Employment Data\nAs the pandemic persisted through 2021, we continued to put the safety, health and well-being of our colleagues first. Early on in the health crisis, we developed principles that have consistently guided our decisions, including how we returned to the office. We focused on data, not dates, took a localized approach, and were transparent with colleagues that we would continue to learn and adapt as we go. Much of our attention was on creating a safe and welcoming workplace for today, while also pushing ourselves to envision new ways of working for tomorrow \u2013 a model that is more flexible, agile and collaborative.\n\nDespite the ongoing challenges of the pandemic, we continued to make progress on our commitments to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace and using our corporate voice to drive change.\n\nReturn to Office and the Future of Work\n\nIf the pandemic taught us anything from an employee wellness perspective, it was the value of flexibility. As the situation surrounding the virus continued to evolve, we focused on how we could bring our colleagues safely back to the office. At the same time, COVID-19 opened our minds to new ways of working. While we know there are enormous benefits to being together in person, we saw just how productive and effective remote work could be. We recognized that we couldn\u2019t go back to the way things were and that we had to adapt to new realities. After coming to understand just how important flexibility is to our current and future success as a firm, we became the first major U.S. bank to publicly embrace a hybrid model of work for our colleagues moving forward.\n\nAs vaccinations became widely available in the United States, United Kingdom and other parts of the world, and where the data told us it was safe to do so, we began to bring colleagues back to the office in a hybrid model \u2013 with a minimum of two days per week in person and a few days from home. Colleagues in more than 30 locations across the U.S. returned to the office in 2021. We required colleagues returning to those sites to be vaccinated against COVID-19, wear masks and social distance wherever possible. For colleagues working in our branches, we required rapid testing and masks in 2021, and vaccination as of early 2022. Understanding there is not a one-size-fits-all approach, we adjusted our global return-to-office efforts region by region, based on local data, vaccine availability and country mandates.\n\nEqually important, we communicated regularly and consistently with our colleagues \u2013 sending messages from our CEO and senior leaders to keep people informed of our plans to return to the office and equipping our managers with resources and information so that they, in turn, could effectively support their teams and answer questions.\n\nAfter working from home became the \u201cnew normal\u201d in early 2020, we listened to feedback from our employees and enacted policies to help ease the blurring of lines between home and work. In response, in 2021 we launched \u201cZoom-Free Fridays\u201d for internal meetings to combat the well-recognized fatigue from virtual meetings. We asked colleagues whenever they could to designate noon to 1 p.m in local times as an hour free of calls and meetings, as well as to reduce hour-long meetings to 45 minutes to give colleagues time in between sessions. We also offered a \u201cReset Day\u201d in May for colleagues to take a day off to recharge and added several new benefits to further support work-life balance.\nThe Future of Work\n\nOne of the silver linings of the pandemic was that our colleagues and teams learned new and different ways of working when the virus initially closed the doors of our offices. At Citi, we felt it would be a missed opportunity if we didn\u2019t seize the moment to reimagine the workplace once the pandemic eases.\n\nOur CEO, Jane Fraser, boldly embraced the desire to be a bank with brains and a soul, and to break out of the traditional mindset that required our colleagues to be in the office all day, every business day. We established principles to guide our flexible, future work model and related ways of working \u2013 all with the aim to drive collaboration and meaningful connections, maximize apprenticeship and learning opportunities, leverage technology to our advantage, support colleague well-being and belonging, and treat our colleagues equitably.\n\nWe announced this future work model will take effect after colleagues return to the office, and the model will provide hybrid, remote and resident designations for colleagues. Hybrid roles offer colleagues the flexibility to work at least three days per week in the office and up to two days from home. The majority of Citi employees have been designated as hybrid. Remote roles may be performed 100% from outside the office location. Resident roles are jobs that cannot be performed remotely, such as tellers in our branches and data center employees.\n\nIn 2022, we will roll out the future work model and survey employees throughout the early phases, using data to understand what is working \u2013 and what isn\u2019t \u2013 so we can adapt where we need to. To support hybrid and remote working, we have been introducing enhanced technology and tools that enable us to be more connected and collaborative, no matter where we work.\n\nThe Benefit of Time\n\nHaving an opportunity to recharge or step away from work can boost job productivity and morale. In 2021, we rolled out two new programs to do just that for those who have been employed by Citi for at least five years.\n\nOur \u201cRefresh, Recharge, Reenergize\u201d sabbatical program allows colleagues to take up to 12 weeks away from work to pursue personal interests or education, take extended travel or simply take time off. Employees will receive 25% of their base pay, do not have to provide an explanation or reason for taking a break, and are eligible for two sabbaticals during their full tenure at Citi. In the first year of the program, which was launched in 2021, more than 200 employees began to take sabbatical.\n\nJulie Berg, Head of Product and Segment Analytics, U.S. Consumer Analytics, took advantage of the new program by driving coast-to-coast (and back again), traveling more than 10,000 miles across 24 states with her dog, Hank, as her companion. \u201cMy sabbatical was like a reboot on the computer with the ability to purge \u2018cached\u2019 information,\u201d Berg said. \u201cI worked with my team to prepare for time off for about 6 months to ensure all of the work was covered. I am forever grateful to them and my manager for holding the fort while I was away.\u201d\n\nOur new, pro bono \u201cGiving Back\u201d program, meanwhile, allows employees to lend their time and talents at a charitable organization for two to four weeks while still receiving 100% of their Citi base pay.\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion\n\nOur workforce of more than 220,000 colleagues around the globe reflects the diverse backgrounds and perspectives of our clients and customers. This is why we ensure equity and inclusion are embedded in everything that we do.\n\nAcross the firm, there is tremendous momentum to build on our efforts to create a more diverse, equitable and inclusive culture \u2013 from our pay equity work to our representation goals to our diverse interview panels and candidate slates to our engagement with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). We believe in setting clear goals to measure our progress and holding ourselves accountable to building a company where the best talent wants to work and where people of all races, gender, sexual orientation, disability status, veteran status or ethnicity can reach their full potential.\n\nOur approach to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) isn\u2019t limited to broadening the representation of those working within the top levels of our own firm and creating a more inclusive environment. We also look at diversity holistically, thinking of ways to widen our impact for our suppliers, clients, customers and communities we serve. Learn about our Action for Racial Equity plan to help close the racial wealth gap and increase economic mobility in the United States.\n\nPay Equity\n\nWe continue to disclose our adjusted and unadjusted (or \u201craw\u201d) pay gaps for both women and U.S. minorities to hold ourselves accountable for making progress.\n\nThe adjusted pay gap is a true measure of pay equity, or \u201clike for like,\u201d that compares the compensation of women to men and U.S. minorities to non-minorities when adjusting for factors such as job function, title/level and geography. The raw gap measures the difference in median compensation when we don\u2019t adjust for any of the aforementioned factors.\n\nThe existence of our raw pay gap reflects a need to increase representation of women and U.S. minorities in senior and higher-paying roles.\n\nOur latest results, released in early 2022, found that, on an adjusted basis, women globally are paid on average more than 99% of what men are paid at Citi, and that there was no statistically significant difference in adjusted compensation for U.S. minorities and non-minorities. Following the review, appropriate pay adjustments were made as part of Citi\u2019s 2021 compensation cycle.\n\nThe Interconnected Nature of Pay Gaps and Representation Goals\n\nCiti was the first company to disclose adjusted pay results, and in 2019 we became one of the first companies to disclose our unadjusted or \u201craw\u201d pay gaps for both women and U.S. minorities. Being transparent about our median pay helped us achieve our firm-wide, aspirational representation goals in 2021. By increasing representation of women and U.S. minorities in higher-compensated roles, we can continue to work toward closing the raw pay gaps.\nCiti\u2019s 2021 raw gap analysis showed that the median pay for women globally is 74% of the median for men, similar to 2020 and up from 73% in 2019 and 71% in 2018; the median pay for U.S. minorities was more than 96% of the median for non-minorities, which is up from just under 94% in 2020, 94% in 2019 and 93% in 2018. Continuing to reduce our raw pay gap requires that we increase representation of women and U.S. minorities in senior roles across the firm.\n\nThese pay equity reviews represent a \u201cmoment in time\u201d snapshot of our employee base, which is constantly changing as people come in and out of the firm, as colleagues are promoted and as market dynamics change. We\u2019re continuing to innovate how we recruit and develop talent and to use data more effectively to help us increase diversity at more senior levels at Citi. Our philosophy is that every member of Citi\u2019s team is responsible for progress in making Citi an even more inclusive and equitable workplace.\n\nCiti collaborated with The Female Quotient, a women-owned business dedicated to advancing equality in the workplace, to develop a free digital tool that provides companies with a snapshot of their raw pay gap. We view it as a way to further equity across all types of companies and see it as a concrete measure to increase diversity more broadly. For more information, visit The Female Quotient\u2019s Advancing Equality Calculator\u2122.\n\n**Representation Goals**\n\nIn 2018, we set aspirational representation goals to increase women leadership globally and Black leadership in the United States at the firm by the end of 2021. We are pleased to share that Citi exceeded these goals. Globally, we increased representation at the Assistant Vice President to Managing Director levels for women to 40.6% (up from 37% in 2018), and in the United States we increased Black representation for those same job levels to 8.1% (up from 6% in 2018). Additionally, when we include colleagues in the United States who self-identify as two or more races, Black representation at the same job levels increased to 9.1%.\n\nOur commitment doesn\u2019t stop here, and we recognize there\u2019s still work to do to build a more diverse, equitable and inclusive firm. We will build and expand on our representation goals in the future and will continue to be transparent while holding ourselves accountable. Diversity, equity and inclusion factors, including the representation of women and racial/ethnic minorities, continue to be included in senior executives\u2019 scorecards. Learn more in the ESG at Citi section.\n\nPipeline analyses help us assess the availability and flow of diverse talent at Citi and how we can achieve better representation among women and racial/ethnic minorities. Such analyses also play an important role in succession planning at Citi, ensuring that we have diversity of employees who are ready for promotion now, and that we have appropriate development plans for those who would be ready for promotion in several years. Intentionality in talent development is essential if we\u2019re going to elevate more women and racial/ethnic minorities to high-level positions at Citi \u2013 and across our industry as a whole.\n\nAccording to McKinsey & Company, there\u2019s a strong business case for gender and racial diversity in corporate leadership, with the most diverse companies outperforming their peers on profitability. A report issued by McKinsey in 2020 found that companies in the top quartile for gender diversity on executive teams were 25% more likely to have above-average profitability than companies in the fourth quartile. That\u2019s up from 21% in 2017 and 15% in 2014.\n\nOur representation goals, as well as other work we are doing around gender equality in the workplace, directly contribute to SDG 5 in support of gender equality and empowering all women and girls. Specifically, we are enabling progress toward target 5.5, which aims to ensure women\u2019s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life.\n\nRead how we\u2019re supporting minority- and women-owned businesses in our supply chain.\n\n---\n\n1. McKinsey & Company, \u201cDiversity Wins: How Inclusion Matters\u201d May 2020.\nA Roadmap for Black Equity\n\nIn November 2021, we announced our participation in the Management Leadership for Tomorrow (MLT) Black Equity at Work Certification \u2014 a first-of-its-kind standard and roadmap for employers that want to achieve Black equity internally while supporting Black equity in society. Citi was the first major Wall Street bank to sign on. Our participation complements our Action for Racial Equity efforts, including our commitment to conduct a third-party racial equity audit. (Learn more in the Equitable and Resilient Communities section.)\n\nMLT\u2019s unique accreditation program calls on corporations to take a stand for Black equity and provides a critical resource for employers to make progress toward their Black equity goals. Through our participation in this program, Citi will receive MLT\u2019s expertise, counsel and feedback on our internal Black equity initiatives and practices, including how we can increase Black representation, drive equal pay and invest in Black equity causes. The validation process will help Citi develop a robust, comprehensive plan that will enable us to achieve a Black Equity at Work Certification in one to three years.\n\nDIVERSITY AT THE EXECUTIVE LEVEL\n\nGender equity is something we demonstrate from the very top of our organization. Jane Fraser is our first woman CEO \u2014 and was the first woman to lead a major Wall Street bank. Based on existing self-identification data, five (29%) of our 17-person Executive Management Team are women and six (35%) are racially/ethnically diverse. As of April 25, 2022, eight (53%) of the 15 members of our Board of Directors are women and three (20%) are racial/ethnic minorities. Citi was among the first financial services firms to achieve gender parity on its Board.\nRecruit, Retain and Promote\n\nWe are committed to continue building a team that is inclusive and representative of our customers and clients. To make progress, we have been evolving the way we bring new colleagues into Citi, including accelerating the use of diverse slates in our recruiting and deepening our capabilities to measure our success.\n\nIn 2021, we expanded the use of diverse slates in our recruiting to have at least two women and/or U.S. minorities in our interviews for U.S. hires and at least two women in our interviews for global hires. These include candidates at various senior levels, from Assistant Vice President to Managing Director. As of December, nearly 75% of roles that were posted globally included a diverse slate of candidates with at least two women and/or two U.S. minorities. In 2021, we launched a Diversity Sourcing team in the United States to consistently identify diverse talent in the marketplace and accelerate our hiring of diverse talent.\n\nWe have expanded engagement with external partners, including diversity professional organizations. These relationships have enhanced our ability to attract and hire mid- to senior-level talent demonstrating Citi\u2019s inclusive culture.\n\nCUPID BY THE NUMBERS\n\nThe Citi\u00ae University Partnerships in Innovation & Discovery (CUPID) Program embeds students from top universities in innovation activities across Citi. CUPID students \u2013 many of them underrepresented minorities \u2013 gain exposure to various aspects of our business and help us develop a robust, diverse pipeline of talent. Since we launched CUPID in 2017, we have:\n\n- Engaged 3,600+ students and early career professionals\n- Hired 202 CUPID participants\n- Hired 43 HBCU students\n- Worked with 90 colleges and universities, including 38 HBCUs\n- Hosted 40 events, such as hackathons, competitions and symposiums\n\nCampus Recruiting\n\nOur campus recruiting program is another important way for us to diversify our employee base, and we have a robust pipeline of talent from HBCUs and other leading universities.\n\n- Our Citi\u00ae University Partnerships in Innovation & Discovery (CUPID) Program enables us to accelerate innovation projects across Citi by engaging diverse students and developing a robust, diverse pipeline of talent from leading universities (see callout above).\n- In 2021, we held our third annual HBCU Innovation and Leadership Symposium, which brought together 42 first- and second-year students (58% first years and 32% sophomores) from 15 HBCUs for an introductory, virtual experience focused on helping them understand financial services, gain technical skills and kick off the career-planning process. While we would like the students to consider the possibility of a future with Citi, our primary goal is to provide them with helpful tools on their path to professional success, without regard for industry or profession.\n- Our Early Insights Programs for college students in their first and second years of undergraduate studies are focused on identifying, mentoring and hiring top diverse talent for summer analyst programs across the firm. These programs provide early exposure to, and education around, Citi\u2019s businesses, technical training, mentorship and culture.\n- Our Freshman Discovery Day is a two-day exploratory program that helps educate underrepresented minority college freshmen about the various roles in financial services.\n\nMILITARY OFFICER LEADERSHIP PROGRAM\n\nOur Military Officer Leadership Program (MOLP) focuses on recruiting, developing, training and preparing transitioning service members for mid- to senior-level leadership roles at Citi. Over a two-year time period, candidates rotate three times, giving them a peer network of mentorship and support and a path to a successful career at Citi. \u201cAs a former combat veteran, with no direct experience in the financial industry, the MOLP was a great opportunity,\u201d said Rob Carter, a graduate of the program who has been with Citi for about five years. \u201cThe exposure to different businesses allowed me to find an area within the firm that leveraged the skills I developed during my time in the Army,\u201d says Carter, Senior Vice President in Human Resources and one of the more than 2,400 U.S. employees who have disclosed their veteran status to us.\nCITI INTRODUCTION TO FINANCE\n\nMore than 1,000 people attended a virtual event in August geared toward mid- to senior-level Black talent. Our CFO Mark Mason and Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer Erika Irish Brown discussed their respective careers in finance. Several participants in the event interviewed for positions across the team.\n\n- Our Early Identification Program focuses on mentorship, interview preparation and best-in-class training to identify diverse talent for our summer analyst programs over a five-week period.\n- Sophomore Leadership Program provides hands-on work experience, mentorship, peer networking and necessary skills over a 10-week summer internship, to provide a pipeline into our full-time analyst programs.\n\nWe continue to partner with Jopwell, MLT, SEO and WayUp, U.S.-based recruiting platforms that attract diverse students, enabling our recruiters to communicate and engage with students to promote job opportunities. We were also honored to receive the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Award and received an Honorable Mention for Recruiting Excellence from the National Association of Colleges and Employers.\n\nDeveloping Diverse Talent\n\nHiring, promoting and retaining more women and racial/ethnic minorities in senior, high-paying roles is critical to our success \u2014 and key to helping solve the two-pronged issue of representation and pay equity. Career development is one of our top priorities, and we promote from within to continue developing our existing talent. In 2021, 41% of open positions at Citi were filled with internal candidates.\n\n\u201cOwning My Success\u201d (OMS), for example, is a group coaching program for Black colleagues that provides exposure to Citi\u2019s senior leadership and supports professional and personal development. More than 700 Black colleagues have participated in OMS since the program began in 2018. Over the course of several months, participants join group coaching circles, led by an external executive coach and a senior leader at Citi. Managers of the participants also take part in group coaching to better understand the experience of Black colleagues in the workplace.\n\nRepresentation in Our Analyst and Associate Programs\n\n**ASPIRATIONAL GOAL: 50% women globally for our analyst and associate programs**\n\n| Year | Women Representation |\n|------|----------------------|\n| 2019 | 45%                  |\n| 2021 | 52%                  |\n\n**ASPIRATIONAL GOAL: 30% Black and Hispanic/Latino in the United States for our analyst and associate programs**\n\n| Year | Black and Hispanic/Latino Representation |\n|------|-----------------------------------------|\n| 2019 | 18%                                     |\n| 2021 | 29%                                     |\n\nCITI ON THE VINEYARD RECRUITMENT\n\nFollowing a successful recruitment event in 2019, Citi held a second recruitment event on Martha\u2019s Vineyard in Massachusetts for Black students to network with industry professionals and learn about potential career paths in financial services. In total, 20+ college students and 12 high school students attended the August 2021 event. Two of the college students were selected for our Early ID Leadership Program, and we\u2019re inviting the high school students to return to future programming.\nCiti Personal Banking & Wealth Management and our Risk and Controls group each piloted advocacy programs for underrepresented talent in 2021, pairing participants with senior leaders to offer career advice and support. Black Leaders for Tomorrow, an initiative within the Institutional Clients Group, also offers an Advocacy program for Black directors. More than 600 Black employees each year participate in one of five programs offered through Black Leaders for Tomorrow.\n\nWe also launched the Black Managing Director Engagement initiative, a quarterly small group gathering of Executive Management Team members and Black Managing Directors who get to know each other, share ideas on ways to enhance Citi\u2019s strategy and discuss opportunities for personal and professional growth.\n\nOur Role-Based Assessment Program, meanwhile, focuses on building a robust succession plan for our Black and women leaders. The career development program includes executive assessment and coaching. In 2021, 31 high-performing Black and women Managing Directors and Directors were selected for the program.\n\nWe provide a range of internal development and rotational programs for leaders at all levels, and we continued to evolve our learning programs to meet new needs. Our Citi Women\u2019s Leadership Development Program was held remotely in 2021, bringing together a group of Senior Vice Presidents and Directors from around the world to network and develop leadership skills.\n\nIn Latin America, our Women\u2019s Virtual Development Program continues to be one of our most valued in the region, with more than 1,600 participants in 2021. Across Asia Pacific, 780 participants joined one of four programs supporting women as they transition to more senior roles. And in Europe, for our \u201creverse mentoring\u201d program, we paired senior leaders from the region with junior mentors from the LGBTQ+ community. The goal of the program, which was subsequently rolled out in Latin America, Asia Pacific and the United States, was to educate the mentees about the lived experience of their LGBTQ+ colleagues.\n\nTo better support our colleagues with disabilities, we made enhancements to our tools and resources to build a more inclusive workplace, including a strong team of doctors, digital accessibility experts and accommodations specialists. The Global Consumer Technology team launched a partnership with Neurodiverse Solutions (formerly Autism2Work), and in May 2021, the team added five contractors who have autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, to the Global Consumer Bank ATM team based in our Florence, Kentucky, ATM Lab. After seeing such strong results in just six months, the Neurodiverse Solutions program has expanded across Citi with 12 contractors and plans to grow the team to 50 contractors by the end of 2022. Citi recently began a partnership with Disability:IN, a global nonprofit resource for disability inclusion. Disability:IN partners with over 400 companies worldwide with the vision to create an inclusive global economy where people with disabilities participate fully and meaningfully.\n\nThe Black Women at Citi Power Panel, presented by Black Women at Citi and Citi Inspires, was a successful hybrid event in 2021, with 3,300 colleagues tuning in. A panel of senior Black women at the firm discussed mental health, work/life balance, self-advocacy, building community, sponsorship and career development. Following the panel, our Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer and Global Head of Talent, Erika Irish Brown, hosted a fireside chat with Grammy-award winner Gladys Knight.\n\n**PARTNERSHIP WITH THE EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP COUNCIL**\n\nWe invest in career development and planning for diverse talent through mentorship, networking, rotational programs and partnerships, such as our longstanding relationship with The Executive Leadership Council (ELC). In 2021, we signed a million-dollar, multiyear agreement with ELC to enhance our investment in Black leadership and establish a cohesive development journey and continuum for Citi\u2019s Black leaders. Through this partnership, Citi plans to help develop 850 mid- to senior-level employees over three years. The program is focused on Black colleagues at the Assistant Vice President through Managing Director levels who are tapped for further development at Citi. The intent is to invest in their continued professional growth and mobility by providing personalized coaching and greater exposure to senior-level leaders.\n2021 Managing Director Diversity\n\nCiti promotes a new class of Managing Directors (MD) each year. This is the highest officer level at Citi and is a testament to these individuals\u2019 performance and commitment to living our Leadership Principles \u2013 Taking Ownership, Delivering With Pride and Succeeding Together \u2013 and instilling them throughout their teams and the entire firm.\n\nFor our 2021 class, we promoted 306 MDs, who are based in 30 countries and represent one of the largest and most diverse classes in recent years.\n\n**SUMMARY BY GEOGRAPHY**\n\n**NORTH AMERICA**\n\n\u2640 150 | 49%\n\n**EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA**\n\n\u2640 86 | 28.1%\n\n**LATIN AMERICA**\n\n\u2640 18 | 5.9%\n\n**ASIA PACIFIC**\n\n\u2640 52 | 17%\n\n**30 countries in 2021**\n\n**UNITED STATES**\n\n53 racial/ethnic minorities (out of the 150 promoted)\n\n35.3% of the new MD class was racially/ethnically diverse\n\n**ASIAN**\n\n19.3% 29 Colleagues\n\n**BLACK**\n\n2.7% 4 Colleagues\n\n**HISPANIC/LATINO**\n\n14.0% 21 Colleagues\n\n**SUMMARY BY YEAR**\n\nLargest class in recent years\n\nAverage Tenure\n\n12.4 Years\n\n306 Promotions in 2021\n\n241 in 2020\n\n220 in 2019\n\n198 in 2018\n\n178 in 2017\n\nThe most women promoted in recent years\n\n106 in 2021\n\n70 in 2020\n\n62 in 2019\n\n49 in 2018\n\n49 in 2017\n\nHighest representation in recent years 36%\nMost Powerful Women in Banking Awards\n\nEight senior leaders at Citi were recognized among American Banker's 2021 \u201cMost Powerful Women\u201d rankings.

We work hard to establish a strong DEI foundation for the company at all levels, creating paths for the next generation of leaders across every dimension of diversity.\n\nWe want all of our colleagues to feel empowered to share all aspects of their identity so that we may continue to honor what makes them diverse and unique while also strengthening a culture that values and promotes diverse perspectives.\n\nCore to our data-driven approach is gaining better understanding of how our employees self-identify so that we can better meet their needs. In 2021 we launched a global Self-ID campaign to nearly 190,000 employees (90% of our workforce), who were invited to self-identify their race and ethnicity, gender identities, sexual orientation, disability status and military status, as permissible by local laws and regulations in the 46 countries we survey. For 2021, we expanded the sexual orientation dimension from 15 to 34 countries and the race and ethnicity dimension from 18 to 31 countries. Additionally, we continued to encourage the reporting of multiple races/ethnicities for those employees who self-identify as such by enabling the selection of specific races/ethnicities. We achieved a response rate of nearly 100% for global gender and U.S. race/ethnicity.\n\nSee our employment data for more information about our workforce composition.\nOur Employee Networks in Action: 2021\n\nOur Employee Network chapters serve as local representatives of our Affinities. Initiated and led by colleagues at our work sites, the Networks offer professional development, mentoring, networking and community engagement opportunities to members and colleagues. Consistent with our inclusive culture, Employee Network chapters are open to all Citi employees, regardless of whether they identify with a particular Affinity. Each of our nine Affinities is co-led by a member of our CEO\u2019s leadership team. The number of our global Employee Network chapters increased from 198 in 2020 to 226 in 2021, while the total number of unique members in the groups increased from 21,420 to 26,950 globally. The following are some examples of our colleagues\u2019 experiences from participating in our Affinities.\n\nAsian Heritage\n\nSTELLA YU, TORONTO\nSENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, HUMAN RESOURCES\n\n\u201cI always feel my intersectionality being a woman, an Asian and an immigrant is celebrated at Citi, and my perspectives are valued by my co-workers. I received overwhelming support from our senior leaders when I first approached them with the idea to initiate an Asian Heritage Network in Canada. Working remotely and separated from families during the pandemic have been very challenging for many in the Asian communities, who experienced or witnessed race-based abuse, hate and even violence. Citi\u2019s Affinity networks have created a safe space for us to share emotions and offer support to each other. Being able to support my community at work adds a sense of purpose and belonging for me.\u201d\n\nBlack Heritage\n\nKATRINA GERALD, CHARLOTTE, N.C.\nSENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, PERSONAL BANKING & WEALTH MANAGEMENT\n\n\u201cIn addition to learning even more about my own culture as a part of the Black Heritage Network, I have also been able to expand my network, increase my exposure to Citi leaders and focus on career development through many of the lessons learned from the network\u2019s events and sessions. This is also true regarding all of the employee networks sponsored by Citi. Citi truly exemplifies a diverse, equitable and inclusive culture through the Employee Network program and through the act of investing in cultures and communities within and beyond our Citi walls.\u201d\n\nCiti Salutes\u00ae\n\nGRAHAM LEWIS, NEW YORK\nASSISTANT VICE PRESIDENT, INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS GROUP\n\n\u201cA veteran Citi employee, who is now my mentor, reached out to me when I was in college and helped me get my foot in the door at Citi. That kindness toward veterans really resonated with me, and I immediately began getting involved with Citi Salutes and North America Service Initiative groups. I started off small by taking on volunteer responsibilities such as our USO Bike Build and Thank You Card events, and with each new opportunity I was able to meet so many unique people who also wanted to help veterans. I am proud to serve as the Citi Salutes New York Chapter co-chair and always look forward to working with our other New York-based networks.\u201d\nOur Employee Networks in Action: 2021 (continued)\n\nCiti Women\nLU SHI, CHINA\nMANAGING DIRECTOR, RISK\n\nCiti Women Networks in Asia had a momentous year with many key initiatives and successful program launches. For example, here in China we launched a maternity buddy program that received overwhelmingly positive reviews from those who participated. We also partnered with other networks to lead November Gratitude Month, where we sent out 8,000 thank you cards to employees and staff, building on our already strong sense of community and showcasing our leadership principle of \u2018We Succeed Together.\u2019 Citi Women has brought tremendous value to my own experience and to Citi overall by creating an inclusive culture for women to thrive.\u201d\n\nDisability\nPATRICK MORAN, UNITED KINGDOM\nDIRECTOR, OPERATIONS TECHNOLOGY\n\nI was originally approached to join London Disability Network in 2006 and found a fantastic group of folks looking to ensure that anyone with a disability, injury or illness felt that they had a voice. I went on to serve as co-chair for the London Disability Network on two occasions, where I believe we enhanced representation, engaged with senior management and weaved inclusion into the business conversation. I am a firm believer that as an employee I need to set an example on how, with the right level of support from my amazing managers over the years, I was able to grow my career and begin to ask not what Citi can do for me, but what can I do for Citi and the disability community. I have been working with various groups and technology experts to raise the understanding on how assistive technology enables inclusion. By being myself, I have allowed my managers to be their very best for me, and together we can work on what we need to do to support our clients.\u201d\n\nFamilies Matter\nLUCIANA ZONZINI, BRAZIL\nMANAGING DIRECTOR, BANKING, CAPITAL, MARKETS AND ADVISORY\n\nThe Networks have the incredible mission to not only act upon the specific themes of each of the diversity groups, but also to expand the overall engagement and awareness among our population \u2013 creating an environment for empathy, connection and \u2018call to action.\u2019 In that sense, Families Matter provides us the amazing opportunity to work across Affinities: learning, supporting and acting together, especially in a moment when work, home and families are more intertwined than ever before. Understanding the realities and particularities of our diverse team and acting together with other Affinities allows us to support our Citi family.\u201d\n\nGenerations\nNUR\u2019I LIM, MALAYSIA\nVICE PRESIDENT, INDEPENDENT COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nI have been with the firm for almost a decade, and I am really proud of how we have stepped up in recent years to strategize on diversity, equity and inclusion efforts to create an inclusive culture at Citi. Our colleagues who participated in Network initiatives continuously share feedback that they experience great value and learnings from our content. I am especially fond of sessions where safe spaces are created to speak up. Inviting people to talk about topics relating to diversity, equity and inclusion increases awareness so we can break down barriers and enable people to be comfortable with certain topics. This helps create an understanding of the role we can all play in supporting one another.\u201d\nOur Employee Networks in Action: 2021 (continued)\n\nHispanic/Latino Heritage\n\nARLET BALTAZAR, CHICAGO\nASSISTANT VICE PRESIDENT,\nMARKETING OPERATIONS,\nPERSONAL BANKING & WEALTH MANAGEMENT\n\nI raised my hand to be part of the Hispanic/Latino Heritage network shortly after joining Citi in 2018 as a Senior Executive Assistant. I hadn\u2019t met many colleagues who looked like me in my office, and the Network has provided me with a sense of community. Working closely with our Hispanic/Latino Affinity leadership on a membership drive initiative, the group I began to work with brings co-chairs from all of our 11 chapters in the United States and United Kingdom together on a monthly cadence, where we exchange ideas collectively. This leadership role has allowed me to hone my public speaking and presentation skills, as well as pursue opportunities to develop a network of connections I wouldn\u2019t have otherwise encountered. I\u2019m certain it has prepared me for my role as a recently promoted Assistant Vice President.\u201d\n\nPride\n\nJOSEPH HERNANDEZ, MEXICO\nVICE PRESIDENT, TRANSFORMATION OPERATIONS\n\nThe value I\u2019ve gotten from the Pride Network is the ability to see not only tangible and measurable results from our network\u2019s projects as we progressed, but also the positive and proactive feedback from folks who have benefited from our efforts. Hearing from both senior leaders and LGBTQ+ people on their beneficial experiences and how this has impacted their work lives has made all the difference. Being able to connect with colleagues from other regions, learn from each other and work together has been a great experience. Specifically, being able to lead the Citi SpeakOUT project with other colleagues from North America and Latin America has been one of the best experiences I\u2019ve had at Citi. Providing access to opportunities for development, such as the Out & Equal Summit and the LGBTQ+ Development Program, are just some of the many ways we support one another.\u201d\n\nRoots\n\nMEGS NAIDU, SOUTH AFRICA\nVICE PRESIDENT, COMPLIANCE GOVERNANCE\n\nSouth Africa has a unique history rooted in racial inequities. The goal of the network is to create a safe space for employees to have open and transparent discussions on the topic of race without fear of retribution. The network is employee-led. Since launching in early 2021, it has already hosted several workshops and events with the goal of providing employees with the correct tools to assess and address situations involving racial matters.\u201d\nEmployee Network Listening Tour\n\nIn 2021, we held our first ever \u201cVoice of the People\u201d listening tour to help us understand what our Affinities mean to our colleagues. More than 800 Citi employees attended in-person and virtual sessions to share their views on our Affinity Networks and to offer ideas about what we can do to make them more impactful. More than 80% of participants said they joined one of the Affinities for networking opportunities.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nGoal\nLearn about the DEI issues that are most important to you\n\n4 Regions\n10 Networks\n11 Sessions\n800 Colleagues\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n82% cited learning from and supporting colleagues as their top reasons for joining Network\n\n78% believe senior leaders are committed to advancing DEI across the firm\n\n68% cited educating managers on DEI goals and senior leader advocacy as the top two ways Citi can create a more inclusive culture\n\nADDITIONAL FEEDBACK: WHAT OUR COLLEAGUES ARE ASKING FOR\n\nSENIOR LEADERSHIP ROUNDTABLES AND QUARTERLY TOWNHALLS TO UNDERSTAND DEI STRATEGY\n\nMORE MENTORSHIP/SPONSORSHIP OPPORTUNITIES\n\nMore diverse interview panels\n\nGreater global connectivity\n\nREPRESENTATION GOALS FOR MORE GROUPS\n\nINCREASED MIDDLE MANAGEMENT SUPPORT FOR DEI INITIATIVES\n\nMore visibility of self-identifying senior leaders\n\nImproved alignment between networks and Affinities\n\nYear-end performance analysis for diverse groups\nVoice of the Employee\n\nOur annual Voice of the Employee (VOE) survey provides valuable insights regarding employee engagement and perceptions about our firm \u2013 our successes as well as our pain points. In 2021, participation was high \u2013 87% of colleagues globally responded. We heard employees are embracing the Leadership Principles we rolled out in March, with all three principles approaching 90% favorability. Overall, 91% of employees said they are proud to work for Citi and felt that our commitments to an ethical culture and diversity are strong.\n\nNearly 90% of employees said their managers promote diversity, equity and inclusion on their teams. But many colleagues are looking for their managers to provide greater support in their career development \u2013 a perennial area for improvement across the firm.\n\nWhile colleagues gave us high marks for our response to COVID-19, employees shared they are feeling the strain of life during the pandemic and increased workloads. These feelings were especially acute among our women colleagues. Their responses have reaffirmed the importance of our efforts, and we will continue to address this feedback to help relieve stress, simplify our working processes, develop tools for collaboration and ensure that our managers continue to support their people.\n\n2021 Survey Highlights\n\nLIVING OUR LEADERSHIP PRINCIPLES\n\n92%\nMy team prioritized the work that helps Citi succeed\n\n89%\nMy manager promotes diversity, equity and inclusion in our team\n\nWe Take Ownership\n88%\n\nWe Deliver With Pride\n89%\n\nWe Succeed Together\n86%\n\nCORE INDICES\n\nDiversity\n85%\n2020 86%\n2019 81%\n\nEngagement\n79%\n2020 82%\n2019 74%\n\nEthical Culture\n91%\n2020 91%\n2019 89%\n\nManager Effectiveness\n84%\n2020 84%\n2019 81%\n\nCOVID-19 RESPONSE\n\nCiti is effectively communicating its plans and response to COVID-19\n\n91%\nUsing Our Corporate Voice to Drive Change\n\nAt Citi, we believe we can use our power as a global bank to effect social change, and we continue to take a stand on a wide range of issues, such as racial and pay equity, immigration, gun violence and climate change. We also believe it\u2019s important to speak up and speak out on issues that impact our colleagues.\n\nFor example, in the United States in 2021, there was an alarming rise in bills proposed at the state level that would single out LGBTQ+ individuals for exclusion or differential treatment. Legislation promoting discrimination could negatively impact our colleagues and their families, as well as our clients, customers and our business. In May, Citi signed the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s Business Statement Opposing Anti-LGBTQ+ State Legislation, reiterating our belief that all people have a fundamental right to equality and our opposition to harmful legislation aimed at restricting the access of LGBTQ+ people in society.\n\nCiti has a long history of outspoken advocacy for the LGBTQ+ community. In 2020, Citi became the first major bank to provide transgender and nonbinary customers with the ability to have account profiles and credit cards that match their chosen first name. Since the initial launch, more than 18,000 consumers have updated their Citi U.S. branded credit cards with their chosen name. Learn more in the Serving Our Customers and Clients Responsibly section.\n\nWhen members of the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community endured rising instances of violence in response to the pandemic, our Executive Management Team condemned the xenophobia while voicing support for our AAPI colleagues and the broader community. We also held internal listening sessions and hosted community forums to show our support for our employees. Watch a public service message we produced. We hosted a \u201cHollaback Bystander Intervention\u201d training, which is designed to provide colleagues with practical tactics on how to intervene in a safe way if they witness an incident in public. In 2021, we hosted three sessions, and more than 500 colleagues joined the training. We plan to host additional sessions in 2022.\n\nWe also expanded our partnership with Ascend, a non-profit organization focused on professional development of the AAPI community, and sponsored the Ascend National Convention week, which more than 200 colleagues attended.\n\nFurthermore, Citi was one of many U.S. businesses that condemned efforts in 2021 to restrict voting access in the state of Georgia. We opposed voting restriction laws because we believed it would \u201cundermine the ability of Americans to avail themselves of this fundamental right.\u201d\n\nMARKING HOLIDAYS OF SIGNIFICANCE\n\nStarting in 2022, we have a new paid holiday for U.S. employees: Juneteenth Day, a federal holiday that marks the end of slavery. We also had the opportunity to be more inclusive and acknowledge Indigenous Peoples Day in addition to Columbus Day. In 2020, Citi implemented one additional floating holiday called Heritage Day, which employees can take at any time to honor a day of personal significance.\n\nFor 17 consecutive years, Citi has received a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation\u2019s Corporate Equality Index, a national survey that benchmarks corporate policies and practices for LGBTQ+ workplace quality.\nFair Employment Practices\n\nWe strive to maintain an environment in which development opportunities are widely available, where people are hired and advanced on their merits and where our employees treat each other with respect. We are fully committed to equal employment opportunities, fair employment practices and nondiscrimination. For more information, see the Human Rights section of this report, our Code of Conduct and our website for policies around fair employment and compensation. More information can also be found in the GRI Index of this report.\nEmployment Data\n\n**TOTAL EMPLOYEE HEADCOUNT**\n\n- **223,449** Total Employees\n  - **220,975** Full-Time\n  - **2,474**

and Clients Responsibly\n125  Human Rights\n134  Responsible Sourcing\nOur Transformation\n\nThrough our transformation we are working to modernize and simplify the bank so that we can better manage risk, improve our service to customers and clients and make Citi an easier place to work. Through the modernization of our data infrastructure and operations, and by evolving our culture, we are strengthening our safety and soundness as a bank and improving our ability to compete in the digital age.\n\nTransforming Our Risk and Control Environment\n\nIn October 2020, the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued consent orders to Citi requiring improvements in the way we manage enterprise-wide risk, compliance, data and internal controls. This, combined with an increasingly competitive landscape and our clients\u2019 acceleration toward digital solutions through the pandemic, became the catalyst for Citi\u2019s transformation strategy.\n\nCiti has been in operation for more than 200 years. But our transformation isn\u2019t about looking back; it\u2019s about looking ahead, to become an even stronger bank for all our stakeholders. This transformation is an interconnected, enterprise-wide effort. In addition to remediating issues, we are addressing root causes, simplifying the way we operate and doing so more effectively. We are redesigning our key processes from end to end, automating them and ensuring we have the proper controls in place while eliminating complexity.\n\nOUR DATA GOVERNANCE PROGRAM\n\nData quality is one of the areas of focus for our transformation. To lead this effort, we have established a Data Governance Program to elevate our data governance and to help drive necessary improvements to our technology and processes. Our goal is to make it easier to locate, collect and use the information our colleagues need to do their jobs and mitigate risk.\n\nIn 2021, we rewrote our Citi Data Governance Policy (which governs how we manage and use our data) to be more concise, provide greater clarity and embed accountability across the firm. The policy clarifies and simplifies the way we govern data, with a focus on achieving access to trusted, high-quality data in a controlled way.\n\nGovernance and Leadership\n\nPutting the right teams and governance in place is critical to creating consistency in our approach across the firm and driving the ultimate success of our transformation.\n\nOur Transformation Steering Committee, chaired by our CEO, sets the overall direction for our transformation efforts and communicates progress to our Board of Directors, as well as seeks input and feedback from the Board. In addition, one or more members of our Executive Management Team lead program groups that are central to our transformation. To encourage enterprise-wide engagement, each of these groups includes representation from across our businesses and functions. The executives in charge of these programs are held accountable for their group\u2019s success, and their compensation is linked to achieving results.\n\nSenior leaders are setting the tone for their teams, showing a high level of engagement with, and commitment to, our transformation activities.\nOur Path to Transformation\n\nTo establish a baseline for our transformation strategy, we conducted a gap analysis exercise, started in 2020 and completed in 2021, to review the issues raised in the consent orders and define the gap between where we were and where we need to be. Following the gap analysis, we designed a roadmap to get us to our target state. The roadmap comprises several distinct areas that feed into Citi\u2019s integrated vision of transformation for our company.\n\nOne of the first actions we undertook in 2021 was to develop and roll out a new Enterprise Risk Management Framework to assess risk across our enterprise. The integrated approach of the framework seeks to drive consistency across key areas of risk, strengthening the way the firm identifies, measures and monitors risk so that we can implement appropriate controls and reporting mechanisms. The framework helps bring consistency and structure to the varied types of risks we face across Citi \u2013 leading to better scenario-planning, stress testing and root-cause analyses across the risk lifecycle.\n\nAll colleagues are empowered to apply the Enterprise Risk Management Framework to their work and are responsible for promptly escalating risk-related concerns. We rolled out training on the new framework to all employees globally in 2021, and 98% completed the training by the end of the year.\n\nWe are also developing standards, plans and training curricula for a more modern, streamlined approach to our control environment, which we will be implementing in future years. For example, we are ensuring that when incidents arise, our employees can conduct robust root-cause analyses and then apply the lessons learned horizontally across the organization to prevent similar issues from arising elsewhere.\n\nIn addition, we are working to simplify, streamline and automate our controls \u2013 strengthening our ability to prevent issues, not just to detect them after they arise.\n\nTo empower our employees and increase the effectiveness of their day-to-day work, we are undertaking a full update of our policies to make them easier to understand and take action against. We\u2019re also planning to migrate our policies to a new platform in 2023, making them easier to access and navigate.\n\nDuring 2021, we continued to build teams focused on transformation activities across the company. These teams are a hybrid of employees with a depth of institutional knowledge and newer employees who bring diverse expertise and perspectives.\n\nEnterprise Risk Management Framework\n\nRisk Management Lifecycle\n\nCiti\u2019s Approach to Managing Risk:\n\n- Culture\n- Enterprise Programs\n- Risk Management\n- Governance\n\nTALENT | TECHNOLOGY AND DATA | ANALYTICS\nAccountability, Culture and Talent\n\nOur transformation is underpinned by a fundamental reset of our approach to culture and talent, to strengthen risk management and our control environment. We believe this will allow us to build a culture of excellence in which we each take ownership for managing risk and controls and where we continue to take pride in working together to always do the right thing for our clients, colleagues and communities.\n\nTo achieve this, we introduced a new set of Leadership Principles in 2021, to help us embed the behaviors and conditions we need in order to sustain the changes we are making as part of our transformation. To further embed the Leadership Principles, Citi is deploying a three-year, firm-wide culture change program, designed to change the way we work by introducing small, everyday habits that we can all adopt to make Citi a stronger, simpler and more enjoyable place to work.\n\nWe are working to ensure that we have the right number of employees with the right skills in place to achieve risk and control excellence, and that we use our employee development programs, promotion and performance management processes and compensation to reinforce and incentivize that excellence. Our compensation structure captures individual impacts on risk and control, and each of our employees has a related performance goal they are working toward.\n\nEthics and Culture at Citi\n\nEach of our employees shares a common responsibility to earn and maintain our clients\u2019 trust by applying our values and principles every day, to everything they do, wherever Citi operates. We expect our employees to prioritize excellence \u2013 for our clients, in our operations, and in our risk and controls environment \u2013 and to provide our products, services and expertise in a systemically responsible manner, while complying with all applicable laws, regulations and Citi policies. To reinforce this, we establish and communicate our core values and principles through our Mission and Value Proposition, our Leadership Principles, Citi\u2019s Code of Conduct, various training and development opportunities, employee engagement initiatives and communications from our senior leaders.\n\nTone from the Top\n\nWe foster a culture of ethics through our governance framework, programs and efforts that embed our culture and expectations for behavior throughout the organization. Our approach begins with a strong \u201ctone from the top,\u201d starting with our Board of Directors. With oversight from the Ethics, Conduct and Culture Committee of the Board, our senior leaders consistently reinforce a culture of ethics, appropriate conduct and accountability within the organization, and empower our employees to make ethical decisions, escalate issues and adhere to Citi\u2019s standards of conduct.\n\nWE ASK OUR COLLEAGUES GLOBALLY TO ENSURE THAT THEIR DECISIONS PASS THREE TESTS:\n\n- They are in our clients\u2019 interests.\n- They create economic value.\n- They are always systemically responsible.\n\nThese three tests help our colleagues to responsibly deliver on our core activities of safeguarding assets, lending money, making payments and accessing capital markets on behalf of our clients \u2013 each of which creates an obligation to act with integrity, to do everything possible to create the best outcomes for our clients, and to prudently manage risk. The tests demonstrate our commitment to using good judgment and taking pride in doing the right thing \u2013 even when it\u2019s not the easiest thing.\nActing with Integrity\n\nWe empower our employees to do what\u2019s right by setting clear expectations through our Mission and Value Proposition, Leadership Principles and Code of Conduct, as well as by providing the tools and resources our employees need to act ethically, along with clear information about the various resources available to escalate concerns.\n\nCode of Conduct\n\nCiti\u2019s Code of Conduct outlines the standards of ethics and professional behavior expected of employees and representatives of Citi when dealing with clients, business colleagues, shareholders, communities and each other. It also provides an overview of key legal and regulatory requirements and select global policies.\n\nOur Code reinforces for employees that Citi\u2019s culture is one in which we take pride in always doing the right thing, hold ourselves and each other accountable, and feel comfortable and equipped to promptly escalate concerns about actual or potential misconduct. It also reflects Citi\u2019s ongoing commitment to fostering a culture of diversity and inclusion \u2013 one in which doing the right thing includes showing empathy for our colleagues, clients and communities; treating each other with respect and civility; and continuing to invest in colleagues from all backgrounds.\n\nCiti\u2019s Code of Conduct applies to all directors, officers and employees of Citi worldwide. Upon joining Citi, employees must acknowledge that they have read and will comply with our Code. To best serve our global workforce, we publish our Code of Conduct in 21 languages and make it publicly available on our Investor Relations website. Individuals performing services for Citi may also be subject to our Code by contract or agreement. As explicitly stated in our Code, violations can result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment or other relationship with Citi.\n\nWe provide Code of Conduct training to new hires globally when they join Citi, as well as to nonemployee contingent workers performing services for Citi at their time of onboarding. In addition, we ask employees and contingent workers to periodically reaffirm their commitment to our Code through required Code of Conduct training. The training includes hypothetical work-related ethical scenarios that focus on making good decisions and performing our work in a way that is consistent with Citi\u2019s values, culture, applicable laws, and Citi policies, standards and procedures. The training includes hypothetical work-related situations that allow employees to practice ethical decision-making and reinforce key concepts from our Code of Conduct, Mission and Value Proposition and our Leadership Principles. Like our Code of Conduct, the training emphasizes employees\u2019 obligation to promptly report actual or suspected misconduct and provides information on the various resources available to them to do so.\n\nLeadership Principles\n\nIn early 2021, we launched a new set of Leadership Principles that reflect the behaviors and expectations we have for ourselves in line with our transformation to become a better, stronger bank. We encourage all employees to demonstrate the Leadership Principles in all that they do. Holding ourselves and each other to these high standards is part of our culture and our commitment to operating in our clients\u2019 best interests, driving economic value and managing risk.\n\nWe expect managers to lead by example and inspire their employees to live Citi\u2019s values. Every manager is responsible for creating a work environment that is free of\ndiscrimination, harassment and retaliation. Managers are expected to reinforce the importance of following our Leadership Principles, Code of Conduct and Mission and Value Proposition, as well as to encourage employees to speak up and raise any concerns about potential legal or ethical issues. Managers must properly resolve or promptly escalate concerns through appropriate channels, promote awareness of all resources available for reporting concerns and neither engage in, nor tolerate, retaliation of any kind.\n\n**Escalating Business and Ethical Concerns**\n\nEach member of our workforce plays a critical role in escalating business and ethical concerns so that they can be addressed quickly and effectively. Citi\u2019s Code of Conduct emphasizes the principle that, when in doubt, employees should always err on the side of escalation. Our Code provides an overview of the types of misconduct and concerns that require escalation and the resources available to employees for prompt escalation of concerns, as well as a link to the full Citi Escalation Policy, which provides even more information for employees about escalation requirements and resources.\n\nAs part of Citi\u2019s escalation resources, the Ethics Hotline provides multiple channels for employees and any third party, including members of the general public, to report concerns about unethical behavior to Citi\u2019s Ethics Office. In addition to internal and public-facing websites (enhanced in January 2022 with upgraded features) that facilitate submission of concerns, a telephone line is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with live operators who can connect to translators in multiple languages.\n\nWe believe it is essential that individuals feel secure when raising a concern. All contacts to the Ethics Office and Ethics Office investigations are treated as confidentially as possible, consistent with the need to investigate and address the matter, and subject to applicable laws and regulations. Concerns may be raised either anonymously or with attribution, subject to applicable laws and regulations. Further, Citi prohibits any form of retaliation against anyone who raises a concern or question regarding ethics, discrimination or harassment matters, as well as against anyone who participates in a subsequent investigation. Employees who engage in retaliation against a colleague because they raised a concern or question, asked for a reasonable accommodation, reported a violation or was involved in an investigation are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or other relationship with Citi.\n\n**ASSESSING OUR CULTURE OF ETHICS**\n\nHearing from employees is one important way we assess the strength of ethics and accountability across our company. As part of Citi\u2019s annual Voice of the Employee survey, we include an Ethical Culture Index to gather feedback from employees about the following items:\n\n- Comfort with reporting unethical practices without fear of reprisal\n- A feeling of accountability to identify and escalate issues\n- Confidence that Citi will act upon reported legal or ethical violations\n- A belief that colleagues act with integrity\n- Manager encouragement of ethical conduct even in the face of pressure\n\nIndex results stayed stable in 2021, with 91% of our employees responding positively to the index. We will continue to listen to our employees and raise the bar in this area.\n\n**Staying on Top of Your Ethical Game**\n\nThrough our global Ethical Fitness Challenge, led by our Executive Management Team, we provided employees with the equipment they needed to get in their best ethical shape. Through this campaign, we released a series of eight modules over three years, incorporating senior leader videos, case studies and knowledge checks, as well as support to help managers guide conversations around each topic. Each part in the series highlighted a different element of ethical fitness, such as behavior rationalization, the importance of speaking up, misplaced loyalty and finding clarity in ethical situations. This campaign concluded in 2021, with a required training for all employees to consolidate and reinforce key themes presented over the course of the campaign.\nTRANSPARENCY FOR EMPLOYEES\n\nAnnual Ethics Hotline Summary\n\nEach year, the Citi Ethics Office provides all employees with a summary of the types of concerns received through the Ethics Hotline and the types of corrective actions that may arise from substantiated concerns. This summary demonstrates that the Ethics Hotline process is used by our colleagues globally and that raising concerns to the Citi Ethics Office leads to meaningful action within our organization, such as disciplinary action, termination of vendor relationships, referrals to law enforcement or governmental authorities, employee communications, additional training, control enhancements, and changes to Citi policies, business processes and procedures.\n\nSpotlight on Ethics\n\nCiti shares with employees the results of ethics investigations, including a summary of corrective actions, through a quarterly communication called the Spotlight on Ethics. This communication reinforces for employees that their concerns are investigated and highlights commonplace areas in which ethical lapses can occur. In 2021, the Spotlight on Ethics focused on select risk areas such as protecting information from inappropriate uses, the prohibition on using unapproved communication methods to conduct Citi business, preventing retaliation or the suppression of concerns, and the requirement to cooperate with appropriately authorized internal or external investigations.\nRisk Management\n\nWe employ robust policies and practices to thwart corruption, address potential environmental and social risks in our portfolio, and safeguard data and customer privacy. These rigorous practices enable us to grow a successful, respected business that delivers the best possible results for our clients, customers and communities.\n\nManaging Corruption and Tax-Related Risks\n\nAnti-Corruption Activities\n\nCiti\u2019s Financial Crimes Unit includes the Global Financial Crimes Investigations and Intelligence (GFCII), Anti-Bribery and Corruption, Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Sanctions teams. Our Chief Compliance Officer, who reports directly to our CEO, provides regular reports on the performance of our compliance program, with regard to these areas, to our Board of Directors or a committee of the Board, as appropriate. Through our Financial Crimes unit, Citi works to prevent, identify and counteract the many and varied corruption-related risks that confront the financial sector.\n\nFor example, since its inception in 2018, Citi has been an active member of United for Wildlife\u2019s Financial Taskforce, a collaboration between financial institutions and nongovernmental organizations to fight illegal wildlife trafficking. In 2021, Citi worked with United for Wildlife, TRAFFIC and two telecommunications companies to create an illegal wildlife trade country threat profile outlining critical risk scenarios and indicators for countries in sub-Saharan Africa, beginning with Kenya as a pilot.\n\nIn addition, during 2021, Citi\u2019s GFCII and Anti-Bribery and Corruption teams participated in a working group led by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to develop a credible certification framework for evaluating infrastructure projects under the auspices of the OECD\u2019s Blue Dot Network. Once implemented, this framework will set a standard to develop market-driven, transparent, financially sustainable development projects. The working group is made up of leaders and experts from the private sector, civil society and academia and is focused on the following core themes: investment efficiency and outcomes, environmental and social considerations, and transparency and integrity. Citi participants are shaping the framework by sharing their expertise in standards, guidelines and practices related to AML and anti-bribery and corruption, including third-party and advisor/intermediary risk management, procurement lobbying, controls, risk assessments, metrics, Financial Action Task Force guidance and customer due diligence.\n\nIn 2021, Citi also contributed to a multi-session workshop sponsored by the Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center, in conjunction with the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists. Participants included several financial institutions and leading nonprofit organizations with expertise in environmental crimes, such as TRAFFIC and key U.S. government development agencies (e.g., USAID). The workshops were designed to address key aspects of global environmental crime and corruption. GFCII provided several presentations and led discussions on the capability of financial institutions and the importance of information-sharing regarding typologies and red flags, to address crimes related to environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues.\n\nAs an outcome of the roundtable discussions, TRAFFIC worked with GFCII to provide specialized training to Citi employees in our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. This included a series of webinars co-hosted by Citi, TRAFFIC and the Environmental Investigation Agency, a nongovernmental organization that investigates and campaigns against environmental crime and abuse. The training series focused on how to identify red flags in client onboarding and transactional activity to disrupt the flow of income generated by environmental crime.\nPrograms and Training to Combat Financial Crimes\n\nAnti-Bribery Program\nCiti has policies, procedures and internal controls to comply with anti-bribery laws, and we conduct an annual bribery risk assessment of all global business lines. We provide our staff with anti-bribery training annually and supplement it with targeted training and communications as needed. For more information, see the Citi Anti-Bribery Program Statement, which is updated at least annually.\n\nAnti-Money Laundering Program\nCiti\u2019s Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Program protects our clients, our franchise and the global financial system from the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing. The program includes more than 5,600 employees globally, including 225 designated AML Country Officers covering every Citi business, function and geographic area. These specialists partner with various functions, including Compliance, Audit, Technology and our institutional and consumer businesses, to provide effective enterprise AML risk assessment and to meet our AML-related requirements at both the global and the local levels. For more information, visit our AML Program website.\n\nGlobal Financial Crimes Investigations and Intelligence\nGlobal Financial Crimes Investigations and Intelligence (GFCII) is uniquely positioned within our Compliance function to tackle financial crime and provide a globally consistent approach to the prevention and detection of risk. GFCII leverages its many trusted partnerships with law enforcement, nonprofits and internal stakeholders to obtain actionable intelligence, primarily through participation in public/private forums, allowing for proactive identification of illicit activity and effective mitigation of risk. This connectivity results in the execution of a data-driven global strategy addressing emerging risk trends and typologies across business lines and geographies.\n\nSanctions Program\nCiti is obligated to comply with applicable sanctions, laws and regulations in the countries where we operate and maintains a robust, risk-based Independent Compliance Risk Management Sanctions Program that applies globally. As a financial institution organized in the United States, Citi and our subsidiaries globally comply with applicable U.S. sanctions requirements, among other requirements. Our Sanctions Program includes policies and procedures, risk category statement and tolerance thresholds, enterprise-wide screening, annual risk assessments and audits of sanctions control processes, employee training and a diverse team of Compliance professionals stationed around the world.\n\nFor more information on our Financial Crimes programs, please see Citi\u2019s Code of Conduct.\n\nNumber of Employees and Contingent Workers Who Completed Citi\u2019s 2021 Financial Crimes Compliance Training (by Region)*\n\n| Region                  | Number of Employees |\n|-------------------------|---------------------|\n| North America           | 62,759              |\n| Latin America           | 29,499              |\n| Europe, Middle East and Africa | 28,671          |\n| Asia Pacific            | 74,365              |\n\n* This combined online training incorporates multiple anti-corruption efforts, including AML, sanctions and anti-bribery training. Numbers include all Citi staff who had completed the 2021 training as of December 2021. (Employees and contingent workers generally have 30 days to complete it.)\nTaxation Policies and Standards\n\nCiti does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions, and maintains strong review and escalation processes that enable us to adhere to high standards of compliance with applicable tax laws. We are a current income taxpayer, both within and outside the United States. Our tax profile is consistent with the locations of our business operations.\n\nWe emphasize strong internal controls and transparency with global tax authorities and share information relevant to our tax profile. We supplement this transparency with additional country-by-country reporting, which is required under the OECD\u2019s action plan to address base erosion and profit shifting. Our tax policy is overseen by our Chief Tax Officer, who reports to the Chief Financial Officer. Tax policies and related matters are reviewed by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\nCiti maintains a strong system of controls to facilitate reporting and withholding requirements. We have systems and processes to comply with the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, and we are in compliance with the Common Reporting Standard in all applicable countries where local implementing guidance has been issued. Similarly, we have a firm-wide policy applicable to customer transactions under which Citi will only engage in transactions where there is a high degree of certainty that any tax aspects will be accepted by the respective taxing authorities.\n\nFor more information on how taxation impacts Citi, see page 128 of our 2021 Form 10-K.\n\nPublic Policy\n\nBeing a responsible corporate citizen includes engagement in the political process as a part of our strong ESG practice. The potential impact of public policy on our business, employees, communities and customers is an important reason why Citi works to advance and protect the global business interests of our company directly and indirectly through engagement with trade associations, governments and elected officials around the world. Citi advocates for public policies that support the interests of our company, clients and employees, such as trade, cybersecurity, data localization, tax and financial reform. Guided by Citi\u2019s Political Engagement Statement, company political activities are performed in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nUnder U.S. Federal Election Commission rules, Citi\u2019s Political Action Committee (Citi PAC) pools the voluntary contributions of eligible employees to support U.S. political candidates and campaigns that support the financial industry and complementary pro-business policies. In 2021, we reviewed and strengthened our principles for determining future support by Citi PAC. The updated criteria include:\n\n- Support of business issues important to Citi\n- Position on a committee with jurisdiction over policy issues important to Citi, or elected leadership position\n- Representation of a state or district where Citi has a significant employee presence\n- Character and integrity, and demonstrated commitment to bipartisanship, governing and protecting democratic institutions\nOur bipartisan Government Affairs team and the Citi PAC Board will consider whether contributions meet the strengthened criteria going forward.\n\nSafeguarding Data and Protecting Customer Information\n\nAs digital solutions expand and become more integrated into our daily lives, we see increasing concerns related to privacy and security breaches. Data security and customer privacy are top priorities for Citi and for our stakeholders. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an even greater reliance on digital technologies, which makes safeguarding data and customer information even more vital.\n\nCybersecurity\n\nCiti\u2019s Chief Information Security Office (CISO) organization ensures that an appropriate level of cybersecurity governance, capabilities and controls are in place to protect Citi\u2019s and our clients\u2019 information assets, with end-to-end accountability across the firm. Our approach rests on ensuring we have the right architecture, technology, policies, processes and talent in place to prevent, detect, respond to and recover from cyber threats quickly.\n\nOur Cybersecurity Program is overseen by Citi\u2019s Board of Directors and is regularly reviewed by regulators, as well as by internal and external auditors. The program is managed by the Chief Enterprise Operations & Technology Officer and the Chief Information Security Officer on a global enterprise basis; the Chief Executives of each business sector and region are responsible for implementation and compliance with program requirements. Annually, we provide our employees with training on how to properly handle and maintain the security and privacy of Citi\u2019s and our clients\u2019 information.\n\nDuring 2021, Citi\u2019s cybersecurity team organized a series of preparedness exercises for employees, including cybersecurity scenarios for global functions and lines of business across both our Institutional Clients Group and Personal Banking & Wealth Management divisions. Due to the continued impact of COVID-19, these events were again conducted remotely. During the year, we saw continued growth in demand from senior executives for cybersecurity exercises. The Citi cybersecurity team conducted a series of linked exercises for our various regions, culminating with an exercise for our CEO and Global Operating team. Citi\u2019s Cybersecurity Fusion Center participated in these global cybersecurity exercises and conducted additional drills dedicated to its operations.\n\nTo safeguard information, we invest in and develop advanced security solutions that allow us to better support our digital strategy. For instance, we are implementing a multifaceted approach to move toward password-less capabilities, including biometric options such as voice recognition or fingerprints. These solutions create a frictionless and more secure experience for both internal and external users. In addition, Citi has invested in next-generation security components that support digital and mobile growth, by enabling enhanced security features for our mobile applications. Further investments in advanced technology have provided Citi with improved cyber incident monitoring, detection and response capabilities, strengthening the bank\u2019s cybersecurity posture.\n\nCiti conducts regular cybersecurity risk assessments and has internal controls to defend against cybersecurity breaches. We maintain technology and cybersecurity policies based on established industry standards and employ robust technologies to protect our data and systems, supported by a strong team with deep expertise from industry and government. Our CISO team safeguards information from data breaches and misuse by maintaining secure networks to protect\nour systems and databases, and we continuously improve our capabilities to meet the challenge of an evolving threat environment.\n\nIn the event of a potential breach, we have a robust process to ensure appropriate reporting and notification, which includes:\n\n- Reviewing the breach to determine whether it meets any regulatory or legal reporting requirements in the country(ies) where the breach occurred or in the country(ies) impacted by the breach. If deemed necessary, a legal assessment is conducted.\n- Notifying the impacted customers as required by the laws or regulations of the impacted country(ies) and as directed in the legal assessment, if it results in a requirement to perform customer notifications.\n\nWe understand that simply defending ourselves is not enough. We must also influence the broader cybersecurity landscape within which Citi operates. As such, we collaborate with our clients, peer financial institutions, governments, law enforcement and intelligence agencies on a global scale to share best practices, exchange tactical information about specific cybersecurity threats, conduct joint cyber resilience exercises and work to drive adoption of industry-wide standards and approaches that will best enable the collective defense of the financial services sector against cybersecurity challenges. Our security teams receive and share threat data with our partners in near real time, leveraging that information to strengthen our internal controls and practices and to protect Citi from attacks being perpetrated against other firms. Citi takes a leadership role in fostering a culture of sharing amongst our competitors on security issues, putting competitive instincts aside for the sake of strong information security practices.\n\nPrivacy\n\nThe fair, ethical and lawful collection, use and processing of customers\u2019 personal information is essential to build trust, provide best-in-class services and achieve our corporate objectives. To help meet this goal, Citi has established a dedicated Chief Privacy Office team, led by a global Chief Privacy Officer. The Chief Privacy Office, part of our Independent Compliance Risk Management team, manages the Citi Global Privacy Program, which is overseen by Citi\u2019s Privacy Advisory Body. The program provides a framework for managing privacy and confidentiality risks for the company. Citi has also established the Global Chief Privacy Counsel under the General Counsel\u2019s Office. The Global Chief Privacy Counsel provides guidance and strategic direction regarding privacy and data protection laws to the Chief Privacy Office and to businesses and functions across the enterprise.\n\nCiti\u2019s Privacy and Bank Customer Confidentiality Policy articulates principles relating to the collection and processing of personal information, requiring, in part, that personal information only be collected and used as necessary for the performance of the services offered and for the purposes disclosed in a privacy notice. Citi is transparent in our collection and use practices and offers customers choices about how their personal information may be collected or otherwise used (as required by law), including opting out of marketing or other communications or reviewing and correcting information. Citi employees are required to take privacy and information compliance training that covers these privacy concepts.\n\nProtecting Digital Identity\n\nFor financial institutions such as Citi, verifying our customers\u2019 identity is fundamental to safeguarding their financial assets and protecting their privacy. Our aim is to deliver solutions that provide seamless, intuitive interactions with digital tools that won\u2019t compromise personal data. To provide ongoing training for our employees, we have created digital identity learning packs that help build awareness of \u2013 and skills related to \u2013 new digital identity technologies. In addition, we engage with clients, partners and industry experts to discuss the trends, challenges and opportunities related to digital identity and to explore cutting-edge technologies that have the potential to meet our customers\u2019 needs.\n\nWe also provide our customers with timely resources and information related to safety and security. Our U.S. online Security Center enables customers to learn about what Citi does to protect them and what they can do to protect themselves against identify theft and other security risks.\nEnvironmental and Social Risk Management\n\nOur Environmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM) Policy helps us identify potential risks within the billions of dollars in global transactions we facilitate worldwide. This policy also sets a framework for us to evaluate how our clients are managing those risks.\n\nOur ESRM Policy\n\nOur ESRM Policy, which is summarized publicly in our Environmental and Social Policy Framework, helps us finance projects and activities responsibly by engaging our clients on environmental and social risks and best practices. We established the Policy in 2003, and we continue to evolve our approach in response to emerging risks and new product development. In 2021, we updated our ESRM Policy by adding a policy prohibition against financing for companies constructing or operating private prisons as a primary business. Although this has not been an issue for our company in the past, we decided to formalize this commitment through an official policy update.\n\nOur comprehensive ESRM Policy covers a broad scope of financial products and client sectors and guides how we assess client impacts on air quality, water quality, climate change, biodiversity, local communities, labor, human rights and other environmental and social issues. Our internal policies and procedures reference international industry standards, such as the International Finance Corporation\u2019s Environmental and Social Performance Standards and the World Bank Group\u2019s Environmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines. Where relevant, we also require clients to adhere to sector and commodity-specific guidelines and certifications such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil and the Forest Stewardship Council.\n\nCiti\u2019s ESRM Policy at a Glance\n\nESRM Policy objective: Effectively assess and manage the environmental and social risks associated with financing client activities in sectors with sensitive environmental and social impacts. A transaction or client relationship may trigger the ESRM Policy for three reasons:\n\n1. Transactions with use of proceeds directed to a specific physical asset or project\n2. Clients in sectors considered particularly high risk by Citi\n3. Clients/transactions with impacts to an Area of High Caution\n\nThe ESRM team reviews transactions subject to policy and benchmarks against relevant industry standards/best practice, identifying opportunities for improvement and engagement.\n\nIf a transaction impacts any of the following Areas of High Caution, ESRM will conduct enhanced due diligence\n\n- Conflict risk\n- Indigenous rights\n- Critical habitat and cultural heritage\n- Human rights, including environmental justice\n- Involuntary resettlement\n\nCiti\u2019s ESRM Sector Approaches apply sector-specific review requirements for certain clients in sensitive sectors\n\nCiti\u2019s ESRM Policy also includes a number of prohibitions for highest concern environmental and social risks. Refer to the ESRM section of Citi\u2019s Environmental and Social Policy Framework for more information.\nPolicy Implementation\n\nOur centralized team of ESRM specialists within Citi\u2019s Risk Management function evaluates transactions that trigger a review under our ESRM Policy. We also provide ESRM training to key risk and banking personnel globally, enabling them to spot potential risks. In addition, our ESRM Champions, located around the world, use their regional expertise and additional ESRM training to serve as bridges between our local banking teams and our global ESRM team. This network approach enhances the global coverage capacity of our centralized specialist team. The ESRM team shares information and best practices with ESRM Champions to support and strengthen the entire network.\n\nWhen the viability of a deal is first explored, our ESRM team works with Citi bankers to evaluate the magnitude of the potential environmental and social impacts associated with the transaction and to determine what action, if any, is needed to comply with our ESRM Policy prior to final approval of the transaction. If Citi receives a mandate to move forward with a transaction that involves such risks, the ESRM team continues to work with the banking team to conduct due diligence commensurate with the risks faced.\n\nHigher-risk, project-related transactions may receive in-depth reviews by independent environmental and social consultants to benchmark against international standards. If gaps are found between a client\u2019s environmental and social plans, policies or practices and international standards, we require the development of an Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) to fill the gaps. As a condition of financing, we require the client to implement the ESAP by specifying covenants in the loan agreement, and we monitor its progress over time. In some cases, we decline to participate in a transaction because we do not believe we can adequately address the environmental and social risks through mitigation measures or because the risks are too high.\n\nApplying our ESRM Policy helps us to identify risks beyond traditional credit risks, guides how we evaluate transactions related to companies or projects in high-risk sectors and presents opportunities for us to advise clients on solutions to thematic risks.\n\nOver the last few years, we have seen a rapid increase in the volume and variety of transactions flagged for ESRM review. This is due to increased interest from regulators on ESRM-related issues and the growth in ESG-related financial products, as well as greater engagement across the firm as employees receive additional training and become more aware of the potential environmental and social risks in the transactions they are managing. For example, the responsibility and activities of our ESRM team have expanded in recent years to account for increasing attention and concern related to climate risk. For information about our approach and management activities in this area, see the Climate Risk and Net Zero section.\n\nThe ESRM section of our Environmental and Social Policy Framework outlines the scope of our ESRM Policy, including the types of transactions that trigger a review, and provides additional detail about our risk-screening practices and categories, independent reviews and action plans. The Framework also includes an overview of our Areas of High Caution, sector-specific approaches and policy prohibitions.\n\nOngoing engagement with our clients is an important part of our ESRM process. When we first established our ESRM policy, our engagements were tied to specific, project-related financial transactions and their associated environmental and social risks and mitigation efforts. However, as we have developed Sector Approaches and Areas of High Caution over the years, we have added corporate-level reviews and client engagements in a number of\nPROTECTING BIODIVERSITY AND ADDRESSING RESETTLEMENT CONCERNS IN PANAMA CITY\n\nIn 2021, Citi, in coordination with other financial institutions, closed a $2 billion transaction to finance Metro Line 3, an expansion of Panama City\u2019s metro system. Citi worked with Consorcio HPH, a consortium of Korean companies responsible for the construction of Metro Line 3. Because this is a project-related corporate loan for more than $50 million, due diligence processes required an independent review before the close of the transaction. Consorcio HPH and the lenders engaged environmental and social consultant, ERM, to evaluate the project\u2019s environmental and social impacts and benchmark management plans against international standards. This due diligence revealed two primary risks related to the project: potential biodiversity impacts and physical/economic displacement of individuals and businesses along the path of the new metro line.\n\nTo address biodiversity concerns and align the project with IFC Performance Standard 6 for biodiversity, ERM performed a Critical Habitat Assessment to study potential impacts on migratory and/or congregatory species within the project\u2019s area of influence. ERM identified an Important Bird Area, including habitat for species such as the broad-winged hawk, Swainson\u2019s hawk and turkey vulture. The assessment revealed that a small area of Critical Habitat (0.54 hectare) would be directly impacted by the project. In order to ensure a net gain of critical habitat and no net-loss of natural habitat, Consorcio HPH will implement reforestation and biodiversity monitoring programs to measure results.\n\nAfter a review of impacts related to resettlement and livelihood displacement, it was determined that the project\u2019s need for resettlement would be minimal. Nonetheless, Consorcio HPH is working with Metro de Panama S.A. (MPSA) to ensure that proper protocols are followed when engaging with residents about the need for resettlement, attaining willing seller consent, providing adequate compensation and developing livelihood restoration plans for those who may be impacted. MPSA is also working with a social consultant to enhance its local resettlement process to align with international best practice, including the IFC Performance Standard 5 for resettlement. As an additional precaution, the project\u2019s construction schedule is tied to review by ERM and the lenders to ensure that resettlement risks are fully assessed and benchmarked before construction begins in areas where resettlement or displacement may occur.\n\nMonitoring the Changing Risk Landscape\n\nThe ESRM team uses a number of methods to proactively scan the changing risk landscape for new, emerging risks, as well as risks with increased prominence and prevalence. Through internal research, engagement with our regional ESRM Champions, collaboration with others in our industry, and the use of third-party environmental and social data, we monitor relevant developments in high-risk industries and stakeholder concerns to flag emerging issues.\n\nProactive monitoring enables us to identify issues and the interrelated impacts of various sectors, so we can be responsive to evolving risks, raise awareness within Citi about emerging issues and identify clients that may be impacted for further engagement. We are beginning to incorporate new tools to scan for emerging environmental and social risks. The team has reviewed a range of technologies for use in our due diligence approach, such as environmental DNA gathering to conduct biodiversity baseline studies and benchmark improvements in biodiversity values over time. This technique enables the analysis of DNA in water or soil samples to identify the fauna living in a given project area without the need to visually verify their presence.\n\nAnother way we monitor risk is by conducting sector-specific reviews to identify and mitigate emerging risks in our existing portfolio. These evaluations are based on information published or provided by the client as well as information from specialized ESG rating agencies and topic-specific databases. This process enables us to better understand how our clients manage environmental and social issues and provides valuable insight into the level of related risk across our portfolio. In 2021, we conducted reviews of our mining, oil and gas, and power portfolios as well as a portfolio review of our clients in Malaysia related to human rights.\nClient Engagement\n\nOur ESRM team is collaborating with our Sustainability and Corporate Transitions team to engage with clients working to transition toward more sustainable strategies and business models. This provides opportunities for in-depth discussions of specific sustainability topics, identifies ways of proactively mitigating environmental and social risks, and supports our clients in their efforts to align with international standards and benchmarks. For example, during an engagement with mining clients in 2021, our ESRM team provided insight and analysis related to the sustainable finance market and the challenges and opportunities for mining companies related to environmental and social risk. The breadth and depth of our ESRM team\u2019s knowledge in these areas is a valuable tool to help us assess new transactions and to guide and advise our clients as we work toward achieving our net zero commitment. For more information about the work Citi is doing to help clients transition to a low-carbon future, see the Financing the Low-Carbon Transition section.\n\nIndustry Collaboration\n\nWe participate in many environmentally and socially focused initiatives and organizations, such as the Equator Principles Association and the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil.\n\nCiti is also a member of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) Forum. We participated in an informal working group prior to the official launch of the Taskforce to develop the TNFD\u2019s workplan for creating a complementary framework to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, but with a focus on reporting nature-related risks rather than climate-related risks. Climate and biodiversity are interconnected, and there are increasing concerns that climate change, along with other human activity, has stressed natural systems and contributed to ongoing extinction events. Through our collaboration with TNFD, we are able to contribute to important nature-related reporting standards and continue to refine our understanding of the complex interaction of climate and biodiversity and our connection with those impacts through our financial relationships with our clients.\n\nESRM Training\n\nEach year, we train key risk and banking personnel on our ESRM Policy to help them identify triggers for engagement with our ESRM specialist team. Topics include environmental and social risks relevant to certain regions and sectors, implementation of the Equator Principles and Citi\u2019s Sector Approaches, as well as specific topics such as human rights, biodiversity and emerging climate risk analysis. Due to increased focus from key stakeholders in ESG issues, more bankers across our firm are receiving ESRM training, which enables them to spot potential risks and engage with our ESRM team more effectively. In total, 950 Citi employees underwent ESRM training during 2021, significantly more than in 2020. All training in 2021 was conducted on live webinars for employees globally.\n\n1. See Anthony D.

Citi received external assurance of our Equator Principles data from SGS. For our SGS Assurance Statement, see the Assurance section.\nServing Our Customers and Clients Responsibly\n\nWe have policies and systems in place to help ensure that we always treat customers responsibly and fairly, such as our Code of Conduct and the internal checks and balances we employ when creating new products.\n\nResponsible Marketing\n\nWe are committed to offering clients an array of products and services based on their needs, wants and preferences, while adhering to our internal policies and procedures as well as applicable laws and regulations. We work diligently to clearly disclose all features and terms and conditions, including applicable fees and charges, for the products and services offered, so that clients can select and use the products or services best suited to them.\n\nOur chosen name initiative for U.S. Branded credit card members offers transgender and nonbinary customers the ability to use their chosen first name on their eligible card and within our servicing channels. As of early 2022, more than 22,000 customers had updated their first name on their physical credit cards, and citi.com/updatemyname had received more than 210,000 visits. Most importantly, we\u2019ve received notes like this from customers: \u201cI wish that there was something like this when I began my transition. This will remove one of the many worries that we have all had when we were introducing our true selves to the world.\u201d\n\nTo celebrate the launch of the chosen name initiative, we created an advertising campaign featuring people from across the gender diversity spectrum, both in front of and behind the camera. This initiative has been a significant step forward in helping this community feel recognized, accepted and empowered. In recognition of its impact, the initiative was honored as one of Fast Company\u2019s 2021 World Changing Ideas.\n\nAnother example of how we continue to amplify our purpose-driven initiatives is through Citi\u2019s global, mission-led partnership with the International Paralympic Committee, which focuses on positively changing societal perceptions of people with disabilities. Over the past several years of our partnership, Citi sponsored 23 National Paralympic Committees and more than 50 Para athletes across the globe in their quest to compete at the highest level.\n\nIn Summer 2021, we celebrated our Team Citi Para athletes and showed the world that \u201cIt\u2019s Okay to Stare\u201d at the talents and accomplishments of the disability community through the #StareAtGreatness campaign. Our advertising and social media campaign successfully raised awareness of the incredible achievements of these athletes and others within the disability community, earning recognition as a finalist in two categories at the 2022 Halo Awards. In early 2022, Citi extended the #StareAtGreatness campaign with 15 sponsored Team Citi Winter Para athletes to continue driving conversations around the world.\n\nAs part of Citi\u2019s Action for Racial Equity goals, we are collaborating with our agency partners to increase the percentage of people of color working on Citi accounts and to increase representation of people of color in our marketing. By the end of 2023, we aspire to achieve the following:\n\nAim to increase representation in the agencies we work with\n\n- People of color making up at least 25% of the agency teams working on Citi accounts\n- People of color comprising at least 8% of senior agency leadership, in line with Citi\u2019s own commitment\nHelping Customers Give Back\n\nWe offer our U.S. cardholders an opportunity to make a difference by turning their ThankYou\u00ae Points into charitable gifts to nonprofits. In 2021, we joined the (RED)EEM initiative which enables eligible cardmembers to make donations with PayPal\u2019s Pay with Rewards feature and supports organizations working to ensure equitable access to COVID-19 testing, treatment and vaccines in the world\u2019s poorest countries. We also expanded the list of eligible organizations to include Susan G. Komen. The list also includes American Red Cross, No Kid Hungry, UNICEF USA and others.\n\nSince 2014, Citi\u2019s support has also helped No Kid Hungry provide up to 290 million meals for the millions of kids facing hunger across America. In 2021, Citi encouraged clients to enroll their Citi credit cards in the Dine and Do Good campaign. For every $5 or more spent dining out, Citi donated $1 to No Kid Hungry until the $1 million donation goal was met. Additionally, on Giving Tuesday, Citi engaged colleagues and general consumers to help raise enough to provide more than 10 million meals in a single day, with Citi\u2019s support alone driving 40% of dollars raised.\n\nNo Kid Hungry is the only national campaign solely dedicated to ending childhood hunger.\n\nAim to increase representation in our marketing\n\n- People of color making up at least 25% of casting for Citi marketing\n- Aim for at least 25% of brand stories highlighting minority-owned businesses and organizations annually\n\nTo cultivate greater diversity and inclusivity in our marketing and communications, we collaborated with Getty Images to develop Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I) Imagery Toolkits. Each toolkit harnesses Getty Images\u2019 proprietary data (Visual GPS) and Kantar\u2019s Global MONITOR research to provide marketers, communicators and creatives with useful insights to create authentic and multifaceted depictions of people in our global marketing and communications. We began rolling out these toolkits in 2021, including in the United States, and will launch in additional markets in 2022. The toolkits feature country-specific data and consumer insights to capture cultural and regional nuances, and custom training is provided to Citi employees for each market. The toolkits will be available to the public on the Getty Images DE&I Imagery Toolkit hub.\n\nThese initiatives are just some examples of our firm-wide commitment to promote activities that are in the best interests of our clients. More broadly, new products are approved by cross-functional committees that include senior executives from Risk, Legal, our Independent Compliance Risk Management team and other relevant units, supported by specialists from Consumer Fairness, as needed. Citi also does periodic testing or monitoring of marketing materials and disclosures. In addition, Personal Banking & Wealth Management has a global approach for handling customer complaints and concerns in a timely and effective manner, in line with our commitment to provide financial services responsibly and treat customers fairly.\nEliminating Overdraft Fees for Our Customers\u2019 Financial Wellness\n\nCiti recently announced plans to eliminate overdraft fees, returned item fees and overdraft protection transfer fees for U.S. Retail Banking consumers by Summer 2022. This makes Citi the only top-five U.S. bank (based on assets*) to completely eliminate these fees, and it demonstrates our commitment to expanding access to inclusive banking products and services that can help advance economic progress, especially for underbanked and unbanked populations.\n\nFor 20 years, we have put measures in place to minimize overdraft fees for our consumers in order to put their financial wellness first. In addition to the upcoming changes, Citi will also continue to offer a robust suite of overdraft protection transfer services for our consumers including:\n\n- **Overdraft Protection Transfer Services**: Citi offers two services that help consumers avoid checking account overdrafts and returned items \u2014 Safety Check and Checking Plus\u00ae (variable rate) line of credit. The fees associated with these services will also be eliminated.\n- **Access Account Package**: Citi\u2019s industry-leading, checkless account package with low or avoidable monthly charges provides consumers with a simple, transparent way to manage their finances and systemically limits point-of-sale, ATM and ACH transactions that could cause negative balances.\n- **Common Sense Protection Measures**: Citi will not authorize ATM or point-of-sale debit transactions in cases when funds are not available.\n- **Low Balance Alerts**: Consumers can enroll in Low Balance Alerts via their account online or through the Citi Mobile\u00ae App.\n\nThe elimination of overdraft fees complements many of our firm-wide *Action for Racial Equity* efforts in the United States that aim to expand banking and credit for communities of color.\n\n* https://www.bankrate.com/banking/biggest-banks-in-america/.\n\n---\n\n**CITI\u2019S TREATING CUSTOMERS FAIRLY PRINCIPLES**\n\nWe aim to deliver products and services that provide value, clarity and dependability, guided by the Treating Customers Fairly principles that define the standards for our products and services. These principles include:\n\n- **Works as described**: Consumers can predict how products and services will work.\n- **Appropriate**: Consumers can rely on Citi to offer appropriate products and services that meet their needs.\n- **Value**: Consumers receive value that is reasonably related to the cost of the products and services.\n- **Ease of understanding**: Consumers understand the terms and conditions of the products and services (particularly limitations and exclusions).\n\nIn November 2021, we opened a new branch and Client Center at our global headquarters in New York City.\nTreating Customers Fairly\n\nThrough Citi\u2019s commitment to our Treating Customers Fairly principles and our Global Consumer Fairness Policy, we strive to earn and maintain the public\u2019s trust by adhering to high ethical standards in conducting our business.\n\nThe Global Consumer Fairness Policy provides a framework for reviewing consumer fairness concerns and a sustainable model for managing emerging risks. The policy covers all aspects of the consumer product and services life cycle, including new product development, marketing, sales (including variable incentive compensation), underwriting and onboarding, as well as all other stages. There are established, formalized escalation processes to Citi\u2019s governance committees and Board of Directors that facilitate consistent, timely and appropriate identification, analysis and escalation of potential consumer fairness and reputational and franchise risk issues. In relation to designing variable incentive plans, we consider a number of factors, including whether plans align with our Treating Customers Fairly principles. For example, we leverage client satisfaction metrics, where available, along with other product-based metrics, to incentivize achieving business results that adhere to internal policies and our Code of Conduct. We routinely evaluate incentive plans, training content, controls, monitoring results and oversight activities to maintain a sales force that delivers on Citi\u2019s commitment to serving our customers with fairness, value, clarity and dependability.\n\nAs part of the program, Personal Banking & Wealth Management and Institutional Clients Group employees complete annual Treating Customers Fairly training to ensure they understand how to identify issues of fairness and how fairness influences real-world results. The 2021 course was launched to more than 95,000 Citi employees globally.\n\nWe also have measures in place to monitor sales practices, including auditing and metrics that assess client risk profiles. When appropriate, we proactively contact delinquent clients, using their credit risk profile and previous payment performance to determine how quickly and how often to contact them. We ensure that contact strategies are vetted for privacy and fairness considerations before implementation.\n\nThe Global Financial Access Policy is a key component of our commitment to fair and equitable access to products and services. This policy establishes the guiding principles and minimum standards for fair, equitable and nondiscriminatory access to credit. Further, it prohibits discrimination against actual or prospective clients on the basis of race, ethnicity, sex (which encompasses gender as well as sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression), religion, national origin, disability or other prohibited factors. This commitment is backed by training, processes, controls and oversight to prevent discrimination. In addition, we continually work to understand evolving discrimination risks and update our approach to preventing such risks in our business strategies, as well as in the design and delivery of our products and services.\n\nTrue to our commitment to responsible finance, we hold an annual Fair and Inclusive Banking offsite with senior management from across the company, to deepen their understanding of fair lending, consumer fairness and accessibility.\nHuman Rights\n\nCiti\u2019s rigorous human rights policies, standards and due diligence practices guide our business and lending decisions. We consistently engage with our employees, suppliers, peers and industry experts, as well as civil society organizations focused on our clients and the projects we finance, to advance the protection of human rights.\n\nOur Commitment to Respect Human Rights\n\nWe are committed to respecting human rights wherever we do business. We engage human rights experts, clients and peers to support our efforts to respect human rights in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights \u2013 a global framework for preventing and addressing the risk of adverse impacts on human rights linked to business activity. The UN Guiding Principles draw upon existing international human rights instruments whose principles Citi has endorsed, such as those in the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization\u2019s (ILO) Core Conventions. To illustrate our implementation of the UN Guiding Principles, we have mapped how this ESG Report aligns with the UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework (see index).\n\nCiti regularly updates our policies and practices to strengthen our human rights due diligence. During the development and subsequent updates of our Statement on Human Rights, which we first adopted in 2007, we engaged internal and external stakeholders to help assess our actual and potential human rights impacts and to identify the most salient human rights risks faced by our employees, workers connected to our supply chain and individuals who might be affected by our clients\u2019 operations.\n\nCiti\u2019s Environmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM) Policy, summarized in our Environmental and Social Policy Framework, guides our approach to assessing environmental and social risks related to financing our clients\u2019 business activities. For more information about our ESRM Policy and our related due diligence processes, see the Environmental and Social Risk Management section of this report.\n\nWe regularly review and update our ESRM Policy to ensure that it reflects our most recent understanding of potential environmental and social risks. For example, during 2021, we updated the Policy to include a formal prohibition against financing for companies whose primary business is constructing or operating private prisons. Although we do not have such clients directly connected to private prisons, we decided to formalize this policy prohibition for the future in alignment with our Action for Racial Equity commitments.\n\nELEVATING ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE CONCERNS FOR ENHANCED DUE DILIGENCE\n\nOver the last several years, there has been growing global acknowledgment that climate change is a human rights issue. In 2021, the UN Human Rights Council recognized the right to a healthy environment as a stand-alone human right. Citi has also recognized for many years the right to a healthy environment and the need to evaluate the potential environmental risks to communities surrounding the industrial developments we finance. For example, due diligence related to environmental justice concerns is critical for identifying projects with significant impacts to local communities from fossil-fuel-related activities, including extraction, refinement and transportation or air and water pollution due to heavy industry.\n\nEnvironmental justice is also important as we consider low-carbon projects with positive environmental benefits that might have negative impacts on local communities. For example, a dam construction project to create renewable hydro-electric power could threaten human rights if it is sited without consideration of the rights of Indigenous or other marginalized peoples. While we want to champion projects that help combat climate change, we need to keep our eyes open to other adverse impacts that may occur, particularly in relation to already marginalized communities.\n\nAs of 2020, we formalized environmental justice as a specific risk within the Areas of High Caution section of our ESRM Policy that triggers enhanced due diligence.\nOur Salient Human Rights Risks\n\nCiti has spent more than a decade seeking to understand and mitigate the most salient human rights risks related to our business \u2013 those that pose the greatest risk to people \u2013 including the activities of our clients and other business partners.\n\nThe most severe potential risks posed to people by our clients\u2019 activities, particularly in the context of project-related finance, are identified under our ESRM Policy. Our work to address these risks began in 2003 when we helped to found the Equator Principles (EP) framework to enhance and standardize risk management across the banking sector, established an internal ESRM team, and began developing our risk identification and mitigation policies and procedures. While our formal ESRM processes give us the most leverage when we are directly financing a project, we also screen for human rights risks and opportunities to engage clients in other types of corporate financing covered by our ESRM Policy and in targeted ESRM portfolio reviews of high risk sectors or geographies. In addition, we work to identify and address salient human rights risks that could arise in other areas of our value chain such as our supply chain, our workforce and our consumer banking activities. For a full list of our salient human rights risks and the stakeholders they may impact, see the table on the following page.\n\nEfforts to achieve racial equity and promote diversity and inclusion relate directly to the protection of human rights, as these efforts seek to remedy disparities and protect individuals from discrimination on the basis of essential characteristics. We have identified salient human rights risks in this area, including discrimination in the provision of financial services and threats to diversity and inclusion. You can learn about Citi\u2019s Action for Racial Equity commitments, established in 2020, and additional inclusion initiatives related to our supply chain, our workforce and the communities we serve throughout this report.\n\nFor human rights concerns related to a particular client, transaction or portfolio, we escalate those issues to the relevant internal Reputation Risk Committee. In addition, in 2021, we established an Asia Pacific Human Rights Task Force, comprised of senior bankers and risk managers. The aim of the task force is to enable a more standardized approach to addressing salient human rights risks that arise in that region. For more information about our governance of ESG issues, including human rights, see the ESG Governance at Citi section.\nSalient Human Rights Risks: Stakeholder Impacts\n\nThis table illustrates which stakeholders could be impacted by the human rights risks we have identified as most salient to our company. Rows shaded in gray indicate risks related to the Areas of High Caution defined in our ESRM Policy and trigger additional due diligence for project transactions, general corporate purpose transactions and regular reviews of client relationships. Additional context about our approach to mitigate these risks and related due diligence processes can be found throughout this report, in our Statement on Human Rights and in our Environmental and Social Policy Framework.\n\n| Human Rights Risks                                      | Citi\u2019s Employees | Suppliers\u2019 Employees | Customers and Clients | Those Affected by Clients\u2019 Operations |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Adequate standard of living; right to property          | \u25cf                | \u25cf                    | \u25cf                     | \u25cf                                    |\n| Conflict risk                                           |                  |                      |                       | \u25cf                                    |\n| Discrimination in the provision of financial services  |                  |                      |                       | \u25cf                                    |\n| Diversity and inclusion; discrimination in the workplace| \u25cf                | \u25cf                    |                       |                                       |\n| Indigenous Peoples                                     |                  |                      | \u25cf                     | \u25cf                                    |\n| Information security; privacy                           | \u25cf                |                      | \u25cf                     | \u25cf                                    |\n| Labor practices (including modern slavery)              | \u25cf                | \u25cf                    | \u25cf                     | \u25cf                                    |\n| Resettlement                                            |                  |                      |                       | \u25cf                                    |\n| Security practices                                      |                  |                      |                       | \u25cf                                    |\nAddressing Forced Labor in Malaysia\n\nMigrant laborers have the potential to become the victims of forced labor practices, due largely to the significant debt they incur through the process of recruitment, obtaining travel documentation and gaining entry into a foreign country. During 2021, this issue gained heightened attention due to the increased focus of the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol on migrant working conditions, with the agency issuing a number of Withhold Release Orders refusing entry of products into the U.S. market that were suspected of being made in whole or in part by forced labor. This included several Malaysian companies involved in the manufacture of personal protective equipment and palm oil products.\n\nWhen migrant workers arrive in Malaysia, they sometimes find that the salaries they earn are too low to cover the cost of repaying recruitment fees and expenses. Compounding the problem, their employers often withhold employee identity documents. This can put migrant workers in a precarious position as they are dependent on their job to repay their debts and, if they face challenging working conditions, they may be unable to look for other employment given the inaccessibility of their work permits and identity documents.\n\nCiti has a longstanding prohibition against providing financing to any company that uses forced labor practices as defined by the ILO\u2019s 11 Forced Labour Indicators. The Citi Malaysia team partnered with our global ESRM team to conduct a portfolio review in Malaysia to determine which Citi clients may have higher risk for potential forced labor practices and whether those clients have policies and procedures in place to address that risk. Out of hundreds of corporate and subsidiary client relationships reviewed, we identified 29 in higher-risk sectors with high migrant labor employee populations that required enhanced ESRM due diligence to assess client practices against international labor practices. In situations where this review uncovered high risks that were not adequately addressed through company policies and practices, or when credible accusations of forced labor existed, we engaged those clients on improvements needed. When necessary, we required clients to bring in labor rights experts to audit and suggest improvements for their policies and procedures, and we set up regular meetings to assess progress to close these gaps.\n\nWhile this is an important step, we also acknowledge that due to the long history of precarious migrant labor working conditions in Malaysia, and in other countries that rely on similar systems, it will take time and continued work to raise awareness to change ingrained practices. With this in mind, Citi Malaysia and the ESRM team took an additional step to educate clients and raise awareness by working with a forced labor expert to develop a webinar for our Malaysian clients. This webinar focused on international standards based on the ILO\u2019s Forced Labour Indicators, risk identification methodologies and best practices for preventing forced labor in corporate operations and supply chains, such as employer payment of recruitment fees, reimbursement of debt, ethical recruitment procedures, employee access to identity documents, and proper pay, overtime management and grievance mechanisms. More than 100 clients in Malaysia attended this webinar and it was very well received.\n\nLearn more about this issue on the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and ILO websites.\nRespecting the Human Rights of Our Employees\n\nWe expect every Citi employee to adhere to our Code of Conduct, which includes a commitment to human rights, and to participate in relevant training. Our Code of Conduct prohibits unlawful discrimination, harassment and other behavior that infringes on individual rights. As stated in our Code of Conduct, Citi expects all employees, as well as suppliers, clients and community partners globally to respect the principle of nondiscrimination.\n\nCiti has identified workplace discrimination and threats to diversity and inclusion as salient human rights risks for our company. As such, respect for diversity and inclusion is a high priority wherever we operate. It can become a particular concern in countries where there is no legal protection against discrimination based on gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, age, religion, physical or mental disability or medical condition, or sexual orientation, in addition to a range of other essential characteristics inherent to identity and personhood. Citi prohibits discrimination and harassment of our employees in all forms, regardless of whether or not individual protections are legally mandated in the countries and communities where we operate. In fact, we know that even in locations with anti-discrimination laws, there is still a need for companies to ensure that they are doing their part to respect individual rights.\n\nIn 2021, we established a team in the United States to identify and accelerate hiring of diverse talent. We also strive to increase the diversity of our workforce through the use of diverse slates in our hiring process and by setting aspirational goals related to diverse representation for Assistant Vice President to Managing Director levels. Citi has also signed the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s Business Statement Opposing Anti-LGBTQ+ State Legislation. Learn more about our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in the Talent and Diversity, Equity & Inclusion section.\n\nFreedom of Association\n\nCiti has employees who are represented by unions and works councils in a number of countries where we operate. In addition, a portion of our employee population is covered by collective bargaining agreements. We engage directly with our employees and through these associations to discuss issues such as health and safety, remuneration, work hours, training, career development, work time flexibility and equal opportunity. Information related to freedom of association is communicated to employees through various mediums, including employee handbooks, our intranet and employee emails.\n\nExtending Respect for Human Rights Through Our Suppliers\n\nOur nondiscrimination policies extend to Citi\u2019s suppliers, and we do not work with suppliers that are discovered to discriminate on the basis of personal characteristics, such as gender, race and sexual orientation. Since 1977, we have used our supplier diversity program to empower communities around the world. We communicate our approach to human rights to our suppliers in our Statement of Supplier Principles. Our approach is reinforced by our Corporate Responsibility Questionnaire (CRQ). This questionnaire helps our procurement team determine how potential and current suppliers manage environmental and social issues, including human rights issues.\n\nBuilding on our prior efforts, we have updated and expanded our CRQ to improve supplier engagement and evaluation of their operations. The latest assessment expands on our previous questions in the areas of modern slavery, supplier diversity, environmental sustainability, corporate responsibility, labor rights and workplace safety. In addition, we have introduced additional screening related to modern slavery for suppliers in high-risk sectors and countries.\n\nCiti is committed to SDG 8, which aims to promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all. This is exemplified by our work to fight modern slavery in our value chain, along with our related reporting, policies, due diligence and risk assessments. In particular, our initiatives in these areas address target 8.7, which includes a mandate to eradicate forced labor, end modern slavery and human trafficking and end child labor in all its forms.\n\nMODERN SLAVERY DISCLOSURES\n\nEach year, we disclose our approach to identifying and mitigating the risks of modern slavery in our operations (including client transactions) and in our supply chain. The disclosures cover information about our governance and policies related to modern slavery, risk assessment and due diligence processes, and training. In 2021, we released our first Modern Slavery Statement specific to Australia.\nRespecting Human Rights in Our Financing Decisions\n\nEffectively evaluating human rights risks related to our clients and the projects we finance is challenging. We work diligently to meet this challenge and respect the human rights of the individuals and communities impacted by the clients we finance and their projects.\n\nWe have established policies and practices that help us influence the protection of human rights. For instance, our anti-money laundering efforts help us prevent criminally sourced funds \u2013 including funds associated with human rights abuses, such as human trafficking \u2013 from passing through our bank. Disrupting the flow of money to those perpetrating human rights abuses and denying those abusers safe harbor for illicit proceeds tied to corruption or human rights violations are effective ways to undermine their efforts.\n\nAdditionally, under our U.S. Commercial Firearms Policy, adopted in 2018, we require clients or partners that are U.S. firearms retailers or firearms manufacturers that sell through U.S. retail channels to adhere to a set of best practices regarding the sale of firearms. For retailers, these practices include selling firearms only to individuals who have completed a background check, not selling high-capacity magazines or bump stocks (which modify semiautomatic firearms to fire faster, at rates comparable to fully automatic firearms), and selling firearms to individuals under age 21 only if they have received firearms safety training (e.g., as part of active or former military or law enforcement employment or via hunter safety training). For manufacturers, best practice entails selling firearms only to retailers that follow these same practices.\n\nSuch examples illustrate our ability to proactively avoid certain business transactions with adverse impacts on human rights, but other situations can occur in which the link between our financial services and human rights impacts is less direct. That complexity may mean we have less leverage, and it diminishes our ability to ensure that on-the-ground outcomes are consistent with Citi\u2019s values. In these instances, we work to improve our clients\u2019 awareness and business practices. In addition, where a transaction\u2019s financial and legal structure allows it, we put loan covenants in place and monitor mitigation efforts through our ESRM systems and corrective action plans.\n\nDue Diligence in Client Transactions\n\nCiti has thousands of corporate and institutional clients. The UN Guiding Principles acknowledge the challenges presented by extensive business relationships, and we have adopted the approach set out in the UN Guiding Principles of prioritizing our due diligence and risk mitigation first in areas where the risk of adverse human rights impact is most significant from the perspective of the people who may be affected.\n\nWe use our ESRM Policy, where applicable, to assess and manage risks consistently and to evaluate client operations against a common set of standards grounded in international best practice, including the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, ILO Forced Labour Indicators, Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, and International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards, among other international human rights norms and emerging standards. Our ESRM team screens transactions covered by our ESRM Policy during the initial marketing\nphase to identify potential heightened environmental or social risks related to the client. Our policy prohibits financing any project for which our due diligence identifies the use of forced labor, harmful or exploitative child labor, or when the relevant labor forces have been subjected to human trafficking. Under the ESRM Policy, Citi screens for human rights risks in project-related transactions and clients subject to ESRM sector-specific requirements. In addition, the ESRM Policy includes Areas of High Caution, which identify flags for heightened human rights risk factors to escalate to the specialized ESRM team for review regardless of financial product or sector.\n\nIf, during our initial screening for a transaction, we find a risk of adverse impacts, we conduct more in-depth due diligence, and we evaluate the client\u2019s commitment and capacity to avoid, mitigate and/or manage those impacts in accordance with international industry best practices and human rights norms and the client\u2019s willingness to continuously improve. We escalate the most challenging cases with the highest potential for adverse impacts to senior business and risk managers for collective discussion on the risks and the client\u2019s commitment and capacity. In some cases, senior management will conclude that the likelihood for adverse impacts is too great \u2013 posing an imminent threat to people or communities \u2013 and we will decline involvement in the transaction. In severe circumstances, where we cannot otherwise effectively influence different human rights outcomes despite our best efforts of sustained engagement, we will end the client relationship. This is a move we take very seriously, since we recognize that it can have a number of ramifications, including removing any leverage we might otherwise have had to improve practices over time through constructive engagement.\n\nAfter the financial close of a transaction or a client onboarding that was subject to a time-bound environmental and social action plan, we monitor the company\u2019s implementation of those actions. For project-related transactions this often involves the retention of an independent environmental and social risk consultant who periodically reports to lenders after on-the-ground audits. In addition, for non-project related transactions where human rights risks have been flagged for ongoing monitoring, our ESRM team uses annual client credit reviews as touchpoints to assess progress on human-rights-related issues.\n\nProtection of Indigenous Rights in Latin America\n\nCiti understands that Indigenous Peoples\u2019 distinct identities, languages, beliefs, cultural values, lands and use of natural resources may be under threat, representing a higher degree of vulnerability. Activities that may impact Indigenous People have long been acknowledged as an Area of High Caution under our ESRM Policy, and require enhanced due diligence.\n\nIn 2021, we put additional emphasis on the evaluation of our Latin American oil and gas clients and mining clients during new transactions and annual credit reviews, to continue identifying clients with operations that may overlap Indigenous territories. All clients were assessed on their community engagement and biodiversity management practices. When overlap with Indigenous territories was identified, Citi engaged clients to assess how they incorporated free, prior and informed consent into their engagement practices with Indigenous Peoples.\nIdentifying Human Rights Risks in Transactions\n\nCiti\u2019s ESRM team screens transactions under the ESRM Policy for potential human rights risks. The specific types of human rights risks we screen for are outlined in the table below. Further data related to ESRM Policy screening can be found in the Environmental and Social Risk Management section.\n\nWhen human rights risks are identified for a project-related transaction during screening, the ESRM team may either decline to approve the opportunity outright, if the risks are deemed too high to address, or we may outline what further due diligence would be needed for the transaction to proceed. There are a number of reasons why initial opportunities may not move forward, including a client declining to move forward with our due diligence review requirements.\n\nIf an opportunity progresses to the due diligence phase, our requirements include gaining access to project information that allows us to benchmark according to relevant standards, such as the IFC Performance Standards, UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, ILO Forced Labour Indicators and the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights among other international human rights norms. In project-related lending this due diligence would be supported by a qualified independent consultant. In circumstances where a project is not aligned with applicable international standards, we will not approve financing until we are satisfied that the client has appropriate plans and capacity to mitigate project risks. For example, in 2021 we declined a project-related financing opportunity for an industrial agricultural project in Africa with concerns related to involuntary resettlement, child labor and biodiversity impacts.\n\nFor general corporate-level transactions (e.g., renewing revolving credit facilities, issuing corporate bonds) that have elevated human rights risks, we have less direct leverage than in project-related financing, but we review our clients\u2019 policies and practices relevant to human rights issues to evaluate their ability to avoid, manage and minimize these risks. We also engage our clients to understand their implementation of those policies and whether they have appropriate staffing to manage these issues, and we review and encourage strong disclosures of human rights policies.\n\n### Human Rights Risks Screened During Transaction Reviews\n\n| **Conflict Risk:** | Project-induced conflict risk, which may be tied to competition for resources or land |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Cultural Heritage:** | Properties and sites of archaeological, historical, cultural, artistic and religious significance; unique environmental features and cultural knowledge; intangible forms of culture embodying traditional lifestyles |\n| **Environmental Justice:** | Potential environmental risks to historically marginalized communities, especially surrounding industrial developments |\n| **Indigenous Peoples:** | Concerns regarding the extent to which Indigenous communities are consulted during project development and have consented to impacts to their land, livelihood and cultural heritage |\n| **Labor Risks:** | Risks related to labor forces used in the construction of projects or other operations, including those associated with forced labor, child labor and human trafficking by project operators and their subcontractors |\n| **Resettlement:** | Resettlement of local communities, including Indigenous groups, as necessary for project implementation; requires resettlement action plans and should include efforts to gain the free, prior and informed consent of Indigenous communities |\n| **Security Practices:** | Concerns about how project sponsors engage with public or private security forces protecting project sites |\n| **Water:** | Project-related impacts that hinder access to water or negatively affect water quality for local communities |\nProviding Access to Remedy\n\nThe UN Guiding Principles call on governments and companies to play their respective roles in ensuring that victims of human rights abuse have access to effective remedy. Remedy can take many different forms, including apologies, financial or nonfinancial compensation, or efforts to prevent future harm through policy commitments and changes in operational practice. The purpose of remedy is to help make victims whole again or to restore them, as much as possible, to their lives and enjoyment of their rights before those rights were violated. Remedy can also help ensure that they and others will not suffer similar harm in the future.\n\nWhen we are made aware of a potentially severe adverse human rights impact, our approach to remedy usually involves working with clients to ensure they have the right policies in place and that channels are available to enable victims to lodge grievances. In addition, in line with our ability to prioritize adverse impacts based on severity, we will encourage clients to follow up on allegations and to have established processes to offer remedy or to cooperate with authorities to make sure effective remedy is provided. For example, in 2021, as the result of our portfolio review in Malaysia related to forced labor and related client engagement, several clients have improved their practices in this area, or are in the process of doing so, by providing workers compensation for recruitment fees and constructing better accommodations to house those working for them.\n\nLearning and Engagement\n\nEngaging Stakeholders\n\nTo ensure that we are living up to our commitment to respect human rights and anticipate emerging risks, we regularly communicate our approach externally, engage with stakeholders on their issues of concern and work to advance respect for human rights more broadly.\n\nDuring 2021, we led an Equator Principles Association collaboration with Shift to develop enhanced guidance for EP financial institutions for evaluating adequate grievance mechanisms and access to remedy. Citi is also a member of the Shift Financial Institutions Practitioners Circle, through which we participate in workshops related to skill building on human rights due diligence for ESRM practitioners and deep dives into emerging salient human rights risks. This collaboration has helped us refine our approach to forced labor and human rights in the Asia Pacific region.\n\nIn addition, we continued to pay close attention to human rights issues raised by stakeholders regarding specific industries. In 2021, concerns were raised by stakeholders relating to the oil and gas, manufacturing, technology and palm oil sectors. We engage with these industries directly through client relationships, stakeholder meetings and active participation in relevant initiatives. For instance, our participation in the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil enables us to engage with multiple stakeholders connected to the palm oil value chain, to improve the collective effort to reduce human rights risks associated with this commodity. In addition, our touch points during annual reviews allow us to evaluate human rights risks and management through client engagements.\n\nAlthough banks are often under pressure to disclose specific findings related to client projects, we are bound by legal requirements related to confidentiality that limit our ability to disclose such information without client consent. As a result, addressing requests for transparency is a balancing act between protecting the confidentiality of our clients\u2019 information and disclosing information to stakeholders as appropriate to advance the protection of human rights.\n\nReporting Mechanisms for Stakeholders\n\nOur Ethics Hotline provides a way for our employees, suppliers and other external stakeholders, including the public, to report concerns about unethical behavior to Citi\u2019s Ethics Office. Stakeholders and whistleblowers can report violations to the Ethics Hotline using a 24-hour phone line, email address, fax line, website or physical mailing address.\n\nIn addition, for project-related finance, we apply the Equator Principles to assess and manage environmental and social risks. This includes an assessment of the project sponsor\u2019s stakeholder engagement process, as well as its operational-level grievance mechanisms that allow affected communities to raise concerns proactively with the project developers.\n\nEmployee Training\n\nHuman rights content is integrated into the training we provide for the employees responsible for implementing our ESRM Policy and in our Code of Conduct training, which is required of all employees. In recent years, we have developed a comprehensive training module on modern slavery, which we provided to our Resource Management Organization (our employees responsible for procurement and supply chain activities). In 2021, we updated that training with the goal of expanding it to other functions globally.\nResponsible Sourcing\n\nAs a global firm that engages with thousands of suppliers across the world, our commitment to responsible sourcing can have wide-ranging effects. Citi\u2019s goal is to have a positive impact on people, the environment and the economy through our supply chain decisions. We seek to work with suppliers that share our values, and we set high standards for performance, measurement and responsible business practices.\n\nWe are committed to providing more opportunities for certified diverse suppliers. Citi\u2019s Supply Chain Development, Inclusion and Sustainability (SCDIS) Program provides the framework and governance that guide Citi employees to make sourcing decisions that support inclusive processes and increase our roster of diverse suppliers. Additionally, the SCDIS Program works across our supply chain to enhance sustainability practices, while mitigating social and environmental risks for all suppliers.\n\nSupplier Diversity\n\nCiti is committed to integrating supplier diversity across our entire business. Our SCDIS team sets clear supplier diversity goals and embeds them in our sourcing processes. Every bid over $250,000 requires the consideration of diverse firms. Promoting the inclusion of diverse suppliers in the bidding process helps us to build a supplier base that more fully represents the communities we serve.\n\nSupplier Policies\n\nCiti has detailed standards and policies, which guide responsible sourcing initiatives and communicate our expectations related to environmental and social issues to our suppliers:\n\n- The Citi Statement of Supplier Principles outlines the foundational guidelines for our sustainable supply chain initiatives, including those related to human rights in the workplace, ethical business practices, implementation of required management systems and environmental sustainability.\n- The Citi Requirements for Suppliers provides detailed processes and procedures that our suppliers must follow for contractual compliance and facilitates awareness of other key Citi policy obligations.\n- We also ask suppliers to abide by the Citi Statement on Human Rights. For more information about our approach in this area, see the Human Rights section.\n\nConsistent with applicable modern slavery regulations, Citi publishes disclosures outlining our approach to identifying and mitigating the risks of modern slavery in our operations and supply chain.\n\nRacial Equity\n\nOne of Citi\u2019s Action for Racial Equity commitments is investment in Black entrepreneurship, which includes a goal to increase our overall spend with certified diverse suppliers to $1 billion annually, including $250 million with Black-owned firms. We achieved over $1 billion in diverse supplier spend in 2021. We have also established a task force that meets bi-weekly to review progress against our supplier diversity goals, evaluate spend with diverse suppliers and discuss new opportunities with broader initiatives across the company.\n\nIn 2021, we introduced more than 200 diverse suppliers, who have expertise in information technology staffing, learning and development, customer experience, neurodiversity, career entry, and advertising and marketing, to Citi business leaders.\n\n2021 SPENDING WITH TIER 1 DIVERSE SUPPLIERS\n\n$1,212M spent with Tier 1 diverse suppliers**\n\n$432M spent with Tier 1 Black-owned suppliers\n\n$172M spent with Tier 1 women-owned suppliers\n\n* Tier 1 suppliers are those Citi procures goods and services from directly.\n** This includes spend with many types of diverse suppliers, including Black-owned and women-owned firms.\nIn addition to increasing our spend with diverse suppliers, we have an Action for Racial Equity commitment to strengthen Citi\u2019s policies and practices to become an anti-racist institution. This includes expanding Citi\u2019s capital market activities with minority-owned broker-dealers to assist with business and franchise development.\n\nIn 2021, we engaged diverse broker-dealers to participate in 92% of Citi\u2019s benchmark debt issuances, including 100% of our USD transactions. During the year, we also issued our first Citi Social Finance bond, with a notional value of $1 billion. For this transaction, we worked with a syndicate of minority- and women-owned businesses, of which Black-owned broker-dealers comprised approximately 20%. In addition, to commemorate Martin Luther King Jr. Day, we worked exclusively with Black-owned broker-dealers to syndicate a $2.5 billion bond issuance.\n\nTo promote additional opportunities, we host an annual breakfast, during which our diverse broker-dealers can share best practices and network with Citi leaders.\n\nWomen-Owned Businesses\n\nCiti is committed to procuring goods and services from women-owned businesses and identifying opportunities for these firms, with an emphasis in developing markets. In 2021, we procured $172 million in goods and services from women-owned businesses.\n\nDuring 2021, Citi participated in WEConnect International sessions for women-owned businesses globally, that emphasized diversity and supply chain development and sustainability. We also joined WEConnect matchmaker and supplier showcase sessions in Latin America that enabled women-owned businesses to present their capabilities and make connections with Citi\u2019s procurement colleagues. Similarly, Citi Indonesia was part of capacity-building workshops held by WEConnect to strengthen market access for women-owned businesses.\n\nWe worked with the Women\u2019s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC) to expand our Bridge built by CitiSM program, a lending platform that connects businesses with local banks for loans. Through this partnership, Citi collaborated with WBENC to identify more than 2,000 women-owned businesses based in locations where the Bridge built by Citi program lending opportunity is available to them.\n\nAdditionally, we rolled out an initiative with our major IT suppliers in India to further the participation of women in technology. This included sessions with suppliers to discuss best practices for recruitment, hiring, retention and career progression for women, as well as a \u201cReturn to Career\u201d program focused on bringing women back into the workforce who were on sabbatical or long leave.\n\nOur efforts to support women-owned businesses align with SDG 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. Our work in this area helps address target 5.5, which aims to ensure women\u2019s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic, and public life.\n\nBuilding Capabilities of Diverse Suppliers\n\nThe SCDIS team provides U.S.-based small firms and women-, veteran-, disability-, LGBTQ+- and minority-owned businesses access to business opportunities, training and mentoring. Our team identifies diverse suppliers, including small businesses that can meet our supply chain needs, then subsequently works to build their capabilities.\n\nIn 2021, we established our Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 program, designed to strengthen our diverse suppliers\u2019 capabilities and expand their opportunities both inside and outside Citi. Through this program, Citi connects established Tier 1 suppliers with minority-, Black-, and/or women-owned Tier 2 suppliers in a mentoring relationship. This provides smaller, diverse suppliers with an opportunity to gain valuable experience in financial services and build important skills to help them compete in the marketplace. One successful pairing within this program is that of mentor company Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), a Tier 1 supplier offering IT & Operations services to Citi, and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firm Technology Concepts Group International (TCGi), a Black-, woman-owned supplier that provides IT services to TCS for the benefit of Citi. The unique element of this pairing is that TCS has contextualized and structured the mentorship around TCGi\u2019s current challenges and shifted gears from\ntraining to capability building. As a result, TCGi is building holistic expertise including technical, functional and soft skills.\n\nWe continue to host events for diverse businesses across the globe to share best practices for doing business with Citi and other large companies. Our global \u201cDoing Business with Citi\u201d session is open to any supplier affiliated with select diversity certification agencies. The 2021 event had nearly 700 attendees, most of whom were diverse suppliers.\n\nIn addition, Citi participated in the NMSDC Emerging Entrepreneurs Program, which includes a new mentoring approach called Success Circles. Entrepreneurs are placed with a group of experts who use their collective talents and connections to help the entrepreneurs build their businesses. Citi also provided a scholarship to the Tuck School of Business Minority Business Enterprise Program as part of this initiative.\n\nDuring 2021, we collaborated with the New York & New Jersey Minority Supplier Development Council to host the 11th annual Sustainability Symposium, where Citi hosted and moderated a Sustainability panel. Panelists shared perspectives on supply chain sustainability, ESG metrics, human rights, net zero carbon emissions programs and the impact of COVID-19 on business growth. The panel included leaders from Citi, UN Women, Ernst & Young and Accenture.\n\nWe continue to support the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) program in South Africa, maintaining a Level 3 BBBEE Scorecard for the inclusion of diverse suppliers during 2020/2021 for local operations.\n\nSupplier Engagement and Evaluation\n\nSince 2013, the SCDIS team has used a Corporate Responsibility Questionnaire (CRQ) to gauge how effectively our suppliers are managing critical issues, such as human rights, environmental management, health and safety, labor practices and diversity.\n\nIn 2020, we began rolling out an updated version of this evaluation tool, which includes an expanded assessment in the areas of modern slavery, supplier diversity, environmental sustainability, corporate responsibility, labor rights and workplace safety. This latest version of the CRQ brings more rigor to our supplier assessment process and will continue to raise the bar for our ESG practices across Citi\u2019s supply chain. It is also helping raise awareness about supply chain corporate\n\n2021 Corporate Responsibility Questionnaire (CRQ) Surveys Completed\n\n1,049 North America\n\n192 Europe, Middle East, and Africa\n\n277 Mexico\n\n277 Latin America\n\n1,133 Asia Pacific\n\nThe CRQ is available in 13 languages:\n\n- Arabic\n- English\n- French\n- German\n- Hungarian\n- Japanese\n- Korean\n- Portuguese\n- Russian\n- Spanish\n- Turkish\n- Simplified Chinese\n- Traditional Chinese\nresponsibility with our colleagues across the company.\n\nOur goal is for all suppliers to complete the CRQ every two years. This helps improve environmental and social practices throughout our supply chain.\n\nSupply Chain Sustainability Focus Areas\n\nCiti has three sustainability focus areas for our supply chain: paper and paper products, IT hardware and e-waste disposal, and travel and logistics. We have developed actions for each of these areas and incorporated them into our supply chain Global Operating Procedures.\n\nAs a result of choosing EPEAT-certified options for 99% of our deployed servers, laptops, desktop computers, monitors and mobile phones, we estimate an energy savings of 273 million kilowatt-hours and a greenhouse gas reduction of 57,200 metric tons of CO\u2082 over the life cycle of the products.\n\nIn support of responsible forestry, Citi made a commitment in 2020 to use Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) Chain of Custody-certified paper for the outer envelopes used for statements and customer communications. During 2021, we made the transition to and began using FSC-certified paper for outer envelopes. We also began integrating a requirement for FSC-certified bulk roll paper (used for printing statements) into our Request for Proposal (RFP) process. However, we have paused this effort due to global supply chain disruptions that have posed serious challenges to sourcing adequate amounts of FSC-certified paper. We will reassess whether it is possible to move forward with updated RFPs in 2022 and continue to advance our use of digital alternatives.\nAppendices\n\nIn This Section\n\n139  GRI Content Index\n150  Sustainability Accounting Standards Board Index\n155  The Principles for Responsible Banking Index\n168  Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Index\n170  United Nations Global Compact Index\n172  United Nations Guiding Principles Reporting Framework Index\n176  Assurance\nGRI Content Index\n\nWe prepared this report in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option.

Prior to becoming a signatory to the Principles, we were engaged in this impact assessment process and we continue to learn from it and adapt it to new and emerging best practices. As such, our process involves concurrent workstreams that provide continuous feedback for the monitoring of potential impacts.\n\nThis integrated process aligns with the directional intent of the Principles to \u201cembed sustainability at the strategic, portfolio, and transactional levels across all business areas.\u201d We recognize that any approach towards impact analysis is never complete, and the guidance developed by the PRB working group can be used to help complement our existing work. Additionally, for financial institutions that are beginning their work to explore areas of greatest impacts, we regard the Principles as an efficient framework for embarking on this level of analysis.\n\nWe plan to use the Principles and reporting from our peers to benchmark the impact areas we have identified and ensure that we are addressing society\u2019s needs in the regions in which we operate and the markets that we serve.\n\nCiti\u2019s Approach\nCiti\u2019s approach to impact consists of multiple concurrent processes, summarized below. Note that these processes, as described, do not necessarily occur in the order presented.\n\n1. Feedback Pathways: To identify potential impact areas, we engage a number of internal and external stakeholders, partners and tools, including:\n\na) Periodic stakeholder engagement:\nCiti regularly reviews its stakeholder partnerships across a range of functions including Global Public Affairs; Investor Relations; Human Resources and Corporate Governance as well as Sustainability; Government Affairs and other teams in Public Affairs. Examples of our stakeholder engagements from 2021 are highlighted in the Stakeholder Engagement at Citi section of this report.\n\nFurthermore, we periodically have feedback sessions for stakeholders including clients, investors and NGOs facilitated by the nonprofit sustainability advocacy organization Ceres. These sessions focus on areas such as our Sustainable Progress Strategy and approach to addressing climate change including, most recently, our setting of net zero targets and measurement of baseline emissions. For more information, please see pages 26-27 of our 2021 TCFD Report.\n\nb) Partnerships with trade organizations:\nBecoming a signatory to global industry initiatives and participating in working groups keeps us abreast of emerging issues and best practices for addressing them. Engagements with organizations such as the Equator Principles, Institute of International Finance (IIF), United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) and GISD highlight potential issues, increasing awareness of our own potential impacts as a global bank. Such involvement also allows for opportunities to support public policy and regulation that encourages sustainable development.\n\nc) Third-party ratings:\nAnalyses conducted by third-party organizations allow Citi to benchmark our approaches to certain ESG issues against standardized frameworks and methodologies. Such ratings and their accompanying reports identify areas for improvement and provide useful data that can help drive performance.\n\n2021 ESG Report:\n\u2022 Our Material ESG Issues: Citi in a Global Context\n\u2022 Stakeholder Engagement at Citi\n\u2022 Sustainable Finance\n\u2022 Sustainable Progress\n\u2022 Climate Risk and Net Zero\n\u2022 Equitable and Resilient Communities\n\nExternal References:\n\u2022 2021 TCFD Report\n\u2022 Action for Racial Equity\n\u2022 Banking in Color\n\u2022 Closing the Racial Inequality Gaps\n\u2022 Environmental and Social Policies Framework\n\u2022 Net Zero Commitment\n\u2022 Sustainable Progress Strategy\n\u2022 The Devaluation of Assets in Black Neighborhoods\n\u2022 The Racial Wealth Gap\n\u2022 202110-K\nHigh-Level Summary of Bank\u2019s Response (continued)\n\nd) Public-Private Partnerships:\nWorking with research organizations, academic institutions and in the case of our racial equity work, initiatives like the U.S. Treasury OCC\u2019s Project REACH (Roundtable for Economic Access and Change) allows Citi the opportunity to direct private sector resources towards public-sector initiatives while also providing first-hand insight into the issues facing the clients, countries and communities with which we work.\n\n2. Normalization of Feedback: Given the myriad streams of incoming feedback and the numerous potential impact areas identified by the pathways described above, we use the following tools to help identify which areas are the most salient and actionable:\n\na) Materiality Assessments:\nWe periodically conduct materiality assessments to identify our most relevant (or \u201cmaterial\u201d) reporting topics from an ESG perspective \u2014 which is a broader standard than that used in our financial disclosures. Such assessments provide a methodological way to gauge and quantify the relative salience of potential impact areas to our key stakeholders. This assessment also mirrors \u2014 and informs \u2014 our increased strategic efforts on these issues. It has also driven our increased reporting on these material topics.\n\nb) Research:\nCiti maintains strong relationships with academic institutions, think tanks and industry groups that periodically publish reports highlighting developing trends and areas of economic and social impact. Citi also considers research conducted by our thought leadership group, Citi Global Perspectives & Solutions (Citi GPS), which analyzes the global economy\u2019s most demanding challenges.\n\nc) Consideration of core business areas, products/services and the geographies we work in:\nQualitative and quantitative factors such as market presence, sectoral exposure and revenue associated with certain businesses and regions may also contribute to our assessment of our potential impacts.\n\nCiti\u2019s Initial Impact Areas\nThe following describes considerations taken as part of our ESG impact analysis approach, which identified our two areas of greatest impact: climate change globally and racial equity in the United States.\n\nNote: As mentioned in our response to disclosure 1.1 of this index, during 2021, Citi was managed pursuant to two operating segments, ICG and GCB, and the reporting structure changed in Q1 2022, as described on page 6 of our 2021 10-K. The findings below are based on the GCB and ICG reporting structure during 2021. However, we believe the conclusions will be applicable to the new structure in 2022.\n\nScope and Scale:\nIn our initial review of potential impact areas, we consider our core business activities under our two primary segments, GCB and ICG, the regions they serve and the revenues attributed to businesses within each.\n\nRegions:\n- GCB: North America; Latin America; Asia\n- ICG: North America; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); Latin America; Asia\n\nCore Business Activities:\n- GCB: Retail banking; Branded cards; Retail services*\n- ICG: Investment banking (advisory and equity and debt underwriting), Markets (fixed income markets, equity markets, securities services and other), Treasury and trade solutions, Corporate lending and Private bank\n\n* This GCB business is in North America only\n\nFindings (Based on 2021 10-K filing):\nGCB: In 2021, revenues for retail banking activity in Latin America and Asia were nearly double the revenue of branded cards in these regions. In North America, the opposite was true, with branded cards exceeding retail banking revenues. However, absolute revenue from retail banking in North America was highest among the three regions. Likewise, aggregate revenue for all three GCB businesses in North America exceeded Latin America and Asia combined.\n\nICG: Unlike GCB, which had a majority of its revenue concentrated in North America, revenues for aggregate ICG activity were more evenly distributed among the primary regions, reflecting this segment\u2019s global work. Among the highest revenue-generating activities were markets and securities services (particularly fixed income activity) and treasury and trade solutions.\n\nAdditionally, we consider activity outside of our core businesses. For example, through strategic grant-making efforts, the Citi Foundation promotes economic progress in low-income communities around the world, including programs that increase financial inclusion. The Citi Impact Fund is a $200 million venture capital fund with a mission of investing in double bottom line companies that are addressing societal changes. The fund prioritizes companies that are led or owned by women or racial/ethnic minorities and that are addressing societal challenges, such as reaching low- and moderate-income households with innovative financial and workforce services, delivering solutions for the climate transition economy and addressing needs for inclusive healthcare and housing.\n\nInitial Areas of Focus:\nGCB: Based on the screening above, we focused on North America, given the concentration of revenue generation there, and focused on global activity for ICG. While GCB revenue in North America during 2021 was driven by our branded cards activity, we feel that a focus on retail banking has more impact, considering the potential societal benefits from small business lending and greater access to financial services and credit through programs like the Citi\u00ae Access Account Package.\n\nICG: Although our fixed income markets and treasury and trade solutions activity generated the most revenue during 2021, they serve to support market-making activity and cash-management capacity for clients and thus have more indirect impact. We concluded that our corporate lending and underwriting activity is the most directly associated with impact, and that through these activities we can be more influential and actionable. This is supported by our industry group partnerships described in the Context and Relevance section below. Therefore, global corporate lending is the scope of our initial focus.\nHigh-Level Summary of Bank\u2019s Response (continued)\n\nWe also consider activities of the Citi Foundation and Impact Fund, where they complement Citi\u2019s ESG-related goals and efforts alongside our core business activities. In the future we will consider corporate underwriting.\n\nContext and Relevance\nFrom the feedback pathways described in the Citi\u2019s Approach section above, we maintain awareness of the most relevant sustainable development challenges and priorities in the countries and regions in which we operate. Below, we discuss our focus on climate change mitigation globally and racial equity in the United States.\n\nGlobal Context:\nThe climate crisis is one of the most critical challenges facing our global society and economy in the 21st century. The data is irrefutable and the world\u2019s climate scientists agree: Urgent action must be taken to address the current and potential impacts of climate change, including chronic changes to temperature and precipitation, diminishing polar sea ice, rising sea levels and more intense and frequent extreme weather events. 2021 was the sixth warmest year on record. That year, we experienced devastating wildfires on the West Coast of the U.S. and in Australia, and one of the most active hurricane seasons in the Atlantic. Additionally, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s (IPCC\u2019s) 6th Assessment Report, released in 2021, further highlights the urgent need to address climate change. Reports also show that vulnerable and marginalized communities are likely to bear a disproportionate share of any physical climate impacts.\n\nU.S. Context:\nA wide range of data and studies have found that many major gaps in economic opportunity, education, income, housing and wealth run along racial lines, particularly between Black and white households. Some gaps remain wide 60 years after the civil rights movement and some, including in homeownership rates and college degree attainment, are even wider now. These gaps have not only had implications for Black Americans and other people of color but the broader economy as well. Over the last few years, the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on communities of color and growing demand for racial justice further highlighted the impacts of racial inequity.\n\nIntensity and Salience\nClimate Change:\nWe have employed a number of tools to assess the intensity and salience of climate change impacts: We published baseline emissions for our Energy and Power loan portfolios in accordance with the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) standard and established emissions targets, with intentions to analyze the emissions of other carbon-intensive sectors in the future.\n\nSeveral industry-wide initiatives also identify corporate lending as a key impact area with potential to mitigate climate change:\n\u2022 The PCAF standard was established to assess financed emissions with an initial focus on lending\n\u2022 The UNEP FI Guidelines for Climate Target Setting for Banks (\u201cUNEP FI Guidelines\u201d) focus on lending and investment activities\n\u2022 PCAF also formed a Capital Markets Working Group, with which Citi has been involved, to develop standards for measuring emissions associated with underwriting activity \u2013 an area of activity that Citi will also explore for its potential impacts.\n\nRacial Equity:\nFor over 20 years, Citi and the Citi Foundation have invested in organizations and partnerships that support financial inclusion and expanding economic opportunities for low-income families and communities of color, such as the Asset Building Policy Network. Through engagement with these and other stakeholders, including minority depository institutions (MDIs), we have enhanced our understanding of the structural inequities that fuel the racial wealth gap and their impact on communities. Numerous publications and research reports articulate the scale, intensity and salience of racial equity (see External References).\n\nAdditionally, the Citi GPS report, Closing the Racial Inequality Gaps, articulates the economic impacts of the racial wealth gap. The analysis in the report shows that if four key racial gaps for Black people \u2014 wages, education, housing and investment \u2014 had been closed 20 years ago, $16 trillion could have been added to the U.S. economy. And if the gaps were closed as of 2020, $5 trillion could have been added to U.S. GDP over the next five years.\n\nNext Steps\nOur work towards addressing our areas of greatest impact is never complete, and we anticipate the following areas of activity as we move toward further implementation of the principles.\n\nClimate Change:\nAs per our NZBA commitments, we will set targets for and establish baseline emissions for additional carbon-intensive sectors, such as Auto Manufacturing, Commercial Real Estate, Steel and Thermal Coal Mining, with additional sectors such as Agriculture, Aluminum, Cement, Iron and other segments of the Transportation sector to follow, as methodological capabilities evolve to accommodate them. Additionally, once a capital markets methodology is finalized and published by PCAF, Citi plans to integrate these emissions into annual disclosures and targets.\n\nRacial Equity:\nAs discussed in the Action for Racial Equity section of this report, we seek to lead and expand firmwide engagement with MDIs, diverse broker-dealers and diverse asset managers through our newly formed Diverse Financial Institutions Group. We are also conducting a third-party racial equity audit to assess our efforts to address the racial wealth gap in the United States through implementation of Action for Racial Equity.\n\nBiodiversity:\nWe recognize that loss of biodiversity globally is an increasing emergency, and we are continuing to expand our understanding of the complex dynamics between climate and biodiversity. These two topics are interconnected, and there are increasing concerns that climate change, along with other human activity, has significantly stressed natural systems and contributed to ongoing extinction events. Although there is increasing focus on biodiversity, there has historically been limited information available to understand how companies rely on and impact natural capital as well as natural capital\u2019s impact on climate. Citi is a member of the Taskforce on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) Forum and participated in an informal working group prior to the TNFD\u2019s launch to develop its workplan to create a complementary framework to TCFD focused on reporting evolving nature-related risks.\n\nFor our impact analysis, we have identified impacts associated with our core businesses and their portfolios as described in the introduction to this section. We may further refine this process and increase the scope of our impact analysis as we explore different methodologies in subsequent reporting.\n### 2.2 Target Setting\n\nShow that the bank has set and published a minimum of two Specific, Measurable (can be qualitative or quantitative), Achievable, Relevant and Time-bound (SMART) targets, which address at least two of the identified \u201careas of most significant impact\u201d, resulting from the bank\u2019s activities and provision of products and services.\n\nShow that these targets are linked to and drive alignment with and greater contribution to appropriate SDGs, the goals of the Paris Agreement, and other relevant international, national or regional frameworks. The bank should have identified a baseline (assessed against a particular year) and have set targets against this baseline.\n\nShow that the bank has analysed and acknowledged significant (potential) negative impacts of the set targets on other dimensions of the SDG/climate change/society\u2019s goals and that it has set out relevant actions to mitigate those as far as feasible to maximize the net positive impact of the set targets.\n\nAs part of our initial impact analysis work, we have developed targets for each of the identified impact areas:\n\n#### Climate Change\n\n**Net Zero Commitment:**\nIn 2021, we announced our commitment to net zero GHG emissions by 2050, including net zero GHG emissions for our own operations by 2030. In early 2022, we published our initial net zero plan, baseline emissions and interim 2030 targets for our Energy and Power loan portfolios. For more information, see the Climate Risk and Net Zero section of this report.\n\n**$1 Trillion Commitment to Sustainable Finance:**\nIn 2021 we announced our $1 trillion sustainable finance by 2030 commitment, which includes a $500 Billion Environmental Finance Goal toward the financing and facilitation of a wide array of climate solutions, such as renewable energy, clean technology, water conservation and sustainable transportation. The $1 trillion commitment also includes $500 billion in social finance toward investments in affordable basic infrastructure, affordable housing, diversity and equity, economic inclusion, education, food security and healthcare.\n\n**Thermal Coal Mining Exposure:**\nWithin our ESRM Policy, we have included a commitment to eliminate our exposure to thermal coal mining companies by 2030, and in early 2021, we also expanded our policy related to coal-fired power. For more information, see our Environmental and Social Policy Framework.\n\nThese goals will drive alignment with SDGs 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) and 13 (Climate Action).\n\n#### Racial Equity\n\n**Action for Racial Equity:**\nIn 2020, Citi and the Citi Foundation committed $1 Billion in strategic initiatives through 2023 to help close the racial wealth gap. Our pledge focuses on four key goals and outcomes:\n- Invest in Black entrepreneurship\n- Invest in affordable housing and promote the growth of Black homeownership\n- Strengthen Citi\u2019s policies and practices in order to become an anti-racist institution\n\nThese goals will drive alignment with SDGs 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) and 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities).\n\nWe have established a firm-wide target for net zero emissions, updated our prior environmental finance target to be a comprehensive commitment to sustainable finance, which now includes social criteria, maintain Sector Approaches related to our exposure to the coal industry, and established goals under a racial equity initiative. We believe these are in line with the requirements of the Principles.\n### Reporting and Self-Assessment Requirements\n\n#### 2.3 Plans for Target Implementation and Monitoring\n\nShow that your bank has defined actions and milestones to meet the set targets.\n\nShow that your bank has put in place the means to measure and monitor progress against the set targets. Definitions of key performance indicators, any changes in these definitions, and any rebasing of baselines should be transparent.\n\n| Measures and actions we plan to put in place: |\n|-----------------------------------------------|\n| **Climate Change:** |\n| In early 2022, we released our 2021 TCFD Report, which highlights potential emissions-reduction approaches for our Energy and Power loan portfolios to reach net zero GHG emissions. |\n| In the initial net zero plan for these portfolios, we provide a phased timeline of actions and measures to achieve our interim 2030 targets including client transition assessment; advisory and finance; clean tech finance; public policy engagement, risk management; and portfolio management. These areas of activity are detailed further in the report. |\n| **Racial Equity:** |\n| In November 2021, we released our Year One Progress report, which summarizes progress made against our Action for Racial Equity commitments to help close the racial wealth gap and expand economic mobility for communities of color in the United States. The report also includes overviews on our approach to working with MDIs, providing venture capital to Black founders, supporting more equitable rental housing, embedding equity in asset management and leveraging philanthropy from the Citi Foundation to support small businesses. In October 2021, we committed to conduct an audit of Action for Racial Equity, which intends to assess the design and implementation of our effort and will help inform how to adapt and grow our work to address the racial wealth gap. |\n\n| Key Performance Indicators: |\n|-----------------------------|\n| Citi will report progress toward our targets annually using the key performance indicators listed below: |\n| **Net Zero Commitment:** |\n| \u2022 Emissions associated with key carbon-intensive sectors |\n| \u2022 Emissions associated with our operations |\n| **$1 Trillion Sustainable Finance Commitment:** |\n| \u2022 Financial performance broken down by region, criteria and business |\n| \u2022 Environmental and social impacts |\n| **Thermal Coal Mining Credit Exposure:** |\n| \u2022 Credit exposure to thermal coal companies |\n| **Action for Racial Equity:** |\n| \u2022 Growth in banking and access to credit in communities of color |\n| \u2022 Amount of equity investments in Black-owned firms |\n| \u2022 Amount of equity investments in MDIs |\n| \u2022 Growth of consumer lending capabilities that increase access to mortgage products and services |\n\nCiti has established strategies and initiatives to implement the identified targets. We have identified key performance indicators that we will report annually to monitor progress toward these targets. While the provided indicators are not an exhaustive list, we anticipate that these metrics may evolve as we move further toward implementation.\n### Reporting and Self-Assessment Requirements\n\n#### 2.4 Progress on Implementing Targets\n\n**For each target separately:**\nShow that your bank has implemented the actions it had previously defined to meet the set target.\n\nOr explain why actions could not be implemented / needed to be changed and how your bank is adapting its plan to meet its set target.\n\nReport on your bank\u2019s progress over the last 12 months (up to 18 months in your first reporting after becoming a signatory) toward achieving each of the set targets and the impact your progress resulted in (where feasible and appropriate, banks should include quantitative disclosures).\n\n| High-Level Summary of Bank\u2019s Response | References |\n|--------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Net Zero Commitment:** Following the announcement of our net zero commitment in March 2021, in early 2022, we released our initial net zero plan for our Energy and Power loan portfolios, including baseline emissions and 2030 emissions reduction targets. We will continue our work to develop emissions baselines and targets for additional carbon-intensive sectors in our portfolio. | **2021 ESG Report:**  \n- Sustainable Finance  \n- Climate Risk and Net Zero  \n- Action for Racial Equity  \n\n**External References:**  \n- 2021 TCFD Report  \n- Action for Racial Equity  \n- Environmental and Social Policy Framework  \n- Net Zero Commitment |\n| **$1 Trillion Sustainable Finance Goal:** Building on our $250 Billion Environmental Finance Goal, we announced a commitment to a $1 trillion in sustainable finance by 2030. The commitment expands the prior $250 Billion Environmental Goal to $500 Billion and includes $500 Billion toward Social Finance. Detailed progress toward the first two years of tracking toward this commitment is provided in the Sustainable Finance section of this report. As of YE2021, we have financed and facilitated $163.1 billion toward our Environmental Finance Goal and $59.0 billion toward our Social Finance Goal for a total of $222.1 billion toward the $1 trillion commitment. |  |\n| **Thermal Coal Mining Exposure:** Following the publication of the 2020 baseline, we saw a reduction of 30% in 2021, as detailed in this report. |  |\n| **Action for Racial Equity:** By November 2021, one year into our three-year pledge, Citi and the Citi Foundation had already exceeded our $1 billion commitment to invest in initiatives expanding economic opportunity for communities of color. For more details, please refer to the Equitable and Resilient Communities section in this report. |  |\n\nWe have set the targets described above and are in the early stages of implementing the measures we have put in place. In some cases, such as for our **Action for Racial Equity**, Citi and the Citi Foundation have exceeded the initiative\u2019s financial targets. We will report on progress made toward achieving our targets in our subsequent reporting.\n\n### Principle 3: Clients and Customers\n\nWe will work responsibly with our clients and our customers to encourage sustainable practices and enable economic activities that create shared prosperity for current and future generations.\n\n| 3.1 Provide an overview of the policies and practices your bank has in place and/or is planning to put in place to promote responsible relationships with its customers. This should include high-level information on any programmes and actions implemented (and/or planned), their scale and, where possible, the results thereof. | Citi has a number of policies and systems in place to ensure we treat customers responsibly and fairly:  \n- Citi Code of Conduct  \n- Citi\u2019s Treating Customers Fairly Principles  \n- Global Consumer Fairness Policy  \n- Global Financial Access Policy  \n\nMore details can be found in the Serving Our Customers and Clients Responsibly section of this report. | **2021 ESG Report:**  \n- Serving our Customers and Clients Responsibly  \n\n**External References:**  \n- Citi Code of Conduct |\n### Reporting and Self-Assessment Requirements\n\n#### 3.2 Describe how your bank has worked with and/or is planning to work with its clients and customers to encourage sustainable practices and enable sustainable economic activities. This should include information on actions planned/implemented, products and services developed, and, where possible, the impacts achieved.\n\nThrough our $1 trillion commitment to sustainable finance, we will finance and facilitate a wide array of climate solutions, such as renewable energy, clean technology, water conservation and sustainable transportation as well as activities in social finance, which include investments in education, affordable housing and basic infrastructure, healthcare, economic inclusion and food security. Reaching the goal will require the development of innovative financing solutions, increasing engagement and helping clients across all sectors, no matter where they are in their own sustainability journeys, to enable more sustainable business models and practices. For more information, please see the Sustainable Finance section in this report.\n\nTo facilitate these transitions, we have established dedicated teams embedded across our businesses to offer strategic sustainability and ESG services and solutions. Our business groups, including Banking, Capital Markets and Advisory; Global Markets; Global Wealth Management; and Treasury and Trade Solutions, all have dedicated bankers or teams focused on advising clients and offering customized ESG-themed products and services.\n\nUnder our net zero commitment, we will engage clients in carbon-intensive sectors that have low-carbon transition opportunities. We have formed specialized business units to work closely with clients to support their business plans as they transition to net zero including the Natural Resources & Clean Energy Transition team; the Sustainability & Corporate Transitions team; and the Sustainable Debt Capital Markets team. For more information, please see our 2021 TCFD Report.\n\nOur ESRM Policy helps us finance projects and activities responsibly by engaging our clients on environmental and social risks and good practices. Ongoing engagement with our clients is an important part of our ESRM process. When we first established our ESRM Policy, our engagements were tied to specific, project-related financial transactions and their associated environmental and social risks and mitigation efforts. However, as we have developed Sector Approaches and Areas of High Caution over the years, we have added corporate-level reviews and client engagements in a number of sectors. These sector-specific risk review processes encourage dialogue between Citi and our clients about the material environmental and social risks associated with their operations, enabling us to develop a better understanding of prevailing industry practices and our clients\u2019 performance and guide our clients toward better sustainability practices.\n\n### Principle 4: Stakeholders\n\nWe will proactively and responsibly consult, engage and partner with relevant stakeholders to achieve society\u2019s goals.\n\n#### 4.1 Describe which stakeholders (or groups/types of stakeholders) your bank has consulted, engaged, collaborated or partnered with for the purpose of implementing these Principles and improving your bank\u2019s impacts. This should include a high-level overview of how your bank has identified relevant stakeholders and what issues were addressed/results achieved.\n\nCiti believes that we are best able to drive business value when we serve the interests of a wide array of stakeholders, including our shareholders. We made a deliberate effort to continue stakeholder engagement in a pandemic environment. To fulfill this approach, we regularly review our stakeholder partnerships across a range of functions, including Global Public Affairs, Investor Relations, Human Resources and Corporate Governance, as well as Sustainability & ESG, Government Affairs and other teams in Public Affairs.\n\nA summary of the groups we have engaged with, the topics addressed, and results achieved is provided in Stakeholder Engagement section of this report. We also highlight our climate-related engagement with clients and trade associations in our 2021 TCFD Report.\n\n### References\n\n#### 2021 ESG Report:\n- Sustainable Finance\n- Climate Risk and Net Zero\n- Risk Management > Environmental and Social Risk Management\n\n#### External References:\n- 2021 TCFD Report\n- Environmental and Social Policy Framework\n- Net Zero Commitment\n### Principle 5: Governance & Culture\n\nWe will implement our commitment to these Principles through effective governance and a culture of responsible banking.\n\n#### 5.1 Describe the relevant governance structures, policies and procedures your bank has in place/is planning to put in place to manage significant positive and negative (potential) impacts and support effective implementation of the Principles.\n\nCiti\u2019s Board of Directors plays an important role in providing oversight of our efforts to ensure responsible business practices. For example, the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee (NGPAC) of the Board oversees Citi\u2019s global ESG activities and performance, and the Risk Management Committee (RMC) provides oversight of Citi\u2019s Risk Management function, reviews Citi\u2019s risk appetite framework, including reputational risk appetite, and reviews key risk policies, including those focused on environmental and social risk. The Ethics, Conduct and Culture Committee of the Board oversees management\u2019s efforts to foster a culture of ethics within the company and receives regular reports from senior management on the progress of those efforts.\n\nIn 2021, we formed a new Global ESG Council consisting of senior members of management in order to provide enhanced oversight of our ESG activities and goals. Additionally, to support the development and launch of our net zero plan, we formed a Net Zero Task Force in 2021. The Task Force, led by our CSO, includes leaders from diverse business units and many other functions throughout Citi.\n\nCiti also has a Global Sustainability Steering Committee, a senior-level committee formed to advise on our sustainability and climate change strategy.\n\nFor more details on governance for ESG and sustainability issues, please refer to the ESG Governance section of this report.

Our Chief Sustainability Officer, Head of Community Investing and Development and other senior executives have oversight over target-setting, measures put in place to achieve the targets and determining remedial action where targets are not on track, or where measures need to be put in place to address unforeseen negative impacts.\n\nWe track our progress toward achieving our targets via reports to the NGPAC and/or the full Board of Directors. The Chief Sustainability Officer and Head of Community Investing and Development periodically report to the Board on progress made with achieving our targets and any remedial action taken to ensure achievement of targets and/or how negative impacts were addressed. Reports are also provided to the Global ESG council on a periodic basis for progress towards our Action for Racial Equity commitments, $1 trillion sustainable finance commitment and net zero targets.\n\nWe have progressed substantially in fulfilling this requirement. The firm has a governance structure with oversight of ESG issues and will ensure that the Principles are implemented, managing significant impacts and setting and monitoring targets. The Sustainability & ESG team leads day-to-day implementation of the Principles in concert with other teams throughout the organization.\n\n### Principle 6: Transparency & Accountability\n\nWe will periodically review our individual and collective implementation of these Principles and be transparent about and accountable for our positive and negative impacts and our contribution to society\u2019s goals.\n\n#### 6.1 Progress on Implementing the Principles for Responsible Banking\n\nShow that your bank has progressed on implementing the six Principles over the last 12 months (up to 18 months in your first reporting after becoming a signatory) in addition to the setting and implementation of targets in minimum two areas (see 2.1-2.4).\n\nShow that your bank has considered existing and emerging international/regional good practices relevant for the implementation of the six Principles for Responsible Banking.

Additionally, in developing our initial net zero plan, we have participated in key net zero frameworks, including our continued participation in PCAF as well as the NZBA and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) of which we are founding members. For more information on these organizations and how they serve as converging net zero guideposts across the financial industry, please see our 2021 TCFD Report.\n\nCiti remains committed to working closely with clients to support their business plans as they transition to net zero. In March 2021, we created the Natural Resources & Clean Energy Transition team in order to drive client engagement efforts in the Energy, Power and Chemicals sectors. This team includes corporate and investment bankers with deep knowledge of these sectors and unites them under a single umbrella to more effectively evaluate and pursue opportunities to assist our clients with the net zero transition.\n\n**$1 Trillion Sustainable Finance Commitment:**\nWe recently established a $1 trillion by 2030 sustainable finance commitment, which expands our Environmental Finance Goal to $500 billion, with a focus on circular economy, clean technology, energy efficiency, green buildings, renewable energy, sustainable agriculture and land use, sustainable transportation and water quality and conservation. This commitment also includes $500 billion in social finance activity in affordable basic infrastructure, affordable housing, diversity and equity, economic inclusion, education, food security and healthcare.

The scope of the assurance, based on the SGS Sustainability Report Assurance methodology, included the data in accompanying tables, contained in this report.\n\nThe information in the \u201cCiti\u2019s 2021 ESG Report\u201d of Citigroup Inc. and its presentation are the responsibility of the directors and the management of Citigroup Inc. SGS has not been involved in the preparation of any of the material included in the \u201cCiti\u2019s 2021 ESG Report\u201d. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the text, data, graphs and statements within the scope of verification with the intention to inform all Citigroup Inc.\u2019 stakeholders.\n\nThe SGS protocols are based upon the internationally recognized Assurance Standard ISAE 3000. This standard follows differing options for Assurance depending on the context and capabilities of the Reporting Organization. This report has been assured at a limited level of scrutiny using our protocols for evaluation of content veracity and the alignment to the Equator Principles and the internal policies and procedures of Citigroup Inc.\n\nThe assurance comprised a combination of pre-assurance research, interviews with relevant employees; documentation and record review and the evaluation of the report for the alignment to the Equator Principles.\n\nSTATEMENT OF INDEPENDENCE AND COMPETENCE\nThe SGS Group of companies is the world leader in inspection, testing and verification, operating in more than 140 countries and providing services including management systems and service certification; quality, environmental, social and ethical auditing; sustainability report assurance and greenhouse gases verification. SGS affirms our independence from Citigroup Inc., being free from bias and conflicts of interest with the organization, its subsidiaries and stakeholders.\n\nThe assurance team was assembled based on their knowledge, experience and qualifications for this assignment, and comprised a Lead Assuror for Sustainability Reporting and Equator Principles, Lead Verifier in Greenhouse Gases, and Principal Auditor registered with IRCA (International Register of Certificated Auditors) in Environmental, Quality, Occupational Health & Safety, and Social Systems.\n\nASSURANCE OPINION\nBased on the methodology described and the verification work performed on the \u201cCiti\u2019s 2021 ESG Report\u201d, section \u201c2021 Projects Covered by the Equator Principles\u201d, we did not observe any circumstance that made us believe that the information and data contained within is inaccurate, unreliable, or does not provide a fair and balanced representation of Citigroup Inc.\u2019 activities in 2021. The assurance team is of the opinion that the Report can be used by the Citigroup Inc.\u2019 Stakeholders. We believe that Citigroup Inc. has chosen an appropriate level of assurance.\nCONCLUSIONS WITH REGARDS TO EQUATOR PRINCIPLES REPORTING DATA FOR 2021\n\nIn our opinion the \u201cCiti\u2019s 2021 ESG Report\u201d reported information of the Equator Principles, as detailed at the section \u201c2021 Projects Covered by Equator Principles\u201d and is presented in accordance with the Equator Principles IV (EP4), Annex B \u201cMinimum Reporting Requirements\u201d.\n\nSGS based this opinion in the review of Citi\u2019s internal documents and a sample of EP-covered financial products and their respective EP checklists and Independent Reviews.\n\nCitigroup Inc. reported information is aligned to the EP Reporting Criteria requirements as follows:\n\n- Public Reporting of the EP-covered financial products separately: Project Finance Advisory Services, Project Finance Loans, Project-Related Corporate Loans, Bridge Loans and Project-Related Refinance and Project-Related Acquisition Finance. There were only Project Finance Loans and PRCL in 2021.\n- The loans were categorized as A, B or C, dependent on the environmental and social risks posed.\n- Total number of Project Finance Loans and Project-Related Corporate Loans that reached Financial Close during the reporting period (2021)\n- The Project Finance Loans and Project-Related Corporate Loans were broken down by: Sector, Region, Country Designation, and whether an whether an Independent Review has been carried out.\n- Independent review is required for A projects and, for B projects when needed. Both Project Finance transactions were category B, and both had an Independent Review.\n- The EP transactions were over the threshold of:\n  - 10 million USD for Project Capital Cost required in the Equator Principles IV for project finance loans, and\n  - Over 50 million USD for Project-Related Corporate Loans (total aggregate loan amount and the EPFI\u2019s individual commitment) in the Equator Principles IV\n- It was identified the transactions which their combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 Emissions are expected to be more than 100,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent annually. In these cases, an annual GHG emissions report and a climate change risk assessment is requested for the transaction.\n\nLead Assessor: Ursula Antunez\n\nPamela Chadwick\nBusiness Manager\nSGS UK Ltd\n\nLead Sustainability Report Assuror: Ursula Antunez de Mayolo Corzo\nDate: 21st March of 2022\n\nwww.sgs.com\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThe disclosures included in this report are being provided to the public in an effort to provide transparency into our environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives to respond to stakeholder requests, and to further enhance our collective understanding of ESG issues. Our approaches to the disclosures included in this report are different from those included in mandatory regulatory reporting, including under SEC regulations. Certain statements in this report may contain \u201cforward-looking statements.\u201d These statements speak only as of the date they are originally made and are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, changes in circumstances, and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond our control. These statements are not guarantees of future results, occurrences, or performance. Actual results and financial outcomes may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by any of these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including, among others, global socio-demographic and economic trends, climate-related conditions and weather events, legislative and regulatory changes, and other unforeseen events or conditions. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements can be found in this report, in Citi\u2019s filings with the SEC, including, without limitation, the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of Citi\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K and disclosures available on our corporate website. Citi does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-looking statements were made. This report contains statements based on hypothetical or severely adverse scenarios and assumptions, and these statements should not necessarily be viewed as being representative of current or actual risk or forecasts of expected risk. While future events discussed in this report may be significant, any significance should not be read as necessarily rising to the level of materiality of the disclosures required under U.S. federal securities laws.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-04-27", "created": "2025-04-27", "metadata": {"Source-File": "climate_reports/tp_reports/citigroup_2021.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.1.59", "pdf-total-pages": 183, "total-input-tokens": 641427, "total-output-tokens": 122646, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 47, 1], [47, 1301, 2], [1301, 3034, 3], [3034, 3251, 4], [3251, 8143, 5], [8143, 10948, 6], [10948, 13334, 7], [13334, 15927, 8], [15927, 18536, 9], [18536, 21194, 10], [21194, 26374, 11], [26374, 30791, 12], [30791, 32291, 13], [32291, 35028, 14], [35028, 39603, 15], [39603, 40894, 16], [40894, 44333, 17], [44333, 47805, 18], [47805, 47874, 19], [47874, 49152, 20], [49152, 49648, 21], [49648, 53627, 22], [53627, 57462, 23], [57462, 60537, 24], [60537, 63497, 25], [63497, 65878, 26], [65878, 70727, 27], [70727, 74915, 28], [74915, 77764, 29], [77764, 77897, 30], [77897, 80233, 31], [80233, 81590, 32], [81590, 84069, 33], [84069, 87199, 34], [87199, 90961, 35], [90961, 96366, 36], [96366, 99506, 37], [99506, 104068, 38], [104068, 107202, 39], [107202, 108801, 40], [108801, 112316, 41], [112316, 115294, 42], [115294, 116381, 43], [116381, 119711, 44], [119711, 123828, 45], [123828, 128516, 46], [128516, 135440, 47], [135440, 141826, 48], [141826, 143634, 49], [143634, 147247, 50], [147247, 150312, 51], [150312, 153010, 52], [153010, 156413, 53], [156413, 159256, 54], [159256, 163456, 55], [163456, 166288, 56], [166288, 170194, 57], [170194, 172440, 58], [172440, 174147, 59], [174147, 174371, 60], [174371, 176233, 61], [176233, 180318, 62], [180318, 182099, 63], [182099, 183782, 64], [183782, 185280, 65], [185280, 189516, 66], [189516, 192052, 67], [192052, 194838, 68], [194838, 198317, 69], [198317, 199764, 70], [199764, 203065, 71], [203065, 206734, 72], [206734, 208506, 73], [208506, 210051, 74], [210051, 212819, 75], [212819, 213455, 76], [213455, 214539, 77], [214539, 218597, 78], [218597, 220848, 79], [220848, 221047, 80], [221047, 224519, 81], [224519, 227794, 82], [227794, 230695, 83], [230695, 234906, 84], [234906, 236669, 85], [236669, 240942, 86], [240942, 244203, 87], [244203, 248666, 88], [248666, 249924, 89], [249924, 252230, 90], [252230, 253820, 91], [253820, 256847, 92], [256847, 260174, 93], [260174, 262659, 94], [262659, 264038, 95], [264038, 265859, 96], [265859, 269210, 97], [269210, 269770, 98], [269770, 270856, 99], [270856, 271398, 100], [271398, 279422, 101], [279422, 280712, 102], [280712, 280911, 103], [280911, 284031, 104], [284031, 286735, 105], [286735, 290216, 106], [290216, 293746, 107], [293746, 297968, 108], [297968, 299396, 109], [299396, 303287, 110], [303287, 306698, 111], [306698, 309785, 112], [309785, 313443, 113], [313443, 317856, 114], [317856, 320859, 115], [320859, 324660, 116], [324660, 329110, 117], [329110, 332399, 118], [332399, 335193, 119], [335193, 337044, 120], [337044, 340441, 121], [340441, 343513, 122], [343513, 346255, 123], [346255, 349630, 124], [349630, 353758, 125], [353758, 356324, 126], [356324, 358794, 127], [358794, 362282, 128], [362282, 367019, 129], [367019, 370427, 130], [370427, 373878, 131], [373878, 377864, 132], [377864, 382835, 133], [382835, 386410, 134], [386410, 390753, 135], [390753, 393473, 136], [393473, 395051, 137], [395051, 395390, 138], [395390, 398591, 139], [398591, 401149, 140], [401149, 404648, 141], [404648, 407554, 142], [407554, 410722, 143], [410722, 414288, 144], [414288, 418077, 145], [418077, 421616, 146], [421616, 425152, 147], [425152, 428209, 148], [428209, 431884, 149], [431884, 436287, 150], [436287, 439860, 151], [439860, 443983, 152], [443983, 447203, 153], [447203, 450815, 154], [450815, 453660, 155], [453660, 457883, 156], [457883, 463254, 157], [463254, 469353, 158], [469353, 476163, 159], [476163, 479679, 160], [479679, 482773, 161], [482773, 486732, 162], [486732, 491272, 163], [491272, 493466, 164], [493466, 497494, 165], [497494, 503205, 166], [503205, 505408, 167], [505408, 508194, 168], [508194, 509652, 169], [509652, 512829, 170], [512829, 513859, 171], [513859, 517328, 172], [517328, 520616, 173], [520616, 524643, 174], [524643, 526743, 175], [526743, 528511, 176], [528511, 531634, 177], [531634, 534155, 178], [534155, 536164, 179], [536164, 537332, 180], [537332, 540454, 181], [540454, 542751, 182], [542751, 545047, 183]]}}
