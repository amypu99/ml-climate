Unless otherwise noted, our sustainability data reflects progress made during the calendar year (ending December 31), whereas our financial reporting corresponds with our fiscal year, which ends on the last Saturday of December.\n\nAs a general matter, recent organizational changes (e.g., acquisitions and divestitures) are reflected in our reporting as soon as practical. When the impact of organizational changes is deemed significant on previously-reported metrics measured against a baseline, those metrics are recast to consistently reflect the impact of such organizational changes.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, goals and progress reflect the impact of our acquisitions of Hangzhou Haomusi Food Co., Ltd. (Be & Cheery), BFY Brands, Inc. (BFY), Pioneer Food Group Ltd. (Pioneer Foods), and SodaStream International Ltd. (SodaStream) and our divestiture of Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands (Tropicana).\n\nTargets apply to PepsiCo\u2019s operations as well as our value chain (e.g., franchise bottlers, joint ventures where PepsiCo has operational control, co-manufacturers, etc.) unless otherwise noted.\nWhen we launched pep+ in 2021, we knew we needed to do two things extremely well.\n\nFirst, we had to execute an end-to-end transformation of our business, with a focus on building a more sustainable future for people, the planet and our business. This meant rethinking the way we grow our ingredients, how we make, move and sell our iconic portfolio of products, and what choices to offer consumers.\n\nSecond, we had to perform whilst we transform. This meant having to grow and deliver value, even as we also reduce our use of natural resources.\n\nA year and a half into this journey, we have put pep+ at the center of virtually everything we do. This focus has driven us to prioritize decisions around regenerative agriculture, reduce added sugars, increase recycled content in our packaging, create circular water systems, advance Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) and invest in our communities.\n\nI am pleased to report that in 2022 we delivered our best business performance in a decade, whilst continuing to transform the company:\n\n- We more than doubled our regenerative agriculture footprint;\n- We are close to meeting our 2025 operational water-use efficiency goal in high water-risk areas;\n- We met our goal to increase Hispanic representation in U.S. managerial positions three years early; and\n- We continued to reduce added sugars and sodium in our products.\n\nThanks go to the hard work of PepsiCo associates around the world who have embraced pep+ and integrated it into their daily work. They are making pep+ part of how we do business. As a result, we learn more every day how to accelerate progress and find innovative solutions to the challenges we, and the planet, face. This makes me both proud and confident that we can all win with pep+.\n\nThese results show that transformation and success can go hand in hand. However, we are also clear-eyed about the challenges: Changing a company of our size and complexity with some 315,000 employees and operations in more than 200 countries and territories, is not an easy or a quick process. Our progress will not always be linear or as fast as many would like, including me.\n\nNo doubt, there are places where there is more work to do \u2013 especially when it comes to reducing the amount of virgin plastic in packaging and the emissions in our value chain.\n\nSuccess in both these critical areas is, in part, dependent upon the structure and efficacy of the systems within which we operate. This is why we are working with many others to advocate for regulatory reform and to drive big picture changes in the global food system.\n\nWe will continue to invest behind public-private partnerships, to bring all our partners and suppliers along on the journey and to work with other industry players, governments, NGOs, start-ups and consumer organizations to identify solutions.\n\nSo, while change on the scale at which we operate will always be challenging, I remain confident in our ability to both transform and perform and to move us ever closer to our longer-term goals.\n\nAs ever, I welcome your comments, suggestions and questions on any of the topics and results detailed in this year\u2019s report.\n\nRamon Laguarta\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer\nTransforming the global food system, including the infrastructure and systems that enable it, is critical for PepsiCo \u2013 and all of us \u2013 to achieve our ambitious goals. We\u2019re proud of the progress we have made and, at the same time, know that there are areas where we have work to do. We\u2019re committed to playing a leadership role and know that with investment, innovative thinking and expanded collaboration we will be able to drive a lasting and meaningful impact for our business, the planet and the people who live on it.\n\nJim Andrew\nChief Sustainability Officer\n\nThe strategic investments we\u2019re making in pep+ will fuel our business to thrive in the long term and will help us build resilience across our global supply chain, while driving positive action for the planet and people.\n\nHugh Johnston\nVice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer\nThis ESG Summary features information on our strategy, goals and progress of pep+ and its three pillars\n\nPositive Agriculture\nPositive Agriculture is our aspiration to source crops and ingredients in a way that restores the earth, makes the soil healthier, sequesters carbon, and eliminates deforestation while also strengthening farming communities.\n\nLearn more \u2192\n\nPositive Value Chain\nPositive Value Chain is our focus on making products that build a circular and inclusive economy, including goals for reaching net-zero emissions, becoming net water positive, introducing more sustainable packaging, continuing our Racial Equality Journey, among others.\n\nLearn more \u2192\n\nPositive Choices\nPositive Choices is about using our brands to inspire people to make better choices for themselves and the planet.\n\nLearn more \u2192\nAbout PepsiCo\n\nPepsiCo products are enjoyed by consumers more than one billion times a day in more than 200 countries and territories around the world. PepsiCo generated more than $86 billion in net revenue in 2022, driven by a complementary beverage and convenient foods portfolio that includes Lay\u2019s, Doritos, Cheetos, Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola, Mountain Dew, Quaker, and SodaStream. PepsiCo\u2019s product portfolio includes a wide range of enjoyable foods and beverages, including many iconic brands that generate more than $1 billion each in estimated annual retail sales.\npep+ Pepsico Positive\n\nGuiding PepsiCo is our vision to Be the Global Leader in Beverages and Convenient Foods by Winning with pep+ (PepsiCo Positive). pep+ is our roadmap for how we operate within planetary boundaries and promote positive change for the planet and people.\n\nOur business is intrinsically tied to the health of the planet and the resilience of our food system so investing in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) is essential and will help our business thrive in the long term. As we aim to advance our mission to create more smiles with every sip and every bite for our consumers, customers, associates and communities, planet and shareholders, we believe that operating in a more sustainable way will help build a resilient supply chain and food system.\n\nNot only does pep+ drive sustainable long-term value and competitive advantage for PepsiCo, it also seeks to fundamentally transform business as usual for our industry by inspiring and working alongside our peers to advance positive social, environmental and economic change for all.\n\nWe are very clear that pep+ is the future of our company, and we are focused on three interconnected pillars:\n\nPositive Agriculture\nWe are working to source our crops and ingredients in ways that restore the earth and strengthen farming communities.\nLearn more \u2794\n\nPositive Value Chain\nWe are helping to build a circular and inclusive value chain.\nLearn more \u2794\n\nPositive Choices\nWe are inspiring people through our brands to make choices that create more smiles for them and the planet.\nLearn more \u2794\nOur value chain\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s complex value chain begins with the sourcing of more than 30 agricultural crops and ingredients from our farmers and suppliers around the world. These crops and ingredients are made into beloved PepsiCo products at more than 1,000 manufacturing facilities, including 291 company-owned facilities. Products are packaged and moved across approximately 1.3 billion miles worldwide by our company-owned fleet \u2014 and even more than that through third-party transportation providers \u2014 to be sold and enjoyed by our consumers more than one billion times a day. Once the product has been enjoyed, the packaging is generally either collected as waste or recycled for another use.\n\nWe aim to make each stage of our complex value chain more circular and inclusive to help address global challenges such as environmental degradation, social inequality and lack of access to nutritious food. We are taking bold action designed to reduce our climate-related impacts, replenish watersheds and minimize water use, innovate more sustainable packaging and recapture packaging materials and help improve people\u2019s lives throughout our value chain.\n\n1. Agricultural Sourcing\n   PepsiCo sources crops and ingredients from approximately 60 countries. The standards we apply and promote can help improve the environmental, social and economic health of agricultural communities around the world.\n\n2. Consumption\n   PepsiCo products are enjoyed by consumers more than one billion times a day. We are responding to changing consumer preferences by refreshing our product portfolio and reformulating many of our beverages and convenient foods to reduce added sugars, sodium and saturated fat.\n\n3. Distribution\n   PepsiCo products are sold in over 200 countries and territories. In 2022, our company-owned fleet traveled approximately 1.3 billion miles worldwide \u2014 and even more than that through third party transportation providers \u2014 to bring PepsiCo products to customers. We are working to reduce the environmental impact of our fleet by adopting more efficient vehicles and practices.\n\n4. R&D and Manufacturing\n   We spent more than $770 million on R&D in 2022 as part of our continued investment in developing quality and innovative beverages and convenient foods. Our 291 company-owned manufacturing facilities bring together innovators and operations teams who strive to use water, energy and product ingredients more efficiently. In 2022, we produced more than 90 million metric tons of beverages and convenient foods.\n\n5. Post-Consumer\n   PepsiCo\u2019s sustainable packaging vision is to help build a world where packaging never becomes waste by driving the shift to a more circular economy. We continue to expand our portfolio of reuse offerings, innovate sustainable packaging and work to improve recycling infrastructure.\nOur ESG approach\n\nGovernance\n\nAt PepsiCo, we believe that strong governance is essential to delivering on our pep+ agenda. Our ESG approach is fully integrated into our business, not a separate activity.\n\nTo govern our operations and shape our strategy, we have created an integrated structure that combines Board and senior leadership oversight with subject-matter and localized expertise.\n\nThe full Board considers ESG issues to be an integral part of its business strategy oversight. To this end, our Sustainability, Diversity and Public Policy Committee assists the Board in providing more focused oversight of key sustainability, diversity, equity and inclusion and public policy matters. This Committee is comprised entirely of independent directors and reflects a mix of public policy, risk, international and science-related skills, qualifications and experience.\n\nAt the Executive Committee level, a Sustainability Committee composed of members of our senior leadership management team regularly reviews our strategy and progress toward our pep+ goals, presenting its findings to the full Executive Committee. This provides opportunities for our senior leadership to align on major strategic issues relating to ESG.\n\nLearn more about PepsiCo\u2019s pep+ Sustainability Governance on our ESG Topics A-Z \u2192\n\nOur reporting strategy\n\nPepsiCo uses ESG reporting as the primary method for informing key stakeholders about our goals and progress. Our stakeholders include investors, potential and current employees, customers and consumers, suppliers, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), regulators and others.\n\nRecognizing that stakeholder needs and interests vary, we offer a suite of reporting elements, tailored to different stakeholder groups. Our reporting approach combines disclosure of strategy, policy and data, as well as stories from around the world that show pep+ in action.\n\nOur reporting suite consists of the following:\n\n\u2022 This ESG Summary: A higher level overview of our pep+ agenda and annual progress.

We rely on a secure supply of more than 30 agricultural crops and ingredients \u2013 such as potatoes, corn and oats \u2013 from approximately 60 countries to make iconic products that bring smiles to consumers around the world.\n\nThrough pep+ and our Positive Agriculture agenda, we are committed to helping farmers grow food in a way that revitalizes the earth and supports their livelihoods. And, by prioritizing a sustainable food system, we are helping to mitigate environmental and social risks, while also preserving natural resources for future generations.\nPositive Agriculture\n\nOur footprint\n\nAs a global leader in beverages and convenient foods, PepsiCo has an opportunity to use our scale, influence and expertise to help build a more sustainable food system \u2014 one that positively impacts natural resources and the people and communities we work with and serve. With products that are enjoyed more than one billion times a day in more than 200 countries and territories around the world, promoting regenerative farming practices and the beneficial outcomes they can drive across our global agricultural footprint can have a big impact:\n\n1. For grower-sourced crops, sustainable sourcing refers to meeting the independently verified environmental, social and economic principles of PepsiCo\u2019s Sustainable Farming Program (SFP).\n\n2. Regenerative acres reported for 2022 include U.S., Mexico, Canada and 17 European countries only. PepsiCo considers an acre as delivering regenerative impact when the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices results in quantified improvements in at least two of the environmental impact areas, with a preference for GHG to be one impact area. Note that all five are included as potential impact areas to be quantified, including livelihoods improvement. Metric counts the cumulative number of regenerative acres since 2021.\n\nAcross the globe, farmers continue to bear the brunt of climate-related risks associated with agriculture and acutely experience the impacts of biodiversity loss, freshwater scarcity and soil degradation on crop yield and resiliency. Many of these farmers\u2019 families have worked tirelessly to maintain their businesses for multiple generations, and these impacts pose a threat to their livelihoods.\n\nWe continue to prioritize working collectively with our farmers to advance the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices \u2014 a set of techniques designed to improve and restore ecosystems across impact areas to make soil healthier, capture carbon, improve watershed health, protect and enhance biodiversity and strengthen farmer livelihoods by optimizing their long-term yields and farm income. By supporting farmers in this way, PepsiCo aims to help secure its supply, and importantly, help farmers counter climate change today and prepare for agricultural challenges of the future.\n\nDepending on local conditions, regenerative techniques may help farmers to grow more food on the same amount of land with fewer inputs like water, fertilizer and pesticides. We are partnering to help protect farmers against the challenges of climate change, water depletion and soil erosion, while also helping farmers achieve greater profitability.\nWhat is regenerative agriculture?\n\nOur 89 demonstration farms explore potential benefits of regenerative farming techniques.\n\nImpact Areas\n\n1. Build soil health and fertility\n   - Rebuild organic matter\n   - Maintain living roots as much as possible\n   - Use inputs efficiently\n   - Plant diverse rotational crops in same field\n\n2. Reduce and sequester CO\u2082\n   - Plant cover crops to sequester CO\u2082\n   - Promote reduced and no-till cultivation for minimal soil disturbance\n   - Incorporate livestock\n\n3. Improve watershed health\n   - Help farmers access more efficient irrigation equipment\n   - Support best practices for scheduling and maintenance\n   - Transition from flood irrigation to more efficient methods (e.g., drip irrigation and \"fertigation\")\n   - Prevent loss of nutrients and other agrochemicals\n\n4.

Feed more people with fewer inputs\n\n---\n\n1 Refer to PepsiCo\u2019s Regenerative Agriculture Practice Bank for a comprehensive listing of practices linked to the five impact areas.\nPositive Agriculture\n\nApproach to regenerative agriculture\n\nThe core goal of regenerative agriculture is to improve the resilience of the agricultural system as the world and the climate changes. Regenerative farming is not a new concept by any means, and regenerative farming practices are being implemented by farmers all over the world, from large-scale commercial farming systems to smallholder farms. However, farming is hyper-local, with each farm having unique needs and challenges. Much like the ecosystems they are intended to revitalize, successful regenerative practices are highly interdependent, requiring a localized yet holistic approach that takes the entire farming system into consideration and balances newer regenerative practices with current farming practices that have been adapted for the local context.\n\nSo, our approach to Positive Agriculture is outcome-oriented rather than prescriptive. We support a wide range of regenerative practices including planting cover crops to protect the soil, reducing tillage to maintain soil health and fertility, and encouraging livestock and other diversity onto farms. These practices, and others, help maintain and add nutrients, improve fertility, maintain soil carbon, control pests and weeds through sustainable management, improve biodiversity, maintain water quality and protect watersheds.\n\nIn collaboration with industry peers and cross-sector partners, PepsiCo launched a Regenerative Agriculture Practice Bank in May 2022 as a resource to help farmers deliver regenerative impacts such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions. We estimate our efforts will reduce and remove at least 10 million tons of GHG emissions by the end of the decade. In 2022, we provided support to more than 3,300 farmers and helped them make measurable improvements on their carbon footprints, biodiversity, soil health and watershed health on over 900,000 acres. This led to the removal of more than 330,000 metric tons of carbon through soil carbon sequestration.\n\nPepsiCo also seeks continuous improvement in agricultural practices that minimize the use of pesticides and other agrochemicals. We engage with external stakeholder groups and industry peers to share and develop best practices in responsible pesticide use and established an internal Global Pesticide Council of cross-functional senior leaders to advise on our policies and programs.\n\nFor regenerative agriculture to take root, farmers need economic, social and cultural, and agronomic support. To improve our ability to provide this support, we invest in innovative programs and nurture close partnerships with our farmers, intermediary suppliers and NGOs along our value chain.\n\nIn 2022, with new and ongoing strategic partners \u2013 some of which were the recipient of the 2022 United States Department of Agriculture\u2019s Climate-Smart Commodities grants \u2013 we helped to fund and support independent advisors for farmers, facilitate coaching and peer support, and financially incentivize adoption of on-farm conservation and climate-smart practices, including:\n\n- **Soil and Water Outcomes Fund (SWOF).** SWOF was awarded funding through the USDA\u2019s Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities Initiative, along with approximately $60 million in support from PepsiCo and other industry peers, to launch the Midwest Climate-Smart Commodity Program. The program will help participating farmers transition to climate-smart practices on nearly one million acres by 2030, with the potential to reduce and capture up to more than three million tons of GHG emissions.\n\n- **Illinois Corn Growers Association (ICGA).** PepsiCo supports the ICGA\u2019s Precision Conservation Management Innovation Project to help address farmers\u2019 environmental concerns such as water quality, soil health and GHG emissions by offering agronomic and financial support, as well as economic analysis, to enable sound business decisions related to conservation practices. The project is helping spread regenerative practices across approximately 600,000 acres by 2030.\n\n- **Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI).** PepsiCo established a long-term, strategic partnership with PFI to help drive regenerative agriculture practices across approximately 1.5 million acres of U.S. farmland by 2030. As part of this work, PepsiCo is making an upfront investment in people and operating systems, aiming to increase farmer resilience, establish sustainable sourcing and achieve GHG emissions reductions across multiple commodities.\n\n- **Archer Daniels Midland (ADM).** PepsiCo established a multi-year shared value partnership with ADM that aims to reduce carbon intensity by expanding regenerative practices on up to two million acres across our shared supply chains. The project will support farmers across the Midwest U.S. in building resilience to climate change and has the potential to eliminate over 1.4 million metric tons of GHG emissions.\n\n1 PepsiCo considers an acre as delivering regenerative impact when the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices results in quantified improvements across at least two of the environmental outcome areas, with a strong preference for removing or reducing GHG emissions to be one impact area. Note that all five are included as potential impact areas to be quantified, including livelihoods improvement.\nGoals & progress\n\nIn 2022, we increased our regenerative farming footprint from more than 345,000 to more than 900,000 acres globally through a number of actions \u2014 including, for example, establishing groundbreaking partnerships; adopting new technologies and working collaboratively with trusted farmer-facing organizations. We improved our agricultural water-use efficiency by 14% (compared to a 2015 baseline) when last measured in 2020 in high water-risk watersheds by supporting farmers through partnerships, relevant training and programs such as our demonstration farms. In 2022, we sustainably sourced approximately 55% of our key ingredients and positively impacted the livelihoods of more than 11,000 people in our agricultural supply chain and communities by supporting economic prosperity, agency and a sense of security for farmers, farm workers and their households.\n\n1 PepsiCo considers an acre as delivering regenerative impact when the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices results in quantified improvements across at least two of the environmental outcome areas, with a strong preference for removing or reducing GHG emissions to be one impact area. Note that all five are included as potential impact areas to be quantified, including livelihoods improvement. Metric counts the cumulative number of regenerative acres since 2021.\n\n2 Data for 2021 and 2022 not available, as we measure this at least once every three years.\n\n3 For grower-sourced crops, sustainable sourcing refers to meeting the independently verified environmental, social and economic principles of PepsiCo\u2019s Sustainable Farming Program (SFP). For supplier-sourced crops, sustainable sourcing is achieved through a third-party standard that has been benchmarked as equivalent to the SFP or, in limited regions, a continuous improvement program addressing the main environmental and social risks with growing the relevant crop. Percentage of volume sustainably sourced and verified by third parties, including volume of Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) \u2014 certified palm oil and volume of Bonsucro-certified (or equivalent) cane sugar.\n\n4 Regenerative acres reported for 2021 include U.S. and Canada only.\n\n5 Regenerative acres reported for 2022 include U.S., Mexico, Canada and 17 European countries only.\nCommitment to local grassroots work\n\nComplementing the large-scale partnerships with well-established organizations, we understand the importance of funding innovation and supporting start-up organizations with the potential to scale.\n\nIn October 2022, we announced the continuation of the Positive Agriculture Outcomes (PAO) Fund, our global agricultural accelerator. The PAO Fund initially launched in 2021 with the intention of accelerating progress toward our 2030 pep+ Positive Agriculture goals and activating the regenerative agriculture strategy across the business. Currently, the PAO Fund acts as a funding mechanism, offering co-investment to drive diverse and sector-led innovative projects around the world. By providing both financial and technical support to transformative initiatives, the PAO Fund incentivizes and ensures committed action is taken across the whole business, innovation is spurred, and capabilities and capacity are built.\n\nAs of December 2022, we had disbursed $1.8 million and invested in over 20 individual projects across a range of sectors and supply chains, supporting initiatives that test new solutions, help farmers \u201cfuture-proof\u201d our supply chains and build sustainable landscapes. Projects have been funded across 16 countries, touching every sourcing region and including 13 ingredients.\n\nTo illustrate the impact of the PAO Fund\u2019s investments on farmer livelihoods, PepsiCo developed a video series, \u201cGrowing Our Future,\u201d showcasing four funded projects.\n\n**Brazil**\nSupported research in Brazil to help potato farmers improve soil health and preserve it for future generations through research on the benefits of cover crops.\n\n**Greece**\nCollaborated with N-Drip to support a potato farmer in Greece in demonstrating more efficient irrigation systems to adapt to increased drought.\n\n**India**\nPartnered with farmers to improve air quality while enriching farmland with biochar by developing kilns that can turn their agricultural waste into fertilizer.\n\n**Thailand**\nJoined with German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ) to help Thai potato farmers adapt to climate change through sustainable farming training programs, soil improvement plans and pest and disease education across the entire crop rotation.\n\nLink to video.\nWe also continued to grow our network of demonstration farms around the world by leveraging the expertise and local influence of farmers. Our demonstration farm program highlights locally-relevant best practices in regenerative agriculture areas such as nutrients, water-use efficiency and precision farming. The network provides local farmers the opportunity to observe and learn from their peers, helping to scale proven practices and innovative agriculture technologies that further regenerative results.\n\nIn 2022, our partnerships yielded value for farmers, the environment and the business (percent increases observed in a control plot vs. a demonstration plot):\n\n- On demonstration farms in India, farmers saw average yield improvements of 3% and reduced GHG emissions by more than 20%.\n- In Thailand, we helped farmers implement pest and nutrient management systems and install drip irrigation. At the end of 2022, farmers saw an 18% yield increase and up to 36% reduction in water use in irrigation.\n- In Mexico, we demonstrated ways to save water through various irrigation techniques and improvements in existing irrigation systems. Farmers saw reduced water use in irrigation more than 35% on average (vs. conventional systems), while increasing potato yields by more than two tons per hectare.\n\nAt the end of 2022, PepsiCo worked with 89 regenerative demonstration farms to demonstrate new technologies and regenerative practices.\n\n### Supporting nature positive outcomes\n\nRegenerative food systems rely on thriving natural ecosystems in the landscapes where agricultural production occurs. A thriving natural ecosystem can help to regulate weather patterns, such as rainfall, and mitigate the impact of less predictable weather, allowing for ongoing access to a sustainable supply of water and soil, supporting pollinators and controlling pests, supporting sustainable livelihoods and communities, and impacting global climate.\n\nA focus on nature positive outcomes is linked to our broader pep+ ambitions. PepsiCo recognizes both the role that resilient natural ecosystems play in supporting natural ecosystems, including deforestation and ecosystem conversion, natural resource extraction and pollution. Across our supply chains, we have identified opportunities to mitigate those risks and to support the conservation and restoration of nature. Examples of our recent efforts include:\n\n- Promoting and measuring the impact of biodiversity on farms: in 2022, over 700,000 of our more than 900,000 regenerative agriculture acres saw measurable positive impact in biodiversity.\n- Engaging with suppliers and the industry (particularly for palm oil) to aim for zero deforestation, no peat loss or conversion in our supply chains.\n- Serving as a Founding Partner of the Rimba Collective, an innovative sustainable finance mechanism to support forest conservation and restoration in palm oil sourcing regions.\n- Working with retailers, manufacturers and suppliers to support the transformation of our sourcing regions toward zero deforestation and supporting conservation, restoration and sustainable livelihoods with the Consumer Goods Forum\u2019s Forest Positive Coalition and the Palm Oil Collaboration Group.\n- Supporting landscape initiatives around the world, including those in Mexico and Indonesia, that work to holistically address sustainable production and natural ecosystem protection and restoration.\n\nWhile we have been working on our nature positive approach for many years, the interplay between nature and our business is complex. We recognize that, like all businesses, we aspire to develop a more detailed understanding of our nature-related impacts, risks and opportunities. Work is underway to further build these capabilities, including investing in on-the-ground impact programs, new tools and technology, and fostering partnerships with our supply chain, industry peers and conservation experts.\nApproach to irrigation efficiency\n\nWater is critical to our business and to the farmers we source from, as they rely on clean, safe and sustainable water supplies to irrigate their crops. This shared interest in water conservation is what drives PepsiCo\u2019s approach to water-use efficiency \u2014 defined as the volume of irrigation water required to grow one ton of raw crop material \u2014 and achieving our healthy watershed goal improvement target of 15% by 2025.\n\nWe continually seek more sustainable ways to use this precious resource to ensure we are efficiently accessing the water we need to make our products while preserving water access for the communities in which we operate. At the end of 2022, we sourced approximately 45% of our grower-sourced key ingredients from areas of high water-risk.\n\nAs we work to improve the water-use efficiency in areas where we directly source our crops, we identify the specific needs of at-risk locations and create action plans that support farmers with the relevant training, equipment and resources they need to meet water goals. Our demonstration farms give farmers the opportunity to learn local water-use efficiency and water quality improvement best practices in a hands-on, peer-to-peer setting.\n\nPepsiCo also supports farmers in transitioning to more water-efficient irrigation equipment such as drip irrigation. In March 2022, PepsiCo announced a partnership with N-Drip to help farmers in our supply chain adopt their game-changing high efficiency irrigation technology across 25,000 acres by 2025. N-Drip\u2019s gravity-powered technology combines the water-saving benefits of high-pressure drip irrigation with lower energy, operating and maintenance demands.\n\nBy helping farmers transition from the commonly used flood or trench irrigation \u2014 known to lose up to 70% of water to runoff or evaporation \u2014 our N-Drip partnership aims to improve farmer livelihoods through water savings of up to 50% while, through a more efficient fertilizer application via the water, potentially reducing carbon and methane emissions by approximately 80% (per season, compared to flood or trench irrigation).\n\nN-Drip technology has been used by farmers in India, South Africa, Vietnam, Greece and the U.S., many of whom have reported higher crop yields, less need for use of fertilizers and a significant reduction in water use compared to flood or trench irrigation.\n\nIrrigation efficiency goal in areas of high water-risk\n\nAdvocate for and contribute to a measurable improvement in water-use efficiency of farmers in high water-risk watersheds where we directly source our crops, including an improvement in water-use efficiency of 15% by 2025.\n\n25,000 acres will benefit from our N-Drip partnership by 2025\n\nIn 2022 we initiated in-depth water basin studies in several high water-risk regions\n\n---\n\n1 15% improvement goal measured versus a 2015 baseline.\n2 Data for this time period not available, as we do not measure this metric every year. Assessments are conducted at least once every three years. Next assessment to be conducted in 2023. Last measured in 2020.\nApproach to sustainable sourcing\n\nWe depend on a sustainable supply of agricultural raw materials to meet the demands of our business and expectations of our stakeholders. We aim to instill integrity, fairness and stewardship throughout our agricultural supply chain and hold our suppliers accountable to the same standards. Our agricultural suppliers are expected to adhere to our Supplier Code of Conduct and other relevant sustainable sourcing policies such as our Land Policy and Global Human Rights Policy, as a condition of doing business with us.\n\nOur Stewardship of Forests and Natural Ecosystems Policy outlines our aspiration for deforestation- and conversion-free business operations and supply chain. We are implementing this policy in our agricultural value chains where we face forest and natural ecosystem conversion risk, for example, in our palm oil supply chains where we implement a No Deforestation, No Peat, and No Exploitation (NDPE) commitment as outlined in our Global Policy on Sustainable Palm Oil.\n\nOur sustainable sourcing approach aims to improve the livelihoods of farmers in our supply chain while ensuring a steady supply of key ingredients for production. Forty-three percent of our key ingredients (by volume) are \u201cgrower-sourced\u201d \u2013 purchased directly from farmers through a grower group, while the remaining approximately 57% are \u201csupplier-sourced\u201d with multiple tiers between the farmer and PepsiCo.\n\nSupplier-sourced key ingredients include milk and those derived from crops such as corn, wheat, beet sugar, banana, cocoa, sunflower, soy and canola. We actively collaborate with suppliers, industry groups and NGOs using two approaches to achieve our sustainable sourcing goal:\n\n- **High-risk approach (verified volumes):** Requires high-risk commodities (palm, cane and soy) and commodities grown in high-risk markets to be verified/certified to a sustainability standard recognized by PepsiCo.\n- **Low- and medium-risk approach (continuous improvement):** Consists of working with suppliers to adopt a continuous improvement model, requiring them to demonstrate active work and progress toward outcomes that address the key risks for the farmers in the sourcing region by 2030.1\n\nOur SFP is a farm-level engagement with growers to build capability, address relevant risks and encourage continuous improvement through fundamental agricultural practices that span the broad aspects of sustainability including positive social, environmental and economic outcomes for growers. SFP focuses on self-assessment, capacity building and verification of farm-level sustainable agriculture practices and principles as described in the SFP Scheme Rules and SFP Fundamental Principles.\n\nWe support our supply chain farmers in their transition to more sustainable approaches, leading to economic benefits, improved food security and climate resilience. For example, Agrovita, a three-year program in partnership with the non-profit Proforest, empowers women and other smallholder farmers in Southeast Mexico to grow their crops in a more sustainable way. PepsiCo purchases crops from participating farmers, who are supported with technical training, financial literacy courses and legal advice related to their right to own land. Agrovita\u2019s aim is to drive regenerative practices on more than 29,000 acres and to support more than 37,000 farmers, at least half of whom are women.\n\nAs one of the world\u2019s largest buyers of palm oil in the consumer products industry, we remain committed to contributing to a sustainable palm oil industry. In 2022, our purchase represented less than 1% of the global supply. In November 2022, PepsiCo and Unilever supported the first independent smallholder group in Aceh Province, Indonesia \u2013 one of the world\u2019s last remaining tropical rainforest areas that is also highly susceptible to illegal logging and clearance for agriculture \u2013 in successfully obtaining RSPO and Indonesia Sustainable Palm Oil certification through The Sustainable Trade Initiative (IDH) Verified Sourcing Area landscape-based program. Throughout 2022, we continued to be an active partner in landscape programs such as those in Mexico and Indonesia that are seeking to demonstrate scaled solutions and impacts on palm oil sustainability.\n\n### Sustainable sourcing goal\n\n| 2020-2022 Goal | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|----------------|------|------|------|\n| ~55% of our key ingredients were sustainably sourced in 2022 | 50% | 55% | 55% |\n| 29,000+ acres to benefit from our Agrovita program in Mexico | | | |\n\n1 Key ingredients include potatoes, whole corn, oats, grains, vegetable oils, cane sugar, beet sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, orange juice, banana, raw milk, cocoa/chocolate and dairy seasoning.\n\n2 PepsiCo is only applying the continuous improvement methodology for sustainable sourcing in our row crop programs in the Midwest U.S. where, through our regenerative agriculture programs, we are addressing key risks such as soil loss/degradation and nutrient loss.\n\n3 For grower-sourced crops, sustainable sourcing refers to meeting the independently verified environmental, social and economic principles of PepsiCo\u2019s Sustainable Farming Program (SFP). For supplier-sourced crops, sustainable sourcing is achieved through a third-party standard that has been benchmarked as equivalent to the SFP or, in limited regions, a continuous improvement program addressing the main environmental and social risks with growing the relevant crop. Percentage of volume sustainably sourced and verified by third parties, including volume of Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) \u2013 certified palm oil and volume of Bonsucro-certified (or equivalent) cane sugar.\nApproach to improving livelihoods\n\nAround the world, farmer livelihoods and the food systems on which they depend are threatened by intractable challenges including topsoil depletion, increasing temperatures, more frequent droughts and decreasing biodiversity.\n\nAmong the most vulnerable to these impacts are smallholder farmers, farm workers, temporary or migrant workers, and women producers in rural agricultural communities. To help address these challenges, PepsiCo aims to use its scale and influence to source crops in ways that help strengthen farming communities and farmer livelihoods. By helping build healthier, more sustainable and inclusive food systems, we are not only supporting farmers directly, but also securing our supply of the ingredients that our business depends upon.\n\nOur approach focuses on supporting economic prosperity, agency and a sense of security for farmers, farm workers and their households. We rely on strategic partnerships across geographies, sectors, industries and supply chains to leverage technical and financial resources that support farmers in transitioning to more inclusive and regenerative practices.\n\nPepsiCo launched the Livelihoods Implementation Framework for Engagement (LIFE) in September 2022 to establish a roadmap and define metrics to calculate progress with a focus on improvement in three areas:\n\n- **Economic prosperity:** Supporting long-term farm profitability and productivity with an emphasis on regenerative agriculture and environmentally sustainable farming practices.\n- **Farmer and farm worker security:** Addressing issues of food security, labor conditions and land rights and enabling access to resources.\n- **Women\u2019s economic empowerment:** Improving women\u2019s access, time, agency and use of resources, and decreasing legal and institutional barriers.\n\nThe framework establishes a set of common Livelihood Outcome Indicators aligned with international norms including the United Nations\u2019 (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), International Labor Organization (ILO), UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n\nAt the time of publishing, according to the FAO, women represent 43% of global agricultural workers, yet tend to earn less than their male counterparts and have less access to key resources including training, land ownership, agricultural advisory services, technology and finance. If the equity gap for women were closed, research by the FAO suggests women-run farms would increase their yields significantly. Our work to bolster gender inclusivity in our agricultural supply chains has the potential to deliver social outcomes for women, including livelihood improvements at the household and community level, greater access to resources and capability building opportunities, as well as business benefits, including resilient supply from a diversified supplier base.\n\n\u201cWe [women] are more involved. Before you wouldn\u2019t see that, only the man, the husband, would go to the fields. Now we are getting involved in the agro field and I think it is a great opportunity for us. Women can even look at it as a source of income and a way to help the household\u2019s income.\u201d\n\nYasmin Hern\u00e1ndez\nFarmer, Mexico\nPepsiCo and the PepsiCo Foundation continue to build resilient supply chains by supporting diversity and inclusion in farm management. We are often working with the most vulnerable \u2014 those that may not have traditionally had access to markets and supply chains, including women, smallholder farmers, Indigenous Communities and People of Color \u2014 through strategic partnerships with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), Cooperative for American Relief Everywhere (CARE), National Future Farmers of America Organization, GIZ and the National Black Growers Council.\n\n- In 2020, PepsiCo and USAID established the Global Development Alliance (GDA), a shared value partnership focused on building an evidence-based business case for empowering women in agriculture supply chains, demonstrating that gender transformative procurement can drive commercial benefits. Co-invested by PepsiCo and USAID, the Investing in Women to Strengthen Supply Chains Program is a $20 million global partnership to make the business case for women\u2019s economic empowerment.\n\n- The GDA \u2014 which has begun implementation in five countries, including India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Colombia and Peru \u2014 collaborates with local PepsiCo agriculture teams to design and deliver programs that work with both existing and new PepsiCo suppliers to make the business case for women\u2019s economic empowerment.\n\n- The GDA \u2013 which has begun implementation in five countries, including India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Colombia and Peru \u2013 collaborates with local PepsiCo agriculture teams to design and deliver programs that work with both existing and new PepsiCo suppliers to build their capacity and knowledge around the inclusion of women. Through pilot partnerships that implement Gender Smart Leadership Lab and Gender Smart Farm programs, both farm management and women workers are exposed to inclusive agronomy advice, receive training on new techniques and are given access to new regenerative agriculture technologies. Participating farms serve as learning hubs that provide data and insights on the economic impact of empowering women on farms and will help scale investments within PepsiCo and other global companies.\n\n- Building upon the lessons learned from PepsiCo and USAID\u2019s co-funded four-year Integrated Land and Resource Governance (ILRG) program in West Bengal, India (our longest running women\u2019s economic empowerment program), ILRG has helped over 1,100 female potato producers gain agricultural training, 97% of whom have applied agronomy and sustainable farming knowledge and skills. Results from 2022 also showed that 55% of participants reported their family experienced an increase in income from potato farming, and 95% of women reported they improved their confidence as farmers over the season.\n\n- Through the Next Generation Agriculture Fund, a three-year, $2 million partnership with IDB, PepsiCo is researching and taking action to enhance the role of women as strategic partners in our potato supply chain. By testing and demonstrating the impact of gender-smart solutions, the fund is helping to identify gender-related issues and challenges in our supply chains in the Dominican Republic, Ecuador and Guatemala.\n\nLearn more about PepsiCo\u2019s key agricultural strategic partnerships, how they are contributing to progress toward our 2025 and 2030 pep+ goals and the growing resilience and sustainability of our agricultural supply chain.\n\n\u201cI must say that the trainings are very essential. I believe there have been multiple areas where farmers lacked knowledge. We often used chemicals without realizing their harmful effects; we used to sow seeds without treating them and we didn\u2019t know the right way to irrigate or the right amount of water needed which led to diseases. After gaining knowledge on various potato diseases, we are much more aware of it now.\u201d\n\nAnita Singh, 50\nFarmer and Participant in West Bengal Women\u2019s Economic Empowerment program\n\nImproving livelihoods goal\n\nImprove the livelihoods of more than 250,000 people in our agricultural supply chain and communities, including by economically empowering women\n\n1 Metric counts the cumulative people impacted since 2021\nPositive Agriculture stories\n\nPepsiCo announces second round of projects funded by its global agriculture accelerator, The Positive Agriculture Outcomes Fund\nLearn more \u2192\n\nPepsiCo, ADM announce groundbreaking agreement aiming to reduce carbon intensity by supporting regenerative agriculture practices on up to 2 million acres of farmland\nLearn more \u2192\n\nPepsiCo continues progress towards ambitious climate goals\nLearn more \u2192\n\nPepsiCo announces $216 million investment in long-term partnerships with three major farmer-facing organizations to support regenerative agriculture transformation on more than three million acres of U.S. farmland\nLearn more \u2192\n\nExplore agriculture topics in more depth\nPepsiCo\u2019s ESG Topics A-Z provides detail on strategy, data, policy, progress and more on a wide range of subjects.\n\nAgriculture \u2192\nBioengineered Food and Ingredients \u2192\nClimate change \u2192\nDeforestation \u2192\nHuman Rights \u2192\nLand Rights \u2192\nPalm Oil \u2192\nPesticides and other Agrochemicals \u2192\nSustainable sourcing \u2192\nWater \u2192\n\nOur 2022 ESG Performance Metrics\nThis download contains detailed performance data, tracking progress against our goals over the past five years.\nDownload 2022 ESG Performance Metrics \u2192\nPepsiCo\u2019s complex value chain begins with the sourcing of more than 30 agricultural crops and ingredients from our farmers and suppliers around the world. These crops and ingredients are made into beloved PepsiCo products at more than 1,000 manufacturing facilities, including 291 company-owned facilities. Products are packaged and then moved over approximately 1.3 billion miles worldwide by our company-owned fleet \u2014 and even more than that through third-party transportation providers \u2014 to be sold and enjoyed by our consumers more than one billion times a day. Once the product has been enjoyed, the packaging is generally either collected as waste or recycled for another use.\n\nWe are working to make every stage of our value chain more circular and inclusive and to help advance the systemic changes we believe are needed to tackle significant global challenges such as environmental degradation, social inequality and access to nutritious food. These changes are not only good for our business but also for the partners and people throughout our value chain, as well as the communities we serve.\n\nWe are taking bold action aimed to reduce our climate-related impacts, replenish watersheds and minimize water use, innovate more sustainable packaging and recapture packaging materials, but know there are many challenges to overcome.\n\nWe aim to keep pushing for better \u2014 particularly with respect to our GHG emissions and packaging goals \u2014 as growth in our business has impacted our progress against these pep+ goals. We know that achieving these ambitious goals will require further investment and innovation, and we face challenges from the limitations of existing technology and regulations. However, we understand the leadership role we need to play, the infrastructure and regulatory requirements, and the partnerships and scalable technologies needed to keep building momentum and we remain focused on advancing our agenda.\nOur world is already feeling the effects of climate change and fast, bold action is needed. At PepsiCo, we are eager to help lead the way toward net-zero. Not only because we know climate change threatens the prosperity of people and communities, but also, because it challenges the long-term sustainability of companies like us, and the millions of jobs we collectively support.\n\nTo help mitigate these risks and adapt to new realities, it is essential for PepsiCo to build resilience to protect against climate change. That means we need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, including by investing in sustainable solutions like renewable energy.\n\nWe have set an ambitious goal of achieving net-zero emissions across our entire value chain by 2040 and an interim goal to reduce absolute emissions (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) across our value chain by more than 40% by 2030, which includes a reduction of 75% in Scope 1 and 2 emissions (both goals against a 2015 baseline).\n\nWe always aim to do more to drive progress toward our climate goals, and we are focusing our climate strategy on the areas where we can have the biggest impact: manufacturing, agriculture, packaging, transportation and vending and cooling equipment.\n\nOur climate action strategy\n\nReaching net-zero GHG emissions while increasing business resiliency\n\n**MITIGATION ACTIONS**\nReducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to decarbonize our supply chain\n\n- Reduce virgin material use, increase recycled materials like recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET), scale reusable models and use low-carbon alternatives or renewable material\n- Shift to renewable electricity and fuels globally\n- Continue to develop sustainable manufacturing, warehousing and distribution\n\n**Scale sustainable agriculture**\n\n**ADAPTATION OPPORTUNITIES**\nReduce vulnerability to climate change impacts by incorporating climate risk into business continuity planning\n\n- Enhance preparation for extreme weather events, bolstering business continuity planning\n- Adapt manufacturing footprint for potential vulnerabilities to climate risks, such as flooding from rising sea levels\n- Increase water security and manage droughts with holistic watershed solutions\n\n**Drive regenerative agriculture practices**\nand explore heat-resistant crops to address climate change effects on growing cycles\n\n- Decarbonize ahead of potential carbon taxes\n\nPositive Value Chain: Climate\nPositive Value Chain: Climate\n\nApproach\n\nIn addition to proven approaches to reducing internal carbon emissions, we are also seeking new ways to influence reductions at the individual farmer level, as well as among large-scale suppliers, and advocating for industry-wide change.\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s Climate Action Strategy aims to reduce more than 26 million metric tons of GHG emissions, the equivalent of taking more than five million cars off the road for a year. Informed by science, our approach is built on mitigation to reduce GHG emissions to decarbonize our supply chain, and adaptation to reduce vulnerability by incorporating climate risk into our business continuity plans.\n\nWe know that turning the tide will take diligence and time, but we are laying the foundation by putting substantial influence and investment behind climate action and building resilience.\n\nWe are continuing to make investments that are designed to help advance our pep+ transformation, through decarbonization and climate resilience in our operations and value chain, among other ambitions. In 2022, we completed our second Green Bond issuance, with a 10-year, $1.25 billion1 senior notes offering. In addition to investments in regenerative agriculture, pursuing net water positive impact, circular economy and virgin plastic waste reduction, net proceeds are being allocated to investments in decarbonization and climate resilience within our operations and value chain. These include, for example, sustainable energy generation using solar installations and other means, greener buildings that receive third-party verifications, energy efficiency efforts and/or reducing GHG emissions at facilities, upgrading of vending and cooling equipment and the expansion of cleaner transportation, such as electric fleet vehicles. In 2022, we continued growing our industry-leading electric fleet by taking delivery of the first-ever Tesla Semis, and deploying electric trucks from several other manufacturers.\n\nWe aim to drive fundamental change by working toward our net-zero emissions goal and catalyzing industry-wide impact. We are developing and supporting solutions to decarbonize operations across our value chain, including a range of initiatives to increase zero- and near-zero emissions delivery vehicles for our company-owned fleets, improve energy-use efficiency and scale renewable fuel solutions at manufacturing sites. We aim to achieve 100% renewable electricity in our operations by 2030 and in all our franchise and third-party operations by 2040.2\n\nWe have launched innovative programs that hold the potential to become templates for decarbonizing operations. Where effective, they can be replicated at other PepsiCo facilities and become the building blocks for scaling impact.\n\n- In 2022, we continued to work toward our goal of 100% renewable electricity in our direct operations, and approximately 65% of our global electricity needs were met by renewable sources.3\n- Our Frito-Lay facility in Modesto, California \u2013 one of the largest in the U.S. \u2013 is a role model for decarbonizing in one of the most challenging sectors: transportation. A major hub for delivery trucks, the plant is home to half of PepsiCo\u2019s new Tesla semi-trucks. To date, it has cut GHG emissions by 91% at its transportation center since 2019 through its transformation into a first-of-its-kind showcase of large-scale commercialization of near-zero and zero-emission technologies in manufacturing, warehousing and distribution. It is the first Frito-Lay manufacturing facility to implement site-wide alternative fuel vehicles, on-site renewable energy generation, energy storage equipment and employee electric vehicle charging stations.\n- In 2022, we completed installation of a bioplas pilot project at one of our facilities in China that collects organic waste such as potato peels and sludge from the wastewater treatment station and transfers it to an anaerobic tank to produce biogas. The biogas is used to generate electricity for production, and the residue can be repurposed as organic fertilizer on potato farms, a contribution to both our pep+ agriculture and climate goals. The pilot is designed to generate approximately 2.4 million kilowatts of electricity per year and will reduce GHG emissions by around 1,400 metric tons per year.\n- At a facility in the Netherlands, we have made initial investments to adopt a renewable electricity system and phase out the use of natural gas. This is expected to replace 4.5 million cubic meters of gas annually, saving 8,500 metric tons of GHG emissions. The Volt system turns electricity from nearby solar and wind farms into heat, and includes a heat storage and transfer system to circulate the thermal oil that powers the fryers to make Lay\u2019s and Cheetos.\n\nWe believe that effectively addressing climate change requires action throughout the value chain.\n\nThe biggest challenge in our journey to net-zero emissions is reducing Scope 3 emissions, which accounted for 93% of our global GHG emissions in 2022. Scope 3 emissions increased by 7% from a 2015 baseline, largely due to business growth. Our emissions intensity (calculated as million metric tons GHG emissions per $ billion net revenue) was 0.71 in 2022.\n\n1 PepsiCo\u2019s 2022 Green Bond Framework defines eligible project categories as circular economy and virgin plastic waste reduction; decarbonization and climate resilience within our operations and value chain; pursuing net positive water impact; and regenerative agriculture.\n\n2 To achieve 100% renewable electricity, PepsiCo has targeted a diversified portfolio of solutions. These include Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), which finance the development of new renewable electricity projects such as solar and wind farms, as well as energy attribute certificates (EACs), known as renewable energy certificates (RECs) in the U.S. from existing wind or solar farms, which are credits certified by independent third-parties that support existing electricity generation from renewable sources.\n\n3 The goal is being accomplished using a diversified portfolio of solutions, including RECs. Results reflect exclusion of Be & Cheery portfolio. Decrease from prior year is primarily due to the unavailability of renewable energy certificates in Russia.\nPositive Value Chain: Climate\n\ndown from 0.93 in 2015, reflecting net revenue growth that has outpaced our emissions increase, but work remains to reduce the linkage between business and emissions growth.\n\nWe expect all our value chain partners \u2013 including suppliers, contract manufacturers and franchise bottlers \u2013 to set science-based climate targets, and we are supporting them in this transition. In 2022, we hosted our first value-chain-wide global pep+ Sustainability Summit, bringing together suppliers to contribute to climate targets with four expectations:\n\n1. Report Scope 1 & 2 emissions to us by the end of 2023;\n2. Set, or commit to setting, a Science-Based Target (SBT) by the end of 2023;\n3. Convert PepsiCo\u2019s portion of electrical load to renewable electricity, where available, by the end of 2023; and\n4. For agricultural suppliers, collaborate with us to develop an action plan for sustainable ingredients and to build regenerative agriculture acres by the end 2023.\n\nUrgent action to achieve net-zero emissions also requires working with strategic partners. We partnered with Schneider Electric in early 2022 to launch pep+ REnew, a new educational program designed to accelerate the adoption of renewable electricity in our supply chain. REnew educates supply chain partners on available procurement options and helps them to successfully and efficiently transition to renewable electricity by, for example, buying renewable electricity credits or entering into a power purchase agreement (PPA) for a solar or wind farm. PepsiCo is currently assembling an inaugural cohort to provide resources and guidance on joining and executing an aggregate PPA \u2013 a buying tool that allows multiple partners to jointly invest in a renewable electricity project.\n\nIn addition, through our demonstration farms and other investments, we work with our farmers and supply chain partners to scale regenerative agriculture practices that sequester carbon and reduce GHG emissions across seven million acres of land used across the world to grow our crops and ingredients for our products.\n\nGoals & progress\n\nAt the end of 2022 \u2013 just over one year since launching pep+ \u2013 we have made significant investments, piloted or adopted innovative technologies, launched groundbreaking programs and entered into strategic partnerships to reduce emissions throughout our value chain. While we did improve our GHG intensity, our 2022 emissions were up against baseline due to strong business growth since 2015. In 2022, PepsiCo\u2019s total GHG emissions across Scopes 1, 2 and 3 were approximately 61 million metric tons, which represents a 4% increase from our 2015 baseline. We have not yet made progress in line with our ambitions but we remain focused on achieving our goals.\n\nAchieve net-zero emissions across our value chain by 2040.\n\nGHG emissions reduction goal\n\nReduce total Scope 1, 2 & 3 emissions by more than 40% by 2030\n\n2022 (43%) 0\n\n2030 Goal >40% reduction\n\n1 Measured versus a 2015 baseline.

According to World Wildlife Fund (WWF), only 3% of the world\u2019s water is freshwater, and over two-thirds of that is frozen in glaciers or otherwise unavailable.\n\nWe are working to become net water positive by 2030. This means achieving best-in-class1 water-use efficiency in 100% of high water-risk PepsiCo and third-party manufacturing facilities and world-class1 water-use efficiency in all other PepsiCo and third-party manufacturing facilities; improving the health of high water-risk watersheds where we directly source our crops including an improvement in water-use efficiency; replenishing more water than we use from local watersheds; and delivering safe water access to those who need it most. Our vision is that, wherever in the world we operate, water resources will be in a better state because of our presence.\n\n### Positive Value Chain: Water\n\n#### Our path to net water positive\n\n| How is PepsiCo working to be net water positive? |\n|-----------------------------------------------|\n| **USE LESS WATER** |\n| **How** |\n| Increasing water efficiency in manufacturing and agriculture by: |\n| \u2022 Aiming for world-class and best-in-class water-use efficiency for PepsiCo manufacturing, franchise bottlers and third-party manufacturers |\n| \u2022 Improving on-farm irrigation efficiency and water management |\n| **REPLENISH WATER** |\n| **How** |\n| Partnering with leading NGOs to deliver nature-based solutions to strengthen and rehabilitate degraded ecosystems by: |\n| \u2022 Restoring degraded wetlands |\n| \u2022 Forestry management, including reforestation, in stressed catchments |\n| \u2022 Removing non-native species that negatively impact local watersheds |\n| \u2022 Using sustainable land management tools to control water levels and prevent runoff |\n| **PROVIDE SAFE WATER ACCESS** |\n| **How** |\n| Investing in distribution, purification and conservation programs that: |\n| \u2022 Support the construction of water supply and sanitation facilities |\n| \u2022 Help farmers irrigate their crops by collecting, treating and reusing rainwater |\n| \u2022 Improve access to hygiene in schools and sanitation in households |\n\n---\n\n1. Best-in-class water-use efficiency for beverage facilities is defined as 1.2 liters of water (or less) per liter of beverage production. Best-in-class water-use efficiency for convenient foods facilities is defined as 0.4 liters of water (or less) per kg of convenient foods production. World-class water-use efficiency for beverage facilities is defined as 1.4 liters of water (or less) per liter of beverage production. World-class water-use efficiency for convenient foods facilities is defined as 4.4 liters of water (or less) per kg of convenient foods production.\nPositive Value Chain: Water\n\nApproach\n\nOur long-term water strategy aims to achieve sustainable water security for our business, natural ecosystems and local communities that depend on an accessible and reliable supply of clean, safe water.\n\nOur net water positive ambition is to use water as efficiently as possible across our manufacturing operations and agriculture practices, replenish local watersheds by returning more than 100% of the water we use and deliver safe water access to those who need it most.\n\nIn support of our goal of being net water positive in 100% of high water-risk company-owned and third-party manufacturing facilities by 2030, we are driving progress and accountability on water-use efficiency in our own operations. We are scaling the installation of new water-efficient manufacturing processes and investment in technologies to make our operations among the most water-efficient in the world.\n\nTo reduce our freshwater consumption, we are piloting innovative water treatment technology in high water-stress areas to use as models for other PepsiCo sites around the world.\n\n- **Vallejo, Mexico facility**: At one of our largest foods manufacturing facilities in the world, PepsiCo has created its first truly circular water system. For more than 200 days in 2022, Vallejo achieved zero freshwater consumption (zero liter/kg), drawing zero water from the conventional supply during this period. By installing water-use efficiency technology to recycle water on-site, including a filtration and reverse osmosis system, low-water cooking processes and rainwater harvesting, and treating and reusing processed water from other nearby companies within our catchment areas, Vallejo has increased its water-use efficiency by 85% (compared to a 2015 baseline).\n\n- **Funza, Colombia facility**: For more than 200 days in 2022, this site operated using zero freshwater, with no burden on local municipalities, by capturing rainwater for use in its operations.\n\n- **Kolkata, India facility**: The average potato is made up of about 80% water. At our Kolkata plant, we developed a way to give the water naturally occurring in the potatoes a purpose by capturing it and cleaning it to safe drinking standards instead of letting it evaporate off as steam during cooking. The technology can recover more than 50% of the water used in the potato chip cooking process. Early results show the process can save each facility up to 60 million liters of water per year. PepsiCo has the potential to scale this application, where regulations permit, at up to 30 high water-risk areas by 2030.\n\nWe continue to expand internal partnership initiatives such as our Resource Conservation (ReCon) program, through which PepsiCo facilities across the globe work together to identify and share best practices in operational water-use efficiency. We are also making progress toward our goal of 100% adoption of the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) Standard in high water-risk manufacturing areas by 2025. We have made strong progress over the year doubling the number of facilities implementing the AWS Standard driven largely by our high water-risk facilities in Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA) and PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA). In addition, eight facilities in the PepsiCo AMESA sector completed adoption in 2022.\n\nWe believe the best way to tackle water stress at the watershed level is to engage all stakeholders and, through collective action, work toward a common goal of improving water governance and conservation. Our approach is to understand the water challenges at the local level and support collaborative solutions that drive equity and address the specific needs of each watershed.\n\nIn 2022, we continued our strategic relationships with The Nature Conservancy (TNC), WWF and others on a range of initiatives that seek to restore the health of high water-risk watersheds and increase their ability to absorb rainfall into their aquifers, rivers and reservoirs. In collaboration with farmers, landowners, local communities, state and federal agencies and NGOs, we support programs that are tailored to address the specific challenges of each local watershed.\n\nProgram highlights:\n\n- In 2022, our work with TNC delivered an impressive 25% increase in replenishment volume since 2021 (delivering approximately 5.5 billion liters in 2022 according to third-party calculations) through strong project implementation. For example, along the Verde River in Arizona, farmers have switched from growing corn or alfalfa to growing barley, a crop that requires less water. This change will help make more water available in the local river for other uses, but also creates new market opportunities for local farmers.\n\n- In South Africa, PepsiCo has established a partnership with WWF to support watershed conservation in four of the country\u2019s 22 strategic water sourcing areas. Programmatic activity under this partnership includes landscape management interventions such as the clearing of invasive alien trees, the restoration of grasslands and improved agricultural practices, which has created economic opportunities and improved local livelihoods.\n\nLearn more about our efforts to advocate for and contribute to a measurable improvement in water-use efficiency of farmers in high water-risk watersheds where we directly source our crops and our work to deliver safe water access to 100 million people by 2030.\nGoals & progress\n\nWater stewardship has long been one of PepsiCo\u2019s top priorities. In 2022, we recorded a 22% improvement in our water-use efficiency rate in our high water-risk locations when compared to our 2015 baseline; replenished approximately 45% of the water used in our company-owned manufacturing facilities in high-risk watersheds, or approximately 8.7 billion liters of water; and at the end of 2022, we had 61 facilities in the process of adopting, and eight facilities that completed adoption of, the AWS Standard.\n\n1. We continue to measure progress against our original 2025 goal and our extended 2030 goal. Third-party manufacturers are not yet included in our 2030 goal progress, but will be included in future calculations. In 2021, an updated water risk assessment identified additional company-owned high water-risk facilities, which are in-scope for calculating progress against our 2030 goal only. Excluding these additional company-owned facilities\u2019 water usage, we replenished 52% of water used in high water-risk facilities in 2022, representing progress against our original 2025 goal. See Calculation methodology for detail on how we measure progress against our pep+ goals.\n\n2. 25% improvement goal measured versus a 2015 baseline; high water-risk locations defined by World Resources Institute\u2019s Aqueduct tool.

These efforts also advance our goal to reduce GHG emissions across our value chain by more than 40% by the end of this decade.\n\nAs we look to achieve our ambitious packaging goals, we plan to take additional mitigating actions to reduce virgin plastic use. In 2022, our results did not reflect the intentions we have. We have more challenges to overcome to address packaging usage and those challenges are significant and complex. We believe we have the right strategy to address those within our value chain and seek to make the investments needed to deliver progress. However, regardless of our intentions, our actions alone will not be enough.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no single solution that alone can solve the systemic challenges and diverse global dynamics that have the potential to enable success but, at this time, are contributing barriers to progress.\n\nWe are committed to working together with partners across the value chain to find scalable solutions \u2013 those that are economically viable, meet quality and safety standards, appeal to consumers and work within industry systems \u2013 such as innovative packaging designs, aligned policy principles and improved recycling infrastructure, that will help us achieve our sustainable packaging goals.\n\nPositive Value Chain: Packaging\n\nOur sustainable packaging vision\nHow we are working toward our vision of a world where packaging never becomes waste\n\n**REDUCE**\n- Minimize plastic across our packaging through lightweighting\n- Rightsize our foods packaging\n- Transition to alternative materials, such as paper\n\n**RECYCLE**\n- Design packaging to be recyclable wherever it is sold\n- Invest to increase collection and recycling rates\n- Incorporate post-consumer recycled content\n\n**REINVENT**\n- Expand low- or no-packaging formats such as SodaStream\n- Scale renewable plastics made from bio-based materials\n- Pilot reuse models for foods portfolio\nPositive Value Chain: Packaging\n\nApproach\n\nPepsiCo aims to create a circular economy for packaging, which requires a concerted effort of partnering with policymakers, NGOs, food and beverage industry participants, scientists, producer responsibility organizations, investors, trade associations, materials recovery facilities, waste collectors and consumers, among others.\n\nWe work closely with partners to promote sustainable practices and accelerate innovation throughout the packaging value chain. We are reinventing the packaging materials we use to reduce our environmental impact. Our efforts focus primarily on using packaging materials that are recyclable, compostable, biodegradable, or reusable (RCBR) not only by design but also taking into account end-of-life management, incorporating recycled content into our plastic packaging, and developing renewable alternatives to fossil-fuel-based materials, including plant-based plastics.\n\nAs we work to achieve our goals, we are also supporting the development of collection, sortation and recycling infrastructure to process the materials we put in market and we are working to help increase consumer education and acceptance; however, challenges remain.\n\nThe lack of sufficient collection, sortation and waste management infrastructure and well-designed policies to support the development of a more circular plastics supply chain through recycling, composting and reuse, as well as varying consumer behavior across markets are some of the key challenges we face in making progress on achieving a packaging portfolio that is fully RCBR.\n\nIn order to address these current global infrastructure and other challenges, we are leveraging partnerships to identify solutions across the value chain and advocate for smart policies.\n\nIn support of our goal to invest to increase recycling rates in key markets, PepsiCo collaborates with organizations globally. We do this through multi-stakeholder partnership platforms such as the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF) Plastic Waste Coalition of Action, the World Economic Forum (WEF), the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF) and The Recycling Partnership (TRP). These pre-competitive collaborations focus on aligning global standards and practices and advocating policies and regulations that properly incentivize circular solutions.\n\nThrough our partnerships with several consortia, we cofounded the Composting Consortium in 2022. The group is managed by the investment firm Closed Loop Partners (CLP) and aims to define best practices across the compostable packaging value chain, test various composting technologies, identify enabling environment factors that support the industry\u2019s development and outline the business case for greater investment in this emerging space.\n\nIn 2022, we committed $35 million to help create the Closed Loop Local Recycling Fund to advance new small-scale, modular recycling systems in U.S. communities. We are also a founding member of the Closed Loop Infrastructure Fund and have invested in the Closed Loop Beverage Fund through American Beverage Association\u2019s Every Bottle Back Initiative, alongside industry peers, in 2023, we invested in Circular Services, a developer launched by OLP and Brookfield Renewable, whose goal is to build recycling facilities that will enable U.S. cities to abandon the costly practice of dumping waste in landfills by ensuring that valuable commodities are recycled and reused in domestic supply chains. Since 2018, PepsiCo and PepsiCo Foundation have committed to invest more than $100 million in global recycling partnership initiatives to help elevate recycling rates and waste collection.\nIn addition to investments in recycling, we have taken steps to light-weight bottles, reduce film thickness, minimize packaging materials, incorporate recycled content and bio-based materials and transition from plastic to alternative materials such as paper.\n\nTo further our recycled content objectives, we:\n\n- In 2022, entered into an agreement with Eastman to supply us with recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) made from non-bottle feedstock that would otherwise go to landfill, including volume that will come from a new plant that Eastman will build in the next few years which, once online, is expected to have an annual output capacity of more than 150,000 tons of rPET.\n- Made progress on transitioning to rPET bottles across several markets:\n  - Through advocacy and partnerships, in 2022, PepsiCo AMESA launched multiple brands, such as Aquafina and Pepsi, in rPET across six markets (South Africa, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Egypt, Kuwait and Qatar), with plans to expand modestly in 2023.\n  - In 13 European markets, key Pepsi-branded products have transitioned to 100% rPET bottles.\n- In the U.S., we sell LIFEWTR in 100% rPET bottles and as of 2022, have begun to convert all 20oz bottles of Pepsi, including Pepsi Zero Sugar to 100% rPET (we plan to convert all Pepsi-branded products in the U.S. to 100% rPET bottles by 2030).\n- In 2021 and 2022, PepsiCo Asia Pacific, Australia, New Zealand and China (APAC) launched 100% rPET beverage products in Australia, New Zealand and Vietnam.\n- PepsiCo Latin America launched 100% rPET for Pepsi and Pepsi Black in Argentina.\n- In early 2022, PepsiCo Europe set a new ambition to use 100% recycled or renewable plastic in all crisp and chip packets by 2030, which is projected to reduce GHG emissions in Europe from film food packaging by up to 40%.\n\nAligned with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation\u2019s Reuse \u2013 Rethinking Packaging framework, our four-part strategy to achieve this goal includes expanding our SodaStream business at home and in workplaces through SodaStream Professional; building out our refillable plastic and glass bottle offerings in partnership with PepsiCo bottlers; expanding reusable cups for our growing fountain drinks business; and accelerating growth in powders and concentrates. We currently offer beverages in reusable or returnable containers in more than 80 markets around the world.\n\nWe joined four pre-competitive industry working groups to accelerate learnings on scaling and measuring reuse in packaging: the Ellen MacArthur Foundation\u2019s Scaling Reusable Packaging project; World Economic Forum\u2019s Consumers Beyond Waste initiative; CLP NextGen Cup Consortium; and the Consumer Goods Forum Reuse/Refill Workstream.\n\nSet new global packaging goal to deliver 20% of all beverage servings we sell through reusable models by 2030.\n\n1 Includes Pepsi, Pepsi MAX, Pepsi MAX Lime, Pepsi MAX without caffeine, Pepsi Light, Pepsi Light without caffeine.\nGoals & progress\n\nGreater than anticipated business growth, as well as external factors such as the limited availability and high cost of recycled content, and a need for regulatory unlocks in some markets, contributed to a 2% increase in virgin plastic use per serving and an 11% increase in our absolute plastics tonnage compared to baseline.\n\nWe remain focused on the targets we have set and aim to continue making the decisions and new investments needed to help accelerate our efforts. We will take the lessons learned this year to inform our strategy so that as our business grows, we do so sustainably.\n\nRecyclable, compostable, biodegradable or reusable goal\n\nDesign 100% of packaging to be recyclable, compostable, biodegradable or reusable by 2025.\n\n| Year | Goal | Progress |\n|------|------|----------|\n| 2020 | 87%  |          |\n| 2021 | 87%  |          |\n| 2022 | 88%  |          |\n\nRecycling rate goal\n\nInvest to increase recycling rates in key markets by 2025.\n\nOur actions include:\n- Educating and encouraging consumers to recycle\n- Partnering to increase and improve recycling infrastructure and building solutions for current and future material streams\n\n1 PepsiCo considers packaging to be recyclable, compostable, biodegradable or reusable (RCBR) if certain end-of-life waste management criteria is achieved. See \u201cCalculation methodology\u201d in our ESG Topics A-Z for an explanation of how we calculate the percentage of our packaging that is RCBR.

We strive to create and maintain a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace and world and a safe environment within our company, our supply chain and our communities. This means that championing safety, dignity and human rights is foundational to the way we do business.\n\nOur positive impact on people\n\nHow we are using our scale and scope to have a positive impact on people:\n\n- **Increased supplier diversity spend**\n  - From an initial spend of $5 million in 1982 to nearly $30 billion spent over the past 40 years across PepsiCo\u2019s entire value chain\n\n- **Continued to expand our development programs**\n  - Including our global Transformational Leadership Program, Indelible Mark, INSPIRA, Pinnacle, and She Works Wonders for Women, which gives women employees tools to fulfill their career aspirations and succeed as leaders\n\n- **Delivered meals around the world**\n  - Through our Food for Good program, PepsiCo has delivered more than 270 million meals since 2009, and to more than 47 million people since 2016 around the world\n\n- **Expanded One Smile at a Time**\n  - Our first global volunteering program, with employees volunteering more than 290,000 hours in 2022\nPositive Value Chain: People\n\nApproach, goals & progress\n\nProvide meaningful jobs and growth opportunities for our people and empower them to make a positive impact at work, at home and in their local communities.\n\nApproach to job and volunteer growth opportunities\n\nPepsiCo has a tradition of investing in programs and initiatives to help our approximately 315,000 employees grow and develop their careers and personal lives. We are building on that history with three programs that focus on career enhancement and community involvement.\n\nPEP U Degreed, a PepsiCo University offering, and myeducation are programs with distinct approaches to building job skills. PEP U Degreed, an online, self-service platform launched in 2020, leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to suggest personalized learning resources based on people\u2019s skills, interests and connections with colleagues and individual learning habits.\n\nLaunched in 2022, myeducation helps frontline and professional U.S.-based employees develop fresh skills in a classroom setting. It offers access to more than 100 flexible education and upskilling programs from reputable schools and universities \u2014 with PepsiCo covering 100% of the cost of tuition, books and fees for selected education programs. Since launch, more than 360 employees have completed a degree or a school program, and more than 1,600 U.S.-based employees have enrolled. According to our internal data, myeducation participants are 1.5 times more likely to experience a job level change.\n\nOne Smile at a Time, PepsiCo\u2019s first global volunteer initiative, provides resources and support to encourage and empower employees to cultivate prosperity in their communities. In 2022, One Smile at a Time delivered on that aim as employees volunteered more than 290,000 hours of their time to assist local communities in more than 25 countries. In the process, we developed digital assets and issued a playbook in 16 languages to help facilitate greater engagement and support the reach of our employees in their local communities.\n\nIn 2023, we will continue to nurture engagement and empower employees to volunteer. We already stepped up activities during Global Volunteering Month in April 2023. We further plan to integrate One Smile at a Time into our Employee Resource Group programs and launch a content series to highlight employees\u2019 volunteer work and elevate the program\u2019s impact.\n\nJob growth goal\n\nIncrease the employability of our people through increased access to degrees, skill development and new roles, providing meaningful growth opportunities to everyone at every stage.\n\nOur 2022 actions include:\n\n\u2022 Helping PepsiCo employees build and strengthen their leadership and professional skills through a variety of global training and development programs such as our PepsiCo University (PEP U) Degreed online learning platform. In 2022, employees completed over 1 million hours of training.\n\n\u2022 Launching myeducation, which will enable U.S. employees, in the frontline population and elsewhere, to upskill and re-skill by offering specific interventions and paths, all without going into debt.\n\n\u2022 Enabling more than 360 employees to earn degrees or complete courses, including more than 60 employees who received Commercial Driver\u2019s License (CDL) certification through our tuition-free myeducation program since it began last year.\n\nVolunteer growth goal\n\nEmpower our associates with the resources and time needed to build and cultivate prosperity in our communities.\n\nOur actions in 2022 included activating the One Smile at a Time program to:\n\n\u2022 Unite the volunteer efforts of our employees across more than 25 countries to donate their time and talent to the communities where they live and work.\n\n\u2022 Make a positive impact on local communities worldwide by spending more than 290,000 hours in volunteering actions.\nPositive Value Chain: People\n\nApproach to Racial Equality Journey managerial representation\n\nBuild a better workplace and world by advancing human rights and diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) for our people, in our business partnerships and our communities.\n\nWe are making progress against our U.S. Racial Equality Journey goals. In 2022, we continued monitoring data across our internal working councils for our Racial Equality Journey (REJ) to help ensure we can sustain our progress well beyond 2025. Launched in 2020, REJ is comprised of a five-year set of goals with a focus on three pillars: People, Business and Communities. Within our company, we focus on increasing the representation of Black and Hispanic employees at the manager level at PepsiCo to mirror the workforce availability in the communities where we operate. Outside our walls, we are using our scale and influence to increase Black and Hispanic representation among our suppliers and partners. We are also striving to drive long-term change across our communities by addressing systemic barriers to economic opportunity and advancing economic empowerment for Black and Hispanic Americans.\n\nWe have continued advancing our goals with respect to Black and Hispanic representation among PepsiCo managers. Two leadership development programs we have created for Black and Hispanic employees have helped to fuel this progress. More than 82 Black managers and more than 68 Hispanic managers, along with their direct supervisors, have completed our six-month Breakthrough Organizational Leadership Development (BOLD) program, which instills leadership skills. We also implemented mandatory Unconscious Bias and Inclusive Leadership Training for our U.S. executives: 100% of the required population completed the training.\n\nRacial Equality Journey managerial representation goals\n\n| 2025 Goal | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|-----------|------|------|------|\n| Achieve 10% Black representation in U.S. managerial populations | 8.0% | 8.3% | 9.0% |\n| Achieve 10% Hispanic representation in U.S. managerial populations | 9.3% | 9.5% | 10.1% |\nPositive Value Chain: People\n\nApproach to helping address inequalities\n\nLast year marked the 40th anniversary of our Supplier Diversity program. Since 1982 when the program began, our annual volume of business with U.S.-based certified, diverse suppliers \u2013 those whose owners are Women, Black, Hispanic, Asian, LGBTQ+, Native American, Individuals with Disabilities and U.S. Veterans \u2013 has risen from $5 million to more than $1 billion. In furtherance of our REJ goals, we pledged to spend more than $400 million annually with Black and Hispanic-owned suppliers \u2013 a figure we surpassed by more than $30 million in 2022. We estimate this investment will unlock over $600 million in Gross Domestic Product impact and employ over 6,000 people.\n\nNow in its second year, our $50 million Juntos Crecemos (Together We Grow) platform supports small Hispanic-owned businesses, including restaurants, bodegas and meat markets across the U.S. To date, the program has helped more than 500 enterprises with marketing and safety essentials. Pepsi Dig In, a similar-sized program to strengthen Black-owned restaurants, has provided more than $22 million to date to Black restaurateurs since its inception in 2020.\n\nIn 2021, PepsiCo and the PepsiCo Foundation launched a two-part scholarship program to support 4,000 Black and Hispanic collegians over five years. In 2022, we expanded the program\u2019s Uplift Scholarships for students attending community colleges to 20 U.S. cities. Additionally, the S.M.I.L.E. (Success Matters in Life & Education) program provides scholarships to talented students transferring from two-year to four-year schools. Collectively, in 2022, the PepsiCo Foundation provided nearly 1,800 scholarships to students across the United States.\n\nReduced inequalities goal\n\nOur actions include:\n\n- Increasing our engagement and programs at colleges and universities to cultivate and increase hiring of diverse talent\n- Tailoring our tools, resources and skill-building programs to elevate business impact, while ensuring DE&I is embedded across the talent lifecycle as we strive for equitable outcomes\n- Expanding our diverse supply base across our value chain and investing in diverse-owned businesses by providing grants and business-building support services\n- Continuing to benchmark ourselves across industry peers to ensure our continual progress\nPositive Value Chain: People\n\nApproach to women in management\n\nPepsiCo believes that ensuring women have equal access to hiring and advancement opportunities and strong representation in our management ranks makes us a more innovative and competitive company. We remain focused on our goal of 50% women in management roles around the world by 2025.\n\nAs part of our efforts to cultivate women\u2019s talents, we provide a range of mentoring, coaching and development programs for women at different career stages. They include our Transformational Leadership Program (TLP) for Women, a global mentoring program designed to equip women with the tools they need to elevate their business impact and achieve their professional goals within a large and complex organization.\n\nIn our Pinnacle Group program, senior sales managers teach leadership skills to top-performing women sales associates. The program was created to increase retention of PepsiCo female sales talent, while strengthening and diversifying our future leadership pipeline. The 10-year-old program has a retention rate of 70%.\n\nIn Latin America, our INSPIRA multi-year program aims to accelerate career growth for female managers and executives and establish a strong bench of women leaders. In PepsiCo AMESA, our Tamakani program has proudly empowered Saudi women since its inception. We have set out to equip women with the necessary tools, knowledge and networks to become impactful leaders. We have done so through relevant partnerships with associations dedicated to empowering women and who share our vision and values as a brand.\n\nWomen in management goal\n\nAchieve and sustain 50% women in management roles globally\n\n| Year | Goal | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|\n| 2025 | 50%  | 41%  | 43%  | 44%  |\nPositive Value Chain: People\n\nApproach to pay equity\n\nEnsuring pay equity across employee groups has been the aim of our review process since 2016. We apply a comprehensive global pay equity review process to 72 countries that collectively make up more than 99% of our salaried employee population. Our results show that among this population, women and men are paid within 1% of each other.\n\nPay equity goal\n\nAchieve and sustain pay equity for our global professional population by maintaining a comprehensive global pay equity review process.\n\nWomen and men continue to be paid within 1% of each other.\n\nApproach to our Supplier Code of Conduct\n\nWe expect that all our suppliers, vendors, contractors and consultants meet the same high standards of responsible business behavior that PepsiCo embraces \u2013 standards enumerated in our Global Supplier Code of Conduct regarding ethics, labor practices, health and safety and environmental management. PepsiCo has set a goal of extending the principles of the Global Supplier Code to all our franchisees and joint venture partners by 2025.\n\nSupplier Code of Conduct goal\n\nExtend the principles of our Supplier Code of Conduct to all of our franchisees and joint ventures by 2025.\n\nOur actions include:\n- Continuing to engage directly with our franchise and joint venture partners through our Sustainable Sourcing Program, prioritizing action on our pep+ priority areas, including our salient human rights issues.\n\n1 After controlling for legitimate drivers of pay such as job level, geographic location and performance ratings; based on base compensation. 71 countries included in 2020 analysis, 72 countries included in 2021 and 2022 analysis, representing more than 99% of salaried population.\nPositive Value Chain: People\n\nApproach to human rights\n\nPepsiCo is committed to respecting the fundamental human rights of all workers and communities throughout our value chain. To help ensure we are in the best position to prevent, identify and address potential impacts, we established a global human rights approach that is guided by the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n\nAs part of this approach, we focus our efforts on our most salient human rights issues, including those that pose the greatest risk of severe negative impacts through our company\u2019s activities and business relationships. We identified six salient human rights issues during our initial assessment in 2017.\n\nAs a result of the reassessment performed in 2022, we added climate change as a salient issue due to the severe challenges it poses for human rights. We know that the physical effects of climate change impede the exercise of universal human rights \u2013 the right to food, water, sanitation and housing \u2013 and worsen inequities in living conditions across the world. We will continue to embed human rights risk management into our climate mitigation and resilience efforts to more fully address climate-related human rights impacts.\n\nWe also expanded the salient issue of vulnerable workers into a cross-cutting lens that is applied across all salient issues to help ensure that vulnerability is effectively considered in the approach for each salient issue. For instance, we have identified worker groups that are especially vulnerable to exploitation and forced-labor related impacts \u2013 migrant workers, women, young workers and temporary/contract workers \u2013 and focused our efforts on addressing the impacts most commonly faced by these groups such as bonded labor and recruitment fees. PepsiCo is collaborating with other global brands to advocate for fair pay, conditions and protections for workers throughout our value chain.\n\nAdditionally, we use a risk-based human rights due diligence approach as part of our Sustainable Sourcing Program, which encourages our business-critical, first-tier ingredient suppliers to adhere to sustainable sourcing practices and apply these principles across their respective supply chains. This approach aims to mitigate adverse impacts on the workers throughout our supply chain and prioritize areas where the risks to rights holders are highest. The process monitors and assesses potential impacts, integrates findings into our internal systems, remedies impacts and tracks the effectiveness of our actions.\n\nHuman rights goal\n\nPromote fair and safe working conditions for all by advancing respect for human rights everywhere we operate and throughout our business activities.\n\nOur actions include:\n\n- Completing a formal reassessment of our salient human rights issues to determine whether certain issues have become higher priorities over time and to establish new action plans\n- Updating our Global Human Rights Policy to ensure alignment with stakeholder feedback, emerging regulatory developments and internationally-recognized best practices, as well as publishing our Human Rights Defenders (HRDs) Statement outlining our commitment to respect the rights of HRDs throughout our value chain\n- Adding climate change to the list of salient human rights issues PepsiCo faces and reframing other issues, including fair pay and working conditions and forced labor, in light of last year\u2019s assessment\n\n1 In late 2021, we initiated a strategic review of the most salient human rights issues for our value chain to ensure that we focus on the most urgent human rights concerns. We concluded this review and provided a more detailed update in late 2022.\nPositive Value Chain: People\n\nApproach to striving for an injury-free work environment\n\nWe are committed to respecting human rights and driving fair and safe working conditions throughout our value chain, including maintaining high safety standards and striving for an injury-free work environment.\n\nInjury-free work environment goal\n\n1. To align with U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration calculation methodology, PepsiCo now reports Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR) as Lost Time incidents per 200,000 hours worked. For comparison purposes, we re-calculated prior years\u2019 performance data previously reported per 1,000,000 hours.\n\n2. 2022 results reflect the exclusion of SodaStream. 2021 and 2020 results reflect the exclusion of SodaStream and Pioneer Foods.\nPositive Value Chain: People\n\nApproach to providing safe water access\n\nAccess to clean, safe water is a human right that the UN reports two billion people, a quarter of the human population, currently lack. Climate change and environmental degradation have aggravated the shortage of access to clean, safe water, which could displace 700 million people by 2030. Water stewardship has long been a priority at PepsiCo, and we were one of the first companies to recognize water as a human right. Over the past 15 years, PepsiCo and the PepsiCo Foundation have invested more than $53 million and committed other resources to help ensure that more people can realize that right.\n\nIn partnership with NGOs including WaterAid, Water.org, Safe Water Network and the National Business Initiative, along with local organizations, we have driven improvements in watershed management, agricultural technologies, distribution, purification and conservation that have a real impact on people\u2019s daily lives.\n\nAs of 2022, we were closing in on our goal to provide safe water access to 100 million people by 2030. At the end of 2022, the PepsiCo Foundation had ensured access to clean, safe water for more than 80 million people worldwide since 2006. This includes 12 million people in 2022 alone.\n\n1 Metric counts the cumulative number of people provided with access to safe water since 2006. Goal increased to 100 million by 2030, having achieved more than 50 million in 2020.\nPositive Value Chain: People\n\nApproach to advancing food security\n\nFood security is essential to thriving communities. When people get the nutrition they need, children are better educated, economies grow and people live healthier, longer lives. Yet access to nutritious food is another vital need that much of humanity lacks. Climate change, rising costs and conflicts across various regions have amplified a hunger crisis affecting approximately 828 million people.\n\nFor more than a decade, PepsiCo and the PepsiCo Foundation have worked with more than 60 nonprofits, industry peers, local and international organizations and our employees across 28 countries to expand access to nutritious food. We are using our global scale to create local impact and help realize zero hunger in the communities where we live and work.\n\nThrough our Food for Good program, we have leveraged our resources to deliver more than 270 million meals to underserved communities since 2009. We began tracking beneficiaries in 2016 and since then, have delivered food to more than 47 million people through the program. In addition to distributing food, Food for Good will help us toward our goal of improving the livelihoods of more than 250,000 people in the agricultural supply chain by 2030, with a focus on economically empowering women and making farming more diverse.\n\nWe aim to meet three global goals through a combination of philanthropic initiatives, such as our Food for Good program, and commercial initiatives:\n\n- Provide training in sustainable agriculture and economic support to five million female farmers and members of their communities by 2025, to help them increase their crop yields, incomes and access to nutrition.\n\nFood security goal\n\n- Partner with communities to advance food security and make nutritious food accessible to 50 million people.\n\n2030 Goal\n\n50 million\n\n>54 Million1\n\n>58 Million1\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n1. Initial target setting for this metric did not include Pioneer Foods, which delivered accessibility for over 20 million people in 2021. Progress results include programs funded by the PepsiCo Foundation that are intended to provide nutritious meals, utilizing external standards established by the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).\n\n2. The food security target will be reassessed in 2023 to fully account for both commercial and charitable efforts. Progress results represent the cumulative sum of people reached with nutritious meals per annual reporting period through programs funded by the PepsiCo Foundation, as well as through commercial efforts.\n\nExplore People topics in more depth\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s ESG Topics A-Z provides detail on strategy, data, policy, progress and more on a wide range of subjects.\n\n- Diversity, equity and inclusion\n- Employee demographics\n- Employee engagement\n- Employee learning and development\n- Employee recruitment\n- Employee well-being\n- Environment, health and safety\n- Forced labor\n- Freedom of association\n- Gender parity\n- Human right\n- Pay equity\n- Philanthropy\n- Supplier diversity\n- Sustainable sourcing\n\nRead stories about People initiatives at PepsiCo\n\nOur 2022 ESG Performance Metrics\n\nThis download contains detailed performance data, tracking progress against our goals over the past five years.\n\nDownload 2022 ESG Performance Metrics\nPositive Value Chain: People\n\nPositive Value Chain stories\n\nPepsiCo introduces innovative clean electricity program: pep+ REnew\nLearn more \u2192\n\nFrito-Lay Transforms California Facility into Showcase for Sustainability\nLearn more \u2192\n\nPepsiCo Issues New $1.25 Billion 10-Year Green Bond As Company Accelerates pep+ Transformation\nLearn more \u2192\n\nIrrigating crops with a water-conserving innovation in Greece\nLearn more \u2192\n\nAn innovative project saving millions of liters of water a year in Mexico\nLearn more \u2192\n\nHow PepsiCo is working to protect water resources around the world\nLearn more \u2192\n\nPepsiCo introduces new packaging goal, doubling down on scaling reusable packaging options\nLearn more \u2192\n\nPepsiCo Europe sets ambition to eliminate virgin fossil-based plastic in all of its crisp and chip bags by the end of the decade\nLearn more \u2192\n\nPepsiCo Beverages North America invests $35 million to help close gap in recycling access through investment in Closed Loop Local Recycling Fund\nLearn more \u2192\n\nWe\u2019re uniting our volunteer efforts to cultivate prosperity in our communities and advance our pep+ journey\nLearn more \u2192\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s Supplier Diversity Program celebrates 40th anniversary and commits to spending more than $400 million annually with Black and Hispanic-owned suppliers\nLearn more \u2192\n\nPepsiCo creates dedicated North America Multicultural Business and Equity Development Organization to accelerate Racial Equality Journey and community efforts across beverage and convenient food businesses\nLearn more \u2192\nPeople throughout the world enjoy PepsiCo products more than one billion times a day, so we have an incredible opportunity to use that scale to inspire consumers to make a positive impact on our planet and communities and to make positive choices within their own lives.\n\nWe are on a mission to create more smiles with every sip and every bite, and we are doing that for our consumers by creating joyful moments through our delicious products and unique brand experiences.\n\nFor example, we are making it easy for consumers to choose the great-tasting beverages and convenient foods they want while working to accelerate the reduction of added sugars in beverages and sodium and saturated fat in convenient foods and offering them a product portfolio with diverse ingredients such as legumes, plant-based proteins and whole grains.\n\nTo meet consumer demand for more sustainable packaging, we continue to innovate on platforms that require little or no single-use packaging, and we offer reuse models in more than 80 markets, including SodaStream, SodaStream Professional, Gatorade Gx, fountain beverage reusable cups, returnable glass and plastic bottles, concentrates and powders. Learn more about our disruptive packaging solutions in Positive Value Chain.1\n\nWe are empowering our consumers to make more informed decisions. We are aiming to equip them with simple and clear information on our packaging and exploring ways to empower them with transparent environmental labeling. We are also rethinking packaging to reduce our carbon footprint and minimize waste to meet consumer demand for more options.\n\nOf critical importance is the role our brands can play in creating a more diverse, equitable and inclusive world. This means addressing inequality in our business partnerships, in our communities and in the workplace. We are combining consumer trends data with a deep empathy and understanding of the cultural nuances of our consumers across the globe; and the diversity of our workforce allows us to connect with the consumer on a personal level and put consumer needs at the center of innovation and marketing.\n\nOur approach to Positive Choices is delivering growth across beverages and convenient foods, and we anticipate that growth will continue to accelerate as we continue to harness the reach and culture-shaping impact of our iconic brands.\n\n1 The Positive Choices innovative packaging solutions section is now included under the packaging section of the pep+ Positive Value Chain pillar alongside all of our packaging goals. This includes goals that were communicated in our 2021 ESG Summary to develop and deploy disruptive sustainable packaging materials and new models for beverages and convenient foods, which is now covered under our new reuse goal introduced in late 2022.\nPositive Choices: Expanded portfolio offerings\n\nWe have enhanced our product portfolio to help build a more sustainable food system by making it easier for consumers to make Positive Choices that are better for people and the planet.\n\nWe continue to expand our portfolio offerings in an effort to meet our goals and to continue providing consumers with the products they want through a combination of reformulation, new product innovations and the acquisition of new brands.\n\nWe are also improving the nutritional profile of our convenient food products by including diverse ingredients that help consumers meet dietary recommendations for key food groups such as legumes, whole grains, plant-based proteins, fruits and vegetables, and nuts and seeds.\n\nBy displaying clear and prominent labeling on our product packaging, we are making it easy to understand the nutritional content of our beverages and convenient foods, empowering consumers to make informed, positive choices.\n\nOur portfolio advancements\nExpanded portfolio options through Positive Choices\n\n- **Quaker Puffed Granola**\n  - Satisfying blend of delicious ingredients including whole grain oats and whole grain rice puffs\n  - At least 36g whole grains per serving\n  - 1g of saturated fat per serving\n  - Less than 100mg of sodium per serving\n  - No artificial flavors\n\n- **SunChips Black Bean**\n  - Made with whole grains and real black beans\n  - 3g of fiber and 14g of whole grains per serving\n  - 0.5g of saturated fat per serving\n  - No artificial flavors, no preservatives\n\n- **Quaker Cruesli Zero Sugar**\n  - New product launched in Belgium and the Netherlands with no added sugars or sweeteners\n  - Rich in fiber\n  - No added sugars, no added sweeteners\n  - No artificial flavors, colors or preservatives\nPositive Choices: Expanded portfolio offerings\n\nApproach\n\nWe continue to innovate and expand our portfolio with products that provide more nutritional benefits.

To provide consumers with a range of positive choices that prioritize better nutrition and to help consumers make more informed decisions about the environmental impact of their purchase, we aim to provide clear information on our packaging. We are working toward a consistent approach to nutritional labeling to help consumers make conscious, informed choices throughout the world.\nPositive Choices: Expanded portfolio offerings\n\nGoals & progress\n\nExpand our portfolio to provide more consumer choices with products that are better for the planet, as well as people.\n\nBalancing the nutritional profile of our portfolio has been a focus of ours for many years, and we are proud of the progress we have made to reduce added sugars in beverages and sodium and saturated fat in convenient foods, all while maintaining the great tastes our consumers love.\n\nIn 2022, as in the prior year, 75% of our convenient foods portfolio volume did not exceed 1.1g of saturated fat per 100 Calories \u2013 a goal we achieved ahead of schedule in 2021.

That is why we are building purpose into our brands and using their power to inspire consumer action toward a better future for the planet and people.\n\nWe hope to educate consumers about the impacts of their buying choices and empower them with clear environmental labeling on our products. We remain committed to investing in the communities in which we operate and want to leverage the power of our many iconic brands to help promote a more diverse, equitable and inclusive world.\n\nApproach\n\nAt PepsiCo, people come first, which is why we strive to address our consumers\u2019 needs and empower them with information that can help them make better choices.
