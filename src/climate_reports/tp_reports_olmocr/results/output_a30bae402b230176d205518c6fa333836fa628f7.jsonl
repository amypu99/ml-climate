Actual production model will vary. Model Year 2024 Blazer EV SS shown available Fall 2023.\nA Message\nFrom Mary Barra,\nChair and Chief\nExecutive Officer\n\nWhen General Motors began the journey to an electric and autonomous future, our mission was to help create a better and safer future for all, guided by our vision of zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion.\n\nChoice is important to our customers and they will see more than a dozen new EVs from our brands, including the Chevrolet Silverado, Blazer and Equinox EVs; Buick Electra E5 in China; and the first of our Cadillac CELESTIQ bespoke sedans, to name just a few. These distinctive and stylish vehicles join Ultium EVs already in their hands, like the GMC HUMMER EV, Cadillac LYRIQ and BrightDrop Zevo 600.\n\nThis industry-leading portfolio provides a wide variety of options for customers with a wide variety of needs. This is part of why 2023 will be a breakout year for GM.\n\nJust as importantly, it means we will be in the most high-volume vehicle segments where we\u2019ll make the biggest impact and, in the case of the Equinox EV, with incredible affordability.\n\nWe are on track to produce 400,000 EVs in North America by mid-2024 and have built production capacity for 1 million units in North America in 2025\u2014and we\u2019ll continue scaling from there.\n\nWe know EV customers want the freedom and confidence they can travel anywhere, anytime. That\u2019s why we are investing nearly $750 million in home, workplace and public charging that will include more than 5,000 DC fast chargers in major metropolitan areas and along America\u2019s highways. We are also working with our dealers to install 40,000 Level 2 charging stations in communities across the United States and Canada.\n\nTo support this massive shift, we are working with our partners and suppliers to help secure a localized and sustainable supply chain, including three announced joint venture battery cell plants in the United States. Our first plant, in Ohio, is producing cells now, and a second plant in Tennessee will be operating by the end of the year. These facilities are creating exciting new jobs in our communities and supporting our EV acceleration.\n\nWe remain committed to eliminating tailpipe emissions from new U.S. light-duty vehicles by 2035. Last year, we went even further, securing enough renewable energy to power our U.S. facilities by 2025\u201425 years earlier than we originally shared. It\u2019s a huge step toward making our business carbon neutral by 2040.\n\nAt Cruise, the team will expand on last year\u2019s incredible progress as it continues to safely expand ride hail and related deliveries to more cities, and launch the Cruise Origin.\n\nThe brighter, more inclusive future we envision goes beyond our own walls. Last year, generous employees volunteered more than 158,000 hours in their communities and donated more than $5 million to causes that stir their passions. GM provided another $60 million to more than 400 U.S.-based nonprofits in education, road safety, community enrichment and climate initiatives.\n\nI invite you to learn more about what we are doing in this report, which follows established GRI Standards that comparably and credibly measure and assess our impact in several areas.\n\nI am proud to lead GM\u2019s talented and innovative team, intent on positively changing the world. Our commitments and investments reflect our sense of urgency to transform our vision into reality.\n\nMary T. Barra\nChair and Chief Executive Officer\nA Message from Kristen Siemen, Chief Sustainability Officer\n\nOur journey to a more sustainable, electric future has never been more important than it is today. We know climate change is an urgent priority, and we are advancing toward our bold goal to be carbon neutral in our global products and operations by 2040 so that we can be a part of the solution.\n\nAs chief sustainability officer, my priority has been to ensure our sustainability strategy connects to our business strategy\u2014one that is focused on putting everyone in an EV. We know that it will take millions of new EVs hitting the road every year to reach the zero-emissions future we\u2019re striving for, and we\u2019re moving faster than ever.\n\nGM is pursuing multiple aspects of what it takes to help put more people in EVs. We are rapidly building out our own battery, software, manufacturing and customer experience capabilities to make that a reality, while also laying the critical foundations for customer EV education and EV charging infrastructure.\n\nAt the same time, we\u2019re moving forward with our investments in renewable energy. In 2022, we announced that we\u2019ve secured 100% of the renewable electricity needed to power our sites in the United States by 2025 and we continue to work toward our plan to secure enough renewable electricity to do so globally by 2035. Additionally, we joined the First Movers Coalition through commitments to low-carbon concrete, cement, aluminum and steel, signaling a firm market demand for a net-zero transition and our dedication to a more resilient and sustainable supply chain.\n\nWe\u2019ve also prioritized developing a more resilient and sustainable supply chain for EV battery raw materials, and developing a battery recycling strategy that can grow with us. Through collaborations with global and domestic partners, we have secured sources for enough battery raw materials to meet our 2025 goal of having 1 million units of annual EV capacity in North America.\n\nThese are just a few of the many important steps we have taken in the last year to advance our business goals and our sustainability journey. Our sustainability strategy is woven into our business strategy and both are focused on providing growth and long-term value.\n\nThough I am confident that we will reach our most ambitious goals, I recognize that we cannot, and will not, achieve them alone. That\u2019s why we\u2019re continuing to pursue collaborative opportunities with stakeholders across the globe, including suppliers, dealers, policymakers, climate thought leaders and others. In fact, we have invited all Tier I suppliers to sign our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Partnership Pledge to embrace sustainability in a holistic manner, focusing on ESG practices.\n\nA shift this massive truly requires everybody in, working together toward a single goal\u2014an all-electric future.\n\nAs we implement our sustainability strategy, we have an opportunity\u2014and an obligation\u2014to create a better future. The pursuit of a safe and sustainable world is a passionate movement within GM; one that\u2019s gaining momentum as our technologies reveal their increasingly profound potential. As a leader, engineer and mom, I am here to help break down barriers and advance our plans toward creating a world with zero emissions for generations to come.\n\nWe will continue along this journey, recognizing that it is on us to lead positive change and implement inclusive solutions that bring everyone along. Our sights are set on continuing to excite and inspire people about the road ahead and we know that our culture, strong values, robust strategies and proven execution will allow us to accelerate toward our vision of a more sustainable, electric future together.\n\nKristen Siemen\nVice President Sustainable Workplaces & Chief Sustainability Officer\n2022 Report Highlights\n\nAgreements in place to power\n\n100% of our electricity for our U.S. sites from renewable sources by 2025\u201325 years ahead of our initial target of 2050.\n\nOpened our first\n\nUltium Cells\n\nbattery cell plant in Ohio, with a second plant opening in Tennessee in 2023 and a third in Michigan in 2024.\n\nProvided\n\n$60M in grants to more than 400 U.S.-based nonprofits to help create inclusive solutions to social issues.\n\nJoined the\n\nFirst Movers Coalition\n\nthrough commitments to low-carbon steel, aluminum, concrete and cement, signaling a firm market demand for a net-zero transition.\n\nPublished our\n\nfirst disclosures\n\nfor the Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber (GPSNR) and Corporate Human Rights Benchmark (CHRB). In the 2022 CHRB, GM was placed in the top 10 out of 127 companies across three industries.\n\nSecured all EV battery raw materials for\n\n1M units of North American capacity in 2025. Signed a number of agreements to build a more sustainable and resilient North America and free-trade-focused supply chain, including with Lithium Americas for lithium from the United States and POSCO for cathode-active material from Qu\u00e9bec.\n\nCruise became the first\n\npaid driverless ride-hailing service\n\nin a major U.S. city when it launched in San Francisco, followed by commercial expansion into the Phoenix area and Austin.\n\n3 Based on estimated forecasted global renewable energy sourced through currently executed agreements, subject to change depending on actual future electric usage in operations and actual future renewable generation.\n## Awards and Recognition\n\n| Received the ENERGY STAR Sustained Excellence Award for the 11th straight year | Listed in the DiversityInc Top 50 Companies for Diversity for the seventh successive year, ranking #36\u2014two places up from 2021 | Ranked #18 in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Green Power Partnership list | Won the Environmental Initiatives Award at the SEAL Business Sustainability Awards |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Won the Sustainability Leadership Award from the Business Intelligence Group | Named as the only original equipment manufacturer (OEM) automaker on Ethisphere's World\u2019s Most Ethical Companies\u00ae list for the fourth year in a row | Received an A- on the CDP Climate Change and Water Security questionnaires | Ranked 1st in the Automobiles & Parts industry sector in the 2023 JUST 100 rankings |\n| Named on Fast Company\u2019s 2022 Brands That Matter list, which recognizes organizations leading on social action, sustainability and inclusivity | Ranked as a leading OEM in North America in S&P\u2019s Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI), and listed in the 2022 Yearbook | | |\nOur Sustainability Strategy\n\nOur sustainability strategy supports our vision of an all-electric future, our carbon neutral goal and our growth strategy, which we believe can lead to greater revenue and margins.\n\nIn This Section\n\nThe External Landscape 8\nOur Sustainability Journey 9\nHow GM Creates Value 11\nAssessing Priorities 12\nProgress Toward Our Goals 14\nOur Priorities 15\n\n\u201cOur world is evolving in dynamic, complex and unexpected ways. To remain at the forefront of innovation, we must understand the future, embrace it and incorporate it into everything we do.\u201d\n\nKatura Brown\nGlobal Foresight & Trends Manager\nOur sustainability strategy continues to evolve, informed by a range of external environmental, social and regulatory trends and pressures.\n\n**Vehicle Regulations**\n\nLegislation on vehicle emissions, fuel economy and safety is evolving, with varying standards being introduced at a local, regional and national level. GM and the Environmental Defense Fund have together recommended principles to guide the next generation of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) vehicle emissions standards for Model Year 2027 and beyond. Focused on the shared vision of a zero-emissions, all-electric future, the proposals outline a challenging yet achievable framework that accelerates EV adoption and supports underserved and socially vulnerable communities.\n\n**Supply Chain Constraints**\n\nAs our business shifts toward EVs, we face new sourcing challenges related to the limited availability of certain key minerals. Additionally, certain key mineral supply chains are at a high risk for environmental and human rights concerns. We are exploring ways to create a North-America-focused supply chain, as well as ways to reuse and recycle battery materials to reduce the need for mining. We have made investments to contractually secure all battery raw materials to support our goal of 1 million units of EV capacity in North America in 2025. These include a long-term supply agreement with Livent, which will see the processing of battery-grade lithium hydroxide move from South America to North America. We also continue to conduct responsible sourcing audits and engage with our supply base, inviting Tier I suppliers to sign our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Partnership Pledge, with a focus on carbon emissions, labor and human rights, ethics and sustainable procurement.\n\n**Climate Change**\n\nExtreme weather events are increasing in frequency and severity, which can potentially impact local communities, the supply of raw materials and components, and vehicle production. In light of these changes, we continue to explore ways to reduce the carbon emissions of our operations and products, and take steps to increase the resilience of our business and our supply chain. Our facilities also depend on consistent water availability and quality, both of which are threatened by the effects of climate change. We are investigating and implementing water-conservation projects, both in water-scarce locations and those where future availability concerns are forecasted.\n\n**Bringing Everyone Along**\n\nWe understand that climate change does not impact every community equally. Moving society toward an all-electric future is a major undertaking that risks leaving some communities behind. In an attempt to bring everyone along on the journey, we continue to retrain and upskill our workforce so that they can make a successful transition. We also doubled our initial $25 million commitment to invest in our Climate Fund, made in 2021, to $50 million, to help support the future of work and increase access to EVs and charging infrastructure. Making capital investments and supporting philanthropic ventures in these areas will help support the transition to EVs and other sustainable technologies.\n\n**Lower-Carbon Transportation**\n\nIn support of our vision of zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion, we are making EVs more affordable and accessible, and developing tools and services that simplify the EV ownership process. We have also started to make mobility more accessible by commercializing zero-emissions driverless ride-hailing through Cruise, and last-mile delivery solutions through BrightDrop, in line with consumer and commercial demand for more sustainable transportation.\nIn change, we see opportunity. It is our chance to lead; to provide the vehicles of tomorrow that we believe our customers are looking for today; to use our expertise, scale and experience to help solve some of society\u2019s greatest challenges.\n\nGrowing Through Innovation\nAt GM, we are always innovating. From pioneering the first electric starter to assisting drivers in emergencies with OnStar through our advanced software technologies, GM has always pushed the limits of engineering. Today, with Ultium as a driving force, we are enabling our EV strategy and our vision of zero emissions.\n\nTaking Environmental Action\nWe have ambitious climate goals and we are committed to achieving them. To reach our goal of carbon neutrality in global products and operations by 2040, we will continue to prioritize creating a broad portfolio of EVs and enhancing the sustainability of our supply chain. We cannot do it alone, but we will lead based on our strengths.\n\nEverybody In\nOur role at GM is not just to direct our own company\u2019s transformation; it is also to bring everybody in on the journey to a safer, all-electric future, including our workforce and the communities in which we live and work. We are on a path to prove that technology and collaboration, driven by purpose, can help change the world.\n\nDriving Responsible Governance\nLeading with integrity is an essential part of working toward an all-electric future that is better for people and the environment. As GM drives impactful change by bringing EVs, mobility and connectivity to the next level, we have processes and policies in place to help guide responsible, ethical action.\n\nAt GM, we are transforming the way we do things\u2014from the materials we source and the way we manufacture to the products we deliver\u2014and making progress toward our sustainability goals.\nInvesting in an Electric Future\n\nWe plan to make a number of strategic investments to help us progress toward our vision of a more sustainable future. These include:\n\n\u2022 Announced investments of $11.7 billion across 14 sites in North America to support EV manufacturing\n\u2022 Anticipated total annual capital spending and investments in battery cell manufacturing joint ventures of $11\u2013$13 billion through 2025\n\u2022 Planned investments of nearly $750 million in home, workplace and public charging infrastructure in the United States and Canada\n\u2022 Signed agreements to build a more sustainable and resilient supply chain focused on North America and free trade partners, including a $650 million equity investment and supply agreement with Lithium Americas to develop the Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada\n\nSustainable Finance Framework\n\nWe have created a Sustainable Finance Framework to further align our financing activities with our sustainability strategy and commitments, thereby bringing us closer to achieving our vision.\n\nProceeds from future issuances under the framework may be used to fund projects supporting clean transportation or socioeconomic advancement and empowerment.\n\nUnder this framework, we issued $2.25 billion of investment-grade green bonds, our first capital markets activity that specifically supports our EV strategy. Our first Sustainable Finance Report will be published later in 2023 and will discuss the allocation of proceeds and certain estimated impacts of investments from our inaugural green bond issuance.\n\n\u201cThe overlap of my personal purpose and the company\u2019s purpose is the reason I love what I do. We make innovations come to life and impact people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nMohammad Ehaab\nManager, Innovation 2\n\n$2.25B of investment-grade green bonds issued pursuant to our Sustainable Finance Framework\nHow GM Creates Value\n\n2022 Value Creation Model\n\nOur Purpose is the foundation for creating long-term value for all our stakeholders.

This helps us understand the topics that are most relevant to them and to our business, and that offer the greatest opportunity for GM to create shared value.\n\nWe performed our most recent Sustainability Priority Assessment in 2021, and plan to conduct similar assessments every two years, taking emerging sustainability issues, global events and other trends into consideration.\n\nIn collaboration with a third party, we undertook a four-part process aligned with the GRI materiality principle for sustainability reporting.\n\nOur Four-Part Process\n\n1. Identify sustainability topics relevant to GM and the automotive industry\n\n2. Understand stakeholder perspectives\n   - Survey GM employees\n   - Interview internal and external stakeholders\n   - Regularly engage with our shareholders\n\n3. Score and prioritize the topics based on quantitative and qualitative inputs\n\n4. Develop a tiered priority matrix (see page 13)\nThemes and Perspectives\n\nThe placing of priorities into three categories reflects the range of different stakeholder perspectives. The 2021 assessment identified six topics as \u201chighest priority\u201d and therefore urgent for the company to manage. Some topics were not deemed as urgent because stakeholders and management view them as a GM strength today. For example, we have been working on operational waste, water and energy since 2010 and have robust management systems with a track record of good performance in these areas. Other \u201cpriorities\u201d are seen more as emerging issues that could grow in importance over time.\n\nThrough both the qualitative and quantitative inputs, several stakeholder themes emerged:\n\n\u2022 The safety of employees and vehicles remains a top priority and a strength for GM.\n\n\u2022 A changing employee and customer landscape calls for GM to focus on a transition to an all-electric future that brings everyone along.\n\n\u2022 Both internal and external stakeholders support the company\u2019s vision of a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion.\n\n\u2022 There is an imperative for standardizing the EV ecosystem, underscoring priorities such as product GHG emissions and EV infrastructure.\n\n\u2022 Responsible innovation should occur across the value chain as new advanced technologies create business opportunities.\nProgress Toward Our Goals\n\nWe are on track to meet our sustainability goals and are proud of the progress we are making. The below graphs show the progress we have made toward our sustainability goals to date.\n\n- **53% of our goal**\n  - Reducing Scope 1 and 2 operations emissions by 72% by 2035 against a 2018 baseline\n\n- **5% of our goal**\n  - Reducing energy intensity in our operations by 35% by 2035 against a 2010 baseline\n\n- **55% of our goal**\n  - Power 100% of our electricity for our U.S. sites from renewable sources by 2025\n\n- **11% of our goal**\n  - Reducing Scope 3 GHG emissions from the use of sold products of light-duty vehicles by 51% per vehicle kilometer by 2035 against a 2018 baseline\n\n- **2% of our goal**\n  - Eliminating tailpipe emissions from new U.S. light-duty vehicles by 2035\n\n- **30% of our goal**\n  - Reducing water intensity by 35% by 2035 against a 2010 baseline\n\n- **100% of our goal**\n  - Diverting more than 90% of our total operational waste from landfills, incinerators and energy recovery facilities by 2025\n\nWe plan to achieve these goals by improving the efficiency of our operations and increasing our use of renewable power for electricity. Energy intensity consists of base energy used and variable energy (production volume). With the investments in new plants and retooling of plants for EV production, there will be several opportunities to improve the energy intensity of our operations. One challenge in achieving these goals is finding alternatives to natural gas for the paint ovens in our plants, and heating our manufacturing and nonmanufacturing facilities.\n\n**Operational Energy Efficiency**\n\nAlthough we now have the agreements in place to meet our goal to source 100% of our electricity for all our U.S. sites from renewable energy by 2025, we will continue to support the growth of renewable power generation through direct investments, on-site power generation, green tariffs and power purchase agreements.\n\n**The Transition to Renewable Energy**\n\nWe remain focused on accelerating the transition from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and offering EVs across a range of price points and segments. We are on track to produce 400,000 EVs in North America by mid-2024 and have contractually secured all battery raw materials to support our goal of having 1 million units of EV capacity in North America in 2025. Our investments in EV and battery cell manufacturing will allow us to rapidly scale our EV production footprint, leading to tangible progress toward this goal.\n\n**An All-Electric Future**\n\n**Transforming Our Manufacturing Footprint**\n\nWe will achieve this goal by addressing our highest water consumption areas, which include our paint shops and cooling towers. We will design water-saving measures into new processes and retrofit existing technology during facility upgrades.\n\n**Water**\n\nThe waste program covers solid, containerized and hazardous waste generated by our operations. These efforts drive innovations that provide the greatest benefit to the environment.\n\n**Waste**\n\n---\n\n12 Based on estimated forecasted global renewable energy sourced through currently executed agreements, subject to change depending on actual future electric usage in operations and actual future renewable generation.\nOur Priorities\n\nThe topic areas in this report reflect the priorities identified through our Sustainability Priority Assessment.

affordability and profitability. Our innovations around electrification and mobility include electric vehicles (EVs) and charging infrastructure, self-driving ride-hailing services and low-carbon delivery vehicles. This is the future and we are leading the charge.\n\nIn This Section\n\nAdvancing Electrification and Autonomy 18\nPutting Customers First 27\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen many changes over my two decades with GM. I\u2019ve seen the plant transform to manufacture EVs, and what our future looks like with electric truck assembly. Adapting to change, and ultimately innovation, is key to our success.\u201d\n\nWilfredo Romero\nBody Shop Team Member\nAdvancing Electrification and Autonomy\n\nOur transition to EVs and autonomous vehicles (AVs) is a critical part of our growth strategy. As we continue on this journey, we remain committed to developing the technology and infrastructure for a safer, cleaner tomorrow.\n\nAccelerating Our EV Momentum\n\nAs we prepare for an all-electric future, we continue to expand our portfolio across several segments, including affordable and accessible EVs, luxury models and software-defined vehicles, with a focus on building trust and understanding among our customers. This involves:\n\n\u2022 Rolling out a comprehensive portfolio of EVs\n\u2022 Building a robust charging network\n\u2022 Integrating autonomy, ride-hailing and electrification into a single vehicle\n\u2022 Creating new electric delivery solutions\n\nIn the next three years, GM plans to move aggressively toward EV leadership as EV adoption is expected to approach 20% of U.S. industry sales in 2025. By then, we will have EVs in one-third of vehicle segments, representing nearly 70% of the U.S. industry by volume, and we will continue to grow from there. To achieve this, we are planning to rapidly scale our annual capacity to 1 million EVs for North America and more than 2 million EVs globally in 2025.\n\nUntil now, we have focused on building platforms including Ultium and Ultifi. The next phase of our strategy, which we anticipate running until 2025, will see rapid growth in volume on these platforms, which will provide the scale necessary to significantly bring down costs. In the third phase, we expect to see even more volume and margin growth, as well as contributions from our high-margin software businesses.\n\nLeveraging the Ultium Platform\n\nWe have more than 100 years of manufacturing expertise and over a decade of advanced lithium-ion battery research and development behind us. Our EV strategy is built on a flexible global platform, which centers on the Ultium propulsion architecture.\n\nCrucially, Ultium is not constrained by any one chemistry or even cell form factor, which will become even more important as we grow our EV lineup. We use energy-dense, NCMA (nickel, cobalt, manganese, aluminum) pouch cells in the United States, which are currently produced by Ultium Cells Holdings LLC, an equally owned joint venture with LG Energy Solution. In China, our Ultium vehicles\u2014using the same packs and modules\u2014are powered by nickel-rich and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells that are better suited to the needs of the local market.\n\nBy managing the early stages of our supply chain through vertical integration, we are planning to accelerate the production of our technology while reducing costs. Read about our relationships with key suppliers to secure critical materials for our batteries and learn more about how we refurbish, recycle or reuse the batteries returned to us.\n\nRecovering Waste Energy From EV Batteries\n\nIn 2022, we announced a patented heat pump that recovers waste energy from EV batteries to power heating and propulsion, while providing up to 10% more range. Ultium\u2019s energy recovery technology reduces the need to power heating and other functions from energy stored in the battery, potentially allowing more power and range than vehicles with similarly sized batteries without such capabilities. With its active heating capabilities, Ultium vehicles can also potentially charge more efficiently by warming up the batteries before charging.\n\nHydrogen Fuel Cells: The Potential to Electrify Everything\n\nGM\u2019s hydrogen fuel cell technology, HYDROTEC, allows us to extend electrification technologies to more industries and a broader range of applications, from transportation to mobile power generation. Fuel cell-enabled mobile power generation can help users provide fast charging at remote worksites and outdoor events, and can also deliver backup electricity during disruptions.\n\nOur focus on transportation modes includes work to make medium- and heavy-duty trucks more efficient while reducing carbon emissions. We are collaborating with the U.S. Department of Energy on its SuperTruck 3 program, supported by a $26 million grant that we will match over a five-year period.\n\n13 Actual range will vary based on several factors including temperature, terrain, battery age, loading, use and maintenance.\nPure Watercraft\n\nGM acquired a 25% ownership stake in Pure Watercraft, a Seattle-based company that specializes in all-electric boating solutions. The collaboration advances a shared vision to expand zero-emissions mobility and reflects the holistic approach necessary for widespread EV adoption.\n\nThe Pure Outboard from Pure Watercraft uses groundbreaking efficiency to benefit a boat\u2019s performance while reducing environmental pollution. It also boasts much lower operating costs and maintenance than traditional marine propulsion systems.\n\nGoing Beyond GM Vehicles\n\nThe modular and flexible nature of our Ultium and HYDROTEC technologies means they could pave the way for a range of zero-emission products beyond our own vehicles.\n\n\u2022 GM is utilizing its Ultium platform to develop electrification solutions for many non-automotive applications, including airport ground support, personal all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), industrial equipment, delivery vehicles and farm equipment.\n\n\u2022 GM and Wabtec Corporation are developing battery technology for Wabtec locomotives for orders from Class 1 and international railroad operators, and are exploring concepts for hydrogen fuel cell-powered locomotives.\n\n\u2022 GM and Liebherr Aerospace are exploring how hydrogen fuel cells could provide auxiliary electrical power in commercial aircraft.\n\n\u2022 With Lockheed Martin, GM is co-developing a Lunar Mobility Vehicle for exploring the lunar surface.\n\n\u2022 We have entered a new joint development agreement with Nel Hydrogen U.S., a subsidiary of Nel ASA, to help accelerate the industrialization of its proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer platform, to enable more cost-competitive sources of renewable hydrogen.\n\n\u201cMy job means moving the world, literally and figuratively, in the direction of zero emissions. I see a world with a bright future, based on the technologies we are commercializing.\u201d\n\nAnil Bika\nEngineering & Business Operations Manager \u2013 Global HYDROTEC, BEV2, Innovation & Defense\n\n\u201cGM\u2019s stake in Pure Watercraft represents another exciting opportunity to extend zero-emissions transportation beyond automotive applications. Building upon GM\u2019s existing efforts to strategically deploy our technology across the rail, truck and aerospace industries, our combined expertise should result in future zero-emissions marine product offerings, providing consumers with more choice.\u201d\n\nDan Nicholson\nVice President, Strategic Technology Initiatives\nGM Defense\n\nWith defense and government markets moving toward electric, autonomous and connected fleets, GM Defense LLC\u2014a wholly owned subsidiary of GM\u2014is helping lead this major transformation. GM Defense is leveraging GM\u2019s world-class manufacturing capabilities and global supply chain, to deliver customized solutions for global defense and government customers.

Plug and Charge will eventually extend across all compatible DC fast-charging stations on the Ultium Charge 360 network.\n26 Availability of these initiatives and tools may vary across the regions/countries that GM operates in.\nSuper Cruise and Ultra Cruise: Advanced Driver Assistance Systems\n\nAt GM, we are focused on safely deploying our advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), like Super Cruise and soon, Ultra Cruise. These hands-free technologies are an important step in our journey toward our vision of a world with zero crashes and zero congestion.\n\n- Super Cruise is the industry\u2019s first true hands-free advanced driver assistance technology. In 2022, we announced a doubling of the Super Cruise road network to more than 400,000 miles of compatible highways in the United States and Canada on select vehicles.\n\n- Ultra Cruise will offer a destination-to-destination hands-free driving experience, designed to enable hands-free driving in 95% of all driving scenarios.\n\nAt the end of 2022, GM customers had driven more than 50 million miles with Super Cruise engaged and the feature will be available on 22 GM vehicles globally by the end of 2023. Ultra Cruise will later be available on certain premium entries. Together, these technologies will bring ADAS to more customers on more vehicles, in more regions at more price points, playing an important role in GM\u2019s comprehensive path to autonomous mobility.\n\nCruise: Autonomous Vehicle Commercialization and Rapid Scaling\n\nWith Cruise, our majority-owned autonomous vehicle (AV) technology startup, we are unlocking the full potential of self-driving technology. Cruise has been developing automated driving system (ADS) technology with safety front of mind since the company was founded in 2013. After its 2016 acquisition by GM, Cruise has continued developing and commercializing its self-driving ride hail and associated delivery services with zero tailpipe emissions.\n\nOver the past four years, Cruise has been operating a fleet of fully integrated AVs in the complex driving environment of San Francisco. Initially, they all operated with a human backup driver before advancing to fully driverless operations with passengers onboard. Cruise became the first company to operate a commercial, driverless ride hail service in a major U.S. city in June 2022, and has since completed thousands of paid driverless rides. Cruise has continued to expand the service\u2019s area of coverage and hours of operation in San Francisco and in late 2022 also launched in Austin, Texas, and Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nCruise is also expanding its collaboration with Walmart by building upon its initial grocery delivery pilot first launched in Scottsdale, Arizona. Local Walmart customers can now opt-in to autonomous deliveries and track their orders through a Cruise web app. This pilot completed more than 22,000 autonomous deliveries through the end of 2022, and is now being expanded to eight stores in the Phoenix area.\n\n\u201cAs a GM designer responsible for Super Cruise and Ultra Cruise radars, I get to create solutions that are changing the way we move and think about transportation. I am excited about the future and being part of it.\u201d\n\nJay Jones\nSenior Engineering Designer\n\n---\n\n27 Always pay attention while driving and when using Super Cruise.

Cruise began this work at the height of the pandemic, in response to the needs of local partners at San Francisco-Marin Food Bank and SF New Deal. It has pledged to dedicate at least 1% of its all-electric fleet to help meet local community needs, everywhere it operates.\n\nCruise Origin\n\nEncouraging passengers to ride together in shared electric vehicles has the potential to reduce urban congestion and pollution, serve more people and reduce fares. That\u2019s why GM has developed the Cruise Origin in a collaboration with Cruise and Honda.\n\nThis self-driving vehicle operates without a steering wheel, brake or accelerator pedals, allowing more space for passengers, luggage or goods. With a focus on accessibility and sustainability, some of the benefits of Cruise\u2019s fleet and operations include being all-electric and designed to not only reduce congestion but also increase access to transportation for those facing barriers to mobility.\n\nBrightDrop: Decarbonizing Last-Mile Deliveries\n\nWith the rapid growth in e-commerce putting more delivery vehicles on the road, logistics companies are looking for ways to meet consumer demand while reducing carbon emissions and congestion. At GM, electrifying our last-mile delivery fleet offerings is an important part of our carbon neutral ambition.\n\nOur solution is BrightDrop, a wholly owned subsidiary currently operating in the United States and Canada that primarily serves two markets: last-mile package deliveries and online grocery deliveries. Both grew quickly during the pandemic and are expected to maintain double-digit growth rates throughout the decade. BrightDrop aims to help businesses lower costs, maximize productivity, improve employee safety and increase freight security with a portfolio of electric delivery vans and smart, purpose-built electrically propelled carts, as well as the BrightDrop Core software platform.\n\nIn 2021, BrightDrop launched the BrightDrop Zevo 600 all-electric light commercial vehicle (eLCV) and the BrightDrop Trace eCart, which helps couriers take goods the last step to the customer. The smaller BrightDrop Zevo 400 was also announced.\n\nIn 2022, we launched the BrightDrop Trace Grocery, an eCart designed to help streamline order fulfillment and pickup for online grocery purchases. The BrightDrop Trace Grocery eCart is expected to be fully available in 2024.\n\nOur CAMI Assembly plant in Ontario, Canada, commenced full production of the BrightDrop Zevo 600 in 2023, and will scale up total Zevo production to a projected 50,000 units a year by 2025. With the speed to market and the levels of customer demand (see right), BrightDrop is on track to generate approximately $1 billion in revenue in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe are developing relationships with those that can help us expand our ecosystem of last-mile delivery solutions. For example, one such collaboration with Nauto offers an event-based safety system enabling better fleet management for our customers.\u201d\n\nRobert Tiderington\nHead of Strategic Partnerships, BrightDrop\n\nThe BrightDrop Zevo 600 received an honorable mention in Fast Company\u2019s 2022 Innovation by Design Awards\n\nDriving the BrightDrop Zevo 600, BrightDrop\u2019s Stephen Marlin set the Guinness World Record for the longest distance traveled by an electric van on a single charge (nearly 260 miles from Manhattan to Washington D.C.) in April 2022\n\nBrightDrop Customers\n\nFedEx Express\nReserved priority production for at least 2,000 electric delivery vans over the next few years, adding to an initial reservation of 500 BrightDrop EVs announced in 2021\n\nDHL Express Canada\nPlans to add BrightDrop Zevo electric delivery vans to its fleet in 2023, and is currently piloting BrightDrop Trace eCarts and software platform\n\nHertz\nPlans to order up to 175,000 EVs, including BrightDrop vehicles, over the next five years\n\nMerchants Fleet\nReserved 18,000 units (BrightDrop Zevo 600 and BrightDrop Zevo 400)\n\nWalmart\nReserved 5,000 (BrightDrop Zevo 600 and BrightDrop Zevo 400) electric delivery vans to support the retail giant\u2019s growing last-mile delivery network and goal of operating a zero-emissions logistics fleet by 2040\n\nKroger\nScheduled to add the BrightDrop Trace Grocery to its e-commerce operations\nPutting Customers First\n\nCustomers are at the center of GM\u2019s growth strategy. We deliver on that by producing high-quality, easy-to-use products, while offering an excellent customer experience.\n\nA Relentless Focus on Customer Experience\n\nThe people who drive our vehicles are an extension of the GM family.

We are committed to designing new and innovative solutions, including software-enabled services and features that allow us to continue enhancing the total vehicle ownership experience over time.\n\nBy delivering excellence in every interaction, even in everyday moments, we can keep customers returning to GM.\n\nListening to Our Customers\n\nOne of the best ways to deliver exceptional experiences is to listen to customers. GM\u2019s Voice of Customer platform pulls in millions of comments from across all our communication channels, including phone calls, emails, social media posts and dealership surveys. Once aggregated and anonymized, we use these insights to proactively support customers, focus our efforts where we can have the biggest impact and inform the development of future products, features and services.\n\nMobile App\n\nMeeting connected vehicle owners wherever they are on their digital journey is key to delivering an exceptional GM ownership experience. In fact, GM owners who use our vehicle brand mobile apps show a significantly higher recommendation rate than owners who do not. As we continue to adapt to customer expectations and preferences, select OnStar safety and digital services, including remote access enabled in the mobile app, will now be offered on most vehicles in the United States and Canada for three years, with the initial vehicle purchase. We are working to broaden our standard connected features to other markets.\n\nAdditionally, we continue to listen to the needs of our customers and have redesigned the in-app \u201chelp\u201d experience. This new functionality will include live chat, links to web support content and quick-start guides, which will make learning about and owning a new GM vehicle even easier. Recently, the GM mobile app team was recognized by Michigan\u2019s Association of Customer Experience Professionals for \u201cCustomer Feedback & Continuous Improvement\u201d during the Industry Best Practices Award program.\n\nBuilding for the Future\n\nThe future is digital and we are reimagining experiences that can support this future. Our strategy is to create experiences that are both Digitally Human and Deliberately Human: digital experiences that are as easy and intuitive as interacting with a human, while preserving and enhancing interactions with people (dealers or advisors) in moments that have the most impact. We are determined to lead the future of the automotive customer experience as we create a first-class digital experience and continue to drive innovation to make the customer journey more convenient, simple, seamless and informative.\n\nQuality Assurance\n\nOur quality policies and culture of continuous improvement inform our customers\u2019 product experience.\n\nGM\u2019s Quality Policy states that: \u201cGM will be Quality Leaders in every market and every segment in which we compete through effective execution of all applicable requirements and through continual improvement.\u201d\n\nGlobally, we have achieved, and sustained, certification to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001:2015 standard at all of our manufacturing facilities where required by region or country. As of the end of 2022, 52 operations had completed certification. We intend to maintain ISO compliance by adapting our processes to meet any modifications to the standard.\n\nWe have nine component plants that are certified to the International Automotive Task Force (IATF) 16949 standards. Our Global Manufacturing System incorporates all IATF requirements, guiding the quality aspects of our business and, in some cases, driving more rigorous standards than external ones. As a result, GM brands and products regularly perform well in the leading product quality, reliability, vehicle safety and consumer satisfaction studies.\n\nRead more about Vehicle Safety and Quality.\nExternal Recognition\n\nWe measure the quality and dependability of our vehicles, as well as customer satisfaction with our vehicles, sales and dealership service, through the following studies run by J.D.

We continue to invest in energy-efficiency projects around the world as we look to reduce energy consumption and drive energy efficiency. As global production volume stabilizes, we expect to see improved energy intensity that aligns with our long-term goals.\n\nEnergy-Saving Programs and Initiatives\n\nOur approach to improve the sustainability of our operations includes aligning our business strategy with aggressive environmental goals and energy reduction targets, collecting accurate data and publicly reporting progress against those targets. We continue to use an energy metering tool to monitor and reduce the use of our heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment.\n\nU.S. Department of Energy (DOE)\n\nTo assess and improve our EMS, we have implemented the U.S. DOE 50001 Ready program across our business. 50001 is a voluntary global standard for energy management systems in industrial, commercial and institutional facilities.\n\nAs of December 2022, we had 28 sites in the United States recognized by the program, up from 27 in 2021. While not officially recognized by the U.S. DOE program, we have 16 other sites that have met the same criteria: three sites in Canada, four in Mexico, eight in South America and one in Korea.\n\nWe are also participating in the DOE Better Buildings pilot program, exploring ways to achieve low- or zero-carbon operations.\n\nAwards and Recognition\n\nReceived\n\nGM has received the ENERGY STAR Sustained Excellence Award for the past 11 years\n\nWon\n\nGM won the Sustainability Leadership Award from the Business Intelligence Group in August 2022\n\nWon\n\nGM China\u2019s energy treasure hunt program won the Carbon Neutral Outstanding Practice Award at the International Green Zero-Carbon Festival in Beijing in August 2022\n\nAwarded\n\nIn 2022, GM\u2019s Flint Truck Assembly plant was awarded the Michigan Battle of the Buildings title in the Manufacturing/Industrial category\n\nU.S. ENERGY STAR\n\nBuildings certified by ENERGY STAR use less energy, save money and generate fewer GHG emissions. To be certified as an ENERGY STAR building, it must meet strict energy performance standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and outperform at least 75% of similar buildings nationwide. In 2022, we received four new certifications: Fort Wayne Assembly, Flint Assembly, Milford Enterprise Data Center and Arizona IT Innovation Center.\n\nIn 2022, we met the EPA ENERGY STAR Challenge for Industry at seven sites by reducing energy intensity by an average of about 18%. To meet the EPA Challenge, industrial sites must reduce their source energy intensity by at least 10% within a five-year period. In total, 71 GM manufacturing sites have met the EPA Challenge, with many sites achieving the goal multiple times for a total of 139 recognitions.\n\nIn 2022, we conducted 13 on-site ENERGY STAR treasure hunts, through which we found 194 energy-saving opportunities that could save the company approximately $13 million.\n\nRead more about our energy-saving initiatives around the world in our Regional Reports.\n\nGoal\n\nReduce energy intensity in our operations by 35% by 2035 against a 2010 baseline\n\n31 Energy intensity is a global calculation. It is a measure of global energy usage in relation to global assembly production. Regional variations in volumes can impact global intensity.\nOur Global Energy and Emissions Progress\n\nWe continue to invest in energy-efficient systems and renewable energy strategies to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Global energy intensity consists of two parts: base energy used in our buildings and variable energy, which is directly tied to production. Lower vehicle volumes translate to higher energy intensity. We continue to implement energy projects focused on both base and variable energy consumption, to achieve lower intensity as vehicle volumes stabilize.\n\nEnergy Consumption by Source (GJ)\n\n| Source                                      | 2010 (Baseline) | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2035 (Goal) |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------|------|------|------|------|-------------|\n| Electricity Consumption (incl. cooling)     | 1,233,302       | 988,443 |      |      |      |             |\n| Fuel Consumption From Nonrenewable Sources (incl. heating) | 24,991,559 |      |      |      |      |             |\n| Fuel Consumption From Renewable Sources (incl. heating) |      |      |      |      |      |             |\n| Steam Consumption                           | 23,438,387      |      |      |      |      |             |\n| Total                                       | 50,652,702      |      |      |      |      |             |\n\n32 This is based on the production of 6,075,449 light-duty vehicles and includes all of our energy sources.

Reporting is based on GHG Protocol, and the source of emission factors is regulatory or IPCC Good Practice Guidelines.\n\n35 GM\u2019s Scope 1 emissions are generated from use of fossil fuels, mostly natural gas for process and building heat.\n\n36 GM\u2019s Scope 2 emissions are mostly from electricity used in our operations for process and building with some purchased steam and delivered heat by third parties.\n\n37 GM\u2019s Scope 3 emissions are calculated in reference to the GHG Protocol for all 15 categories. Category 11: Use of Sold Products, is calculated using the well-to-wheel method, consistent with SBT requirements.\nThe Transition to Renewable Energy\n\nWe now have the agreements in place to meet our goal to source 100% of our electricity for all our U.S. sites from renewable energy by 2025.\\(^{38}\\)\n\nSourcing Renewable Energy\n\nWe support the growth of renewable power generation through direct investments, on-site power generation, green tariffs and power purchase agreements.\n\nAs well as working to reduce the energy we use in our operations through improved efficiency, we source renewable energy through direct investment, on-site generation, green tariffs and power purchase agreements (PPAs). According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance,\\(^{39}\\) GM has sourced more renewable electricity than any other automaker over the last decade, giving us the scale to help drive the transition to renewable power across the United States.\n\nOur Progress\n\nIn October 2022, we announced that we have successfully sourced 100% of the renewable energy needed to power all our U.S. sites by 2025.\\(^{40}\\)\n\nIn meeting this accelerated timeline, we estimate that we will have avoided the production of approximately 1 million metric tons of carbon emissions that would have been produced between 2025 and 2030, which equates to burning 1 billion pounds of coal.\n\nIn 2022, our global consumption of renewable power totaled 1.869 billion kWh, an increase from 1.368 billion kWh in 2021. As the chart on page 33 shows, the share of our global electricity powered by renewable energy increased to 30%, and we remain on track to meet our 2035 goal.\n\nAddressing Intermittency\n\nWind, solar and other renewable energy sources are intermittent by nature, and the first step to determine how we can address this intermittency is to understand our emissions footprint.\n\nTools and initiatives that help us track our emissions are an important element of our carbon reduction strategy. In collaboration with software provider TimberRock and Pennsylvania\u2014New Jersey\u2014Maryland Interconnection (PJM), the operator of the largest power grid in the United States, we are tracking the carbon emissions from our electricity use at 35 GM sites.\n\nThis almost-real-time \u201cmarginal emissions data\u201d is provided every five minutes by PJM, which serves 65 million people across 13 states and the District of Columbia. The information highlights the most efficient times to run our operations, given the carbon output of the grid at the time. This helps us make strategic decisions about our energy use. For example, during times of high emissions, there is the potential to reduce electricity use or switch to stored sources of renewable energy to reduce our emissions.\n\n---\n\n\\(^{38}\\) Based on estimated forecasted global renewable energy sourced through currently executed agreements, subject to change depending on actual future electric usage in operations and actual future renewable generation.\n\n\\(^{39}\\) Bloomberg New Energy Finance\u2019s Corporate PPA Deal Tracker.\n\n\\(^{40}\\) Based on estimated forecasted global renewable energy sourced through currently executed agreements, subject to change depending on actual future electric usage in operations and actual future renewable generation.\nPolicy Advocacy\n\nPublic policy and advocacy efforts will encourage the development of a resilient, carbon-free energy system. In the United States, grid decarbonization can be catalyzed by legislative efforts. The Energy Strategy Team collaborates with a number of organizations engaged in energy and decarbonization policy, including the Clean Energy Buyers Association, American Clean Power and the Renewable Thermal Collaborative.\n\nBeyond the United States, we are working with several universities that are gathering feedback from companies in China, to better understand what market changes will help them meet their energy targets in an affordable way.\n\nAnd in South Korea, we are working with other companies with clean energy goals to influence policy and regulation through RE100.\n\nRead more in the Public Policy section.\n\nOur Renewable Energy Portfolio\n\nIn October 2022, we announced that we now have 17 renewable energy sourcing agreements across 10 states, to source enough renewable energy to meet our 2025 target.41\n\nWhen investing in assets that generate renewable electricity, we aim to do so near our facilities, to maximize their localized emissions reduction impact. The map on the next page shows the U.S. sites where we have invested in renewable power, generate on-site renewable energy, or have Green Tariff agreements or PPAs in place.\n\n\u201cSecuring the renewable energy we need to achieve our U.S. goal by 2025 demonstrates tangible progress in reducing our emissions in all aspects of our business, ultimately moving us closer to our vision of a future with zero emissions.\u201d\n\nKristen Siemen\nVice President Sustainable Workplaces & Chief Sustainability Officer\n\n41 Based on estimated forecasted global renewable energy sourced through currently executed agreements, subject to change depending on actual future electric usage in operations and actual future renewable generation.\nRenewable Energy for Electricity Initiatives\n\n42 Figures include both operating and executed agreements.\nClean Energy Buyers\u2019 Alliance\n\nWe are a founding member of the Clean Energy Buyers\u2019 Alliance (CEBA), a business association activating a member community of more than 350 energy customers and partners to deploy market and policy solutions for a carbon-free energy system.\n\nWe serve as Foundational Funders of the Beyond the Megawatt initiative through the Clean Energy Buyers Institute (CEBI), CEBA\u2019s sister organization. This public benefit charity is dedicated to solving the toughest barriers to achieving a carbon-free energy system. Beyond the Megawatt was established to promote clean energy procurement processes with a focus on energy security and resilience while minimizing environmental and societal impacts.\n\nThe Clean Energy Buyers Alliance was formed with an aspiration to achieve a 90% carbon-free U.S. electricity system and cultivate a global community of energy customers driving clean energy.\n\nAwards and Recognition\n\nGM shortlisted for an RE100 Changemaker Award in 2022\n\nGM ranked #18 in the EPA Green Power list in 2022\n\nGM has sourced more renewable electricity than any other automaker over the last decade\n\nInvesting in Offshore Wind Technology\n\nIn 2022, GM Ventures made a strategic investment in Wind Catching Systems (WCS), a Norway-based offshore wind company. Our strategic agreement for collaboration covers technology development, project execution, offshore wind policy and the advancement of sustainable technology applications.\n\nWCS is developing an innovative design that incorporates several individual turbines into a standalone Wind Catcher. GM\u2019s investment will be used for engineering, design, supply chain development and an anticipated pilot project. WCS\u2019s design is more space-efficient than traditional offshore technology as it produces nearly five times the energy in a single unit. It also costs less to maintain, overcomes installation and maintenance issues, and significantly increases production efficiency.\n\nWCS was the recipient of Fast Company\u2019s Innovation by Design Awards in the Sustainability category.\nAn All-Electric Future\n\nClimate change is a global challenge that needs to be addressed. As part of the solution, we plan to make all-electric, zero-emission vehicles more accessible and affordable, bringing everyone along as we transition.\n\nUnder Scope 3, Use of Sold Products is the biggest contributor to our global emissions footprint and reducing these emissions is one of our highest priorities. Our main strategy for addressing this is by eventually replacing traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles with EVs, which have a significantly lower emissions intensity than equivalent ICE models.\n\nDriving EV Adoption\n\nAs detailed in Advancing Electrification and Autonomy, we are focusing on accelerating our transition toward EVs. We are building our EV portfolio to be inclusive, with models to suit a range of lifestyles and price points. We are on track to produce 400,000 EVs in North America by mid-2024, which will help lower the emissions intensity from the use of sold products significantly.\n\nMany of these vehicles, including the all-electric GMC HUMMER EV, Cadillac LYRIQ and upcoming Chevrolet Silverado EV, Chevrolet Equinox EV and Chevrolet Blazer EV, will feature our Ultium architecture and battery platform. Read more about our developments in EV battery technology.\n\nVehicle Emissions\n\nAcross the company, we have embedded governance processes that assess our fleet\u2019s fuel efficiency and emissions performance. Learn more about global fuel economy and emissions regulations.\n\nWell-to-Wheel CO2 Emissions per Light-Duty Vehicle43 (gCO2e/km)\n\n|                | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|----------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| United States  | 287  | 293  | 280  | 301  | 290  |\n| China          | 220  | 208  | 206  | 206  | 194  |\n| Brazil         | 200  | 198  | 195  | 201  | 200  |\n| Total Weighted Average | 245  | 243  | 240  | 246  | 233  |\n\n43 Data aligns with SBTi for Scope 3: Use of Sold Products. The SBTi standards require well-to-wheel (from fuel production to vehicle driving) for vehicle CO2 intensity (gCO2e/km) calculations.\nTransforming Our Manufacturing Footprint\n\nWe are rapidly scaling up our EV production footprint. In 2021, we began production at our Factory ZERO Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center, which was retooled into a fully dedicated EV facility to produce the GMC HUMMER EV, the upcoming Cruise Origin, the Chevrolet Silverado EV and the GMC Sierra EV. In January 2022, we announced that we will convert our assembly plant in Orion Township, Michigan, for fully dedicated EV production, including the Chevrolet Silverado EV and the GMC Sierra EV.\n\nIn addition to the transformation of five North American assembly plants, we are also investing in component, stamping and propulsion plants to support EV production as we bring everybody in with us on our journey to an all-electric future.\n\nRapidly Scaling EV Production Capacity\n\nIn support of our ambition to expand our EV manufacturing capacity, we will continue to invest in EVs, EV software and autonomous electric vehicles. Since 2020, we have announced investments of $11.7 billion across 14 sites in North America.\n\nInvestments in Our North American EV Manufacturing\n\n(Projects completed, in progress or announced through January 2023)\n\n- **Orion Assembly, Michigan**\n  - $3.5M\u2014Additional production of Cruise AV test vehicle\n  - $4B\u2014To renovate and expand to begin the production of new EV trucks\n\n- **Pontiac Stamping, Michigan**\n  - $40M\u2014Support future EV production\n\n- **Global Technical Center, Michigan**\n  - $81M\u2014Production of Cadillac CELESTIQ\n\n- **Marion Metal Center, Indiana**\n  - $491M\u2014Support future vehicle production, including EVs\n\n- **Spring Hill Assembly, Tennessee**\n  - $2B\u2014EVs, including the Cadillac LYRIQ\n\n- **Ramos Arizpe, Coahuila, Mexico**\n  - $1B\u2014New paint shop, preparations to produce EVs, batteries and EV components\n\n- **Detroit-Hamtramck, Michigan**\n  - $2.2B\u2014Electric trucks and SUVs\n\n- **CAMI Assembly, Ontario, Canada**\n  - $800M ($1B CAD)\u2014Production of BrightDrop Zevo 600 and BrightDrop Zevo 400\n\n- **Rochester General Motors Components Holdings (GMCH), New York**\n  - $56M\u2014Battery pack cooling lines for EV products\n\n- **Lockport Components, New York**\n  - $154M\u2014Renovation and new equipment installation to support electric motor production\n\n- **Brownstown, Michigan**\n  - $1M\u2014Additional production of Cruise AV test vehicle\n\n- **Rochester General Motors Components Holdings (GMCH), New York**\n  - $56M\u2014Battery pack cooling lines for EV products\n\n- **Toledo Propulsion Systems, Ohio**\n  - $760M\u2014Supporting production of Silverado EV, Sierra EV and HUMMER EV\n\n- **Defiance, Ohio**\n  - $8M\u2014Casting cell for future EV strategies\n\n- **Bedford Casting, Indiana**\n  - $52M\u2014Upgrades to support drive unit castings in new Silverado EV\n  - $45M\u2014Increase manufacturing capacity of EV drive unit castings\nThe Wallace Battery Cell Innovation Center\n\nWe are helping to pioneer cell manufacturing processes at our Wallace Battery Cell Innovation Center. The facility, located at our Global Technical Center (GTC) in Warren, Michigan, complements our two other existing facilities, the Estes Battery Systems Lab and our global R&D center.\n\nThis collaboration between our lab operations, R&D and product engineering teams will allow us to replicate large-format prototype battery cells in the same facility where we are developing them. It typically takes many years working with a cell supplier to develop and evaluate a new chemistry in a large-format cell. The Wallace Center will allow us to do this much faster and use our own technology, increasing speed to market for our future battery technologies.\n\nThe Wallace Center builds on the work of our R&D team, which already has more than 2,000 granted and pending patents in EV battery technology.\n\nInvesting in Battery Cell Manufacturing\n\nWe have announced plans to mass-produce battery cells for current and future EVs through Ultium Cells Holdings LLC (an equally owned joint venture with LG Energy Solution) in Warren, Ohio; Spring Hill, Tennessee; and Lansing, Michigan.\n\nThe first plant in Ohio opened in August 2022 and the second plant in Tennessee is currently under construction. Together, these sites are expected to create 6,000 construction jobs and 5,100 operations jobs when at full capacity.\n\nCarbonCure\n\nFollowing the successful implementation of CarbonCure\u2019s Ready Mix Technology in Spring Hill, Tennessee, GM engineers helped implement the technology at two more strategic locations in Lansing and Lake Orion in Michigan. CarbonCure\u2019s unique technology injects a precise dose of liquefied CO2 directly into freshly mixed concrete to improve its compressive strength. This reduces the amount of cement needed and lowers its overall carbon footprint and global warming potential (GWP).\n\nThis collaboration has resulted in two more concrete producers adopting sustainable concrete technologies, further supporting our climate commitments as a member of the First Movers Coalition and helping bring sustainable concrete to the greater Michigan market.\n\nIn 2022, we used more than 100,000 cubic yards of low-carbon concrete in our projects and in 2023, we plan to double our use of low-carbon concrete to an expected 285,000 cubic yards.\nDesigning for the Environment\n\nThrough holistic evaluations of our sustainability impacts, we make data-driven design decisions to develop impactful technologies, materials and products that help advance GM\u2019s sustainability initiatives.\n\nA circular approach will overcome some of the disadvantages of the traditional linear economy, in which materials are taken from the Earth, used to make products and then discarded as waste.\n\nNature\nWe rely on nature for many of the materials used in our products, including metals, wood and rubber. We are working to preserve biodiversity and restore natural ecosystems at our facilities and in sourcing communities through collaborations with key partners.\n\n- 40 wildlife conservation programs certified by the Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC)\n- Working with Conservation International on agroforestry projects in the Amazon Rainforest and Felinos Pantaneiros on biodiversity conservation\n\nCircular Economy\nOur work to improve circularity throughout the life cycle of our vehicles spans material selection and vehicle design, recycling, remanufacturing and reuse, and sustainable packaging.\n\n- Sold 750,000+ units of remanufactured parts (9 million units since 2013)\n- Aiming to have 100% returnable, viably recyclable, reusable or compostable packaging by 2030\n\nSustainable Materials\nWe are aiming to reduce the carbon footprint of new GM vehicles through material selection and sourcing decisions such as lower GHG intensity processes, and more recycled and renewable content.\n\n- Approximately 24 million pounds of recycled plastic used in GM vehicles\n- Founding member of the Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber (GPSNR)\n- Joined the First Movers Coalition through commitments to low-carbon steel, aluminum, concrete and cement, signaling a firm market demand for a net-zero transition\n\nWater\nWe are committed to managing water use in our facilities efficiently and responsibly, particularly in water-stressed locations.\n\n- Signatory of the CEO Water Mandate\n- Water consumption of 0.798 m\u00b3 per vehicle at our San Luis Potos\u00ed plant in Mexico\n\nWaste\nWe are working toward our Zero Waste ambition by treating waste as a useful resource that is out of place rather than something for disposal.\n\n- Diverted 1.33 million metric tons of waste from landfills, incinerators and energy recovery facilities\n- Achieved a waste diversion rate of 91.8%, meeting our 2025 goal of 90% three years early\n\nNature\nWe rely on nature for many of the materials used in our products, including metals, wood and rubber.

We are also using more recycled and renewable content, and content utilizing a higher proportion of renewable energy, as well as carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technologies.\n\nOur approach to sustainable materials relies on a comprehensive commodity management plan for each of our key materials: plastics, steel, aluminum, textiles, EV battery materials and more. Together, these represent more than 90% of the CO2 emissions associated with the materials we use in our vehicles.\n\nThe plans also drive collaboration within our supply chain and apply data-driven strategies to each commodity.\n\nRead more about how we source strategic raw materials.\n\nRecycled Plastics in GM Vehicles\n\nTo support the reduction of GHG emissions, we continue to increase the recycled content of materials in our vehicles.

We are working to understand our suppliers\u2019 long-term plans to achieve carbon neutrality for those materials and products, through the use of innovative new processes and technology, recycled materials, renewable energy, CCUS, carbon offsets and credits, and efficiency improvement.\n\nWe are also:\n\n\u2022 Developing new alloys that allow increased recycled content\n\u2022 Exploring closed-loop recycling to drive efficiencies and lower GHG emissions\n\u2022 Continuing to develop and select metals with less mass, reducing emissions by consuming less material and by increasing the range per unit of fuel or battery energy\n\u2022 Collaborating with suppliers, researchers, entrepreneurs and other organizations to develop innovative technologies and foster relationships that will enable the production of lower GHG emission metals and other materials\n\u2022 Working with suppliers to establish strategic purchase agreements, like our recent agreement with U.S. Steel, which provides GM with steel that has up to 75% fewer emissions than the traditional blast furnace steel it replaces\n\nAs part of our membership in the First Movers Coalition, GM will commit to purchase:\n\n\u2022 Crude Steel: At least 10% of the crude steel used in manufacturing the sheet steel products that GM directly purchases for U.S., Canada and Mexico manufacturing facilities will be near-zero emissions by 2030, if prices are no more than 20% higher than current commercial prices and/or as approved by GM leadership\n\nPrimary Aluminum: At least 10% of the primary aluminum used in manufacturing the sheet aluminum products GM directly purchases for U.S., Canada and Mexico manufacturing facilities will be low carbon by 2030, if prices are no more than 20% higher than current commercial prices and/or as approved by GM leadership\n\nTextiles\n\nWe have a goal of developing 50% recycled content on seat insert fabrics and up to 100% recycled content for overhead fabrics, carpets and floor mats in our new vehicles. Working with our suppliers, we are supporting the development of dozens of other textiles from items such as recycled plastic bottles, recovered fishing nets and plant-based fibers. We are also exploring lower-impact leather-tanning practices.\n\nNatural Rubber\n\nAs a founding member, GM participates on the Executive Committee of the GPSNR, a multistakeholder initiative working to make the natural rubber supply chain more sustainable. Around 55% of the global rubber supply chain are currently members of the GPSNR, including all GM tire suppliers. All members\u2014original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), tire manufacturers, rubber producers, processors and traders, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and smallholder farmers\u2014are expected to protect ecological health, local livelihoods and human rights.\n\nAs a GPSNR member, GM is required to report progress in implementing the company\u2019s Sustainable Natural Rubber Policy through annual reporting requirements.\n\nAlternatives to Leather\n\nWe are supporting the development and commercialization of an innovative silicone-based material for seating and interior trim, offering an environmentally friendly alternative to animal leather that contains three times fewer volatile organic compounds (VOCs).\n\nWe are also working on a leather-free seating and interior trim made with plant-based bio-materials. This material is phthalate-free, Oeko-Tex certified, replaces a portion of fossil-based content with soybean oil and has a 100% recycled polyester backing made from post-consumer waste. Both materials are durable and chemically resistant.\n\nAdditionally, through GM Ventures, we have joined forces with bio-tech company MycoWorks to co-develop Fine Mycelium\u2122, bio-based materials for our interiors. This innovative technology engineers mycelium, the densely entwined root structure of mushrooms, and offers the potential for premium, renewable materials with durability, softness and flexibility.\n\n46 Based on comparing Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO2e intensities for raw steel production at U.S. Steel integrated Blast Furnace\u2013Basic Oxygen Furnace (BF-BOF) facilities and the Big River Steel Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) facility, as reported in the U.S. Steel 2021 Sustainability Report.\nCircular Economy\n\nGM is currently working to increase circularity throughout the vehicle life cycle. This starts with sustainable materials and vehicle designs, and continues with our recycling, remanufacturing, reuse and sustainable packaging initiatives.\n\nGM has become a member of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation Network, along with other businesses, policymakers and institutions, to promote the principles of a circular economy. Through our membership, we are investigating ways to measure and improve our circularity.\n\nRemanufacturing\n\nGM\u2019s Customer Care & Aftersales (CCA) remanufacturing program is a crucial part of our commitment to a circular economy. The program helps reduce raw material needs and waste to landfill by enabling the reuse of vehicle parts through remanufacturing. These parts include engines, transmissions and other offerings, all of which meet engineering specifications.\n\nIn 2022, CCA sold more than 750,000 units, encompassing 7,000 unique parts including engines, transmissions and other offerings, in the United States. This brings our total units sold to 9 million since 2013. Alongside new service parts, remanufactured parts also enable vehicle repairs to help prolong the life of vehicles. The CCA Team also works with dealers and suppliers to encourage parts that are not currently remanufacturable to be recycled. Examples include fascias, aluminum wheels and catalytic converters, where all or part of the product is recovered for recycling or reuse.\n\nSustainable Battery Life Cycle\n\nGM\u2019s EV battery life cycle management program is an important element in our commitment to a circular economy and a zero-emissions future. It helps reduce energy and resource use throughout the battery supply chain and minimizes sustainability impacts across the vehicle\u2019s life, from design to EoL disposal. Recycled battery materials have a lower carbon footprint than mined materials and reduce many of the risks of human rights abuses and deforestation associated with sourcing new materials.\n\nGM\u2019s CCA Team supports circularity on all GM field-returned propulsion batteries in the United States. These batteries flow through a GM determination process and are either remanufactured, recycled or allocated for second uses. Since 2016, our CCA Team has been successfully remanufacturing both propulsion battery packs and modules to GM specifications.\nRecycling\n\nAs we work to make our battery supply chains more sustainable, we are investigating the most efficient ways to circulate scrap battery materials back into the supply chains of future battery cells where it makes sense.\n\nWe are working with our cell and cathode manufacturers to identify global recycling partners and establish pathways for recycled material from our manufacturing battery scrap and warranty returns to reenter EV supply chains in a way that is environmentally and technologically sound. We also support the development of recycling and recycled material reuse in new cells through a collaboration with recycling companies and the Department of Energy\u2019s U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium.\n\nWe have a longstanding collaboration with Cirba Solutions, which handles dismantling and recycling components, as well as materials used in our EV batteries. Cirba also allows employees to drop off batteries at designated recycling points at certain GM facilities.\n\nBy actively enabling a use for spent battery metals and supporting high recovery rates for raw materials, the work to return recycled material to our supply chain aligns with our priority of making sure our batteries get recycled at the end of their useful life.\n\nEnd-of-Life Disposal\n\nIt is important that we dispose of EV batteries properly. Our recyclemybattery.com website provides dismantlers with valuable information on how to disable, remove, store and ship used battery packs from our EVs. We will continue to develop guidelines that support the safe handling and transport of EV batteries by EoL processors and to evaluate opportunities to enable the recycling of all batteries.\n\nWe are also engineering and refining battery packs that are easier to recycle at the end of life.\n\nBattery Recycling with Lithion\n\nIn 2022, GM Ventures made a strategic investment in Lithion, a Qu\u00e9bec-based battery recycling company. Lithion\u2019s technology creates opportunities to recover raw materials. With a recovery rate above 95%\u2014and using Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s green energy\u2014Lithion can reduce the GHG emissions in battery materials by over 75%, and water use by over 90%, compared to mining new materials.\n\nHaving commissioned an industrial-scale demonstration plant in January 2020, Lithion will start commercial recycling operations in 2023. This new facility will be able to process 7,500 metric tons of lithium-ion batteries a year.\n\nUsing Sustainable Packaging\n\nGM is focused on innovation and embedding circular principles into packaging procurement and design. As part of this work, we recently announced a new goal, aiming to have 100% returnable, viably recyclable, reusable or compostable packaging by 2030.\n\nWe have contracted with ORBIS Corporation and Monoflo International to increase the use of recycled resin within knockdown shipping containers, enabling the use of more than 7.4 million pounds of recycled resin between 2021 and 2022. Through this innovative and collaborative initiative, we increased recycled content use to approximately 80%, which is a 40% increase for these containers.\n\nIn addition, our CCA Team has developed programs to reclaim and reuse packaging\u2014including wheel foam packaging\u2014from remanufacturing facilities.\n\n\u201cWe believe that collaboration is critical when focusing on circularity. We are piloting new packaging types and materials to minimize waste, and evaluating tools that measure how much material we reuse, recycle and remanufacture.\u201d\n\nReeshemah Howard\nEmerging ESG Sustainability Strategies Manager\nWaste\n\nWe aim to divert more than 90% of our total operational waste from landfills, incinerators and energy recovery facilities by 2025.\\(^{47}\\)\n\nWe operate in a resource-intensive industry, so it is important to integrate circular design thinking into our product development and operational footprint.\n\nWe are proud to have surpassed our waste reduction target three years ahead of schedule. This has been accomplished by achieving a waste diversion rate of 91.8%\\(^{47,48}\\) and diverting 1.33 million metric tons of waste from landfills, incinerators and energy recovery facilities.\n\nOur waste program\\(^{48}\\) builds upon our previous \u201clandfill-free efforts.\u201d By diverting waste from landfill, incineration and energy recovery for reuse, recycling, composting and other treatment options, our waste hierarchy is aligned to drive innovations that reduce harm to the environment.\n\nGM Waste Hierarchy\n\nOur waste hierarchy represents the approximate increasing benefit of each waste management method.\n\n**Reduce / Reuse**\nTo generate less waste, we aim to reduce the amount of waste in our products and manufacturing processes from the start.\n\n**Recycle / Compost**\nFor material byproducts that we cannot design out or reuse, we evaluate recycling and composting options.\n\n**Other Treatment / Energy Recovery / Incineration / Landfill**\nAny remaining waste materials are analyzed to ensure responsible disposal.\n\n---\n\n\\(^{47}\\) Total operational waste is defined as all relevant waste streams (\u226598% of reported operational waste) that are not generated due to construction, demolition or remediation activities.\n\n\\(^{48}\\) GM\u2019s waste program represents the percentage of waste diverted from landfill, incinerators and energy recovery compared to a three-year average (2017\u20132019) baseline of total operational waste generated and is based on the Zero Waste International Alliance (ZWIA) to reflect a 90% diversion threshold.\nWaste Initiatives Around the World\n\nWe have implemented a range of innovative projects to design out waste and improve reuse and recycling at a local, regional and national level.\n\n\u2022 In late 2022, our Milford Proving Ground partnered with CLEARAS Water Recovery, Inc. to trial a low-level nutrient recovery unit within our on-site wastewater treatment plant (WWTP).\n\n\u2022 We teamed up with Carbon Rivers to recycle some of the carbon and glass fiber from scrap Corvette fascia. We are now researching the feasibility of \u201cclosing the loop\u201d by reusing this material in our own product line.\n\n\u2022 In Brazil, we work to extract metal content from the filter cake generated from our wastewater treatment processes. All material with at least 5 mg of metal per kilogram are processed and to date, nearly 618 tons of metals have been extracted and recycled into steel.\n\nEmployee Engagement\n\nWe have implemented an \u201ceverybody-in\u201d approach to waste reduction, engaging senior leadership, employees and external partners across our global footprint.\n\nOne example of how we support this behavior is through our Zero Waste49 treasure hunt programs. Through this initiative, cross-functional teams visit specified facilities to identify opportunities and best practices for reducing waste. In 2022, we led Zero Waste49 treasure hunts at nine sites across the United States, Mexico and Brazil. Informal treasure hunts were conducted across all GM regions: North America, South America, China and International.\n\nAnother channel we use to promote engagement is the Sustainability Ambassador Program. This diverse group of employees across 10 countries meets monthly with senior leadership to learn about achievements and challenges, develop their skills and support GM\u2019s sustainability aspirations.\n\nCollaborations to Accelerate Progress on Waste\n\nWe have a number of collaborations in place to maximize our reach and our waste reduction efforts.\n\n\u2022 Chemical Recycling of Automotive Shredder Residue (ASR): This project demonstrates that plastics recovered from EoL vehicles can be chemically recycled and used in new automotive components.\n\n\u2022 Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG) and Suppliers Partnership for the Environment: Together, we are working across the automotive industry to benchmark zero waste definitions and management methods, and generate white papers to share knowledge and solutions.\n\n\u2022 DOE\u2019s Better Plants program: We have partnered with the DOE\u2019s Better Plants program to help lead manufacturers to reduce their carbon and waste footprints.\n\nManufacturing Reuse Practices\n\nIn 2022, we reused approximately 60 tons of steel structure from an old press line and an old area of die storage at our S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos site in Brazil, reworking and reinforcing them to be reinstalled in the new press line. This process reduced costs, avoided the need for purchasing new steel structures and reduced our CO2 impact.\n\nStarting in 2021, two GM foundries that manufacture engine components have teamed up to reuse waste sand, completely replacing the need for virgin sand on a block production line. This project diverts sand waste from Defiance Foundry, OH, to our foundry in Saginaw, MI. This initiative reused more than 1,000 metric tons of sand in 2021 and 4,000 metric tons in 2022, with a cost saving of nearly $230,000.\n\nIn partnership with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Defiance Foundry has also collaborated with our Biodiversity program to restore its on-site sludge ponds into a native wildlife habitat. In 2022, this habitat restoration project reused nearly 99,000 metric tons of sand.\n\n49 GM\u2019s waste program represents the percentage of waste diverted from landfill, incinerators and energy recovery compared to a three-year average (2017\u20132019) baseline of total operational waste generated and is based on the Zero Waste International Alliance (ZWIA) to reflect a 90% diversion threshold.\nWater\n\nWater is a scarce resource, and access to clean water and sanitation is fundamental.\n\nWe are committed to managing water use in our facilities efficiently and responsibly, particularly in water-stressed locations such as Mexico and China. We use predictive modeling to focus our efforts to preserve water quality and support water stewardship in our operations, supply chain and local communities.\n\nWater scarcity is a global and increasingly critical issue with the potential to impact our production and the communities we support. In response, we have identified which of our facilities are under water risk stress regarding quality, quantity and regulatory issues, and developed action plans and commitments.\n\nManaging Water\n\nWe are committed to identifying and implementing ways to reduce our operational water use. Focusing on the areas of our business with the highest consumption, such as paint shops and cooling towers, we design water-saving measures into new processes and retrofit technology during facility upgrades. Additionally, the World Resources Institute\u2019s Aqueduct tools help us identify water risks such as floods and droughts, informing location-specific decisions ranging from introducing conservation measures to sourcing alternative supplies.\n\nFurthermore, we explore opportunities to reduce water use at our manufacturing facilities by engaging employees through water treasure hunts.\n\nReducing Water Intensity\n\nOver the past decade, we have been dedicated to achieving our 2035 goal to reduce the water intensity of our operations by 35% compared to a 2010 baseline. This could save enough water to fill more than 4,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools.\n\nWe continue to invest in water-efficient systems and recycling strategies to reduce our water consumption. Global water intensity consists of two parts: base water used in our buildings, and variable water, which is directly tied to production. Lower vehicle volumes translate to higher water intensity.50 We continue to implement water projects focused on both base and variable water consumption, to achieve lower intensity as vehicle volumes stabilize. In 2022, our water intensity decreased to 4.50 m3 per vehicle.\n\nGlobal Water Intensity (m3/Vehicle)\n\n| Year | 2010 (Baseline) | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2035 (Goal) |\n|------|----------------|------|------|------|------|------|-------------|\n|      | 4.77           | 4.23 | 4.26 | 4.17 | 4.54 | 4.50 | 3.10        |\n\n50 Water intensity is a global calculation. It is a measure of global water usage in relation to global assembly production. Regional variations in volumes can impact global intensity.\nWater Projects Around the World\n\nWe manage water locally, with each facility setting its own annual improvement targets in line with the level of water stress in the area.\n\n**Mexico:** At our San Luis Potos\u00ed Complex, our Assembly Complex water efficiency benchmark, we continue to build upon our sustained water conservation efforts. The Transmission plant has taken actions to reduce water from processes by reducing filter cleanouts and improving oil/water separation within the circulating system. The Assembly plant, looking to improve separation and therefore the treated effluent quality, studied and implemented alternative chemical treatment methodologies. The resultant high-quality effluent is used as a source of make-up water in our paint sludge pit system, as well as within our fire extinguishing system, replacing the need for fresh water. Through these and other initiatives, San Luis Potos\u00ed\u2019s water consumption per vehicle produced is 0.798 m\u00b3.\n\n**China:** Our Transmission and Assembly manufacturing complex in Dongyue continues to focus on water conservation initiatives and remains one of our lowest water intensity facilities at 1.59 m\u00b3/unit. Focusing on continued improvement, the site replaced cooling towers to minimize water loss. This increased the efficiency of its tower operations, reducing make-up water requirements and eliminating the need for several high-purity water rinses within the paint shop.\n\nEngagement on Water Security\n\nIn 2021, we signed the CEO Water Mandate, a UN Global Compact initiative. In doing so, we joined other global business leaders in addressing key challenges around water security. We are mapping our water progress and achievements against the mandate\u2019s six core target areas: direct operations, supply chain and watershed management, collective action, public policy, community education and transparency.\n\nWe are active stakeholders in regional watershed committees and projects to protect river basins, specifically in Colombia and Ecuador. Additionally, we are conducting reforestation and soil care activities to help us improve the water cycle in the Toluca Complex and Sierra Morelos Park area of Mexico.\n\nWe also engage with around 300 suppliers through organizations including the AIAG and undertake annual responses to CDP\u2019s Water Security questionnaire.\nNature\n\nThrough key collaborations, we are working to preserve biodiversity and restore natural ecosystems at our facilities and in surrounding communities.\n\nOur Collaborative Approach to Nature Conservancy\n\nNature, biodiversity and ecosystem services are linked to our business. We rely on the natural world for many of the materials used in our products, including metals, wood and rubber. The production and use of our vehicles also has an impact on the environment. GM is also:\n\n\u2022 An engagement member of Science Based Targets for Nature\n\u2022 An active member of the Suppliers Partnership for the Environment Biodiversity working group\n\u2022 Engaging in pollinator projects with several of our own pollinator gardens, including at the Warren Tech Center and Renaissance Center\n\nWildlife Habitat Council (WHC)\n\nThe WHC certifies land that promotes wildlife conservation. Through our collaboration, we have 40 Certified programs, the most in the automotive industry. Of these, 17 are Certified Gold programs, which are considered exceptional by the WHC.\n\nAnother collaboration with the WHC was the GM Biodiversity by Design catalogue. The catalogue shares best construction practices that integrate green design into new builds, retrofits, expansions and land management at GM facilities. We have incorporated these best practices into nine GM facility transformations. They include an eco-friendly lighting strategy with energy-efficient LED lighting, as well as using skylights and reflective surfaces to maximize natural light. We also enhanced facility grounds with living walls and no-mow zones, by planting trees and by incorporating native plants into landscaping.\n\nAt our S\u00e3o Caetano do Sul site in Brazil, we built a green roof\u2014the Goldenfield Space\u2014to benefit the environment and our employees. The space contains native plants and trees, a solar energy system that generates electricity for the entire space and a self-watering system that harvests rainwater. In addition, the material used to protect the surroundings comes from 100% recycled and reused content.\n\nNational Wildlife Federation (NWF)\n\nThrough Eco-Green, our educational partnership with the NWF, we have supported project-based learning since 2015. With a science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) focus, we offer students a chance to learn about the environment, either remotely or in person. We also support teachers\u2019 professional development and share information through videos, webinars and blogs.\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, more than 2,000 students from 20 U.S. schools took part in 75 sustainability projects, ranging from wildlife habitat restoration and water preservation to community gardens and plastic recycling. In addition, 20 GM employees contributed nearly 400 volunteer hours to assist teachers and mentor students.\n\nWHC Awards\n\nIn June 2022, WHC recognized our nature conservancy work by awarding GM two of its three highest honors. We received WHC\u2019s most prestigious award, the Corporate Conservation Leadership Award, for our commitment to biodiversity and conservation education across 40 programs and 136 projects. We also received the Employee Engagement Award, which celebrates 6,000 employees participating in WHC biodiversity projects in 2022.\nConservation Projects in South America\n\nWe have invested in several strategic conservation and restoration projects in South America. For example, GM\u2019s partnership with Conservation International in the Amazon region encompasses work in four countries: Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. In 2022, our overall support for the conservation of the Amazon totaled approximately $500,000.\n\nImpact of Agroforestry Projects with Conservation International\n\n**Ecuador**\n- 300 beneficiaries across 85 families in the Zabalo community\n\n**Peru**\n- 4 indigenous communities participating\n- 27 female community leaders in charge of agroforestry pilot plots across 25 hectares\n- 20 farms involved in traceability/block chain pilot for sale of certified organic cocoa\n- 17,000 tree seedlings produced\n\n**Brazil**\n- 4 community organizations involved in agroforestry projects\n- 3 communities with female leadership\n- 23 families impacted directly by restoration activities\n- 50 women with greater restoration, community business and gender inclusion skills\n- 5 hectares of degraded land restored\n- 2 tree seedling nurseries able to produce and store 40,000 seedlings\n\n**Colombia**\n- 157 families participating in the Putumayo and Caquet\u00e1 region\n- 87 hectares of agroforestry plots developed\n- 642 tons of materials and 60,000 tree seedlings transported using GM vehicles\nSocial\n\nOur aspiration is to make GM the most inclusive company in the world. We are also focused on protecting human rights, fostering supplier relationships and bringing communities along.\n\n\u201cCollectively, doing the hard work of creating consistently inclusive environments that are supported by equitable practices makes way for every team member to thrive and contribute to the GM purpose.\u201d\n\nTelva McGruder\nChief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer\nClimate Action Framework\n\nThe changes driving the transition to an all-electric future represent a seismic shift in our industry. As we accelerate that future, we must listen and learn. We understand that climate change does not impact every community equally, and that sustainable technology alone is not enough for everyone to benefit from an all-electric future.\n\nOur Climate Action Framework is rooted in four key areas: the future of work, access to electric vehicles (EVs), infrastructure and climate.\n\nThrough the Climate Fund, we have committed to several capital and philanthropic ventures that are helping to close the community gaps present in the transition to EVs and other sustainable technologies.\n\nFocus Areas\n\n| Future of Work | EV Access | Infrastructure | Climate |\n|----------------|-----------|----------------|---------|\n| Developing skills for our electric future by investing in training and reskilling, such as through our Technical Learning University and its Electrical Apprentice Program | Planning to offer a wide range of EVs across segments and price points | Committing to accessible charging solutions that can help meet customers where they are and understanding the need to help address charging deserts and other scenarios that can hinder EV ownership | Funding organizations that are helping to close the climate gaps at the community level as well as educating key GM stakeholders |\n\nPrinciples\n\n- Help make mobility safe, accessible and environmentally friendly for all\n- Incorporate and normalize equity considerations across our business operations and program implementation efforts, including workforce strategy, sustainability efforts, and products and services\n- Work with community-based stakeholders to identify their unique needs, assets and priorities as well as collaboratively assist impacted communities\n- Advocate for climate change action, renewable energy and transportation-related policies at the federal, state and local levels\n- Help support organizations that are providing diverse communities access to a more sustainable future\nA Team That Includes Everybody\n\nTo attract and inspire the most qualified and diverse talent, we focus on fostering great employee experiences in an inclusive culture in which everybody can learn, grow and thrive.\n\nWe listen carefully to feedback from across the business to improve our approach every day. Our processes focus on experiences during the recruitment process and through the employee journey.\n\nRecruiting Talented People\n\nWe are building a more diverse, equitable and inclusive environment to make a positive impact and deliver on our purpose. Our talent recruitment and assessment processes are strategically executed with a mindset of inclusion to allow candidates from all backgrounds to find opportunities in inspiring and challenging roles.\n\nWe recognize that everyone brings their own unique experiences to a role\u2014and we are consistently improving our recruitment methods to enable each candidate to highlight their skills during the application and interview processes.\n\nOur Global Talent Acquisition Team uses various outreach strategies, including market analysis, sourcing, talent marketing and communications, to generate relevant, effective candidate interactions.\n\nWe establish partnerships and use marketplace databases to expand our outreach to diverse candidates, including to universities such as Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs). We also employ relationship management systems to notify potential candidates when relevant positions become available.\n\nWe aim to remove barriers by reframing job descriptions to focus on the capabilities and skills needed for the role. Candidates participate in structured interviews that help provide an objective platform for our teams to assess skill and behavioral alignment with the specific job needs. We also strive to create diverse teams of interviewers who can provide different perspectives when assessing a candidate.\n\nLeveraging Talent Innovation\n\nInnovation is at the heart of transforming GM technologies, and we bring that same mindset to how we recruit talent. Some examples of these efforts include:\n\n\u2022 Implementing an agnostic approach to recruiting, aiming to reach schools all across the United States. In 2022, we hired more than 2,800 early career individuals with recruitment efforts at over 500 universities. Of these, over 2,000 filled entry-level positions, with more than 700 taking intern and co-op roles. We are proud that our student program has been recognized as a Top 100 Internship Program by a panel of industry expert judges and thousands of public votes, organized by yello and WayUp.\n\n\u2022 Collaborating closely with other organizations, such as the American Indian Science and Engineering Society, the National Society of Black Engineers, the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers and the Society of Women Engineers.\nEngaging Every Employee\n\nWe are reimagining our workforce strategy and evaluating our systems to ensure that all GM employees have impactful experiences and feel connected to our purpose and our values.\n\nWe collect employee feedback throughout the year. This includes our Workplace of Choice engagement survey, conducted every other year, and shorter \u201cpulse\u201d surveys that check in on important topics. These surveys provide critical information to support data-driven decisions that improve the employee experience.\n\nIn 2022, we conducted a \u201cpulse\u201d survey in June and a Workplace of Choice survey in October. Across both, we collected more than 199,000 global salaried and represented employee responses. A record 66% of represented employees responded to the Workplace of Choice survey, significantly higher than any prior edition.\n\nUnlocking Everybody\u2019s Potential\n\nLearning continues to be a significant enabler of our employees\u2019 growth and development. We subscribe to a 70\u201320\u201310 philosophy of learning, where 70% of learning occurs through on-the-job experiences, 20% through exposure activities, coaching, mentoring, participation in Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) and other social activities, and 10% through formal educational resources.\n\nWe make learning and development opportunities available to employees at all levels. GM\u2019s Technical Education Program (TEP), established in 1984, helps us keep our engineering community on the cutting edge of innovative knowledge. We provide employees with technical coursework in partnership with top universities with impactful automotive and automotive-related research initiatives. Each program has at least one GM-directed component in which students integrate and apply their coursework knowledge to generate solutions to improve processes and solve issues resulting in measurable value to GM.\n\nEarn a Living. Make a Life.\n\nEarn a Living Make a Life is a collaboration between our Marketing and Manufacturing Communications Teams with the purpose of highlighting the amazing people behind our products. It celebrates their talents and the impact that they have in their families and communities. Our manufacturing employees are much more than their jobs\u2014they are parents, grandparents, friends, coaches, students, leaders, mentors and community advocates.\n\nWe are using billboards, digital screens, video streaming and newspaper advertisements to bring their contributions and personal stories to life. Recognizing employee impact is one way we demonstrate inclusion.\n\nIn 2022, TEP reached 601 students from 11 countries and five capstone projects were awarded TEP\u2019s Value Add Award for enhancements and tangible savings in areas of cost, quality, innovation and customer satisfaction.\n\nFor example, we have deployed Virtual Advisor to support OnStar navigation inquiries using Google\u2019s Dialogflow. This project\u2014selected for TEP\u2019s Value Add Award\u2014focuses on expanding conversational AI across all customer engagement channels to analyze unstructured data and gain better insights.

It\u2019s important to make the effort to listen to and understand everyone\u2019s perspective so you can make an informed decision.\u201d\n\nJulie Xiong\nBusiness Intelligence and DEI Data Governance Manager\n\nOur DEI Leadership and Strategy\n\nOur DEI strategy is aligned with and integrated into our growth strategy across three strategic pillars: DEI Maturity, Transparency and Talent Innovation.\n\nWe continue to invest in and strengthen our Center of Excellence for DEI, in areas such as business intelligence and insights, ERG impact, internal and external partnerships, global reach, and workforce design and innovation.\n\nWe recognize that DEI is the responsibility of every leader at GM. Accountability for diversity, equity and inclusion begins at the highest levels of the company and extends across the company. Throughout the year, our chief DEI officer shares strategy, growth and progress updates with the Senior Leadership Team and Board of Directors. Additionally, the GM Inclusion Advisory Board (IAB), comprised of internal and external leaders and led by our Chair and CEO, provides guidance and recommendations to our Senior Leadership Team on DEI and cultural competence.\n\nAlong with examining systems and implementing structural improvements, we ensure progress and accountability using key strategic indicators, which measure diversity in the overall and executive populations. We also review progress in hiring, promotions, performance assessments, candidate populations and retention. To measure inclusion, we use an Inclusivity Index derived from our Workplace of Choice survey.\n\nDriving DEI Maturity\n\nWe build DEI maturity across the business by engaging in critical conversations with leaders and employees to improve our interactions with each other and our customers, suppliers and communities.\n\nWe recognize that unconscious bias is one of the key impediments to building an inclusive culture, so in 2022, we trained more than 200 employees around the world to facilitate unconscious bias workshops. This helped us provide more than 22,900 employees with experiential workshops to significantly increase unconscious bias awareness in the company.\n\nIn January 2022, we launched Inclusive Leadership Coaching to provide people leaders with the tools to live up to the \u201cBe Inclusive\u201d GM behavior. Our inclusive leadership model encourages leaders to use the leadership levers of listening, empathizing, collaborating, leaning in and building trust. We prioritized the global manufacturing and finance organizations, and through 2022, nearly 25% of manufacturing people leaders and over 70% of finance people leaders had been exposed to the coaching experience.\n\nOther diversity-focused councils within GM include:\n\n- GM Supplier Council\n- ERG Leader Council\n- Minority Dealer Development Council\n- Women\u2019s Dealer Advisory Council\n- One DEI Council\n- Disability Action Committee\nCreating an Inclusive Culture With Employee Resource Groups (ERGs)\n\nThe employees in our ERGs are an important part of our cultural transformation. ERGs are global employee-led groups that serve as a resource for their constituent members and allies and help to improve DEI maturity throughout our business.\n\nWe have 12 ERGs, with chapters spanning the United States and globally. They have executive-led advisory councils to help them progress, address issues and pursue opportunities. We are proud that more than 55% of our salaried employees are a member of at least one ERG.\n\nGM Generations: Our Newest ERG\n\nStudies show that multigenerational teams add value through a diversity of skills, opinions and experiences. Formed in 2022, the GM Generations ERG\u2019s mission is to break down generational stereotypes and bias through cross-generational sharing and teamwork. In addition to helping everyone feel respected and supported, the ERG will facilitate the sharing of professional and personal lessons.\n\n\u201cI believe our 12 ERGs are critical to helping GM in pursuit of its aspiration of becoming the most inclusive company in the world. They highlight our commonalities and differences, as well as the need to ensure DEI is something we consider in everything we do at GM.\u201d\n\nKerri Wright\nGM Able Co-President and ETS Project Portfolio Manager\n\nIncreased collaboration between ERGs is also helping us to address intersectionality and the interconnectedness of people and issues. Through workshops and various events, our ERGs are increasing cultural intelligence and competence across the company. To continue driving progress, in 2022 we:\n\n\u2022 Established an ERG Innovation and Growth Team to oversee and support the ERGs as they drive their initiatives forward, assist in sharing best practices and promote collaboration among ERGs\n\n\u2022 Held our first ERG Summit, an in-person event for ERG leaders and other stakeholders, featuring speakers, Inclusive Leadership Coaching, networking opportunities and education on multicultural mental health\n\n\u2022 Hosted our first ERG Week, which featured 19 sessions including inclusion workshops, sessions on interfaith education, multicultural market information, executive panel discussions and global content\n\n\u2022 Introduced a new Degreed Pathway for ERG leaders, catered to those with less experience leading people, covering a range of leadership topics\n\nTo complement our ERGs, we have employees serving as DEI Ambassadors. They are engaged in inclusion committees within business functions. This structure is critical to our ability to address local opportunities as well as to scale certain DEI initiatives. It also ensures we address DEI from both local and centralized perspectives and enables everyone to lead DEI efforts.\n\nMaking Mobility More Accessible\n\nIn 2021, GM hired the industry\u2019s first chief engineer of accessibility to lead a new Accessibility Center of Excellence (ACE). The ACE is helping drive GM to be a trusted accessible mobility provider, supporting new ideas that help advance the 1.3 billion people the World Health Organization estimates live with a disability.\n\nThe team works across four main areas: researching and innovating with the customer, defining what it means to have accessible solutions in our vehicles, creating customizable solutions for a variety of customer needs and creating an ecosystem to grow the culture around accessibility.\n\n\u201cFor us, helping GM fulfill its purpose of connecting people means understanding the mobility needs of the millions of customers with disabilities and incorporating that into our innovation and design strategies.\u201d\n\nCarrie Morton\nChief Engineer \u2013 Accessibility, Accessibility Management\nGM\u2019s DEI Ambassadors Are Catalysts for Change\n\nAcross GM, our more than 160 DEI Ambassadors are creating and facilitating DEI messages and activities, sharing tools and resources to educate and inspire inclusive behaviors and collaborating to address barriers to inclusion.\n\nGlobal Purchasing & Supply Chain DEI Ambassadors created a DEI week focused on leading inclusively with five inspiring sessions attracting an average of 700 participants each.\n\nSales, Service & Marketing DEI Ambassadors coordinated multiple executive-led 90-minute conversations on mindfulness, bias, mental health, inclusion and psychological safety.\n\nGlobal Finance DEI Ambassadors facilitated events such as DEI All People Meeting Quarterly Roundtables, DEI showcases presented by global teams and Inclusive Leadership Coaching for their people leaders.\n\nIncreasing Transparency\n\nInclusivity demands transparency. We are committed to holding ourselves accountable and demonstrating progress to our internal and external stakeholders through data collection, analysis and disclosure. We have launched an Inclusivity Index as part of our global Workplace of Choice survey. We disclosed our consolidated Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)-1 Report in 2022 and commit to making similar disclosures in the future.\n\nWe also believe that transparency reaches beyond data. We aim for transparency through our guiding principles (Our Words, Our Deeds, Our Culture) and encourage open discussion of our DEI journey.\n\nTalent Innovation: Building New Pathways to Entry\n\nGM is committed to evolving our talent pathways through inclusive hiring practices that highlight skills, remove barriers, enhance career opportunities and increase diversity.\n\nWe continue to build strategic relationships to expand our recruiting efforts with underrepresented communities, for example:\n\nGM engages talent developer programs that are focused on providing technical skills to position candidates for opportunities in our workforce.\n\nWe are a founding member of OneTen\u2014a coalition of 72 companies and leaders that aims to train, hire and advance 1 million Black Americans over a 10-year period into family-sustaining jobs with opportunities for advancement. In 2022, we hired more than 800 qualifying OneTen talent.\n\nOur U.S. career re-entry program\u2014Take 2\u2014targets anyone with two or more years of experience in a field who has taken a break from that field for two or more years.\n\nRepresentation in Top Management Positions in 2022 (Within Two Levels of Our CEO)\n\n- 30% women globally\n- 17% minorities in the United States\n\nExecutive Population in 2022, Compared to 2021\n\n- 18% increase in women globally\n- 12% increase in minorities in the United States\n\nSalaried Representation in 2022, Compared to 2021\n\n- 12% increase in women globally\n- 16% increase in minorities in the United States\nPromoting Equality\n\nWe believe everyone deserves to work in an environment where they can be proud of who they are. GM has long advocated for women in the workplace. In 2022, we were recognized in the JUST 100 rankings, leading in the Automobiles & Parts industry, and ranked third on Equileap's Gender Equality score for the United States. We also participate in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Framework.\n\nIn 2022, women comprised 30% of management positions within two levels of the CEO.\n\nWe are committed to equal pay practices, and our Equal Pay Pledge reflects our belief that employees' protected characteristics, including gender, should not factor into compensation decisions. As part of this commitment, we have a rigorous annual process that involves measuring pay equity and making adjustments if unaccounted-for discrepancies are found.\n\nOur Disability Action Committee, managed and led by our DEI Team, is dedicated to identifying opportunities to increase inclusivity and accessibility for all employees.\n\n\"We strive to support our communities in a holistic way. That's why our Inclusion Fund focuses on programming aligned with GM's initiatives in education, economic empowerment, personal and professional development, and health.\"\n\nRhonda Fields\nSenior Manager, Corporate Giving: DE&I Initiatives\n\nExtending Inclusivity Into the Market\n\nDealer Diversity\n\nGM's Minority Dealer Development (MDD) Program\u2014established in 1972 and covering North America\u2014is the industry's longest-running minority dealer program. In addition, GM is the only original equipment manufacturer to have a Women's Retail Network (WRN) program in the United States. We work diligently to:\n\n- Increase the number of qualified diverse dealers\n- Help dealers reach levels of operational effectiveness that consistently meet or exceed the general dealer population\n- Encourage and attract strong leaders into retail organizations as dealer operators, managers and employees\n- Provide dealers with resources to implement inclusive practices in their dealerships\n\nIn 2022, we made educational DEI resources available to more than 92,000 dealer team members.\n\nWe are proud that our MDD and WRN programs together consist of over 600 diverse dealerships within our dealer network. Our diverse dealers consistently outperform all other GM dealers in many key performance indicators and are among the most profitable of our retail partners.\n\nInclusion Fund\n\nIn the United States, we are working to drive generational change through our Inclusion Fund. We aim to support historically underserved communities by supporting organizations that drive meaningful change in the areas of health, education and economic empowerment.\n\nIn 2022, GM disbursed approximately $8 million to 45 nonprofit organizations serving a projected 3.6 million people.\n\nEngaging on Behalf of Employees\n\nGM engages in public policy advocacy on matters that reflect company priorities and policies that impact its employees. Our efforts include the following initiatives:\n\n- CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion Pledge\n- Coalition for the American Dream\n- Business Coalition for the Equality Act\n- The Dialogue Project\n- Gender and Diversity KPI Alliance\n- Business Statement on Anti-LGBTQ State Legislation\n- Human Rights Campaign supporting the Respect for Marriage Act\n- Companies of Purpose Initiative\n- Disability:IN CEO Letter on Disability Inclusion\n\nThese grants are expected to support outcomes which include access to quality early childhood education (with an emphasis on STEM), providing resources for entrepreneurs and improving access to mental health services so that communities have higher standards of living.\nTotal Rewards\n\nWe prioritize a holistic approach to well-being, which includes support for employees\u2019 physical, emotional and financial wellness.\n\nTotal Rewards Program\n\nOur comprehensive Total Rewards program supports our employees and their families around the globe.\n\nBesides competitive wages, GM\u2019s benefit packages, which vary by country, can include health insurance, access to employee assistance programs, life insurance, disability benefits, profit sharing, retirement and savings plans, paid time off, tuition assistance, vehicle discounts and various other offerings.\n\nSee the Supplement for more information about our employee benefits by country.\n\nExpanding Benefit Eligibility to Domestic Partners\n\nIn January 2023, we expanded our dependent eligibility provisions in the United States to include domestic partners, allowing our salaried employees to add domestic partners\u2014regardless of gender\u2014and their children to certain benefits and policies, making them eligible for medical, dental, vision and life insurance. GM now recognizes domestic partners as eligible dependents in many countries and we continue to look for opportunities to expand them further.\n\nRecognition Program\n\nRecognition is an important part of our culture, and our salaried recognition program provides an online platform where employees around the world recognize individuals or multiple colleagues for their contributions and demonstrating our company values and behaviors. This program is used by 99% of our salaried employees. In January 2022, we launched a pilot at our Lockport Components location, with 53% of the hourly employees at this facility actively using the recognition program. We continue working with our union partners to find ways to recognize and engage represented employees.\n\nIn 2022, there were approximately\n\n1.1M recognitions sent\n\n1.9M recognitions received\n\n1.3M comments shared\nLabor Relations\n\nAt GM, manufacturing is our competitive advantage in building our all-electric future. The success of our represented employees and GM\u2019s growth are inextricably linked.\n\nThis skilled and experienced workforce comprises nearly 95,000 industrial problem-solvers on our Manufacturing Team. It is critical that we bring this workforce along on our EV journey.\n\nSince the beginning of 2020 through January 2023, we have announced the creation or retention of approximately 10,200 jobs as part of our investments in North America. These investments include the conversion of an assembly plant to EV production and upgrades in production capabilities for two other assembly plants. See An All-Electric Future. Equally important are investments in our workforce to ensure they possess the required skills to successfully launch our future EVs. See How We Invest in Learning at GM.\n\nWorking Collaboratively With Union Partners\n\nHealthy union relationships are built on effective communication. We engage with our union partners daily and provide opportunities for them to offer input into our processes. An ongoing priority is to ensure that our represented employees feel empowered as members of our Global Manufacturing and Operations Team and that their voices and ideas are heard on topics such as safety and quality improvement.\n\nIn 2019, GM ratified a four-year labor agreement covering employees at 55 United Auto Workers (UAW)-represented sites across the United States. This agreement provides GM-represented workers with a world-class wage, benefit and profit-sharing package, rewarding their hard work and supporting families and communities across the United States. It also outlines collaborative initiatives to enhance the health and safety of manufacturing employees as well as other aspects of the production process.\n\nOur National Committee on Advanced Technology, made up of both union and management representatives, meets at least quarterly to discuss the impact of electrification and other advanced technologies on our represented workforce.\n\nSupporting Employees Through Business Challenges\n\nWhen we face significant challenges to our operations, such as the global pandemic and associated supply chain shortages, we prioritize our represented employees by working to ensure the health and safety of all who are on the job.\n\nOur responsible employment philosophy extends to times when workers are displaced because of a plant production adjustment through measures including on-the-job training programs and various types of paid leave and supplemental unemployment insurance.\n\nFor example, we have had to creatively manage the complex and fluid global semiconductor shortage, which called for inventive ways to sustain production of our highest-demand, capacity-constrained products while developing long-term supply chain solutions.\n\nStrong Relationships\n\nGM works with about 28 unions globally, representing approximately 99% of our represented workforce\u2014or approximately 60% of our total global workforce\u2014who are covered by collective bargaining agreements.\n\nWe manage our labor relations regionally, with responsibility for labor relations held by the global manufacturing leader. Our leadership devotes time to work productively with our union partners and ensure they are updated on the business and pertinent issues. We hold regular meetings, including:\n\n- Quarterly meetings between our CEO and UAW leadership\n- Meetings between regional vice presidents of manufacturing and unions during manufacturing site visits\n- Regular meetings between manufacturing directors and local unions at plant sites\n- Daily discussions between plant managers and local unions\n\nThese meetings provide critical inputs to business decision making in a highly dynamic working environment.\n\nWe work continuously with our union partners to address unique issues within their respective markets. Collaborations in 2022 included:\n\n- In the United States, committing to invest $4 billion in Orion Assembly to renovate and expand the facility to begin the production of new EV trucks in 2024, including the Chevrolet Silverado EV and GMC Sierra EV\n- In the United States, committing to invest $760 million in Toledo Propulsion to produce drive units for the Silverado, Sierra and Hummer EVs, as part of our continuing transition to electric vehicles\n- In Mexico, committing to invest more than $1 billion in Ramos Arizpe Manufacturing for a new paint plant to prepare the complex\u2019s Global Propulsion Systems (GPS) and assembly plants to produce EVs\n- In Korea, focusing on our employees and product footprint to transfer employees to where they are needed and better ensure full employment\nVehicle Safety and Quality\n\nGM views safety in a holistic way. We engineer our products through a human lens of driver behaviors and the driving environment, developing features and technologies that can assist drivers and help keep vehicle occupants and others safe.\n\nOur Approach to Vehicle Safety\n\nAt GM, safety starts with our employees. All employees are trained to have an appropriate level of safety knowledge through annual training that conveys the importance of product safety. Product safety is also stressed during an annual Safety Week, which is an opportunity to strengthen our safety culture and collectively reaffirm our foundational commitment to keeping ourselves, our colleagues and our customers safe.\n\nWe bring together technology, safety advocacy and research to improve the safety of drivers, passengers and those outside the vehicle through:\n\n- Development of vehicle technologies to help drivers avoid crashes, reduce injuries and help save lives\n- Safety advocacy to support nonprofit organizations, such as Safe Kids Worldwide\n- Research conducted with world-renowned universities and institutions, including the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI) and the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI)\n\nA Holistic Approach to Vehicle Safety\n\nThe Vehicle\nEngineering advanced technologies and features\n\nThe Driver\nEducation and advocacy to help reduce driver error and risky driving behaviors\n\nThe Environment\nInfluencing vehicle and driving policies to make city and community infrastructures safer, including by providing insights to customers and governments\n\nDeveloping Safe Products\n\nOur Global Product Safety & Systems organization is responsible for vehicle safety systems, confirming and validating vehicle safety performance, identifying emerging issues and conducting field actions, including recalls.\n\nWe monitor crash data to understand where safety opportunities exist. For example, unrestrained occupants account for nearly half of in-vehicle fatalities in the United States, which drove the development of our Buckle to Drive feature. When turned on, this feature can prevent the vehicle from being shifted into gear for up to 20 seconds while reminding unbelted drivers and front-seat passengers through a chime and visual message to buckle their seat belt.\n\nWe design our vehicles to meet or exceed regulatory crash requirements, leveraging both physical testing and virtual methods. Our safety engineering development includes a rigorous safety peer review process to assess vehicle performance and incorporate our best practices and learnings into new vehicle designs.\n\nWe foster strong collaboration and communication between our Quality and Safety Teams. Metrics we gather about the efficacy of our safety features are also used to guide the development and enhancement of these features, as well as our overall safety strategy. See Engineering Advanced Technologies and Features.\n\nLearn more about our Quality Assurance.\nGlobal Product Safety Management Process\n\nSpeak Up For Safety\n\nOur SUFS program gives hourly and salaried employees and contractors an easy way to report potential vehicle safety issues and suggest improvements. Concerns are submitted through a toll-free phone number, a smartphone app, email or the SUFS website.\n\nWe view SUFS submissions by our employees as a measure of employee engagement in safety issues. By building a culture of safety, we attempt to identify issues sooner and reduce the number of impacted vehicles. A dedicated team evaluates concerns raised through SUFS submissions and escalates them as appropriate.\n\nIn 2022, we made enhancements to the program, including the user experience with the SUFS process. For example, interviews with prior submitters led to modifications in communication with and feedback for new submitters. We also implemented a user survey to gather ongoing feedback on user experience. To further monitor our safety culture, we conducted a Global Safety Survey to assess attitudes toward product safety and willingness to raise safety concerns.\n\nExternally, we maintain an open dialogue with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), including regularly scheduled meetings with senior agency officials. Expedited discussions, as needed, cover field investigations, safety recalls and other identified issues. GM also participates in meetings with NHTSA and other stakeholders to advance safety discussions that benefit the industry as a whole.\n\nSpeak Up For Safety Submissions\n\n| Since Program Inception | Approximate Annual Average (2018\u20132022) | In 2022 |\n|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------|\n| 38,937                  | 3,900                                  | 3,419   |\n\nOur Speak Up For Safety program and Safety Field Investigation processes help identify and investigate potential issues, while our Prevent Repeat Defects process captures lessons that will help us improve our standard procedures and prevent issues from recurring.\n\nGlobal Product Safety and Systems works cross-functionally to analyze recalls and address functional safety with the goal of ensuring that we do not repeat previous mistakes.\nRoad Safety In Collaboration With INRIX\n\nGM Future Roads is a start-up through which we are harnessing aggregated and anonymized data insights to understand factors that can impact and reinforce safety outside of the vehicle to help keep all road users safe. Its first product, Safety View by GM Future Roads and INRIX, is a cloud-based data insights tool. It is designed to provide transportation planners and operations managers with insights to help improve road safety. It provides crash, vehicle, vulnerable road user (VRU), and U.S. Census datasets and analytical tools to deliver a holistic view that supports Vision Zero and the U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s Safe Streets and Roads for All.\n\nVehicle Safety: EV First Responder Training\n\nWith a human-first approach to safety, we expanded EV first responder training efforts in the United States and Canada. The latest training program is aimed at first and second responders and focuses on how to safely approach and address emergency situations involving EVs. The four-hour, in-person program provides information about EV technologies and best practices for safely interacting with electrified vehicles during an emergency response.\n\nEngineering Advanced Technologies and Features\n\nIn pursuit of a world with zero crashes, we provide foundational vehicle safety through crash performance, thoughtful reminders, technology to help avoid or mitigate crashes, and other safety innovations.\n\nWe are continually developing a pipeline of safety and driver assistance features, such as Rear Cross Traffic Braking and Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB), which can avoid or reduce the harm caused by striking the rear end of a vehicle ahead. Similarly, Lane Keep Assist with Lane Departure Warning uses a brief, gentle steering wheel turn to alert drivers when it detects they are unintentionally drifting out of their lane lines.\n\nGM Safety & Noncompliance Recalls\n\n| Year | Global | North America |\n|------|--------|---------------|\n| 2018 | 50     | 29            |\n| 2019 | 44     | 28            |\n| 2020 | 57     | 43            |\n| 2021 | 60     | 47            |\n| 2022 | 44     | 36            |\n\nGM Safety & Noncompliance Recalls (Vehicle Volume in Millions)\n\n| Year | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021* | 2022 |\n|------|------|------|------|-------|------|\n| Global | 4.2  | 2.2  | 1.8  | 1.7   | 4.6  |\n| North America | 8.9  | 7.6  | 9.7  | 9.3   | 4.0  |\n\nNumber of Global Recalls with <10,000 Vehicles\n\n| Year | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Global | 16   | 15   | 30   | 34   | 30   |\n| North America | 50   | 44   | 28   | 57   | 43   |\n\n* Includes 7M Takata airbag-related recalls.\n\nGlobal recalls that involve fewer than 10,000 vehicles are one way we measure the effectiveness of our product safety management process. The ability to catch more issues early\u2014with a relatively low volume of vehicles affected\u2014and act swiftly is positive. The data above is also included in the total vehicle volume of safety and noncompliance recalls.\n\n51 Safety or driver assistance features are no substitute for the driver\u2019s responsibility to operate the vehicle in a safe manner. The driver should remain attentive to traffic, surroundings and road conditions at all times. Visibility, weather and road conditions may affect feature performance. Read the vehicle\u2019s Owner\u2019s Manual for more important feature limitations and information.\nLeveraging Renowned Research\n\nWe work with world-class research institutes to study how Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) technologies are making a real-world difference on the path to a world with zero crashes. We collaborate with organizations such as VTTI, UMTRI, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) and the Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI). We utilize safety data from many sources, including crash data from the NHTSA. Following a landmark police report study initially published in 2019, GM and UMTRI continue to collect data, to analyze the performance and field effectiveness of a wide range of GM ADAS technologies as police report data becomes available.\n\nBecause a key purpose of ADAS is to alert the driver to potential crashes, we have conducted significant research to determine how best to communicate these alerts to the driver. For example, the GM-exclusive Safety Alert Seat, developed with research by the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research, as well as with VTTI, can provide directional vibrations to help alert drivers of potential crash threats.\n\n52 Safety or driver assistance features are no substitute for the driver's responsibility to operate the vehicle in a safe manner. The driver must remain attentive to traffic, surroundings and road conditions at all times. Visibility, weather and road conditions may affect feature performance. Read the vehicle's Owner's Manual for more important feature limitations and information.\n\n53 Number of models with these technologies available or as standard equipment out of 35 models: 2023 Model Year \u2013 Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC models available in the United States.

The driver must remain attentive to traffic, surroundings and road conditions at all times. Visibility, weather and road conditions may affect feature performance. Read the vehicle's Owner's Manual for more important feature limitations and information. All results shown are from a research study conducted with UMTRI.\nEducation and Advocacy\n\nWe recognize the need to keep building public awareness of road safety risks by promoting safe driving behaviors. We invest in nonprofit relationships and initiatives to promote good behaviors such as seat belt use and educate on the dangers of impaired and distracted driving. Our current relationships and initiatives include:\n\nFor more than 25 years, GM and Safe Kids Worldwide have collaborated to help keep kids safe in and around vehicles through the GM-funded Safe Kids Buckle Up Program. Buckle Up has educated more than 29 million parents and caregivers, including around protecting young children from heatstroke. More than 2.3 million car seats have been inspected for proper installation and 792,000 car seats have been provided to families in need. In addition, 31 GM employees are certified Child Passenger Safety Technicians and volunteer to support Buckle Up events.\n\nThe Governors Highway Safety Association (GHSA) and GM are working together to combat distracted driving. With our support, GHSA published a report with 29 recommendations that State Highway Safety Offices (SHSOs) and their partners can implement to help address this pervasive and persistent problem. GHSA and GM have provided competitive grants to seven states and they are currently implementing recommendations in the report.\n\nAmerica Walks engages the public to advocate for safe, equitable, accessible and enjoyable places to walk and move. With GM\u2019s support, the organization is expanding existing communications, capacity building and training programs to create safe streets for everyone.\n\nCarFit\u00ae is an educational program developed by AAA, AARP and the American Occupational Therapy Association. CarFit enables mature drivers to assess how well they fit in their vehicle and identify opportunities for improvement through a checklist that focuses on 10 key areas. The program also provides community-specific resources that could help enhance driver safety through correct seat belt usage.\n\n\u201cWe have supported nonprofits with grants that focus on improving vehicle and road safety, from decreasing driver distraction to teaching mature drivers how to use new vehicle technology.\u201d\n\nAlexis Brandl\nManager, Corporate Grantmaking\n\nOnStar Safety Innovation\n\nOnStar is available to over 21 million connected vehicles globally through subscription-based and complimentary services. It is also available through the OnStar Guardian mobile app, available throughout North America. Launched in 2020, OnStar Guardian allows members, and up to seven of their family members and friends, access to key OnStar safety services from their compatible mobile devices, whether they are at home, out walking or traveling in any vehicle.\n\nIn late 2021, we expanded the service to include the OnStar Guardian skill for Amazon Alexa in the United States. Now fully launched, the skill enables customers to communicate with OnStar Emergency-Certified Advisors 24/7 by simply saying, \u201cAlexa, call for help,\u201d to any compatible Alexa-enabled smart speakers. In 2022, we added Guardian Motorcycle Crash Response using a customized version of our algorithm.\n\nWe work in collaboration with RapidDeploy, a public safety technology company working to accelerate Next Generation 911, to supply 911 centers statewide with real-time Automatic Crash response notifications in California, Arizona, Tennessee and Kansas, along with 10 other states. The number of states adopting this technology continues to grow. Certified emergency OnStar advisors coordinate with the appropriate 911 center for rescue and response. The advisors can relieve pressure on emergency call centers by triaging situations and providing verbal medical instructions through the vehicle speakers while responders are on en route.\n\nInjury Severity Prediction (ISP) is a feature included with OnStar\u2019s Automatic Crash Response service for subscribers in the United States and Canada. ISP predicts the likelihood of severe injury to vehicle occupants in a motor vehicle crash by using certain vehicle-generated crash data and other information. This is shared with public safety dispatch for first responders to mobilize the right type of support.\n\nAdditionally, Super Cruise\u00ae driver assistance technology is regularly updated via vehicle software updates. Super Cruise functionality is enabled by an OnStar data connection for real-time, precise positioning, periodic Super Cruise map updates and access to an OnStar Emergency-Certified Advisor.\n\nIncorporating Safety Into Electric Vehicles\n\nOur dedicated High-Voltage Battery Safety Team works to protect the EV battery in a crash, similar to the protection of fuel systems in ICE-powered vehicles. Our batteries are packaged below the seating area and designed as an integral part of the vehicle structure safety cage. We assess the crash performance of a high-voltage battery system, and our vehicles are designed to shut down and isolate the electrical system in the event of a crash or flood to avoid the risk of electrical shock. We play a key role in leading standards committees on battery safety through organizations like the Society of Automotive Engineers International.\n\n54 OnStar plan, working electrical system, cell reception and GPS signal required. OnStar links to emergency services. Not all vehicles may transmit all crash data.

Every person. Every site. Every day.\u201d This vision is guided by our Global Workplace Safety Policy, which applies to everyone working at our sites.\n\nSafety Governance\n\nWorkplace safety is governed at the highest levels of the company through monthly operating reviews with global functional senior leaders, including the CEO, and through the Global Safety Leadership Council (GSLC), which comprises more than 20 senior global leaders.\n\nWorkplace safety risks and control initiatives are reviewed on an annual basis, and updates are provided to the Board\u2019s Risk and Cybersecurity Committee. Workplace safety reviews are also a part of every meeting of the full Board.\n\nGlobal Workplace Safety (GWS) Strategy\n\nOur comprehensive GWS strategy highlights Culture, Knowledge, Systems, Data-Driven Decisions and Risk Mitigation. These five key focus dimensions enable us to achieve our vision as we aspire to zero injuries and fatalities. We have a three-year plan for each of these dimensions, refreshed annually with new initiatives to help us continuously improve.\n\nOur Safety Culture\n\nWe strive for a culture where each person decides to keep themselves and their team members safe\u2014\u201cPeople First, Task Second.\u201d\n\nTo help create mindsets where people consider safety and health in all that we do, senior leaders use a process called Safety and Health In Everyday Leadership Discussions (SHIELD) in meetings. Senior leaders ask probing questions within agenda topics to help create awareness and understanding of potential safety impacts. Using the SHIELD process has increased safety engagement during meetings and in overall decision making. Our Employee Safety Concern Process also provides a structure for employees to report potential safety issues.\n\nThe Manufacturing Leadership Team is focused on improving the effectiveness of High-Risk Global Performance Standards, which address pedestrian and vehicle interaction, electrical safe work practices, lockout energy control and fall protection practices. This effort has been expanded at the site level by developing high-risk performance standard teams led by site staff members and engaging all sites across the globe to accelerate safety culture improvements.\n\nIn 2022, we continued to incorporate leadership levers\u2014listen, empathize, collaborate, lean-in, build trust\u2014to drive safety culture change, conduct site safety culture assessments and deliver personalized one-on-one coaching to leaders in targeted sites.\n\nKnowledge: Hazard and Risk Identification\n\nWe aim for every person, at every site, to be able to recognize hazards, understand risk levels and feel empowered to address safety concerns.\n\nWe deliver training on topics that impact potential serious injuries or fatalities (SIF) in interactive, conversational forums. We openly discuss overconfidence, normalization of deviance and other biases which often lead to perceptual distortion and poor judgment. This helps employees recognize situations where they may be inadvertently putting themselves or others in harm\u2019s way.\n\nGlobal Safety Week\n\nGlobal Safety Week is about celebrating GM\u2019s commitment to safety. Participation is companywide, and in 2022 the GM China Campus in Shanghai once again supported GM\u2019s annual tradition. At the opening ceremony, 13 GM China Safety Heroes were recognized for their behaviors, efforts, contributions and actions in regard to safety.\n\nThroughout the week, special activities were organized for employees, executives and GM China Advanced Technical Center team members to refresh their knowledge of safety and remind everyone to focus on safety.\nSystems: Workplace Safety Systems\n\nOur global safety management system, Workplace Safety System (WSS), drives continuous improvement across all five global workplace safety dimensions: Culture, Knowledge, Systems, Data-Driven Decisions and Risk Mitigation. It is aligned with our continuous improvement philosophy and internationally recognized standards such as International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 45001.\n\nWSS includes a set of tools designed to drive continuous improvement through the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle. The system has five components across the PDCA cycle: Policy, Risk Identification & Control, Operation, Process Validation and Leadership Review. We use global procedures, performance and technical standards to reinforce our goals, objectives and behavioral expectations for safety. These are based on recognized international standards such as ISO, Occupational Health & Safety Administration (OSHA) and American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and are mandatory for all GM operating units.\n\nOur governance process for WSS includes annual site self-assessments, validations conducted by global or regional safety teams, and independent internal safety audits conducted by GM Audit Services, providing oversight to the Board.\n\nIn 2022, our sites continued to enhance WSS and created high-risk performance standards teams to accelerate safety culture improvements.\n\nData-Driven Decisions\n\nWe use a data management system to report, collect and analyze all safety information, including incident reports, audit findings, inspections, corrective actions and risk mitigation data. This data provides us accessible insights that promote effective, data-driven decisions.\n\nAny loss of life or serious injury in the workplace is unacceptable. Our target is zero, so that every person who enters a GM facility leaves safe and unharmed. We have a robust prevention program developed to promote the reporting and control of events that could result in severe harm or a fatality. Through it, we identify critical activities and develop global performance standards with mandatory safety controls.\n\nIn 2021, we introduced a SIF hierarchy of control (HOC) metric that is intended to focus our corrective actions on controls that have a higher level of effectiveness when compared to others. Engineering, substitution and elimination controls are much more effective at preventing recurrence of incidents than applying personal protective equipment (PPE) or administrative actions. We set a goal for 25% of our SIF actual or SIF potential events to have at least one corrective action aimed at engineering controls or above. We exceeded this goal by achieving corrective actions at this level for 39.7% of our SIF incidents.\n\nRisk Mitigation\n\nWe aspire to do business with companies and contractors that share our commitment to safety. In 2022, the majority of SIF events at GM sites involved contract labor. We work to provide contractors and temporary employees the necessary training to prevent safety occurrences and build a culture of safety while emphasizing contractor oversight. Our Safety Contract Management calibration method includes a series of assessments to measure contractors\u2019 engagement with our safety culture. We have also expanded our attention to supplier prescreening and on-site safety culture validation processes.\n\nOur EV Occupational Safety Team is continuing to assess opportunities, enhance mitigation plans and improve standards to keep employees safe across the company as our technology, facilities and work environments change. Comprised of around 30 subject matter experts from across the business, the group uses research, benchmarking and networking to create standards and training that support a safe work environment for people exposed to battery packs and EV manufacturing.\nGlobal Workplace Safety Performance\n\n**Lost Workday Case Rate** (GM Employees)\n\n| Year | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Rate | 3.05 | 2.85 | 1.40 | 2.28 | 1.96 |\n\nNumber of lost workday injuries and illnesses per 1,000,000 work hours.

Using expert guidance, our cross-functional team identified strategic priorities and focus areas, and has begun creating detailed action plans that will enable us to achieve our objectives, integrate robust processes across the business and achieve meaningful outcomes for people.\n\nPolicies\n\nGM\u2019s Human Rights Policy applies to all our global operations, including joint ventures in which we have managerial control. Along with our Supplier Code of Conduct, the Human Rights Policy also contains obligations for suppliers and contractors. In 2022, we further updated the Human Rights Policy, reflecting new provisions in the International Labour Organization\u2019s (ILO) Conventions regarding safe and healthy working environments.\n\nThe Human Rights Policy includes a commitment to respect all internationally recognized human rights and sets out our expectations on topics including ethical recruitment practices, diversity, anti-harassment, prohibition of unlawful discrimination, support of women\u2019s rights and equal pay, individual privacy, reporting and non-retaliation policies. It also describes our commitment to respect the rights of human rights defenders and people who may be particularly vulnerable.\n\nThrough our Supplier Code of Conduct, Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement, Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy, and Conflict Minerals Policy, we set out our expectation that our suppliers and business partners make their own commitments to human rights, including to the ILO\u2019s Core Conventions against forced labor, child labor, discrimination and harassment, and protecting freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. In accordance with our Supplier Code of Conduct, suppliers should cascade similar expectations through their own supply chains.\n\n\u201cRespecting human rights is a responsibility to which we have committed. And as we transition to an all-electric future, we continuously review our processes to ensure that we have the right policies in place to identify, prevent, mitigate and remediate potential impacts.\u201d\n\nClaudya Arana Sanchez\nGlobal Sustainability Strategies & ESG Disclosures Manager\nGovernance and Management\n\nHuman rights is an important issue addressed both by the Board and cross-functionally across the company. The Board provides regular oversight of human rights-related issues and topics, including routine workplace safety reviews, and addresses human capital management and supply chain matters as needed. The Board also considers human rights expertise as part of its annual environmental, social and governance (ESG) self-evaluation to ensure it has the requisite skills and expertise to oversee our ESG opportunities, priorities and risks.\n\nAs outlined in its charter, the Board\u2019s Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee (GCRC) has primary oversight responsibility for human rights and conducts reviews of GM\u2019s human rights practices, including responsible sourcing practices. The GCRC also oversees the development of ESG initiatives, strategies, policies, and sustainability and corporate responsibility practices that may have a significant impact on the company.\n\nGM\u2019s chief sustainability officer (CSO) is the executive in charge of our Human Rights Policy, supporting its implementation and regularly considering potential updates. Human rights-related responsibilities are distributed across GM, with senior leaders being accountable for setting strategy and overseeing day-to-day management of human rights matters related to their areas of focus.\n\nCommunicating Our Commitments\n\nWe aim to have our entire global workforce understand our human rights commitments and be aware of our Human Rights Policy. To achieve this, we developed our global communications strategy, which uses GM\u2019s internal company site, announcement and discussion platform, ERGs, location-specific social media channels and local leadership teams. The Human Rights Policy is available in nine languages, reflecting our primary operating regions, to promote ease of access and understanding.\n\nHuman Rights Due Diligence\n\nIdentifying Potential Impacts\n\nTo effectively prevent and mitigate potential impacts to people, the United Nations Guiding Principles defines how to identify what those potential impacts could be and prioritize them in a process known as a human rights saliency assessment.\n\nSaliency Assessment Process\n\n1. Evaluate\n\nConsider, through a cross-functional workshop, severity and likelihood of potential impacts to people across our value chain\n\n2. Validate\n\nDevelop and refine potentially salient human rights impacts with internal and external stakeholders\n\n3. Act\n\nAct \u2013 Prevent, mitigate and remediate potential human rights impacts to which we may contribute, as detailed in our Human Rights Policy\n\nIn 2021, as a part of our saliency assessment process, we conducted desktop research, reviewed industry analyses and connected with external stakeholders. We also held a series of interactive internal capacity-building and exploratory workshops with leaders from across the business and geographic footprint to identify and prioritize potential human rights-related impacts.\n\nIn workshops with a cross-functional working group, we looked at our value chain, and considered potential impacts to people throughout it and the severity and likelihood of each potential impact. Through this process, we derived an initial set of prioritized potential impacts.\n\nNearly all of the potential impacts we identified are systemic and not limited to GM or even the automotive industry. Nevertheless, we take seriously our responsibility to work to identify, prevent, mitigate and remediate potential human rights impacts to which we may contribute, as detailed in our Human Rights Policy.\n\nWe see the saliency assessment process as an ongoing exercise with potential impacts and prioritization that will likely change over time.\nPreventing and Mitigating Impacts\n\nWe work to recognize and address potential adverse impacts on people, and take steps to prevent, mitigate and, where necessary, remediate those impacts.\n\nWe rely on training as a tool to prevent human rights-related issues from arising, as well as robust reporting and internal review mechanisms to rapidly identify and respond to issues. Our aim is to achieve a best-in-class grievance mechanism. Our existing mechanisms include the GM Awareline, which is accessible at any time to everyone\u2014including our suppliers\u2019 stakeholders\u2014to report concerns. Through our Supplier Code of Conduct, we expect suppliers to share information about the Awareline with their workers, or establish their own mechanism. See Reporting Concerns.\n\nTo bolster our supply chain due diligence processes, we partner with the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance to promote comprehensive third-party assessments and certifications, in addition to continuing to work closely with the Responsible Minerals Initiative. See Supply Chain.\n\nWe are also expanding our diligence efforts to gain more insight into whether suppliers are meeting our human rights expectations. In 2022, we launched a new platform to help educate and build supplier capacity around human rights and other critical sustainability areas. See Supply Chain.\n\nEngaging Stakeholders\n\nStakeholder engagement is an important aspect of our approach to human rights. Hearing directly from the people our business may impact is critical to the development of effective policy. These conversations build trust and provide invaluable opportunities to learn and to co-create potential solutions. See our Corporate Human Rights Benchmark Disclosure (section B.1.8) for more information.\n\nPartnering to Address Human Rights\n\nWe help to advance human rights within and beyond our industry by engaging in a wide range of partnerships.\n\nIn 2022, we joined the Responsible Sourcing Coalition (RESCO), which aims to drive the mining value chain to go beyond risk management in its mineral sourcing work by connecting companies with Indigenous peoples and local communities. See Sourcing Strategic Raw Materials.\n\nTo strengthen our supply chain due diligence, we also joined the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) in 2022. We use the RBA\u2019s risk assessment and auditing tools to further our human rights monitoring efforts, including by identifying high-risk suppliers for whom we create corrective action plans to remediate risk.\n\nOur Approach to Social Sustainability\n\nIn 2022, we recognized the need to promote alignment across the many teams at GM working on social sustainability. In response, we hosted a series of internal workshops and benchmarking exercises that fostered meaningful conversations about what leadership looks like. Those discussions helped create a common sense of ambition around our shared goals. In 2023, we aim to build on these efforts to establish buy-in around common aspirations and roadmaps across four key areas:\n\n- **Human Rights**\n  - Protecting people through sustainable sourcing practices, robust processes that manage and avoid negative impacts and by strengthening standards in our supply chain\n\n- **Diversity, Equity and Inclusion**\n  - Accelerating GM\u2019s cultural transformation by designing new entry points, removing barriers across the company and designing products with accessibility in mind\n\n- **Well-Being**\n  - Helping our employees thrive physically, emotionally and financially through holistic programs, while making customer well-being central to our product design\n\n- **Climate Action**\n  - Driving toward an all-electric future by training our workforce, creating new career paths, supporting diverse suppliers and helping community members develop new skills\nStrong Supplier Relationships\n\nOur vision of a zero-emissions future relies on broad-scale commercialization of electric vehicles (EVs). That future depends on a supply chain that can provide the necessary components and materials, including advanced batteries and other technologies.\n\nOur global supply chain spans thousands of businesses and is built on strong and trusted relationships. These relationships, managed by our Global Purchasing and Supply Chain (GPSC) organization, are critical for product quality, availability, affordability and sustainability. To become the customer of choice for suppliers, we strive to improve competitiveness, mitigate risks, improve quality and efficiency in our value streams, and help to address societal concerns.\n\nOur supply chain strategy flows from GPSC\u2019s Priority Wheel, a set of customer-focused priorities that align with our supply chain objectives.\nSourcing Strategic Raw Materials\n\nWe know the importance of a resilient and sustainable supply chain. This is especially relevant as we expand our EV portfolio, where improving visibility and traceability in the supply chain is critical.\n\nTo manufacture our EVs, we require cobalt, aluminum, battery-grade nickel and lithium, as well as other minerals and materials. Aluminum has both battery and nonbattery needs, such as aluminum sheets for body panels and ingots for foundry applications. We pursue responsibly sourced materials at strategic tiers of the supply chain and explore where investment and partnerships can yield benefits and untapped value.\n\nWe are developing battery technologies that maximize efficiency and performance while minimizing their environmental footprint. We are also engaging suppliers to identify socially responsible and low-carbon aluminum products that can be incorporated into our vehicles.\n\nBattery Production and Supplier Agreements\n\nTo support an all-electric future, we have made critical investments to contractually secure all battery raw materials to support our goal of 1 million units of EV capacity in North America in 2025 (see Leveraging the Ultium Platform). We look for opportunities that align with our human rights and environmental objectives. In 2022, these included:\n\n**Glencore**\n\nGM and Glencore announced a multiyear cobalt supply agreement, providing the foundation for a strategic collaboration for the future of decarbonizing energy consumption through EVs. Glencore is a member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) and Glencore\u2019s Murrin Murrin operation in Australia conforms to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)-aligned Responsible Minerals Assurance Process.\n\n**LG Chem**\n\nWe reached a long-term supply agreement with LG Chem in North America for cathode-active material (CAM), a key battery material that consists of components such as processed nickel, lithium and other materials. LG Chem plans to provide GM more than 950,000 tons of CAM over eight years, enough for approximately 5 million units of EV production.\n\n**Livent**\n\nTo obtain battery-grade lithium hydroxide for higher-performance, higher-mileage EVs, we entered a long-term supply agreement with Livent. While materials are largely extracted at Livent\u2019s operations in South America, 100% of Livent\u2019s downstream lithium hydroxide processing for GM will transition to North America over the course of the agreement (six years from 2025). Livent is actively engaged in a Responsible Mining Assurance third-party assessment, has a gold rating from EcoVadis for sustainability and has announced a goal of overall carbon neutrality by 2040.\n\n**Lithium Americas**\n\nIn February 2023, GM agreed to invest $650 million in Lithium Americas, representing the largest-ever investment by an automaker in a company to produce battery raw materials. Lithium Americas is developing Thacker Pass, Nevada, which is the third-largest source of lithium in the world, and expects the extracted and processed lithium will support the production of up to 1 million EVs per year. Production is scheduled to start in the second half of 2026. GM will have exclusive access to the lithium from the first phase of the project and has the right of first offer on the second phase of the project.\nResponsibly Sourced Minerals\n\nMany advanced technologies, including in our expanding range of EVs, may use minerals and materials potentially mined in conflict-affected and high-risk areas.\n\nIn 2022, we joined The Responsible Sourcing Coalition (RESCO), an initiative of the Development Partner Institute. RESCO connects companies, including mining businesses, with Indigenous peoples and local communities.\n\nTo identify and mitigate human rights risk, we conduct due diligence practices through our Responsible Materials Program and our Conflict Minerals Program, which are aligned with OECD guidance. In addition, RESCO membership provides us with opportunities to engage with potentially impacted communities deep into our supply chain and hear from stakeholders in structured, regular engagements.\n\nIn support of our due diligence efforts, we annually request all Tier I direct vehicle component suppliers with cobalt, mica or conflict mineral (tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold) product content to complete the corresponding reporting templates (Cobalt Reporting Template, Mica Reporting Template and the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT)).\n\nWe use the CMRT to survey Tier I suppliers with products containing tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold (3TG) that were shipped to GM. In 2022, 100% of these suppliers were surveyed to gain visibility in the smelters or refiners (SORs) in our supply chain. We also surveyed approximately 2,700 3TG supplier locations for GM\u2019s Conflict Minerals Program in 2022. We received responses from approximately 90% of those supplier locations.\n\nThe Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) validates that SORs pass the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP) through a risk-based approach of processes for responsible mineral procurement.\n\nRMI uses its ESG Standard for minerals processor auditing, which we see as a valuable tool to develop transparency and to perform additional due diligence within our supply chain. The ESG Standard marks an expansion of the RMI\u2019s scope, going beyond the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas. We support the RMI Smelter and Refiner Audit Fund, which helps offset the costs of ESG audits for SORs.\n\nSince coordinated outreach can encourage RMAP participation among nonconforming smelters or refiners, we are active in the RMI and subgroups such as the Smelter Engagement Team, which enable direct engagement. In 2022, we sent communications to 46 3TG, 17 cobalt and two mica smelters, refiners or processors.\n\nSupporting Supplier Communities\n\nThrough our RMI membership, in 2022 we provided support to the Pact Youth Apprenticeship Program (Pact) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Pact implements various programs in the Lualaba province to reduce child labor in mining, including community sensitization, positive parenting training, coordinating community stakeholders and strengthening civil society organizations.\n\nSince 2017, Pact has assisted youth in the Kolwezi area to thrive in livelihoods alternative to mining by equipping them with vocational and business skills. Pact analyzes trade feasibility and profitability within a specific community, then identifies appropriate mentors based on character, experience, legal establishment and a local workshop. Adolescent miners aged 15\u201317 are then selected to undergo a six-month intensive apprenticeship in a trade.\nSupply Chain Engagement\n\nThe GPSC Team advances how GM and our suppliers achieve mutual success by providing better product quality, cost and durability to our customers.\n\nEngagement Programs\n\nGM Supplier Business Council (SBC)\n\nThe GM SBC consists of key suppliers who meet throughout the year with our GPSC Leadership Team, led by GM\u2019s vice president of GPSC. The SBC includes the Sustainability Sub-Council, comprising SBC and non-SBC members recognized for their work in sustainability, and a team of cross-functional GM employees. This group is the voice of our greater supply base on topics of sustainability.\n\nGM Supplier Business Meetings\n\nGM Supplier Business Meetings are held regularly throughout the year as a global webcast where key suppliers are invited to attend and where global topics are shared. Our Chair and CEO addresses this group annually.\n\nGM SupplyPower\n\nGM SupplyPower is an internet portal used to share information with suppliers, including sustainability event information, policies, guidelines, standards and reports, and best practices. In 2022, we added sustainability-related training programs that can help suppliers facilitate discussions within their organizations. In 2022, SupplyPower averaged 65,000 users.\n\nTraining Programs\n\nWe provide external training to support suppliers in the areas of environmental management, workplace conditions, sustainability, ethics and human rights. In 2022, we conducted supplier educational sessions, covering topics that included energy reduction, conflict mineral reporting template requirements and sustainable logistics.\n\nIn 2022, we also launched our Platform for ESG Educational Resources for Suppliers (PEERS), an eLearning platform with scenario-based learning that references specific challenges to sustainability. The platform offers webinars, content from Tier I suppliers that supports our supply base and other free resources.\n\nIn December 2022, we held our third annual Supplier Energy Symposium, with speakers from the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) Better Plants program, Consumers Energy, Clean Energy Buyers Association (CEBA), Adient and Edison Energy.\n\nEnergy Treasure Hunts\n\nIn partnership with our suppliers, we conduct energy treasure hunts to drive energy- and water-reduction efforts at Tier I and Tier II supplier facilities. The program\u2019s success is embedded in its collaborative framework, identifying potential energy reduction and financial savings opportunities at suppliers\u2019 manufacturing facilities. Each project uses an iteratively developed tool for data collection and assessment. These treasure hunts collectively provided recommendations to save approximately 14,000 MWh of energy and 41,000 cubic meters of water, as well as eliminating 4,600 metric tons of CO2 emissions.58\n\n58 Supplier self-reported data.\nCollaborating With Our Industry\n\nWe work closely with many industry- and supply chain-focused organizations, including the Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG), in which we actively participate in the Responsible Materials Work Group, several of its subgroups and sit on the Corporate Responsibility Steering Committee. AIAG fosters dialogue and collaboration across the automotive industry related to conflict minerals and high-risk materials. GM also partnered with AIAG to provide training to employees and suppliers through Supply Chain Sustainability eLearning.\n\nWe are members of the RCS Global Better Mining Initiative and the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA). IRMA advances responsible mining practice through a comprehensive set of standards and helps us conduct business with suppliers and partners whose standards and actions align with our own approach to integrity, responsible sourcing and supply chain management. It also fosters collaboration between companies to share best practices and drive transformation of the mining industry toward more responsible operations.\n\n~400 GM employees in 2022 received AIAG\u2019s Supply Chain Sustainability eLearning training, which highlights fundamental principles of responsible working conditions.\n\nKey Industry Collaborations\n\n- Automotive Industry Action Group\n- Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber\n- Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance\n- International Automotive Task Force\n- Responsible Business Alliance\n- Responsible Minerals Initiative\n- Responsible Sourcing Coalition\n- Suppliers Partnership for the Environment\n- Sustainable Purchasing Leadership Council\n\nSustainability in Logistics\n\nGM participates in various freight sustainability programs, including the EPA\u2019s SmartWay Partnership, which we have been a proud member of since 2013. In 2021, we increased our engagement with the SmartWay program by encouraging all our eligible logistics suppliers to join. As a result, in 2022 we received commitment from U.S. and Canadian carriers representing over 96% of our 2021 U.S. and Canadian truck and rail ton-miles. In addition, GM North America was listed as a SmartWay High Performer for shippers meeting the emissions and carrier selection criteria of the program. Through participation in Transporte Limpio, a freight efficiency program administered by Mexico\u2019s Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources, we are expanding freight efficiency efforts to include Mexican truck carriers.\n\nOur GM Logistics Team aggressively evaluates our logistics network for optimization opportunities, studying methods for improving efficiency and emissions reduction through redesigning routes, changing modes and adjusting frequency. The integration of carbon calculation methodology allows for increased visibility of CO2 emissions when reviewing and considering various network scenarios.\nIntegrating Sustainability Into Our Supply Chain\n\nWe envision an all-electric future for everyone, extending beyond GM to include our suppliers. Their commitment is a critical component of our vision of a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion.\n\nThe cross-functional GPSC Sustainability Team is leading efforts to integrate sustainability into all aspects of our supply chain, with particular focus on logistics, materials, packaging and supplier sustainability. Through our engagements, we aim to build strong supplier relationships. We also encourage suppliers to identify emissions reduction opportunities with bold goals and aggressive timelines.\n\nIn 2022, we continued inviting Tier I suppliers to sign GM\u2019s ESG Partnership Pledge. This pledge holistically embraces sustainability and asks our suppliers to:\n\n- Commit to carbon neutrality for their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions relevant to products or services they provide us\n- Achieve or exceed a minimum EcoVadis score of 50% by 2025 in the areas of Labor and Human Rights, Ethics and Sustainable Procurement\n\nBy the end of 2022, 68% of our direct suppliers, by budgeted annual purchase value, had committed to the Pledge.\n\nTimeline to Achieve Aspirational Carbon Neutrality by Supplier Category\n\n| Year | Category | Description |\n|------|----------|-------------|\n| 2025 | Professional Services | Suppliers working predominantly in offices providing software or nonmaterial goods |\n| 2025 | Manufacturing | Suppliers providing vehicle components and purchased equipment |\n| 2035 | Raw Materials and Logistics | Suppliers in carbon-intensive industries providing raw materials or primary resources and freight and transportation providers |\n\n59 Applies to products and services provided to GM.\nIn 2022, we launched an enhanced packaging feature within our Online Collaboration Tool (OLCT), designed to drive our goal to have 100% returnable, viably recyclable, reusable or compostable packaging by 2030 (see Circular Economy) by helping our suppliers to quantify the impact of packaging. The new OLCT Environmental Sustainability module asks our suppliers questions about the recyclability and sourcing of their packaging materials.\n\nGM\u2019s Supplier Sustainability Goals Framework enables us to assess sustainability within our Tier I supplier community, including Strategic Supplier Engagement (SSE) and key indirect and logistic suppliers. Additionally, it creates a pathway for GM suppliers to take increasingly bold steps toward a more sustainable future.\n\nOur GM ESG Partnership Pledge Guide and Supplier Sustainability Goals Framework for our Tier I suppliers communicate our supply chain goals, priorities and processes. Our Framework includes increasing levels of engagement from our suppliers with four distinct levels: compliance, commitment, growth and leadership. The framework allows for supplier-specific goals based on their priority assessments.\n\nGM Supplier Sustainability Goals Framework\n\n| Level | Level 0 \u2013 Compliance | Level 1 \u2013 Commitment | Level 2 \u2013 Growth | Level 3 \u2013 Leadership |\n|-------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------|----------------------|\n|       | GM\u2019s baseline requirements for our own suppliers | Making sustainability a priority, creating alignment, setting goals and achieving results | Furthering commitment while expanding sustainability into one\u2019s supply chain | A true accomplishment, recognizing a supplier as a pacesetter in sustainability |\n\nAll Tier I Suppliers\n\n- Terms and Conditions\n- Supplier Code of Conduct\n- Priority assessment\n- Goals across the ESG pillars (relevant, impactful, transparent, improving, linked to United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (UN SDG))\n- \u2265 4% year-over-year absolute CO2 reduction (Scope 1 & 2)\n- Sustainable procurement program\n- Supplier to cascade goals into own supply base\n- Minimum ratings (CDP, EcoVadis)\n- Industry leader:\n  - Leading innovator\n  - Ambitious targets (Scope 1, 2 & 3, SBTi, Zero Waste)\n  - Proactive actions\n  - Life cycle assessment (full)\n\nEnrolled Suppliers*\n\n- Score in EcoVadis\n- CDP participation\n- Industry specific participation (e.g., GPSNR)\n- \u2265 3% year-over-year absolute CO2 reduction (Scope 1 & 2)\n- Actively support GM\u2019s commitment to sustainable materials and packaging\n- Strong social sustainability commitment\n\n* Initially, Strategic Supplier Engagement (SSE) suppliers, key indirect and key logistics suppliers will be eligible to become enrolled suppliers.\nAssessing Performance\n\nWe use the EcoVadis platform to assess supplier management systems to support environment, labor and human rights, ethics and sustainable procurement. See Supply Chain Compliance.\n\nBy the end of 2022, approximately 90% of our direct suppliers, by budgeted annual purchase value, had enrolled in the EcoVadis platform. The average score of all GM\u2019s rated suppliers is approximately 51 out of 100.\n\nCDP Supply Chain Initiative\n\nWe have participated in the CDP supply chain survey since 2013 and have collaborated with CDP and our suppliers to accelerate environmental action.\n\nAll our direct material strategic suppliers are invited to complete the CDP Climate Change and Water Security surveys, in addition to a subset of indirect suppliers and our top strategic logistics suppliers. In 2022, direct suppliers representing 90% of our budgeted annual purchase value participated in CDP.\n\nWe reached a response rate of over 84% in 2022 among in-scope SSE and key logistic suppliers with the Climate Change survey. We are now aiming to increase participation beyond our targeted and strategic suppliers.\n\nCDP Supply Chain Response\n\n| Climate Response | Water Response |\n|------------------|----------------|\n| 84% response rate from enrolled suppliers | 69% response rate from enrolled suppliers |\n| $1.6B estimated annual monetary savings from emissions reductions | 78% reporting active targets and/or goals |\n| 55% of suppliers engaging their own suppliers | 52% reporting any water-related policy |\n| 60% reporting active targets | 59% reporting water accounting |\n| 35M (metric tons) estimated annual CO2e savings | |\n\n60 Data obtained from CDP.\nSupply Chain Compliance\n\nWe have high expectations of sustainable and ethical conduct of suppliers, who are expected to act consistent with our integrity, principles and values.\n\nWe are committed to upholding human rights across our network of suppliers and have several policies in place, including our Human Rights Policy, Conflict Minerals Policy and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy. When sourcing, we review criteria including meeting conflict mineral reporting requirements, CDP participation and EcoVadis scores when available.\n\nThe EcoVadis assessment includes evaluation of a company\u2019s policies and practices related to numerous significant human rights-related issues as reported by the company, such as working conditions, child labor, forced labor, human trafficking, diversity, discrimination, harassment, health and safety, and social dialogue.\n\nWe ask that suppliers participate in the EcoVadis platform in connection with their request for quotes. As of March 2023, over 900 GM suppliers have participated, including more than 200 SSE suppliers.\n\nThe GPSC Ethical Sourcing Team identifies suppliers below our minimum EcoVadis scores for Ethics and Labor and Human Rights categories and engages with them to implement corrective measures. We also have a risk remediation process for suppliers identified as nonconformant. Learn more in section B.1.6 of our 2021 CHRB Disclosure.\n\nOur Supplier Code of Conduct and purchase contract Terms and Conditions set out our approach to ethical practices. This includes our prohibition of child labor or any other form of forced or involuntary labor, abusive treatment of employees or corrupt business practices.\n\nWe aim to remedy supplier nonconformance to our policies and Supplier Code of Conduct. If we cannot mitigate the risk, we re-evaluate the business relationship.\n\nOur expectations also include compliance related to data protection and privacy, wages, hours and conditions of employment, subcontractor selection, antidiscrimination, and occupational health and safety. We also expect suppliers to cascade these or similar requirements to their own value chain.\n\nIn 2022, we updated our Supplier Code of Conduct to include:\n\n\u2022 More detailed expectations regarding labor and human rights, health and safety, environmental practices and business integrity\n\u2022 Updated expectations regarding treatment of human rights defenders, due diligence requirements for responsible sourcing, respect of land rights, implementing grievance mechanisms and appropriate internal management systems\n\u2022 Closer alignment with GM\u2019s Human Rights Policy, Conflict Minerals Policy, Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy and ESG Partnership Pledge\n\nWhen we become aware of violations or alleged violations of our Supplier Code of Conduct, we respond swiftly and appropriately, up to and including the termination of business relationships.\n\nWe conduct annual supplier self-verification surveys to validate adherence to the Supplier Code of Conduct and contractual obligations. Supplier responses to the survey are reviewed and, if required, escalated to remediate risk and noncompliance. We directly address any noncompliance disclosed in surveys or otherwise identified with suppliers.\n\nApproximately 3,500 suppliers participated in self-verification compliance surveys in 2022.\n\n86% of approximately 4,000 supplier locations are third-party certified to the IATF 16949 Quality Standard.\n\nGM Tier I suppliers must be compliant with IATF 16949 Quality Standards, which require responsible supply chain practices as well as policies on employee code of conduct, anti-bribery and ethics escalation policy (\u201cwhistle-blowing\u201d). Learn more in Human Rights.\n\n\u201cWe strive to align GM\u2019s business endeavors with our ESG goals. When these goals and values are shared across the supply base, it makes a difference in communities and the environment through supply chain tiers.\u201d\n\nMaryellen Salliotte\nSocial Responsibility Supervisor, GPSC Ethical Sourcing Team\nSupply Chain Disruption\n\nSupply chain visibility is key to proactively identifying and mitigating sustainability risk and impacts.\n\nOur in-house supply chain visibility tool integrates GM plants, Tier I, II and III suppliers, and logistics nodes to map geographic locations and relationships across our global supply chain. The tool also constantly maps and monitors supply chain disruptions and potential human rights issues worldwide, including those affecting members of our supply chain.\n\nThrough our monitoring process, we can identify suppliers potentially involved in human rights events and, with our Supply Chain Risk Management Team, notify appropriate GM Global Supply Chain Crisis Response Teams. These teams work cross-functionally with Tier I suppliers and our functional Purchasing, Logistics and Engineering Teams to mitigate potential human rights or sustainability risks. In addition, our internal teams determine ESG risks for each commodity and communicate ESG trends throughout the purchasing organization.\n\nHow We Monitor and Manage Supply Chain Risks\n\nSupply Chain Monitoring\n\n1. Use innovative tools and real-time data analysis to monitor catastrophic events (e.g., earthquake, hurricane) and isolated disruptions (e.g., factory fire, labor strike)\n2. Report all potential impacts to regional command center\n3. Receive information on suppliers and supply chain tiers through third-party services\n4. Factor risk scores into sourcing process\n5. Develop mitigation plan for high-risk areas\nSupporting Diverse Suppliers\n\nGM continues to build upon our legacy of leadership by helping diverse suppliers advance.\n\nOur Mission\nServe as bridge builders, connecting an ecosystem of diverse suppliers, communities, advocacy organizations and customers.\n\nOur Vision\nAchieve equitable and sustainable supply chain inclusion goals that ensure long-term viability for our diverse supply base.\n\nOur Aim\nEnsure that our connections drive lasting business relationships, customer loyalty and world-class parts and services that support our long-term viability.\n\nIn 1968, we became the first OEM to establish a formal supplier diversity program. To support diverse suppliers, we contribute to many community initiatives, aligning our actions with our vision.\n\nFor over a decade, we have attracted thousands of attendees to our annual Supplier Connections event to strengthen existing relationships, enhance our business acumen and identify new sourcing opportunities. Despite the impact of COVID-19, we supported advocacy partners, such as the National Minority Supplier Development Council, in preparing, positioning and propelling minority business owners to the next level of achievement during a challenging time.\n\nIn 2022, we invested over $123,000 in technical assistance programs, reaching more than 47 diverse businesses through key collaborations.\n\nLearn more about GM\u2019s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion program.\n\nRecognition for Our Work in 2022\n\nInducted\nInto the Hall of Fame by the Women\u2019s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC)\n\nRecognized\nAs the Forefront 50: Top Corporations for Minority Business by the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC)\n\nNominated\nfor Corporation of the Year by Michigan Minority Supplier Diversity Council (MMSDC)\n\nReceived\nExcellence in Supplier Diversity Award from Great Lakes Women\u2019s Business Council (GLWBC)\n\nGM is an active member of the Billion Dollar Roundtable (BDR) and joined as a charter member in 2001. The BDR was created to recognize and celebrate corporations that achieve spending of at least $1 billion annually with diverse-owned companies and promotes and shares best practices in supply chain diversity excellence through policy papers, webinars and summits. As a corporate member, GM aims to drive supplier diversity excellence through best practice sharing and thought leadership.\n\n$4.4B approximate spend with North America diverse Tier I suppliers\n\n$2.5B approximate spend with North America diverse Tier II suppliers\n\n\u201cWe are helping strengthen economic prosperity with diverse suppliers by utilizing certifying bodies, so that more diverse businesses run by women and those from minority groups can work with GM.\u201d\n\nPollyette Lenear\nSupplier Diversity Program Manager, Supplier Engagement\n\n\u201cGM is committed to building a culture and team that looks like the communities we serve. We are building bridges that connect people. Buying from small, local and diverse businesses changes lives. This builds economic wealth and empowerment in our communities.\u201d\n\nTamara Hicks\nAssistant Director, Supplier Engagement\n\n61 United States and Canada spend only.\n62 Tier II spend is self-reported by suppliers.\nSupplier Diversity EV Immersion Symposium\n\nIn October 2022, we invited our 50 largest diverse suppliers, potential suppliers and relevant nonprofits to Warren, Michigan, for our Supplier Diversity EV Immersion Symposium. Designed to give diverse suppliers insights into our industry\u2019s future, the event also helped business leaders learn how to align on a shared strategy for long-term sustainability as a GM supplier. Sessions showcased GM\u2019s new EV technologies and programs and considered how diverse suppliers can remain competitive in any economic environment.\n\nDiverse Media Suppliers\n\nIn the United States and Canada, GM approaches diverse media relationships through our stated action plan, using diverse media to enable engagement, economic empowerment and sustainable growth. The action plan is realized through five components:\n\n**Strengthened Commitment**\n\n- Increased Diverse Media Spend: In 2022, GM achieved our goal of investing 10% of our total annual media spend in diverse-owned and -targeted media, and we expect to maintain this performance in 2023.\n\n**Deeper Engagements**\n\n- Diverse-Owned Media Summit: GM hosted our second Diverse-Owned Media Summit in May 2022, attracting over 300 individuals and demonstrating our commitment to building relationships through communication and collaboration. During the Summit, we announced our partnership with the Michigan Minority Supplier Development Council (MMSDC) to sponsor Minority Business Enterprise certification and recertification of summit participants.\n- Vendor Profile Analysis: We encouraged diverse suppliers to submit an overview of their business to help us understand areas of opportunity for collaboration.\n- Quarterly Series: In 2022, we introduced a learning series designed to aid in continuous dialogue, information sharing and inspiration for diverse supplier owners.\n\n**Sustainable Growth**\n\n- Diverse Marketing Incubator Fund: GM is allocating $50 million over 10 years to support and scale diverse marketing companies. This investment is to support sustainable growth and is incremental to GM\u2019s media spend. The initiative is expected to foster equitable representation of media and marketing partners through three strategic pillars of business development, analytical capability and innovative creative marketing.\n\n**Increased Flexibility**\n\n- Revisited Payment Terms: GM was an early adopter to shorten payment terms and offer greater flexibility to our diverse-owned marketing companies, modifying our standard payment terms and reducing payment timing from 60 days to 30 days. This underscores our priority to create a win-win for diverse media companies and GM.\n\n**Expanded Opportunities**\n\n- Prospective Partnering Analysis: We expect our media buying agencies to follow a multifactor analysis for selecting diverse media. The analysis requires criteria for assessing capabilities, reach and analytics, and is expected to drive more opportunity for diverse media.\n- Diverse Owned Media Hub: We host a dedicated space, launched by GM, for the sharing of content, thought-leadership, programming and dialogue to promote and support engagement, empowerment and growth for diverse media.\n\nWe achieved our goal of investing 10% of our total annual media spend in diverse-owned and -targeted media in 2022.\nSupporting Communities\n\nOur vision is of a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion, and our Corporate Giving Strategy is designed to support this vision.\n\nWe create jobs and support local economies to advance social progress in the communities where we live and work. Our philanthropic focus is on investments that put people at the center. Learn more about our Corporate Giving Strategy.\n\nIn 2022, we provided $60 million in grants to more than 400 U.S.-based nonprofits to help create inclusive solutions to social issues. This funding is anticipated to impact over 7 million individuals.\n\nSee our 2022 Corporate Giving Report for details.\n\nInternational Giving Program\n\nIn 2022, GM launched an international giving program to direct over $1 million in philanthropic funds to five global regions: Canada, China, Egypt, Mexico and South America. Each region selected nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) within GM\u2019s focus areas to support. In total, we supported seven organizations and anticipate that around 3,200 people will be positively impacted.\n\n28% STEM Education\n8% Vehicle & Road Safety\n13% Community Development\n15% Climate\n24% Detroit\n12% Other (Inclusive of Community Impact Grants and Disaster Relief)\n\n\u201cI feel fortunate that through STEM and climate initiatives, we can teach students\u2014our future engineers\u2014about the environmental and technological advances we will need for a more sustainable future.\u201d\n\nSamantha Sugiyama\nManager, Corporate Grantmaking\nClimate Fund\n\nWe are broadening our social impact by helping to create a zero-emissions future by working with our peers and others to amplify our impact. Our $50 million Climate Fund, launched in 2021, helps community-based organizations innovate and include their customers in the transition to EVs and other sustainable technology.\n\nGrants provided by the fund align with GM\u2019s three climate-focused social outcomes:\n\n\u2022 Access to sustainable jobs\n\u2022 Access to more sustainable transportation\n\u2022 Community climate action\n\nProgram Highlights\n\nTackling Unequal Impacts with the National Wildlife Federation\n\nIn 2022, we partnered with the National Wildlife Federation as a founding member of the new Climate Equity Collaborative, an initiative focused on addressing the disproportionate impacts of climate change on vulnerable communities and youth. The Collaborative will engage with people from these communities, as well as nonprofits, to design and implement equitable and inclusive climate solutions. Through our Climate Fund, we have donated $1 million and we will co-design the Collaborative\u2019s framework and roadmap.\n\nClimate Fund: Expected Benefits\n\n1.1K\npeople gained access to programs that increase sustainability career readiness\n\n1.2M\nindividuals impacted by new or continued community climate programs like resilience hubs and environmental education programs\n\n19.8K\npeople gained awareness of and/or access to sustainable transportation solutions\n\nHelping Underserved Communities Access Infrastructure Funds\n\nTo help underserved communities access federal funding for electric vehicle charging infrastructure, GM gave Forth Mobility a $500,000 grant. The organization is experienced in developing electrification grant proposals and will help eliminate \u201ccharging deserts\u201d by supporting underserved communities. The funding will support the development of publicly available tools and grant application templates, as well as education and training to help transportation program staff and other decision makers use federal funding most effectively.\n\nEncouraging EV adoption in the San Joaquin Valley (SJV)\n\nGM supported the Central California Asthma Collaborative (CCAC) to launch the SJV Climate Equity Program, which will expand and integrate work to address climate inequity in one of the highest-risk regions in the United States. The project will carry out coordinated outreach related to EV technology, available light-duty EV and EV infrastructure incentives, and climate adaptation strategies\u2014such as wildfire smoke preparedness\u2014in disadvantaged communities in California.\n\nInvesting in Detroit\n\nAs home to GM\u2019s global headquarters, Detroit is a key focus of our Corporate Giving Strategy. In 2021, we announced the company will invest $50 million in grant funding by 2025 to nonprofits that are innovating in education, workforce development and neighborhood revitalization. This is our way of working to help Detroiters learn, work and thrive.\n\nBy the end of 2022, GM had disbursed more than $26 million through more than 120 grants to support nonprofit projects in Detroit and surrounding Hamtramck and Highland Park.\n\nLearn more about how we are supporting strong communities, including through employee volunteering and giving, in our 2022 Corporate Giving Report.\nResponsible Governance\n\nWe have robust governance structures and policies in place to manage our business in a responsible and ethical way. These strengthen our company, build a strong foundation for our sustainability strategy and help us address environmental and social issues.\n\nIn This Section\n\nCorporate Governance 89\nCybersecurity and Privacy 92\nEnvironmental Management and Compliance 94\nEthics 96\nPublic Policy 99\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great feeling to get to align our company goals and public policy related to electric vehicles and the environment\u2014and to have such an awesome team to work through the challenges each day.\u201d\n\nNic Lutsey\nManager, Climate and Environment Policy\nCorporate Governance\n\nThe Board is elected by GM\u2019s shareholders to oversee and provide guidance on GM\u2019s business and affairs. It is the ultimate decision-making body of the company, except for those matters specifically reserved for shareholders.\n\nAmong other things, the Board oversees company strategy and execution of the strategic plan. In addition, it oversees management\u2019s proper safeguarding of the assets of the company, maintenance of appropriate financial and other internal controls, proper governance and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nThe Board is committed to sound corporate governance policies and practices that are designed and routinely assessed to enable GM to operate its business responsibly, sustain our success and build long-term shareholder value. The Board also works with management to integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles into the company\u2019s business strategy. This includes agenda items and discussions related to ESG topics at Board and committee meetings.\n\nIn 2022, the Board updated GM\u2019s Corporate Governance Guidelines, Bylaws and several committee charters. Read more about these enhancements in our 2023 Proxy Statement.\n\nLeadership Structure\n\nThe Board is led by our Chair and CEO, who works closely with our Independent Lead Director. The Board comprises 13 members, all of whom, with the exception of our CEO, are independent, as defined by the Board\u2019s Corporate Governance Guidelines, which reflect the independence standards of the New York Stock Exchange and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nGovernance Best Practices and Shareholder Protections\n\nWe are committed to protecting the interests of our shareholders and believe that Board independence is crucial to this work. To achieve these goals, we follow several governance structures and policies, including:\n\n- Independence of 12 out of 13 directors\n- Annual election of all directors\n- Majority voting with director resignation policy in uncontested elections\n- Proxy access and shareholder right to call special meetings\n- Strong Independent Lead Director empowered with clearly delineated duties\n- No poison pill or dual-class shares\n- Annual review of the Board\u2019s leadership structure by the independent directors\nBoard Diversity\n\nGM\u2019s Board is composed of directors that have strong ESG expertise and possess a broad range of skills, qualifications and attributes that support our ambitious electric vehicle (EV) transition, growth strategy, sustainability and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) goals.\n\nBoard membership is 46% women, including the Chair and Independent Lead Director, with 17% identifying as racially or ethnically diverse. In addition, 50% of Board committees are chaired by women. See our 2023 Proxy Statement for more information about Board composition, succession plans and perspectives on diversity.\n\nCommittee Structure and ESG Governance\n\nThe Board has six standing committees, all of which, except the Executive Committee, consist entirely of independent directors. These committees help the Board develop and oversee GM\u2019s ESG strategy, including through delegated responsibility for specific ESG-related topics.\nShareholder Engagement\n\nMembers of the Board and senior management regularly engage with institutional shareholders. These engagements help us collect feedback on various topics, including strategic and financial performance, operations, products, executive compensation, and Board composition and leadership structure, as well as on important environmental and social issues. The constructive insights, experiences and ideas exchanged during these engagements have helped the Board evaluate and assess key initiatives during GM\u2019s ongoing transition to an all-electric future. Learn more about these engagements with shareholders and other stakeholders in our 2023 Proxy Statement.\n\nRisk Management\n\nThe Board has overall responsibility for risk oversight and focuses on the most significant risks facing GM. It discharges these responsibilities, in part, through delegation to its committees. The company\u2019s risk governance is facilitated through a top-down and bottom-up communication structure, with our CEO serving as chief risk officer. The Senior Leadership Team appoints members to our Risk Advisory Council, an executive-level body with delegates from each business unit, to discuss and monitor the most significant business and emerging risks in a cross-functional setting. They are tasked with championing risk management practices and integrating them into their functional or regional business units. We contemplate climate-related risks in our enterprise risk framework and continuously monitor changes to our overall risk landscape. See our approach to managing climate-related risks in our Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Report.\n\nESG Governance\n\nThe Board oversees ESG principles throughout the enterprise and has delegated specific ESG oversight responsibilities to each of its committees.\n\nAt the management level, GM\u2019s Senior Leadership Team establishes and executes the company\u2019s ESG strategy. This cross-functional group of senior leaders drive GM\u2019s ESG initiatives throughout the company, from global product development, portfolio planning, manufacturing, and supply chain and purchasing to human resources (including DEI and other workforce matters), legal, compliance, social and community impact projects. The Senior Leadership Team is supported in this work by our Office of Sustainability and ESG Disclosure Committee.\n\nGM\u2019s vice president sustainable workplaces and chief sustainability officer, reporting to the executive vice president of global manufacturing and sustainability, is the enterprise-wide leader for sustainability initiatives, and develops and coordinates sustainability strategy and efforts across the company. GM\u2019s chief of diversity, equity and inclusion, reporting to the senior vice president and chief people officer, is the enterprise-wide leader for DEI initiatives, and develops and coordinates DEI strategy and efforts across the company.\n\nThe Office of Sustainability is a cross-functional group that uses a \u201cteam of teams\u201d approach to guide sustainability initiatives across the company. It is chaired by the vice president sustainable workplaces and chief sustainability officer. The ESG Disclosure Committee is a cross-functional group that oversees GM\u2019s ESG disclosures. It is chaired by our vice president global business solutions and chief accounting officer, vice president sustainable workplaces and chief sustainability officer, and assistant corporate secretary and lead counsel\u2013corporate governance, finance and securities.\n\nExternal Stakeholder Dialogue\n\nFor the past decade, our Global Sustainability Team has engaged with stakeholders through Ceres, a nonprofit organization dedicated to transforming the economy to build a sustainable future for people and the planet.\n\nIn December 2022, Ceres convened a diverse group of stakeholders to provide recommendations and feedback that we will use to inform our goals and progress on climate, mobility and connectivity, human rights, diversity and governance.\n\nThe objectives of this dialogue were to:\n\n\u2022 Understand what actions certain stakeholders expect GM to take and what influence they expect it to exert\n\u2022 Determine areas where GM is seen as a sustainability leader and should continue its current strategy\n\u2022 Identify any perceived gaps to continue to enhance GM\u2019s sustainability disclosure\n\u2022 Highlight evolutions in stakeholder expectations and emerging sustainability trends for GM to consider\nCybersecurity and Privacy\n\nFrom electric vehicles (EVs) to connected, self-driving vehicles, transformative innovations are changing the nature of transportation and our relationships to the vehicles that move us. As connectivity becomes embedded in transport, new digital risks are emerging, making cybersecurity and data protection a critical aspect of our operations.\n\nCybersecurity Risks\n\nSoftware and connected services are key to GM\u2019s vision of a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion, and with the increasing connectivity of our vehicles, cybersecurity risks continue to evolve. Already, we offer OnStar and connected services to more than 21 million connected vehicles globally. Safely and securely delivering these services is possible due to a strong cybersecurity focus throughout the company.\n\nGM\u2019s vice president, chief cybersecurity officer leads a dedicated global team that works to protect the data and digital security of our employees, customers and vehicles. GM\u2019s Cybersecurity organization was recently restructured to report to the company\u2019s executive vice president\u2014legal, public policy, cybersecurity and strategic technology initiatives and corporate secretary to reflect the best practice of creating an independent cybersecurity office. The team is supported by the Board\u2019s Risk and Cybersecurity Committee, senior leadership across the company and a centralized cybersecurity office.\n\nUsing well-established risk frameworks and standards, we are focused on cybersecurity risks including information technology and intellectual property protection, vehicle and connected services, manufacturing safety and operations, supply chain and third-party security, merger and acquisition risks, and the secure integration of all new business models.\n\nCybersecurity\u2014ensured through both hardware and software measures\u2014is a high priority in the development of advanced driving features, semi and autonomous systems, in-market enhancements, connected services and many other software-defined services. See our Product Cybersecurity Policy.\n\nPrivacy Protection\n\nRobust privacy policies and processes are critical to protecting our employees, our customers and our business. We rely on information technology systems and networked products, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of our processes, activities and products. We also collect and store sensitive data, including personally identifiable information of our customers and employees.\n\nGM\u2019s Privacy Center publishes a Global Privacy Policy that covers all our operations. We also have a Third-Party Information Security Requirements Exhibit and Privacy Exhibit with additional privacy obligations that are required for all contracts involving personal information (PI), and we update these regularly. Our Board has approved the adoption of Global Privacy Principles, and we continue to be committed to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation\u2019s Consumer Privacy Protection Principles.\nPrivacy Program\n\nOur collaborative privacy practice is designed to ensure that our collection, use and sharing of PI is secure and compliant, and that it reinforces employee and customer trust and confidence.\n\nThe GM Privacy Center provides a privacy program framework that focuses on policies, procedures, tools, guidance and training. This framework also includes a Privacy-by-Design program that requires all data-dependent initiatives to receive a privacy-focused consultation throughout their life cycle. The Privacy Center is operated by our legal staff, who, when necessary, leverage additional nonlegal and external resources to help instill best practices across the company.\n\nOur greatest resources in protecting PI are our employees and processes. Privacy compliance is part of GM\u2019s annual Corporate Required Training, which emphasizes the importance of employee and customer privacy to our business. In addition, the Privacy Center conducts awareness training on emerging privacy laws and regulations with key areas of our business.\n\nPrivacy Practices\n\nOur Information Security program is aligned to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cyber Security Framework and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Standards and includes elements to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. Our robust Information Lifecycle Management (ILM) Policy and record retention schedule applies globally to all GM employees and others (e.g., contract workers, purchased services, etc.) that create or manage GM records.\n\nThe ILM Policy requires that we retain only those records needed to meet business, fiscal and legal requirements. We require a Privacy Impact Assessment to be approved by a Privacy Center member before the implementation or change of any new product, service or process involving the use of PI. Additionally, our Information Security and Risk Management has implemented a risk-based framework to apply additional controls to high-risk systems containing PI.\n\nData exports outside GM must be approved through our cross-functional data export review process, which evaluates the privacy, security and business risks of all proposals.\n\nIncidents\n\nWe have a robust process for employees to report incidents of possible wrongdoing, violations of GM\u2019s Code of Conduct, IT or other cybersecurity events, PI incidents or other concerns. This includes our toll-free GM Awareline hotline and a system for reviewing and investigating all alleged incidents. An employee who violates our Privacy Policy or Code of Conduct may be subject to discipline, including warnings, suspension with or without pay and/or termination of employment. Our Cyber Intelligence Team also continuously monitors publicly available information for cyber incidents or data spills that may impact us or our suppliers.\n\nCustomer Privacy\n\nWe disclose our privacy statements on consumer-facing websites such as our corporate, vehicle brand and OnStar sites. We use an opt-in approach for the collection, use and sharing of consumer PI where legally required or appropriate, based on the nature of the data collected and its intended use. We also offer opt-out options where appropriate.\n\nWe comply with all privacy regulations, such as General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act. We honor data subject requests under these regulations, including requests to access, make corrections to and delete data. We do not allow the use of customer PI for secondary usage if it is not disclosed in the Privacy Statement or otherwise consented to by the customer. In 2022, we did not have any material customer privacy complaints from regulatory bodies or outside parties.\nEnvironmental Management and Compliance\n\nGM is a global company with operations in diverse regions. In the course of our work, we must comply with multiple sets of regulations. To ensure we act in accordance with a wide spectrum of legislation, we develop internal commitments with an aim to match or exceed global best practice.\n\nAs a responsible corporate citizen, we provide global guidelines to help reduce the impact of our activities on the environment. GM\u2019s Management of Environmental Compliance and Guiding Environmental Commitments are the foundation of our updated Global Environmental Policy. The commitments are a guide for all GM employees worldwide, encouraging environmental awareness in daily conduct and in the planning of future products and programs.\n\nAlthough GM-owned and -operated facilities have their own operating plans, all function under the common Global Environmental Policy, which provides an effective foundation for environmental stewardship.\n\nWe have a robust process to enhance the integration of environmental sustainability practices into daily business decisions and to:\n\n\u2022 Comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations globally\n\u2022 Monitor our performance according to our own Environmental Performance Criteria (EPCs), which are universal corporate performance requirements designed to protect human health and the environment in accordance with the GM Global Environmental Policy\n\u2022 Conform to key sustainability performance indicators and environmental performance metrics\n\nEach GM manufacturing site has one or more environmental leaders, who are supported by a GM regional environmental leader and a team of subject matter experts in regional central offices. We also have an annual business planning process, known as Business Plan Deployment (BPD), to strengthen the management of environmental performance. This process links our Global Manufacturing salaried employees and their annual compensation to GM sustainability commitments. Performance on BPD metrics and goals is monitored monthly at all GM manufacturing sites. Action plans are developed as needed to keep performance on track.\n\nEnvironmental Compliance\n\nOur global guidelines play a significant role in our overall environmental compliance, ensuring that local plant policies:\n\n\u2022 Are appropriate to each plant\u2019s specific environmental impacts\n\u2022 Reinforce a commitment to comply with applicable laws and regulations\n\u2022 Include a framework for setting goals and delivering continuous improvement\n\u2022 Are documented, implemented and communicated to all employees\n\nIt is imperative that we comply with all applicable statutory, regulatory and permit programs and other environmental requirements. Compliance issues occasionally arise, and we treat each allegation of noncompliance seriously. In 2022, we received 26 Notices of Violation, 22 of which were in the United States. We paid two penalties over $10,000.\nEnvironmental Management System (EMS)\n\nAll manufacturing facilities that GM owns and operates, and most of our global nonmanufacturing sites, have implemented an EMS. Our EMS combines elements of ISO 14001 and management system elements that are unique to our operations.\n\nFrom 2019 through 2022, we developed and implemented an aligned, global, third-party certified ISO 14001 enterprise program. This integration ensures we perform our environmental commitments as a normal part of our business activities.\n\nWe continue to expand our EMS program, introducing it into our operations where we see a clear benefit. In 2022, we added one manufacturing and 10 nonmanufacturing sites to it.\n\nEnvironmental Performance\n\nWe implement GM EPCs in support of our environmental compliance efforts under our Global Environmental Policy at our global facilities and major technology centers. The EPCs are internal performance requirements for the management of environmental matters at our facilities. In many cases, they supplement applicable legal requirements by setting minimum standards for environmental management and performance practices that may be more stringent than those required by law. This supports our work to achieve a base level of environmental performance, regardless of where a facility is located or whether there are local environmental programs in place or not.\n\nWe track environmental compliance and sustainability performance in manufacturing operations by using the Manufacturing Excellence Indexes system. This is an internal GM scoring tool which provides real-time, common data to measure performance, assess risk and drive continuous improvement.\n\nManaging Substances of Concern\n\nWe have a two-tier system for evaluating chemicals used in our facilities to reduce the risk of exposure to workers and releases into the environment. We have centralized and site-specific reviews where experts in industrial hygiene and environmental and human health toxicology evaluate new chemicals. In addition, we work with our suppliers to reduce the presence of chemicals that pose a significant health or environmental hazard.\n\nGM has also established policies, procedures and supplier engagement to monitor banned substances and protect the health of our customers. We receive supplier data monthly and cross-reference it with known restricted substances lists to ensure compliance with regulations around the world. Our Vehicle Chemical Regulatory Compliance Team evaluates all materials, components and parts to verify they do not contain substances prohibited or restricted through GM internal standards, approval databases, the Global Automotive Declarable Substance List or the International Material Data System.\n\nEmployee Environmental Training\n\nOur employees are key stakeholders in our environmental stewardship and are critical to our environmental performance. In addition to specific facility, country or region training, we provide strategic training and guidance to our environmental professionals to help them keep pace with evolving environmental issues, changing regulations and best practices. Our training addresses a variety of areas specific to the regulatory requirements for air quality, waste management, water quality and other environment-related topics.\n\nEvery new employee working in a plant receives orientation training, which includes environmental training. Employees that need specific environmental management skills or knowledge for their role will receive additional training.\n\nEnvironmental professionals develop training goals through Workday, our human capital management portal and seek personal and professional development through a range of channels. In North America, environmental professionals attend sessions with internal and external speakers. Outside North America, environmental professionals take a Global Environmental Certification and Training Program focused on our Guiding Environmental Commitments and internal EPCs and industry best practices.\nEthics\n\nGM is dedicated to maintaining an ethical performance culture and living up to our core values and behaviors in everything that we do.\n\nOur business is built upon our vision, core values and core behaviors and we believe that the tone for our ethical performance culture starts at the top. Our Code of Conduct\u2014Winning with Integrity\u2014is a guide for how all employees, including the Board and Senior Leadership Team, play their part in fostering our ethical performance culture across GM and protecting our reputation for integrity in the marketplace. Our Chair and CEO and other members of our Senior Leadership Team regularly emphasize to all employees the importance of knowing the Code and striving to do the right thing, even when it is hard.\n\nWe monitor the presence and practice of our ethical culture by conducting surveys every few years and will conduct the next survey in 2023.\n\nThe Board's Audit Committee has oversight responsibility for our ethics and compliance program, which promotes a culture of high performance and high integrity worldwide. It is supported in its work by the Global Ethics and Compliance Center (GECC).\n\nThe GECC supports GM's efforts to prevent, detect and correct violations of law and corporate policies and helps promote our ethical performance culture. It is led by the assistant general counsel and chief compliance officer, who reports to the executive vice president\u2014legal, policy, cybersecurity, strategic technology initiatives and corporate secretary, and to the Board's Audit Committee. The chief compliance officer provides regular updates to the Audit Committee and attends annual private sessions without other members of management.\n\nGM received external recognition for our ethics and compliance program and ethical leadership, including:\n\n**Recognized**\n\nIn 2023, for the fourth year in a row, GM was the only original equipment manufacturer automaker recognized as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies\u00ae by Ethisphere\n\n**Won**\n\nGM won the Coalition for Integrity's 2022 Corporate Leadership Award\n\n**Recognized**\n\nIn 2022, GM Mexico was recognized again as one of the Most Ethical Corporations in Mexico by AMITAI\u00ae\n\nIn addition to aligning GM\u2019s ethics and compliance program with the recognized elements of an effective compliance program, the GECC manages GM\u2019s Code of Conduct and other ethics- and compliance-related policies and processes such as training, communications and misconduct reporting.\n\nWe regularly conduct independent third-party assessments of our compliance program and completed our most recent review in 2022. We also recently developed a risk assessment protocol that will modernize the GECC\u2019s ability to assess risk using quantitative and qualitative data, and plan to launch our first risk assessment survey using the new protocol in 2023.\n\nThe GECC has assumed certain anti-money laundering responsibilities and plans to publish an enhanced Global Anti-Money Laundering Policy. It will also continue to play an active role in supplier and strategic transaction due diligence in the EV supply chain, including by partnering cross-functionally in the development of our ESG-related investigations process.\n\n**Compliance Liaisons**\n\nCompliance liaisons are GM team members that help business units and regions by supporting local leadership in promoting our ethical performance culture and assisting the GECC in its compliance risk management efforts. In 2022, we continued to expand the program to further localize compliance and to serve as an additional knowledgeable resource for identifying compliance issues.\n\nThe GECC has experienced regional compliance officers to ensure our global ethics and compliance program is implemented uniformly with local customizations as needed. We also have functional and geographic compliance advisors that provide legal advice and support on a variety of legal risk areas, including safety and export compliance, antitrust compliance, data privacy and cybersecurity compliance, and records management compliance.\nCode of Conduct\n\nGM\u2019s Code of Conduct\u2014Winning with Integrity\u2014reinforces our commitment to maintain a work environment founded on integrity, mutual respect, trust and accountability. It outlines the policies and obligations that guide our conduct. The Code also includes information on the mechanisms available to report safety and other concerns and publicizes various points of contact, including local leadership, Human Resources, labor representatives, the GECC, Legal Staff, GM Audit Services and our Awareline.\n\nAvailable in nine languages, the Code applies across our entire company, including to subsidiaries we control. In 2022, we refreshed it with our \u201cBe Inclusive\u201d behavior, a new CEO leadership message and other relevant content. We also expect third parties, including suppliers, to act in a manner that is consistent with the principles and values outlined in our Code when conducting business with, and on behalf of, GM.\n\nConflicts of Interest\n\nWe maintain a robust conflict of interest disclosure process that applies to all salaried employees and members of the Board. Employees are required to complete an electronic conflict of interest questionnaire at least once during their employment and keep it updated as their personal circumstances change. Board members who are not employees provide written disclosure of any actual or potential conflicts of interest at least annually.\n\nReporting Concerns\n\nWe encourage our employees to speak up and provide resources to do so. Our internal \u201cReport Concerns\u201d site helps employees quickly identify the most effective way to report their concern.\n\nThe GM Awareline\u2014operated by an independent third party\u2014allows employees and others to anonymously (where permitted by law) report concerns in over a dozen languages at any time by phone, web or email. In 2022, GM received 5,715 reports to the Awareline; 4,039 were classified as allegations, with the remaining classified as suggestions, inquiries and other issues.\n\nWe track all reports of misconduct, whether through Awareline or another channel, in a case management system that allows us to preserve a reporter\u2019s anonymity while facilitating efficient investigation, follow-up and compliance trend analysis.\n\nAllegations of misconduct are reviewed and prioritized based on a number of factors, including the type of misconduct, the position of the alleged wrongdoer within the company and whether the allegation entails any potential violations of law. We give high-priority cases special scrutiny and review, and a cross-functional committee meets monthly to discuss their progress and resolution. Processes are in place to determine which cases require reporting to the Board or Audit Committee.\n\nSpeak Up!, GM\u2019s Non-Retaliation Policy, protects GM employees from retaliation when they raise a concern in good faith. Since the majority of misconduct reports are made to an employee\u2019s manager, we have developed a website with a range of helpful compliance tools for managers. We also offer a scenario-based course for managers.\n\nThe GECC developed and launched a post-investigation anti-retaliation survey in 2021. Its purpose is to initiate outreach to known reporters following an investigation, to identify and respond to potential retaliation and improve the investigative process. The survey was successfully piloted in the United States through 2022 and we plan to expand it globally in 2023.\n\n2022 Allegations Received\n\n| Category | Proportion of total |\n|----------|---------------------|\n| Accounting, Auditing and Financial Reporting | <0.1% |\n| Business Integrity | 5% |\n| Human Resources, Diversity and Workplace Respect | 68% |\n| Environment, Health and Safety | 13% |\n| Misuse, Misappropriation of Corporate Assets | 14% |\n\n| Category | Proportion of total |\n|----------|---------------------|\n| Examples: Fraud relating to accounting procedures, internal controls or auditing matters | <0.1% |\n| Examples: Fraud, conflicts of interest, corruption | 5% |\n| Examples: Interpersonal conflicts, harassment, discrimination, retaliation | 68% |\n| Examples: Threats and violence, substance abuse, environmental concerns, workplace safety | 13% |\n| Examples: Theft, property damage, information or IP loss, computer misuse | 14% |\nWe require all eligible salaried employees to complete Corporate Required Training courses annually. This is available in seven languages and we deploy new or refreshed content every year. In 2022, we achieved a 100% completion rate across our salaried employees for the required courses, which were:\n\n- GM Code of Conduct: Winning with Integrity\n- Cybersecurity\n- Product and Workplace Safety\n- Anti-Corruption Compliance\n\nIn addition to Corporate Required Training, we require our salaried employees to annually complete Code of Conduct training, certify their agreement to it, and declare that they have disclosed any new potential conflicts of interest and reported any suspected Code violations or safety issues. Board members receive in-person Code of Conduct training delivered by the chief compliance officer.\n\nTo ensure the effectiveness of our training, we regularly conduct third-party assessments of our training program against Department of Justice and benchmarking resources, such as Ethisphere\u2019s World\u2019s Most Ethical Companies\u00ae Evaluation Framework.\n\nWe require all eligible salaried employees to complete Corporate Required Training courses annually. This is available in seven languages and we deploy new or refreshed content every year. In 2022, we achieved a 100% completion rate across our salaried employees for the required courses, which were:\n\n- GM Code of Conduct: Winning with Integrity\n- Cybersecurity\n- Product and Workplace Safety\n- Anti-Corruption Compliance\n\nIn addition to Corporate Required Training, we require our salaried employees to annually complete Code of Conduct training, certify their agreement to it, and declare that they have disclosed any new potential conflicts of interest and reported any suspected Code violations or safety issues. Board members receive in-person Code of Conduct training delivered by the chief compliance officer.\n\nBeyond Corporate Required Training and Code of Conduct training, we use risk-based principles to provide live and remote training to thousands of employees each year on topics such as export compliance, antitrust, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, privacy, working with third parties, winning in the marketplace without sacrificing our values, the Speak Up! policy and other relevant compliance topics. We also use on-demand microlearning modules so that employees can access refresher training on gifts and entertainment and conflicts of interest processes as needed. In 2022, we launched a People Leader Ethics Toolkit that contains guidance on how to apply GM\u2019s ethics and values.\nPublic Policy\n\nOur global commitment to advancing an all-electric, zero-emissions future is unwavering. GM has consistently and publicly advocated for policies that support the adoption of EVs and help to address climate change.\n\nWe continue to work closely with governments worldwide to implement complementary policies and nonmonetary incentives, and build out infrastructure, low-carbon electricity and the overall manufacturing footprint necessary to the success of our all-electric vision and carbon neutral goals.\n\nTo reach our goals, GM\u2019s Global Public Policy (GPP) organization leverages the expertise of the GM team, industry subject matter experts, coalitions and industry trade associations. We carefully consider public policy challenges and opportunities and develop informed policy positions to effectively advocate for legislative and regulatory action that will support decarbonizing on-road transportation and the grid.\n\nIn September 2022, GM and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) announced a set of principles that seek to accelerate a zero-emissions, all-electric future for passenger vehicles in the United States. The recommendations were developed to support the critical next generation of national tailpipe emission standards, scheduled to begin in 2027. We encourage the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish standards aimed at ensuring that at least 50% of new vehicles sold by 2030 are EVs, so that the nation can achieve a 60% reduction in GHG emissions from new vehicles in Model Year 2030, compared to 2021.\n\nWe strongly support policies that will allow the EV transition to accelerate so the United States can be globally competitive. New technologies take time to scale and reduce costs. EVs are no different, but we are determined to ensure that the U.S. auto industry leads the way.\n\nIn August 2022, GM was the first automaker to publicly support the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The IRA incentivizes domestic production and sourcing of EVs and their components. We also engaged with trade associations on the economic advantages and climate benefits provided by the clean energy provisions, particularly the on-shoring and ally-shoring of the EV supply chain. For more examples of our work to advance our climate policy agenda, see our 2022 Sustainability Advocacy Report.\n\nAdvocating for Technologies to Improve Mobility\n\nGM envisions a future where we can all enjoy the freedom and convenience of vehicle use while also striving for a world with zero congestion. A combination of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology, new mobility solutions and supportive public policy will enable reductions in congestion as we continue to push toward a future of zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion.\n\nWe are engaging in policy discussions and relentlessly working on technologies that will make this future possible. We have a strong track record of collaboration with the public sector and community partners, such as the deployment of sustainable last-mile solutions and community-based EV ride-hailing programs. We will continue building on this foundation through engagement with a diverse array of stakeholders, crafting meaningful pilots and using our knowledge and experience to drive innovative policymaking.\n\nAs we explore future markets for our AV and fleet offerings, we work closely with communities to find solutions together. Gains in efficiency and safety create opportunities for more community access to employment, education and health care.\n\nWe are also optimistic that innovations in vehicle connectivity will help optimize traffic flows and reduce traffic crashes, ultimately easing congestion. To help achieve these objectives, we are focused on deploying advanced driver assistance technologies such as Super Cruise and Ultra Cruise, and self-driving technology through applications such as the Cruise Origin.\n\nWe have many examples that demonstrate the immediate benefits the deployment of our products can present, including our technologies in last-mile urban delivery solutions such as BrightDrop.\n\nCorporate Political Contributions and Lobbying Expenditures\n\nWe believe we should have a role in shaping public policy and addressing legislation that impacts our company, industry and stakeholders. We have and will continue to support public policies that drive our long-term, sustainable growth. Recent enhanced disclosures led the Center for Political Accountability to award GM \u201cTrendsetter\u201d status in their annual CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability.\n\nOur Board receives regular reports on the most pressing public policy issues and actively oversees our participation in the political process, for example by:\n\n\u2022 Adopting a U.S. Corporate Political Contributions and Expenditures Policy, overseen by the Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee (GCRC).\n\n\u2022 Through the GCRC, annually reviewing the Sustainability Advocacy Report, as well as all corporate political contributions, GM Political Action Committee contributions (which are funded entirely by voluntary employee contributions) and the process by which contributions are made. The committee also receives regular updates each year regarding the company\u2019s direct and indirect lobbying activities and expenditures.\n\nLearn more in our 2022 Sustainability Advocacy Report.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-04-27", "created": "2025-04-27", "metadata": {"Source-File": "climate_reports/tp_reports/general_motors_2022.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.1.59", "pdf-total-pages": 101, "total-input-tokens": 232475, "total-output-tokens": 62500, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 42, 1], [42, 5217, 2], [5217, 7132, 3], [7132, 10517, 4], [10517, 14312, 5], [14312, 15883, 6], [15883, 16987, 7], [16987, 17605, 8], [17605, 21304, 9], [21304, 23129, 10], [23129, 24955, 11], [24955, 30367, 12], [30367, 31426, 13], [31426, 32759, 14], [32759, 36043, 15], [36043, 41300, 16], [41300, 44940, 17], [44940, 45628, 18], [45628, 49909, 19], [49909, 52352, 20], [52352, 54805, 21], [54805, 61111, 22], [61111, 62112, 23], [62112, 65420, 24], [65420, 70498, 25], [70498, 74228, 26], [74228, 78617, 27], [78617, 83018, 28], [83018, 86142, 29], [86142, 86828, 30], [86828, 90077, 31], [90077, 91247, 32], [91247, 95349, 33], [95349, 98903, 34], [98903, 102046, 35], [102046, 103948, 36], [103948, 104053, 37], [104053, 106114, 38], [106114, 108217, 39], [108217, 110997, 40], [110997, 113393, 41], [113393, 118334, 42], [118334, 120080, 43], [120080, 124416, 44], [124416, 126794, 45], [126794, 130310, 46], [130310, 132237, 47], [132237, 136150, 48], [136150, 138804, 49], [138804, 141130, 50], [141130, 144379, 51], [144379, 145735, 52], [145735, 146191, 53], [146191, 148281, 54], [148281, 151165, 55], [151165, 154502, 56], [154502, 157630, 57], [157630, 160952, 58], [160952, 164653, 59], [164653, 167494, 60], [167494, 171169, 61], [171169, 173064, 62], [173064, 177766, 63], [177766, 180765, 64], [180765, 182984, 65], [182984, 186425, 66], [186425, 189489, 67], [189489, 194982, 68], [194982, 198680, 69], [198680, 202521, 70], [202521, 205004, 71], [205004, 207561, 72], [207561, 211320, 73], [211320, 215103, 74], [215103, 216004, 75], [216004, 219340, 76], [219340, 222780, 77], [222780, 225604, 78], [225604, 228490, 79], [228490, 230264, 80], [230264, 232984, 81], [232984, 234654, 82], [234654, 238642, 83], [238642, 240153, 84], [240153, 243332, 85], [243332, 246630, 86], [246630, 248118, 87], [248118, 251407, 88], [251407, 252080, 89], [252080, 254352, 90], [254352, 255282, 91], [255282, 259728, 92], [259728, 262800, 93], [262800, 266528, 94], [266528, 269453, 95], [269453, 273466, 96], [273466, 277508, 97], [277508, 281764, 98], [281764, 284331, 99], [284331, 289687, 100], [289687, 289687, 101]]}}
