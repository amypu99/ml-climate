Aviation is integral to our modern world, touching many sectors of the global economy and enabling personal human connections. That\u2019s why we title our report \u201cSustainable Aerospace Together.\u201d Each of us has a role to play to ensure we make the world better for future generations.\n\nIn this report, you\u2019ll see examples of our collective efforts and partnerships to advance environmental stewardship, human development and inclusion \u2014 underpinned by transparency at every level as we strive to make aerospace more sustainable, together.\n\nWorking Together for the Environment\n\nCollaboration with global industry partners, the energy sector, governments, nongovernmental organizations, higher education institutions and other stakeholders to advance sustainable solutions is more necessary than ever. To increase education around the commercial aviation industry\u2019s carbon footprint, and its ambition to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, Boeing created an innovative visual data modeling tool known as Cascade, which you will learn more about in this report. Cascade models the climate impact of the commercial aviation industry and explores paths to decarbonize and reach net zero by 2050.\n\nWithin our manufacturing operations, it is not just what we build, but how we build our products. We increasingly look at every stage of the product life cycle through a sustainability lens. Our people have worked hard to reduce our environmental impact by investing in conservation and procuring more renewable electricity.\n\n... continued on next page\nPresident and CEO Message\n\nWorking Together for Our Employees and Communities\n\nWe also continue our focus on providing a transparent, inclusive workplace culture in which teammates\u2019 voices are heard and managers are empowered to make meaningful change when necessary. Our latest progress and efforts in 2022 are seen within our Global Equity, Diversity & Inclusion report, including an increase in women\u2019s representation in our global workforce and racial/ethnic minority representation in the U.S. workforce and connecting incentive compensation to inclusion.\n\nWe routinely encourage use of our Seek, Speak & Listen habits in internal interactions. Quarterly enterprise culture surveys indicate that a majority of our teammates are comfortable discussing concerns with managers and feel comfortable telling others at work when they have made an error. Our goal is to provide a safe environment so that each employee\u2019s voice is heard.\n\nOur employees are also at the heart of our community work. Through our global community engagement efforts across Boeing, we support science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education initiatives; assist military members, veterans and their families; promote environmental stewardship; advance racial equity; and provide for communities in need \u2014 including disaster recovery and relief.\n\nTransparency at Every Level\n\nWe continue to prioritize safety, quality, integrity and sustainability every step of the way. Trust is earned one airplane and one interaction at a time. Our leadership team also works closely with the Boeing Board of Directors to help ensure industry standards and ethical practices are followed. Our Board and specifically the Governance & Public Policy Committee provides oversight and holds us accountable to our sustainability policies, practices and strategy.\n\nWe are in the era of more sustainable aerospace, and together, we look forward to achieving it.\n\nDavid L. Calhoun\nPresident and CEO\n\nOur Values\n\nHow We Operate\n\nStart with engineering excellence\n\nBe accountable \u2014 from beginning to end\n\nApply Lean principles \u2014 eliminate traveled work\n\nCrush bureaucracy\n\nReward predictability and stability \u2014 everywhere in our business\n\nHow We Act\n\nLead on safety, quality, integrity and sustainability\n\nFoster a Just Culture grounded in humility, inclusion and transparency\n\nImport best leadership practices\n\nEarn stakeholder trust and preference\n\nRespect one another and advance a global, diverse team\n\nInnovate and operate to make the world better\n\nRead more about our values\nMapping the Sustainable Aerospace Future Together\n\nDecarbonizing aerospace is both the challenge and opportunity of our lifetime. We have long maintained that decarbonizing aerospace will take everything \u2014 technology, policy, capital, energy, entrepreneurship \u2014 and everyone \u2014 employees, customers, financiers, regulators, academics and business partners. For that reason, we just convened global thought leaders and decision-makers from across these communities to review our progress to date and discuss the way forward toward achieving Sustainable Aerospace Together.\n\nAerospace is more than an industry. We connect people around the globe and promote an understanding of different cultures; we protect through national security and humanitarian relief; we contribute to the global economy with jobs, trade, technology and commerce; and we inspire young minds to seek careers in STEM. Commercial aviation also generates about 2.5% of the world\u2019s carbon emissions and 12% of transport emissions, so we must find ways to further decouple forecasted growth of aerospace from greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) \u2026 and continue to do so safely and transparently.\n\nThe engagement was energizing and encouraging as sector leaders leaned into the issues and potential roadblocks that could slow the commercial aviation industry\u2019s progress toward meeting its net-zero 2050 ambition. What struck me was the collective decision in tackling this issue together for the greater good of the industry and humanity at large. It was also a reminder that this hard to abate industry has historically solved hard challenges \u2014 from inventing flight to discovering the universe. It\u2019s with humility and resolve that we collectively take on the challenge of more sustainable aerospace.\n\nDuring the event, we also launched a public version of Cascade, a web-based application that uses public aviation and energy data to visualize how various approaches might be combined to lower emissions. It was rewarding to see our partners and stakeholders engage with the tool, and we can\u2019t wait for the global user community to further refine Cascade over time. We invite everyone to check it out at SustainabilityTogether.aero.\n\nThis Sustainable Aerospace Together Forum was a culmination of many activities and events that took place throughout 2022 with the same common theme \u2014 together. We made important progress over the past year with valued partners around the globe.\n\nTogether \u2026\n\nWe launched Cascade. At the Farnborough International Airshow in July 2022, we announced Cascade and provided a live demonstration of Version 1.0. Cascade was developed to visualize the climate impact of aviation across the world and explore scenarios to most effectively decarbonize commercial aviation by 2050: fleet renewal, operational efficiency, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and new aviation technologies such as transonic truss-braced wing structures, hybrid-electric, all-electric or hydrogen airplanes. This tool allows stakeholders across the industry \u2014 in particular customers and policymakers \u2014 to make informed decisions and trade-offs about how to best reach the commercial aviation industry\u2019s net-zero 2050 ambition. We look forward to the additional feedback from the recent public launch and will continue to invest in Cascade through collaborating with founding members of the Community to include IATA, NASA, University of Cambridge\u2019s Whittle Laboratory and the MIT Laboratory for Aviation and the Environment.\nWe advanced SAF. Nearly all industry and governmental decarbonization road maps conclude that SAF is the biggest lever we have to reduce GHG emissions from commercial aviation. Our company is focused on multiple areas to catalyze SAF scaling, including investing in airplane efficiency and compatibility, purchasing SAF for our own fuel use in our operations, engaging global regulators on smart policies, promoting robust sustainability criteria, and investing in Cascade to further industry partnerships and policy advocacy to scale up SAF supply and bring down cost.\n\nWe continue to make progress on the technical journey working with our suppliers to ensure our commercial airplanes are 100% SAF compatible by 2030. We are seeing exciting SAF innovation occurring in sustainable feedstocks and partnering on technologies including waste- and-biomass-based SAF, power-and-biomass-to-liquid and power-to-liquid enablers that can make existing and future SAF pathways more sustainable over time.\n\nWe purchased 5.6 million gallons (21.2 million liters) of blended SAF to support our commercial operations. The challenge remains scaling SAF availability and lowering its cost. Together, we\u2019ve made important progress this year on building the industry. Governments around the world are unlocking policy mechanisms to scale SAF, including a blending mandate and corresponding offtake requirement in Europe, and incentives such as the Blenders Tax Credit for SAF producers in the U.S. These policies and incentives are beginning to attract necessary capital to scale production.\n\nFinally, the Boeing ecoDemonstrator team partnered with NASA on emissions testing to better understand SAF and contrails.\n\nWe advanced the future of flight. While SAF is a necessary lever to decarbonize commercial aviation, we have a \u201cSAF and\u201d view and not a \u201cSAF or\u201d approach to achieving the commercial aviation industry\u2019s net zero goal by 2050. Together with partners, we continue to explore the safety and viability of other renewable energy carriers and technologies for aircraft. You\u2019ll read about several of these developments in this report, including our Wisk joint venture\u2019s announcement of the world\u2019s first self-flying, all-electric four-passenger vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) air taxi. As Wisk\u2019s go-to-market aircraft, the latest generation of this aircraft represents the first-ever candidate for type certification by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration of an autonomous eVTOL. We also value our partnerships around the world to advance sustainable technologies, such as the new Boeing Research and Technology center in Japan with a focus on sustainability. We are also honored to be selected by NASA for the Sustainable Flight Demonstrator program, which will inform future designs that could lead to breakthrough aerodynamics and future efficiency gains.\n\nThe aforementioned Boeing ecoDemonstrator program embodies our \u201ctogether\u201d theme and is celebrating its 10-year anniversary this year. The ecoDemonstrator takes promising technologies out of a lab and tests them in operational environments with a variety of partners, including airline customers, suppliers and regulatory agencies. From the first ecoDemonstrator in 2012 through this year\u2019s effort, the ecoDemonstrator program will have evaluated more than 225 technologies with approximately one-third of those getting implemented. Projects include technologies that reduce fuel use, emissions and noise, enhance safety and incorporate more sustainable materials.\n\nSustainable Aerospace starts within our four walls and Boeing continues to make progress on our 2025 operational targets as outlined on Page 53.\n\nSee Page 7 for a more comprehensive snapshot of our accomplishments last year and Page 45 for an overview of how we partnered around the globe to advance sustainable aerospace together.\n\nTogether as an industry, we\u2019ve made modern jet travel a reality, helped defend freedom around the world, and made space exploration possible. We now enter the era of more sustainable aerospace. The foundation we are laying now will be carried forward by future generations to preserve and grow the societal benefits of this industry. We are proud to be on this journey \u2014 together \u2014 with so many capable and committed partners around the globe.\n\nChris Raymond\nChief Sustainability Officer\nSustainable Aerospace Together\n\n2022 Highlights\n\nJanuary 2022\n- Wisk secured $450 million from Boeing to advance certified autonomous electric flight\n\nFebruary\n- Purchased 2 million gallons (7.6 million liters) of SAF for Boeing\u2019s commercial airplane operations\n\nApril\n- Announced multiyear commitment to Yale Center for Natural Carbon Capture\n\nMay\n- Named ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year\n- Boeing and MIT announced research project to help decarbonize aerospace\n\nJune\n- Unveiled 2022 ecoDemonstrator, a 777-200ER serving as a test bed for 30 new technologies to help decarbonize aviation\n- Became founding member of UK Innovation Hub to drive SAF development\n\nJuly\n- Debuted Cascade, a data modeling tool that visualizes how to get to a net-zero carbon emission future for commercial aviation\n- Boeing and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries partnered on innovative climate change solutions\n\nAugust\n- Debuted future flight concepts at Farnborough Airshow\n\nSeptember\n- Boeing and Alder Fuels unveiled concept of operations for urban air mobility\n- New Boeing Additive Manufacturing facility in Auburn, Washington, uses 3D printing to produce essential components, reducing waste\n\nOctober\n- Wisk unveiled world\u2019s first autonomous, four-seat, all-electric, vertical takeoff and landing air taxi\n- ecoDemonstrator program collaborated with NASA to test SAF emissions\n\nNovember\n- Partnered with Avolon, an aircraft leasing company, to scale SAF in Ireland\n\nJanuary 2023\n- Selected for NASA Sustainable Flight Demonstrator award\nConnecting Globally to Advance Sustainable Aerospace\n\n**Americas**\n- **Brazil** \u2014 Boeing Sustainability Forum: Boeing celebrated its 90th anniversary in Brazil at an inaugural summit with the Roundtable on Sustainable Materials and Brazilian-American Chamber of Commerce in S\u00e3o Paulo in September.\n- **U.S.**\n  - Summit of the Americas: Hosted a roundtable on sustainable aviation with IATA as part of Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles in June.\n  - Decarbonizing Aviation \u201cEverything for Zero\u201d: Hosted an event in Washington, D.C., in November, sharing Boeing\u2019s vision and a Cascade demo with U.S. and non-U.S. policymakers, legislators and think tanks.\n\n**Asia-Pacific**\n- **Australia** \u2014 Indo-Pacific Clean Energy Forum: Co-hosted a high-level SAF panel discussion in July in Sydney.\n- **China**\n  - Peking University Institute of Energy\u2019s Report Launch: Supported the report launch in October, which compiled results of SAF research.\n  - Boeing participated at the 1st China Civil Aviation Green Development Forum, which was sponsored by CAAC and in the Annual Civil Aircraft Industry International Forum.\n- **Japan** \u2014 Boeing Tokyo Sustainability Summit: Hosted a two-day sustainability summit to celebrate a new research center opening in August.\n\n**Europe**\n- **Belgium**\n  - European Parliament Sustainability Event: Organized a joint event with Ryanair in October, engaging with members of the Parliament, media, industry and EU stakeholders about ongoing policies and regulations that contribute to accelerating SAF supply and use.\n  - Conference on National Armaments Directors: Joined NATO\u2019s first Industry Symposium on Climate Change and Capabilities, which brought together over 150 representatives from NATO Allies and industry.

Please see our corporate governance materials for more information.\n\nSustainability is rooted in Boeing\u2019s values. The Board, and specifically the Governance and Public Policy (GPP) Committee, oversees a variety of sustainability topics and Boeing\u2019s Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO), Chris Raymond, is an Executive Council member reporting to Boeing\u2019s CEO. As CSO, Raymond reports the progress of Boeing\u2019s sustainability objectives and stakeholder-oriented reports regularly to the GPP Committee and the full Board. The Board reviews and provides input on the sustainability report.\n\nRead the Governance and Public Policy Committee\u2019s Charter.\n\nOversight of Political Activity\nTogether, the Board, the GPP Committee and senior leadership are committed to aligning political activities with the company\u2019s values, business strategies, long-term shareholder interests and long-term strategic imperatives. This includes regular discussions about the company\u2019s public policy priorities; the company\u2019s memberships in and payments to trade associations and other tax-exempt organizations; Boeing Political Action Committee (BPAC) strategy and expenditures; and the company\u2019s network of compliance procedures related to these activities.\n\nRisk Management\nWith over 100 years at the forefront of innovation, Boeing has established processes to identify, assess, mitigate and manage risk. It is the responsibility of the Board and senior management to ensure that we avoid imprudent risks and mitigate the strategic, technological, operational and compliance risks we face, all with our core values of safety, quality, integrity and sustainability at the forefront. Our Board has significant climate change risk expertise and management skills and experience, which is described further in the Proxy Statement. Senior management is responsible for day-to-day management of risk, including the creation of appropriate risk management policies and procedures.\n\nBoeing has two overarching risk processes: Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and Compliance Risk Management (CRM). All functions and business units participate in both ERM and CRM, including the Global Enterprise Sustainability organization. Global ERM and CRM risk assessments are completed annually to determine the most critical risks to Boeing.\n\nBoeing\u2019s sustainability organization, informed by internal and external stakeholders and augmented by a digital tool, determined the most relevant sustainability priorities to our business. You can learn more about our 11 sustainability priorities on Page 11.\n\nTo learn more about our lobbying and political activity governance, see:\n- Boeing\u2019s Oversight and Compliance Procedures for Political Activity\n- BPAC Contributions\n- 2022 Trade Association Memberships\nThe results from the risk assessments and sustainability priority assessment are compared for commonality, and overlapping risks receive additional monitoring and management. For example, Innovation and Clean Tech is a key priority for Boeing and our 2030 goal of 100% SAF-compatible current and future commercial airplanes is a key component to the commercial aviation industry\u2019s climate goals. Within the ERM process, Boeing mitigates and manages the key strategic risk to this priority and goal \u2014 the ability to scale SAF supply to meet the demand needed to achieve the commercial aviation industry\u2019s net-zero ambitions. SAF as a drop in fuel is currently approved to be blended at 50/50 blend with Jet A and works with existing airplanes and offers the largest potential to reduce carbon emissions over the next 20 to 30 years in all aviation segments. Boeing\u2019s intent is to help catalyze SAF scaling through subject matter expertise, investments in product compatibility work, purchasing SAF for our own fuel use, and our partnerships and policy advocacy. As mentioned on Page 45, Boeing continued to make key investments to scale SAF in 2022.\n\nWithin the sections of this report, we will continue to discuss our governance, risk identification and management of our key priorities.\n\n**Business Continuity Management**\n\nBoeing strengthens its resiliency through Business Continuity Management (BCM), managing and mitigating risks should a significant incident disrupt business operations. This entails five key preparedness programs: Business, Emergency, Information Technology, Supply Chain and Human Resources, working together to facilitate company resiliency. The primary objective of these preparedness functions is to develop and maintain guidelines, standards, processes and tools that enable business units and functions to mitigate risk and recover critical programs, applications and suppliers.\n\nBoeing navigated challenges in 2022 that added to the company\u2019s risk profile, including:\n\n- Social and political issues\n- Organizational and structural challenges\n- Regulatory review of the 737 MAX\n\nBCM continues to identify risks and to implement strategies and processes to mitigate those risks to our people, programs, infrastructure, network and supply chain.\n\n**Tax Governance and Compliance**\n\nWe are committed to being a responsible taxpayer wherever we operate. Our global tax team is responsible for maintaining the highest compliance standards, being transparent in our dealings with authorities and sustaining robust internal controls for risk management. Boeing\u2019s principled tax approach is grounded in ethical business practices and tax guidance that follows business substance.\nEnhancing a Sustainability Culture\n\nAnnual Incentive Plans Reinforce Sustainability Goals\nStarting in 2022 and continuing into 2023, Boeing enhanced its enterprise annual incentive design to incorporate climate and equity, diversity and inclusion metrics into the Company Performance Score formula, which determines payouts under the company\u2019s largest employee incentive plans. These include the Performance-Based Incentive Plan, the Employee Incentive Plan, the Management Incentive Plan, and the Executive Annual Incentive Plan.\n\nThe climate metric is designed to incentivize and reward employee behavior that reduces our energy consumption across the enterprise, and along with equity, diversity and inclusion and our other operational goals, accounts for 25% of the overall Company Performance Score driving payouts under our incentive plans. Individual performance is also taken into account in determining individual employee payouts under most of our incentive plans.\n\nLearn more about Boeing\u2019s 2022 company performance in our Proxy Statement.\n\nGood Habits: Seek, Speak & Listen\nTeammates across the company continue to build Seek, Speak & Listen habits, which are fundamental to how we work together. These habits are foundational to our culture of integrity and inclusion, and they enable us to improve \u2014 in safety, quality, production, performance and inclusion. Individual performance is also assessed using our Seek, Speak & Listen habit framework.\n\nBy embracing these simple habits, we make better decisions, drive innovation and build connection. We seek out the places where things aren\u2019t going well and where potential issues could arise, so we can learn and address issues before they become problems. We get all perspectives on the table and ensure every team member feels safe to speak up. We listen to each other with humility and grace. This is a key part of our commitment to collective progress, lasting cultural change and enhancing trust from within.\n\nThe habits are simple acts of caring so our people can be their best at work and in life. We will continue to embed the habits into our daily work, processes, systems and communications to hold ourselves accountable.\n\nOur Habits\n\nSeek\nBecause awareness can teach us and help us improve\n\nSpeak\nBecause it\u2019s the right thing to do and every voice matters\n\nListen\nBecause listening builds trust and leads to better decisions\n\nThe Olathe Pollinator Prairie, near Kansas City, is an ecological habitat supported by Boeing. (Boeing photo)\nEthical and Compliant Business\n\nBoeing recognizes that the company\u2019s long-term interests are advanced when employees are responsive to the concerns of employees, customers, public officials, investors, suppliers and the communities we serve. This starts with our Board who actively fosters a corporate culture that puts safety, quality, integrity and sustainability at the forefront of all that we do.\n\nBoard members commit to, and use, a Code of Ethics as guiding principles; the Code emphasizes the importance of compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations; maintaining confidentiality; avoiding any conflicts of interest; and reporting of illegal or unethical behavior.\n\nThe Audit Committee and the full Board oversee our compliance and ethics programs through close collaboration with Boeing\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer and periodic reviews of program metrics. These touch points provide visibility to the Board of significant compliance and ethics risks, as well as specific cases that are identified through the company\u2019s various reporting channels.\n\nLearn more about our Ethics and Compliance Program.\n\nThe Boeing Code of Conduct\n\nAt Boeing, our first commitment is to the people and customers who rely on our products and services to protect, connect and explore our world and beyond. Each Boeing employee has a personal responsibility to honor that promise and to serve as stewards of Boeing\u2019s legacy of aerospace excellence and innovation. New employees sign the Code of Conduct and complete Recommitment training when they join the company \u2014 and we all reaffirm this commitment every year. Learn more about our Code of Conduct and Recommitment.\n\nOur annual Code of Conduct signing and Recommitment remind all of our employees of their obligation to speak up and be a voice for others when something does not align with our values.\n\nRobust Anti-Corruption Program\n\nIntegrity is a core company value and Boeing strictly forbids bribery and corruption of any kind. Boeing\u2019s robust anti-corruption program includes extensive controls, rigorous policies and procedures, and an annual risk assessment to ensure effectiveness and identify potential enhancement opportunities. Learn more about our anti-corruption program.\n\nBoeing publishes an internal policy that explains its anti-corruption and anti-bribery requirements and expectations for employees, while making its guidelines for ethical business conduct publicly available to employees and other stakeholders. The company also makes employees aware of their federally protected whistleblower rights, which are designed to protect employees against retaliation for reporting potential wrongdoing by a U.S. contractor or subcontractor.\n\nUnderstanding Ethical Concerns: 2022 Data\n\n- 2,405 inquiries\n- 2,120 conflict of interest determinations\n- 3,132 investigative requests\n- 7,657 total contacts to Ethics and Business Conduct\n\n1. Data reflects the reporting period of November 2021 through October 2022.\n2. Inquiries comprise Requests for Guidance and Information Requests. Requests for Guidance are situations where employees are seeking guidance when facing ethical dilemmas or when they need assistance in understanding company policies or expected behaviors. Information Requests are situations where employees are seeking general information. Both demonstrate awareness of Boeing\u2019s Compliance and Ethics program, but Requests for Guidance are viewed as the most positive types of contact.\n3. Investigated matters are considered unsubstantiated when investigation findings demonstrate that no misconduct occurred or where there is a lack of evidence to support a finding of misconduct.\n4. Ongoing evaluations demonstrate that Boeing\u2019s substantiation rate is slightly higher than other published benchmarks, indicating an effective investigation process and informed reporting by company employees.\n\nContacting Ethics\n\nBoeing encourages employees, subsidiaries, suppliers and external stakeholders to promptly raise concerns about safety, quality or potential violations of the law or Boeing policies. For more information, visit our Boeing Ethics website.\nCommitments and Actions on Human Rights\n\nBoeing is committed to responsible business practices and promoting positive change while simultaneously creating value for our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders. In recognition of this commitment, the company has developed policies and practices designed to enforce our Code of Basic Working Conditions and Human Rights. Learn more about our approach to human rights.\n\nThrough our Supplier Code of Conduct, we establish foundational expectations of prospective and active suppliers, including adherence to human rights standards.\n\nStrengthening compliance engagement through localized support\n\nIn 2022, Boeing continued to make tangible improvements to its compliance program and meaningful progress toward strengthening its culture of compliance and safety at locations around the globe. The company deployed two localized teams \u2014 the Site Compliance and Ethics Officers (SCEOs) and the Ethics Ambassadors \u2014 both of which are embedded within the business and serve as amplifiers for the company\u2019s compliance and ethics efforts, resulting in thousands of engagements with employees.\n\nThe SCEOs are physically deployed at 22 locations around the globe, leading localized and targeted compliance activities. SCEOs partner with company leaders, leveraging site-specific data to proactively address risks and foster a speak-up culture. SCEOs also serve as an on-site resource for employees, engaging through floor walks and team meetings, new employee outreach, and manager trainings to answer questions, provide guidance, and help address compliance and ethics concerns.\n\nThe Ethics Ambassador Program, originally piloted in 2021, is currently deployed at sites including North Charleston, South Carolina; Mesa, Arizona; Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans; San Antonio; and St. Louis. Ambassadors are emerging leaders embedded within the business who extend the reach of the company\u2019s compliance program by fostering a culture of compliance and integrity by amplifying our values, listening to teammate concerns and encouraging them to speak up. Ambassadors also work with their designated SCEO to promptly elevate local risks and issues to site leadership.\n\nMesa Ethics Ambassadors: SCEO Larry Thompson (left) joins Mesa Ethics Ambassadors, employees and community members to help assemble 1,200 meal packages for local families as part of a volunteer event for United Food Bank in Mesa.

Safety is central to everything we do for ourselves, those we care about and our communities. The Safety Guiding Principles provide a framework to achieve the goal of zero workplace injuries so every person who works at, or visits, a Boeing site leaves as safe and healthy as when they arrived. Boeing\u2019s workplace safety program, Go for Zero \u2013 One Day at a Time, takes a holistic approach to worker safety, striving for a goal of zero injuries, which is underpinned by the belief that every injury is preventable.\n\nOur occupational health and safety management system is modeled after the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 45001. As of 2022, four sites are certified to ISO 45001 with multiple sites conforming to ISO 45001 in support of our business objectives.\n\nCelebrating 10 years of Go for Zero\n\nGo for Zero was introduced to help increase safety in our workplaces. Today, we take a look at how our company has performed in workplace safety since 2013.\n\n- **71% decrease** in ergonomic injuries (since 2013)\n- **31% increase** in lost workday cases (since 2013)\n- **26% decrease** in serious injuries (since 2015)\n- **39% decrease** in recordable injuries (since 2013)\n- **71% decrease** in ergonomic injuries (since 2013)\n\nContinuous improvement\n\nThe goal of zero injuries IS possible\nBoeing\u2019s Lifesaving Rules\n\nSafety is a core value at Boeing. Some operations performed at Boeing are recognized as High Hazard Processes due to their potential for a serious injury or fatality. Lifesaving Rules go beyond regulatory requirements and are intended to reduce or eliminate the risks created when around or performing these processes and prevent life-critical incidents by increasing accountability for following safety policies and procedures.\n\n- **Pedestrian/Vehicle**: Follow safe driving and walking rules.\n- **Chemical Processing**: Control sources of hazardous chemical exposure.\n- **Crane Operations**: Plan lifting operations and control the load path.\n- **Machine Operations**: Operate machines safely.\n- **Aircraft Towing**: Keep myself and others safe during aircraft towing operations.\n- **Hazardous Energy**: Verify control of hazardous energy or a zero-energy state before work begins.\n- **Working at Heights**: Protect against falls and dropped objects while working at heights.\n\n2022 Workplace Safety by the Numbers:\n\n- **44:1**: Near Miss to Hazard\u00b9\n- **98%**: Found/Fixed Metric\u00b2\n- **1,096**: Health and Safety Training Courses Available\n- **1.2**: Lost Workday\u00b3 (includes COVID-19 cases)\n\n\u00b9 Represents global data.\n\u00b2 Represents global data.\n\u00b3 Represents U.S., Canada, Australia and UK data.\nEmployee Well-Being\n\nBoeing takes a holistic approach to employee safety and overall well-being, including physical, financial and mental health components at work and at home. We value human life and well-being above all else and take action to improve many aspects of an employee\u2019s life.

Despite the challenging situation, the Ukraine team continued to work and grow during the war. Boeing is supporting the local team with everything needed to stay safe and online.\n\nA unified effort by Boeing and the initiative of individual employees kept the Ukraine team safe. Employees from Poland welcomed colleagues and other people who crossed the border to seek shelter in their neighboring country. The company provided housing opportunities for them in Poland and gave the team members who stayed in Ukraine financial means and the necessary IT equipment to work safely from home.\n\nIt comes down to this: Supporting Ukraine is a priority for Boeing and its employees. In addition to the support of the Boeing team, the company has committed $2 million to support Ukraine relief efforts. Boeing employees, with a boost from the Boeing Gift Match program, donated more than $1 million.\n\n\u201cIT is incredible to witness the team spirit of our colleagues in Ukraine. We admire our local colleagues for facing all challenges upfront. Our role is to provide them with everything necessary to continue their fantastic engagement with a laser focus on safety and care.\u201d\n\nSuzanne Purdum, senior director, Human Resources, Europe, Israel & Ukraine\n\nGrzegorz Stanny, a manager from Boeing Gda\u0144sk, and Kseniia Karpechenko, a colleague from Ukraine, who relocated to Gda\u0144sk.

(Boeing photo)\nBoeing Employee Assistance Program provides help in times of need\n\nWhy it matters: \u201cSome Boeing employees, like individuals in many communities, were impacted by tragic events and natural disasters \u2014 whether directly or indirectly,\u201d said Andrea Landsman, manager, Boeing Employee Assistance Program (EAP). Boeing offers an EAP to provide support to employees and eligible family members navigating difficult life events.\n\nA few examples of how the EAP helped employees:\n\n- **Conflict Zones:** In addition to providing emotional support to leaders, managers and employees during the war in Ukraine, the EAP offered local employees and their families help with locating emergency resources and information. In March, Boeing extended EAP services to European-based subsidiaries and contract workers to help them cope with the crisis.\n\n- **Pandemic Relief:** To assist employees in China impacted by strict COVID-19-related travel restrictions and lockdowns, EAP provided virtual group support for employee work groups in both Mandarin and English.\n\n- **Trauma Care:** Following the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas, in May and the Highland Park shooting near Chicago in July, counselors were available to support employees and provide information about the EAP.\n\n- **Natural Disasters:** The EAP prepared resources to support multiple natural disasters occurring in the U.S., including employees affected by Hurricane Ian in September.\n\n- **Stress Relief:** To relieve stress and promote emotional well-being, the EAP conducted 597 Mindfulness Meditation sessions with more than 3,100 participants.\n\n- **Suicide Prevention:** EAP coordinated with the Boeing Veteran Engagement Team (BVET) employee resource group to offer suicide prevention webinars to their membership.\n\n- **Mental Health Screenings:** All employees were encouraged to complete online anxiety and depression screenings to help assess their risks and learn about getting help if they needed it.\n\nOur final thought: The Boeing EAP provides support to employees and eligible family members at no cost. Professional EAP counselors can provide help with navigating life events, stress management, work-life challenges, grief and loss, substance abuse and more.\n\nAndrea Landsman, manager, Boeing EAP\n\n\u201cThe Boeing EAP was available 24/7 worldwide to provide counseling and other resources for our employees, some of whom were faced with very challenging circumstances.\u201d\n\nAndrea Landsman, manager, Boeing EAP\nGlobal Equity, Diversity and Inclusion\n\nEquity, diversity and inclusion are foundational values at Boeing and key drivers of business outcomes. Each member of our global team brings a unique perspective, and we grow stronger when everyone has an opportunity to contribute. We are committed to the necessary and challenging work of building an environment in which each teammate has a voice and feels inspired to achieve their full potential. Transparency is the foundation of this commitment, and we have been sharing our progress each year in our Global Equity, Diversity & Inclusion Report and our EEO-1 Report.\n\nRead more about Boeing\u2019s Global Equity, Diversity & Inclusion efforts in our 2023 report.\n\nView all Global Equity, Diversity and Inclusion data.

Data related to gender identity and sexual orientation are not shared with the government, unlike gender and race/ethnicity data, which Boeing is required to submit to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for U.S. employees. The gender identity options include female, male, nonbinary, not listed, prefer not to answer, transgender female and transgender male. Gender identity and sexual orientation participation rates are reported as of March 1, 2023. We will continue our efforts to educate and encourage all team members to self-identify and expand self-ID options outside the U.S. where it is safe and lawful to do so.\nGlobal Equity, Diversity & Inclusion Report reflects Boeing\u2019s journey\n\nBoeing recently released its third annual Global Equity, Diversity & Inclusion (GEDI) report, which shared demographics data, progress toward the company\u2019s six 2025 aspirations, and stories from across the enterprise and around the world about policies, teams and individuals who are making a difference. The report is an invitation to all prospective and current employees, suppliers, customers and community partners to join us on our journey toward becoming a more equitable and inclusive company.\n\nBoeing has roughly 156,000 employees representing 47 nationalities in 65 countries. In 2022 we hired more than 23,000 new teammates, resulting in an increase in female representation across virtually all job levels \u2014 production and maintenance, individual contributors, managers, directors and executives \u2014 and increased racial and ethnic representation in the U.S. at junior and senior levels. We also saw increased rates of participation in our self-identification process, which encourages employees to confidentially share their disability status, sexual orientation, gender identity and veteran status.\n\nKey Highlights Included:\n\nIn 2022, Boeing tied inclusive hiring processes to its incentive compensation: 92% of candidate interview slates in 2022 for manager or director-level roles included at least one woman globally, or at least one woman or racial/ethnic minority in the U.S., showing that specific, measurable and financially relevant accountability has an affect on incentivizing the right behaviors that naturally lead to more diverse outcomes.\n\nWe reformed our Racial Equity Steering Team (newly named Equity & Inclusion Council) to include Executive Council champions and representatives from each of our nine Business Resource Groups, which increased transparency and access to senior leadership. We also made progress on our six specific 2025 aspirations we announced and continue to report against.\n\nAs we look forward to 2023 and beyond, we are energized by the progress we\u2019ve made and are committed to continuing the hard work because it is necessary not just for our business success but also for the sustainability of aerospace and our communities.\n\nPay equity summary\n\nWe foster a diverse, collaborative and inclusive environment that empowers employees to do their best. Equal pay for equal work is a foundational element of our approach. We hold ourselves accountable to equal pay for equal work by conducting regular compensation reviews to ensure that employees are compensated equitably throughout their careers \u2014 independent of race, gender or ethnicity. It\u2019s the right thing to do and makes us a better, more inclusive and higher-performing company. We\u2019re committed to continuing and expanding our analysis globally and doing the work to ensure pay equity at the time of hire and throughout every employee\u2019s career.\nBoeing is dedicated to growing and developing a diverse pipeline of aerospace talent at all levels. Our professional development programs provide education and training opportunities for current and future employees.

(Boeing photo)\nGlobal Aerospace Safety\n\nSafety is a fundamental value. We take seriously the responsibility to ensure those who operate, fly on and service our products are safe.\n\nOur Board of Directors oversees global aerospace safety through a dedicated subcommittee of the board, the Aerospace Safety Committee, to which our chief aerospace safety officer provides regular updates. More information about the subcommittee\u2019s oversight can be found in our Chief Aerospace Safety Officer Report.\n\nIn 2020, Boeing began implementing its enterprise Safety Management System, or SMS. As an integrated framework for managing safety risks throughout the product and service life cycle, SMS incorporates data from employee reporting, production, compliance, quality and safety processes. This provides line of sight to risks, incidents and identified hazards to enable proactive mitigation of issues and to continuously improve safety performance. Ultimately, SMS brings the right data into the right forums with the right people to make data-driven, risk-based decisions that result in safer products. It is a journey of continuous improvement informed by existing data and ongoing development of increasingly better safety analytics.\n\nLearn more about our progress in the Chief Aerospace Safety Officer Report.\n\nBoeing\u2019s safety journey: Every step is purposeful\n\nThe big picture: The safety of our products starts with our culture and is supported by technology and training. Advancements in both areas have led to progress in our safety journey.\n\nWhy culture is first: When more teammates feel comfortable speaking up about safety issues and ideas \u2014 and more leaders listen \u2014 we will have safer products. Our Speak Up program is the fuel for our enterprise SMS that helps manage safety risks throughout the product and services life cycle. Through efforts in the past year:\n\n- Submissions to our Speak Up reporting channel doubled from 2021 to 2022 \u2014 a sign of progress toward a healthy reporting culture.\n- We trained more than 130,000 of our teammates on SMS, safety culture and why it matters.\n- We established a dedicated ombudsperson for FAA Organization Designation Authorization representatives to support their independence and transparency (see Page 29).\n\nHow technology and training help:\n\nAlongside culture improvements, advancements in technology are helping us identify safety hazards and risks through data, and are helping customers. Last year, we:\n\n- Introduced the Boeing Virtual Procedures Trainer and Maintenance Synthetic Trainer for pilots and mechanics to provide experiential training and complement current training.\n- Inducted a new real-time data and analytics platform called Boeing Safety Intelligence into our SMS.\n- Delivered competency-based training and assessment (CBTA) courses to four commercial customers. Additionally, Boeing Next-Generation 737, 737 MAX and 787 CBTA courses were approved by multiple regulatory agencies.\n\nWhy it matters: \u201cOver the next few years, we\u2019re going to see the maturity of our SMS, increased collaboration with our customers to get ahead of safety risks and deployment of our Safety Experience tool for increasing transparency and learning throughout the organization,\u201d said Mike Delaney, Boeing chief aerospace safety officer.\n\n\u201cEvery step is purposeful to make our products safer. These efforts and more have laid both the cultural and structural foundation for our safety journey. It\u2019s up to us to keep that foundation strong and build on it.\u201d\n\nRead more about our safety journey in the Boeing Chief Aerospace Safety Officer Report, including how we\u2019re working with industry to strengthen aviation safety and created a new Safety Experience website \u2014 a resource intended for employees to better understand their role in Boeing\u2019s safety culture.\nOmbudsperson empowers regulatory representatives\n\n**Dedicated focus:** In June 2022, Boeing established a dedicated ombudsperson for Boeing employees who work on behalf of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). These employees \u2014 known as Organization Designation Authorization (ODA) representatives \u2014 serve a critical role in the design certification and conformance of aircraft.\n\nODA Ombudsperson Mark Fava, a lawyer with more than 35 years of aviation experience, serves as a neutral, independent third party to advise and assist ODA representatives. He supports them on work-related concerns relevant to their delegated authority and related matters, including those associated with independence and transparency, without fear of retaliation or reprisal.\n\n**Why it matters:** The strength of the Boeing safety system is rooted in a transparent and open culture, one that gives all team members multiple ways to speak up when they have concerns. Boeing works every day to be trusted with the responsibility of holding an ODA, and the establishment of an ombudsperson demonstrates the company\u2019s commitment to strengthening its safety culture.\n\n\u201cBoeing is working to ensure the ODA program operates with the independence needed to fulfill all our FAA requirements. The appointment of a dedicated ombudsperson strengthens Boeing\u2019s commitment to foster an environment where ODA representatives carry out their duties independently and without interference.\u201d\n\nMark Fava, ODA Ombudsperson\nEngineering excellence, technically speaking\n\nBoeing Technical Fellows are shaping the future of Boeing and aerospace.\n\n**Why it matters:** Recognized as technology leaders inside and outside the company, the Boeing Technical Fellowship program represents the top 3% of Boeing\u2019s technical and scientific community.\n\n**Celebrating firsts:** Christin Datz, Hugh Wong and Helen Lee are among Boeing\u2019s newest Associate Technical Fellows (ATF). They also share other distinctions. Lee is Boeing\u2019s first Technical Fellow appointed in China. Datz and Wong are the most recent ATFs appointed in the area of Sustainability. Together, they will help innovate and continue integrating sustainability into Boeing\u2019s engineering teams and functions to make our products, services and operations better for people and the environment.\n\n- Datz is an expert on life cycle assessment tools and their application to Boeing\u2019s design processes, providing critical proof points about how we use sustainability principles in our product development and design.\n- Wong is a technical expert in conceptual commercial aircraft design and analysis, and specializes in creating engineering tools and methods for design and analysis of aircraft with alternative energy and propulsion systems. Wong helped develop Cascade, Boeing\u2019s emissions modeling and analysis tool.\n- Lee is the regional director of airspace and airport programs for Boeing China\u2019s Global Support Center, supporting the Greater China region. In her role, Lee thinks about ways advanced technologies like artificial intelligence can be applied to improve air traffic management operations.\n\n**It comes down to this:** Technical Fellows are trusted consultants, advisers and mentors, and possess expertise in a variety of areas spanning the full life cycle of all Boeing products, processes and services, across a number of engineering disciplines.\n\n\u201cThe breadth and depth of our Technical Fellowship is unique to the industry, and we count on our fellows to be stewards of technical excellence across the enterprise. This group will continue to strengthen our company and represent engineering excellence throughout the industry.\u201d\n\nHoward McKenzie, Boeing chief engineer and executive vice president of Engineering, Test & Technology\nSustainable Product Life Cycle\n\nBoeing increasingly looks at every stage of the product life cycle through a sustainability lens.\n\nWe continue to evolve our approach so that our next generation of products consider the full breadth of sustainability including environmental, health, safety and human factors improvements by targeting the following seven areas:\n\n**Demand/Sales.** Customers continue to demand higher-efficiency, lower emissions products. Globally, airlines and governments are increasingly accountable to emerging sustainability standards, which requires that they evaluate the life cycle of aircraft they operate.\n\n**Cascade:** Boeing\u2019s data modeling and visualization tool quantifies the potential of four strategies to cut emissions, including fleet renewal, operational efficiency, renewable energy and future aircraft introduction.\n\n**Design/Technology.** Boeing evaluates new product designs and technologies to determine if they are safe and sustainable by conducting an environmental life cycle assessment. We strive to evaluate new aircraft design concepts, materials and technologies early in the development process to assess how much we can reduce the risks and expenses associated with its environmental footprint. We aim to examine whether more sustainable approaches exist for new product design, considering everything from selecting materials and parts to improving manufacturing processes and in-service operations to recycling the plane.\n\n**SAF-Compatible Commercial Airplanes:** Boeing is collaborating with suppliers to achieve our goal that all commercial airplanes we deliver by 2030 will be compatible with SAF.\n\n**Materials/Feedstocks.** Boeing examines coatings that improve our planes\u2019 aerodynamics, fuel efficiency and longevity, in part by using more parts that can be repurposed. Lighter composite materials permit us to design more fuel-efficient aircraft like our primarily composite 787 Dreamliner. Boeing simultaneously supports research into regenerative feedstocks that can replace constituents that are nonrenewable resources. For example, the bio-based regenerative feedstocks from forestry waste and pine root oil that we are researching at Villanova University may one day be integrated into the epoxy resins used in our interior parts, enabling us to reduce the feedstock-related emissions from extraction and refining compared to petrochemical-based feedstocks. Meantime, we recycle the metals used in manufacturing our aircraft back into our supply chain, reducing reliance on virgin materials.\n\n\u201cAcross Boeing Defense, Space & Security, we believe that operational effectiveness and sustainability are two sides of the same coin. A more sustainable, lower cost, energy efficient defense enterprise is a more operationally effective one. That\u2019s why we have a history of partnering with our customers to pioneer the use of sustainable aviation fuels and are leveraging digital design and production to reduce our carbon footprint throughout the life cycle of our products.\u201d\n\nTed Colbert, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security\nParts. Boeing aims to reduce carbon emissions and waste from parts, components and systems procured from suppliers. We reduce carbon emissions from the movement of millions of airplane spare parts by consolidating shipments, eliminating single-use packaging and redesigning warehousing networks to regional hubs. In addition, we use additive manufacturing to 3D print some of our own parts. Doing so allows us to change the designs of some parts in a way that can lessen their environmental impact by creating lighter consolidated parts that use less raw material, fewer machining processes and leave less waste. See Page 64 for more information.\n\nSupplier Collaboration: In 2021, Boeing co-founded an industry effort through the International Aerospace Environmental Group to establish a voluntary sectoral framework for ESG engagement, including assessment and awareness, throughout the aerospace manufacturing industry.\n\nUsed Serviceable Material Offerings: Boeing Service business provides access to recertified used parts from retired aircraft called used serviceable material.\n\nBuild/Test. Reducing waste from operations while boosting the use of renewable energy and digital technologies can help our manufacturing and other work sites reduce their environmental impact while building and testing a product.

We are focused on four key areas: fleet renewal, operational efficiency, renewable energy and advanced technology. In 2022 we set ambitious 2030 targets related to our products, and throughout this section we share progress toward those goals and essential partnerships that will help us achieve them.\n\nMore about the governance of this strategy can be found in the Approach & Governance Section on Page 13 of this report.\n\nThe Cascade effect\n\nBoeing debuted The Boeing Cascade Climate Impact Model (Cascade) at the Farnborough International Airshow in 2022. This web application uses digital technical data pulled from across the world to visualize how introducing various sustainable aviation options would impact global emissions. Cascade uses life cycle modeling to accurately quantify how choices in the four key areas impact the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide.\n\nCascade is a way to visualize the climate impact of global commercial aviation while creating scenarios to calculate what kind of positive impacts our levers to decarbonize aviation would have on carbon emissions: fleet renewal, operational efficiency, renewable energy and new aviation technologies like hybrid, electric or hydrogen airplanes.\n\nWhy it matters: It\u2019s a data-driven way for our stakeholders to make informed decisions about how to reach the commercial aviation industry\u2019s net-zero 2050 ambition.\n\nLearn more about Cascade\n\n\u201cCascade helps airline operators, industry partners and policymakers see when, where and how different energy carriers and life cycle emissions affect their sustainability goals. The tool shows how incremental changes can cut emissions in commercial aviation.\u201d\n\nNeil Titchener, program leader, Cascade.\n\n(Boeing photo)\nFour Strategies to Advance Sustainable Aerospace Together\n\n- Fleet Renewal\n- Operational Efficiency\n- Renewable Energy\n- Advanced Technology\n\nCross-sector global partnerships required\nFleet Renewal\n\nNew airplanes provide significant efficiency gains \u2014 historically each generation reduces fuel use and emissions 15%-25%. Deploying the latest generation of airplanes is one of the most significant contributions to CO2 emissions reduction available over the next decade. Boeing will continue to invest in efficiencies that reduce fuel use and carbon emissions. More detail on the sustainability of Boeing\u2019s products can be found here.\n\nNew orders mean more efficient fleets\n\n774 big things: In 2022, our customers ordered 774 new commercial aircraft. New airplanes provide significant efficiency gains \u2014 each generation has reduced fuel use and emissions by 15%-25%.\n\nWhy it matters: Deploying the latest generation of airplanes is one of the most significant contributions to reducing carbon emissions available over the next decade.\n\nResearch matters: The emissions reductions available today in our latest generation of aircraft are a direct result of Boeing committing a significant amount of its research and development investment to sustainable technologies, such as:\n\n- The Advanced Technology Winglet on the 737 MAX that reduces drag and increases lift.\n- Lightweight carbon-fiber composite material on the 787 that is 30% lighter than aluminum.\n- Folding wingtips on the 777X that offer unconstrained wingspan and contribute to 5% greater aerodynamic efficiency.\n\nGo deeper: Read about our orders and deliveries here.\n\n\"With this investment in its future fleet, the 737 MAX and 787 will help United accelerate its fleet modernization and global growth strategy. The Boeing team is honored by United\u2019s trust in our family of airplanes to connect people and transport cargo around the world for decades to come.\"\n\nStan Deal, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes\nShowing up, sustainably\n\nBoeing\u2019s newest and largest members of its 737 MAX and 777X airplane families flew to the 2022 Farnborough International Airshow on sustainable aviation fuel blended with conventional jet fuel at a 30/70 ratio, using the same SAF blend for their daily flying displays. The 737 MAX family leverages advanced aerodynamic design and highly efficient engines to reduce fuel use and emissions 20%, and the noise footprint is 50% less than the airplanes they replaced. The 777-9 will deliver 10% better fuel use, emissions and operating costs.\n\nVideos:\n- 777-9: Watch it fly.\n- 737-10: See efficient flight.\n\nArriving at EAA AirVenture in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, on a 30/70 blend of SAF, the 2022 Boeing ecoDemonstrator provided tours to more than 5,000 show visitors and served as a beautiful backdrop for attendees celebrating WomenVenture day.

(Boeing photo)\nOperational Efficiency\n\nManaging air traffic efficiently\n\nBoeing works with governments, airports, airlines and air navigation service providers around the world on exploring new approaches to air traffic management (ATM).\n\nWhy it matters: Optimized ATM is a critical component needed to reach the commercial aviation industry\u2019s net-zero ambition \u2014 collaboration on how to manage airspace more efficiently can reduce emissions by about 10%, according to EUROCONTROL.\n\nAround the globe: ATM solutions designed to address specific, local and regional needs help airports and airlines operate more safely, quietly and sustainably:\n\n- **China**: Boeing is supporting China\u2019s Air Traffic Management Bureau in exploring a new approach to ATM called \u201cEoR\u201d \u2014 Established on Required Navigation Performance (RNP). It\u2019s a separation standard for landing aircraft established by the ICAO, which enables safe separation on parallel runways through simultaneous RNP-equipped arrivals, while reducing fuel burn, greenhouse gas emissions and noise.\n\n- **Europe**: Boeing is participating in seven new Single European ATM Research (SESAR) 3 Joint Undertaking research projects, renewing a 20-year-plus commitment to aircraft operational efficiency and air traffic management in Europe and paving the way to a future sustainable sky. The seven projects address critical areas for change, including emissions reduction, automation enabled by artificial intelligence, resilient ATM service provision, as well as the swift uptake of solutions for the integration of drones (U-space), urban air mobility, multimodality and reduced emissions operations. The partnership is a European undertaking between private and public sector partners to accelerate the delivery of the Digital European Sky through research and innovation. To do so, it is harnessing, developing and accelerating the implementation of the most cutting-edge technological solutions to manage conventional aircraft, drones, air taxis and vehicles flying at higher altitudes.\n\n- **India**: Boeing completed the development of a 10-year road map for Communication, Navigation and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) for Airports Authority of India (AAI). Backed by the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, Boeing and AAI conducted an analysis across operational, environmental, regulatory, technological, safety and financial factors. The resulting road map focuses on improving airspace utilization and maintaining safe and efficient aircraft operations \u2014 helping to modernize the Indian National Airspace System with domestic traffic expected to double by the end of this decade.\n\nThe bottom line: Boeing will continue developing local and global partnerships within the aviation ecosystem, enabling exchange of expertise and technology to help build a safer and more sustainable future of flight.\n\n\u201cBoeing has multiple digital solutions available today and even more that are in development to help customers improve their fuel and flight efficiency while reducing carbon emissions.\u201d\n\nStephanie Pope, president and CEO of Boeing Global Services\nCelebrating a decade of paperless flight decks\n\nThe big picture: In the summer of 2012, Boeing\u2019s Jeppesen FliteDeck Pro launched \u2014 the very first electronic flight bag (EFB) application to test what, at the time, felt revolutionary: pilots flying with digital charts and maps, free of paper binders. A decade later, the digital solutions revolution in aerospace continues to enable airlines to make impressive strides in operational efficiency and their sustainability targets.\n\n- 305,000 trees saved\n- 5B+ sheets of paper not printed\n- 6,111 acres of forest not needed for printing\n- 6.3M kg (13.9M pounds) of paper removed from airplanes\n- 300,000+ pilots supported\n- 40,000+ paperless flights enabled daily\n- 270,000 tonnes of fuel saved\n- 857,722 tonnes of CO\u2082 emissions avoided\n\nNumbers represent data from 2012 through August 2022.\nRenewable Energy\n\nRenewable energy can help reduce carbon emissions inside our operations and from our products and services. For our products, renewable energy can help reduce the carbon intensity of an energy powering our products, such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), green hydrogen and batteries. Boeing believes SAF is a necessary lever to decarbonize aviation. However, it will take a \u201cSAF and\u201d approach and not a \u201cSAF or\u201d approach to support the commercial aviation industry\u2019s ambition for net zero by 2050. The \u201cPower-to-Liquids Roadmap\u201d report examines the financial, economic and environmental benefits of decarbonizing the country\u2019s aviation industry with an emerging SAF technology.\n\nBoeing\u2019s role: The report was developed by the UAE Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure in collaboration with the World Economic Forum\u2019s Clean Skies for Tomorrow Initiative. Boeing participated by offering expertise at the launch event, analyzing the findings and being an active member of the UAE\u2019s SAF task force, which is led by the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure and provides strategic guidance on a range of fuel options, including Power-to-Liquids (PtL), a type of SAF.\n\nWhat is PtL? SAF requires careful attention to detail. There are several pathways to creating PtL (Power-to-Liquid) including the process where renewable electricity, CO\u2082 and water are synthesized into a liquid hydrocarbon, including jet fuel.\n\nHere\u2019s how it\u2019s made:\n- Electricity is applied to the water (H\u2082O). The hydrogen is collected and the oxygen is set aside.\n- The hydrogen is mixed with the carbon dioxide in a reactor until it matures.\n- The liquid is removed from the reactor, which results in PtL jet fuel.\n\nResources needed: This PtL relies on two things in the UAE: tapping into the UAE\u2019s abundant sources of renewable energy (intense sunshine and sustained winds), as well as its ability to capture carbon dioxide from the air or from point sources such as industrial waste gases.\n\nPtL is considered a significant technology for the UAE to decarbonize aviation. Other countries are also studying PtL to mature the technology and assess how this pathway may help them decarbonize.\n\nThe upshot: The UAE report shows that it would be ambitious but feasible for the country to produce as much as 11 million tons of PtL SAF by 2050 \u2014 equivalent to approximately 70% of national jet fuel consumption.\n\nIt\u2019s all about partnerships: \u201cWe collaborate with policymakers across six continents to support the SAF value chain, including its supply, use, certification and life cycle,\u201d said Mohammed Al Ghailani, Boeing\u2019s sustainability lead for the Middle East and Africa. \u201cWe were thrilled to support the UAE\u2019s ongoing research into developing a renewable fuel that would be suitable to the region.\u201d\n\nCreating a decarbonized solution in the UAE\n\nWhen Boeing was invited to analyze a study that looked at developing SAF in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the decision to participate was easy and will support the growth of SAF production in the region.\n\nThe \u201cPower-to-Liquids Roadmap\u201d report examines the financial, economic and environmental benefits of decarbonizing the country\u2019s aviation industry with an emerging SAF technology.\n\nBoeing\u2019s role: The report was developed by the UAE Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure in collaboration with the World Economic Forum\u2019s Clean Skies for Tomorrow Initiative.

The flight flew over the Dubai coastline for just over an hour. (Emirates photo)\nFeedstocks and forces \u2013 Boeing\u2019s work to scale up SAF around the world\n\n**Why it matters:** Today, SAF is made from waste-based agricultural products and used cooking oil and reduces emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. Most is currently blended with fossil fuel. Boeing is working to make SAF more accessible to help deliver on its commitment that commercial airplanes will be compatible to fly on 100% SAF by 2030. SAF development and production deliver economic growth, provide energy security for countries and create jobs across multiple industries.\n\n**SAF sources and building scale:** Boeing is researching, developing and advocating for SAF across the globe, working with the most sustainable feedstocks that are available.\n\n- **Australia and New Zealand:** Boeing is working on a SAF road map, in partnership with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), to help analyze the availability of sustainable feedstocks in the Asia-Pacific region, primarily focusing on Australia and New Zealand.\n- **Brazil** is the second-largest biofuel producer globally. Boeing\u2019s focus includes feedstocks that can be sourced sustainably, such as sugar cane, eucalyptus and other residual biomass options.\n- **China** is planning to scale up SAF adoption and Boeing has partnered with Peking University to develop fundamental research meant to guide the industry in identifying promising SAF feedstocks and pathways.\n- **Ethiopia:** Boeing supports a SAF e-learning and academic program in partnership with Roundtable for Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB).

Read more on our partnerships in Japan on Page 45.\n- **Middle East:** Boeing also participated in the Sustainable Bioenergy Research Consortium\u2019s (SBRC) Seawater Energy and Agriculture System (SEAS), which is an integrated system of aquaculture, halo-agriculture and mangrove silviculture to produce SAF and seafood. The first airplane flight fueled with jet fuel produced through SBRC\u2019s SEAS happened in January 2019.\n- **Mexico:** Boeing is the only multinational company working with the Biojet Consortium, established in 2016 and is comprised of 14 research centers and companies that are exploring alternative aviation fuel supply chain in Mexico.\n- **South Africa:** Since 2014, Boeing has been working with RSB and World Wildlife Fund-South Africa to help small-hold farmers to grow crops that produce SAF. Boeing is partnering with Stellenbosch University to deliver SAF e-learning.\n- **UK:** Boeing is focused on supporting the creation of a policy, capital and innovation ecosystem in the UK to enable the Government\u2019s Jet Zero Strategy commitment of having five plants in construction by 2025. Boeing was proud to be the founding partner of the Energy Innovation Centre at the University of Sheffield, which has since been selected as the home of the UK SAF clearing house.\n- **U.S.:** Boeing focuses on SAF procurement, research and development, and promoting SAF commercial scale-up in the U.S. and around the globe. Boeing also recently announced the purchase of 5.6 million gallons of SAF for its commercial operations in 2023.\nFond childhood memories propel a passion for possibility and sustainable fuel\n\nBoeing\u2019s SAF feedstock expert Onofre Andrade witnessed the transformative economic power sustainable biofuels had on his job-deprived rural village, while growing up in central-west Brazil.\n\nWhen he was a young boy, his father joined with other farmers to form a co-operative that built a sugar cane ethanol plant. It still operates today. Prior to this co-op being developed, the sole source of jobs was farm labor.\n\n\u201cThe sugar cane ethanol co-op provided much-needed jobs, and that sparked hope in the lives of many people I care about,\u201d said Andrade. \u201cThe success of the ethanol plant catalyzed other co-ops and sparked capacity-building opportunities \u2014 including a co-op-led school started by my mother.\u201d\n\nAndrade joined Boeing before SAF was a hot topic, but his early experience continues to give purpose to him and his family.\n\nBoeing\u2019s SAF feedstock expert Onofre Andrade was inspired by seeing good jobs come to his rural village in Brazil when his father started a sugar cane ethanol co-op. (Onofre Andrade photo)\n\n\u201cI hope to inspire my kids the way my dad inspired me.\u201d\n\nOnofre Andrade, sustainable aviation fuel feedstock expert\nAdvanced Technology\n\nTo meet the commercial aviation industry\u2019s net-zero ambition by 2050, it will take an approach that includes SAF and other advanced technologies. Boeing has extensive experience on the \u201cand,\u201d through research, studies, testing and partnerships. The future of flight will incorporate the latest digital design, test and production tools, airframe, propulsion and systems technology, and different power and energy solutions will apply to different market segments and aircraft sizes.\n\nInformed by the company\u2019s extensive evaluation and testing of alternative propulsion sources and renewable energy and its research partnerships, and supported by Boeing\u2019s expertise in commercial aircraft design and history of innovation on alternative energy and propulsion systems, Boeing has launched a new effort to conceptually design and assess the potential environmental impacts of \u201cFuture Flight Concepts.\u201d These concepts are exploring applications of technologies including electrification and alternative fuels, such as hydrogen.\n\nNASA awards sustainable flight program to Boeing and partners\n\nIn January 2023, NASA selected Boeing and its industry team to lead the development and flight testing of a full-scale Transonic Truss-Braced Wing (TTBW) demonstrator airplane through the Sustainable Flight Demonstrator (SFD) program. Through this unprecedented public-private partnership with NASA, Boeing and its industry partners are contributing more than half of the funding needed to shape the demonstrator program.\n\nWhy it matters: The technologies demonstrated and tested will inform future designs and could lead to breakthrough aerodynamics and fuel efficiency gains.\n\nWhen combined with expected advancements in propulsion systems, materials and systems architecture, a single-aisle airplane with a TTBW configuration could see reduced fuel consumption and emissions of up to 30% relative to today\u2019s most efficient single-aisle airplanes, depending on the mission.\n\nYears in the making: The TTBW airframe concept is the result of more than a decade of development supported by NASA, Boeing and industry investments. Under previous NASA programs, including the agency\u2019s Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research program, Boeing conducted extensive wind tunnel testing and digital modeling.\n\n\u201cOne of the key outputs of this activity is really the learning, the knowledge. What at the integrated airplane level ... will the benefits be? And depending on the results of this effort, and market conditions \u2014 that\u2019ll dictate whether this shows up on a future commercial product.\u201d\n\nTodd Citron, Chief Technology Officer\nWisk unveils self-flying, eVTOL aircraft\n\nWisk, a technology joint venture, is developing its 6th Generation aircraft. Designed with the highest safety standards, it will be the first candidate for certification of an autonomous, passenger-carrying electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft in the U.S. The Gen 6 aircraft has room for four passengers, carry-on luggage and personal items, can fly 90 miles (145 kilometers) and recharges in 15 minutes.\n\nWhy it matters: Wisk will be the first candidate for certification of an autonomous, passenger-carrying electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWisk is excited to partner with Boeing on the development of this autonomous aircraft. Our combined experience uniquely positions Wisk to succeed in this exciting new mobility market.\u201d\n\nBrian Yutko, CEO, Wisk\n\nTaking a SAF and other advanced technology approach\n\nIt will take a \u201cSAF and\u201d approach, not a \u201cSAF or\u201d approach, to achieve the commercial aviation industry\u2019s net zero ambition by 2050. As part of our approach, which includes SAF and other technologies, Boeing continues to advance the safety and viability of other energy carriers and their use on aircraft. Since the mid-2000s, Boeing has conducted six hydrogen technology demonstrations with crewed and uncrewed aircraft using hydrogen fuel cells and combustion engines. Boeing successfully tested a cryotank designed for space with the capacity to hold 16,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen or the energy equivalent of the Jet A fuel in a typical regional jet.\n\nBoeing was reminded of the challenges and opportunities associated with hydrogen with the recent Artemis mission. Chris Raymond, Boeing\u2019s chief sustainability officer dives into more detail in this Fortune article.\nSustainability test bed turns 10\n\nThe Boeing ecoDemonstrator marked its 10-year anniversary in 2022 \u2014 accelerating innovation by taking promising technologies out of the lab and rigorously testing them in an operational environment.\n\nBy the numbers:\nThe program has tested over 225 technologies to help enhance safety, decarbonize aviation and improve operational efficiency and the passenger experience.\n\n- Nine platforms served as flying test beds:\n  - 2012: American Airlines 737-800.\n  - 2014: Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner.\n  - 2015: TUI 757.\n  - 2016: Embraer E170.\n  - 2018: FedEx 777 Freighter.\n  - 2019: Boeing 777-200.\n  - 2020: Etihad Airways 787-10.\n  - 2021: Alaska Airlines 737-9.\n  - 2022-2024: Boeing 777-200ER (Extended Range).\n\n- Approximately one-third of those technologies progressed onto Boeing\u2019s products and services, including:\n  - More aerodynamically efficient winglets on the 737 MAX.\n  - iPad apps that provide real-time weather and other information to pilots, enabling them to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions.\n  - Custom approach path information to lower community noise.\n  - Flight deck touch-screen displays and a camera system on the 777X that will enhance safety by helping pilots avoid ground obstacles.\n\n\u201cI am proud of the ecoDemonstrator\u2019s role in pioneering the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for the industry. Not only has almost every one of our platforms flown on SAF, we conducted the industry\u2019s first commercial flight on 100% SAF in both engines in 2018 with FedEx Express and tested SAF emissions with NASA. That is what we do \u2014 partner across the industry to help safely decarbonize aerospace.\u201d\n\nRae Lutters, ecoDemonstrator program manager\nPartnerships\n\nBoeing partners for a clean energy economy\n\nThroughout 2022, Boeing joined forces with innovative partners from around the world to scale renewable energy and sustainable technologies for a more sustainable aerospace and future.\n\nWhy it matters: Boeing is aware that no one entity can decarbonize the commercial aviation industry alone. It will take \u201ceveryone\u201d to achieve the industry\u2019s net zero ambition by 2050. We recognize the significant capital investment required in the journey and appreciate the partnership and support of the financial community to channel liquidity into the ongoing transition pathway.\n\n- **Avolon and SkyNRG**: Boeing partnered with Avolon, ORIX Aviation, SFS Ireland and SkyNRG to identify opportunities for a commercial-scale SAF production facility in Ireland. The country is a global leader in aviation finance and airline operations with a planned growth of renewable energy sources. The study will be completed in 2023.\n\n- **Alder Fuels**: Boeing has committed to support testing and qualification of Alder Fuels-derived SAF on its airplanes to further grow the global SAF market. This technology enables the conversion of sustainable forest and agricultural residues into a low-negative carbon \u201cgreencrude\u201d for jet fuel conversion \u2014 displacing the typical jet fuel need by up to 75% in the U.S. The first plant will be completed in 2024.\n\n- **ACT FOR SKY**: Boeing is a member of ACT FOR SKY, a voluntary organization of 19 companies that works to commercialize, promote and expand the use of SAF produced in Japan.\n\n- **Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI)**: Building on their decades-long partnership, Boeing and MHI agreed to study sustainable technologies for a low-carbon society. Their focus areas include green hydrogen, carbon capture, electrification, sustainable materials, emissions propulsion technologies, new aircraft design concepts as well as new feedstocks and technologies for SAF production.\n\n- **NASA**: Boeing and NASA continued their partnership testing the emissions from SAF.

This UK government initiative, which will see a 787 cross the Atlantic on 100% SAF in 2023, will showcase the spectrum of sustainable aviation approaches to the flying public and inform our journey toward routine commercial industry 100% SAF flights by 2030.\n\nWhat\u2019s next: The commercial aviation industry\u2019s ambition is to achieve net-zero carbon emissions for global civil aviation operations by 2050, while also growing the societal benefits of air transportation. Boeing will continue to work across sectors and industry to ensure the benefits of aerospace remain available for generations to come.\nUniversity partnerships strengthen sustainability at Boeing\n\nWhy it matters: Strong university partnerships are one way Boeing demonstrates that it is looking outside the aerospace industry to give and receive support for research and development and to attract top talent.\n\nHere are some universities partnering with Boeing on sustainability:\n\n\u2022 Yale Center for Natural Carbon Capture: In April 2022, Boeing pledged $10 million to research efforts in natural carbon sequestration to scale natural solutions to mitigate GHG. The Center\u2019s focus is on near-term solutions that can capture approximately one gigaton of CO2 per year, the equivalent to current annual airline emissions. This approach offers potential co-benefits such as improved soil health and biodiversity conservation.\n\n\u2022 University of Sheffield: Boeing is the founding member of the Energy Innovation Center (EIC), which is focused on driving SAF development. In early 2023, the EIC was announced as the UK\u2019s SAF Clearing House, in partnership with the University of Dayton, reinforcing the critical role this first-of-its-kind facility in the UK will play in the global ecosystem. The EIC builds on Boeing\u2019s long-standing relationship with Sheffield, which started with the co-founding of an advanced research center for manufacturing and led to the opening of Boeing\u2019s first European manufacturing facility, demonstrating a successful model for university and industry collaboration.\n\n\u2022 University of Cambridge: In 2023, Boeing is celebrating 20 years of collaboration with the University of Cambridge. Among other research projects, Boeing is partnering with the university\u2019s Whittle Lab on its Aviation Impact Accelerator (AIA) to draw from a multidisciplinary range of expertise. AIA develops interactive, evidence-based models, simulations and visualization tools for decision-makers and others to understand low-emissions flight pathways, complementing our own Cascade tool. The AIA tool will help Boeing and interested parties understand how policies, scenarios and technology transitions support the industry\u2019s net-zero carbon emissions from commercial aviation by 2050.\n\n\u2022 Cranfield University\u2019s Digital Aviation Research and Technology Centre: This partnership focuses on technologies that are relevant to the operational efficiency pillar of our sustainable aerospace strategy.\n\n\u2022 Villanova University: The Resilient Innovation through Sustainable Engineering (RISE) Forum advances corporate sustainability by identifying and applying data-driven sustainability solutions. Boeing has access to faculty and graduate students who possess the technical expertise to examine real-world problems by evaluating various technologies or operational innovations through a systems perspective.\n\nWhat\u2019s next: We will continue to partner with academic institutions at the forefront of sustainable aerospace research.\n\nFossil-Free Future for Aerospace: His Majesty King Charles III visits Cambridge University, when he was Prince of Wales, to see plans for a new Whittle Laboratory building that would act as a hub for the university-led Aviation Impact Accelerator (AIA), of which Boeing is an official industry adviser, focused on accelerating the move toward the commercial aviation industry\u2019s climate goals.

Alicia Piscitelli secured a position on Boeing\u2019s Research & Technology team after completing three company internships and earning both master\u2019s and doctorate degrees from Villanova\u2019s sustainable engineering program.\n\nBoeing\u2019s circular economy expert and Associate Technical Fellow (see Page 30), Christin Datz, was Piscitelli\u2019s master\u2019s thesis adviser as she researched ways to advance the sustainable product life cycle. Piscitelli\u2019s doctoral research focused on renewable feedstock material for thermoset polymers used in interior aircraft composites. She studied ways to synthesize phenolics with renewable feedstocks derived from pine root oil and forestry waste.\n\nMost recently, she\u2019s helping Boeing to find sustainable ways to manage polymers at the end-of-life phase of the sustainable product life cycle.\nBoeing partners with decision-makers for sustainable aerospace\n\nBoeing is working with decision-makers and policy institutions globally to create tailor-made paths forward to decarbonize commercial aviation.\n\n**Why it matters:** The commercial aviation industry\u2019s ambition of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 has multiple levers to work toward meeting this target. SAF is seen as the best solution to accelerate toward this goal as it is a drop-in solution to the aviation ecosystem.\n\n**Around the globe:** Here\u2019s a snapshot of Boeing\u2019s global policy partnerships.\n\n- **Americas:** Partnering with International Air Transport Association (IATA), Boeing hosted a SAF Roundtable at the IX Summit of the Americas and asked heads of state to develop sound policies to incentivize the production of SAF across the western hemisphere, highlighting the potential of the region. Boeing also partnered with seven airlines from across the Americas, using nearly 400,000 liters (106,000 gallons) of SAF for commercial flights during the week of the summit, avoiding the release of over 214 tonnes of CO\u2082.\n\n- **Australia:** SAF will unlock its share of an extra $10 billion each year in GDP, generating 26,000 jobs, while reducing emissions by around 9%. Boeing and Bioenergy Australia hosted a panel at the Prime Minister\u2019s Sydney Energy Forum to accelerate the production of SAF, where the Australian Transport Minister announced plans for a Jet Council. Boeing also partnered with seven airlines from across the Americas, using nearly 400,000 liters (106,000 gallons) of SAF for commercial flights during the week of the summit, avoiding the release of over 214 tonnes of CO\u2082.\n\n- **Europe:** Boeing became a member of the European Commission\u2019s Renewable and Low-Carbon Fuels Value Chain Industrial Alliance. As part of the Aviation Working Group, Boeing is partnering with the European policymakers to inform how to scale production and uptake of SAF. In 2022, Boeing also took the lead as Sector Champion for Aviation in the World Economic Forum\u2019s First Movers Coalition (FMC), which has assembled 24 of the world\u2019s leading companies. All airlines and air transport companies in this sector have set a target to procure 5% of their fuel demand as advanced SAF. The group works to overcome technology barriers and bring forward supply with the intent of striking binding commitments between buyers and sellers.\n\n- **Middle East:** Boeing discussed real-world climate actions at the 2022 COP27 via panels and keynotes with partners and stakeholders, amplifying that the only way to keep 1.5 degrees C alive is through cross-sector partnerships, strategies, regulation and data to keep all parties on track.\n\n- **Singapore:** Boeing joined the International Advisory Panel (IAP) set up by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore to develop Singapore Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint by 2023. Boeing provided insight into IAP\u2019s report on scaling SAF and improving air traffic management to create a conducive policy framework for the region\u2019s busiest aviation hub. Boeing also briefed the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Air Transport Ministers on key strategies for sustainable aviation, encouraging further discussion amongst the member states on accelerating regional cooperation.\n\n- **UK:** Boeing hosted the seventh Jet Zero Council meeting in its offices, presenting its Cascade tool to the Secretary of State for Transport and Secretary of State for Energy and Net Zero. The work of the council is crucial for the UK Jet Zero Strategy. Boeing was appointed co-chair of the Defence Supplier Forum Climate Change and Sustainability Aviation Group with the Royal Air Force. Boeing also leads a NATO group on behalf of the UK focused on accelerating military adoption of SAF to support defence sustainability and energy security.\n\n- **U.S.:** The SAF Grand Challenge engages federal government agencies to develop a comprehensive strategy for scaling up new technologies to produce SAF on a commercial scale from renewable or waste resources. Objectives include: expanding SAF supply and end use; reducing its cost; enhancing its sustainability; supplying at least 3 billion gallons of SAF annually by 2030; and sufficient SAF to meet 100% of aviation fuel demand by 2050, which is projected to be around 35 billion gallons per year.\n\n**What\u2019s next:** Boeing will continue to work closely with governments, customers and decision-makers globally to achieve our shared goal in 2023 and beyond, including:\n\n- Partnering on SAF road maps across the APAC region, including Australia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia and Japan.\n\n- Helping to develop Australian Jet Zero Council.\n\n- Advocating to policymakers, the finance community and suppliers through regional workshops with FMC around the world to build local capacity for SAF supply, enhance demand commitments and unlock commercial challenges.\n\n- Supporting the release of global SAF guidance on future supply and demand issues for buyers and sellers.\n\n- Working closely with the UAE government on shaping sustainable transport agenda at COP28.\nLighter seats lift efficiency\n\nBoeing\u2019s Cabin and Interiors and Payloads Engineering teams are finding innovative ways to reduce waste, emissions and weight during the product life cycle for complete customer solutions that promote sustainability. One of those ways involves a group of college students in Spokane, Washington. Boeing and joint venture aircraft seating partner, Adient Aerospace, joined with Gonzaga University\u2019s School of Engineering and Applied Science students to support a sustainability-focused research initiative. The students are using Adient Aerospace\u2019s Ovation seat prototype to study cabin product design, manufacturing and maintenance to find new approaches to increase sustainability measures.\nHabitat restoration along the Lower Duwamish Waterway in Seattle. (Boeing photo)\nQuality\n\nWe design quality into every aspect of our business and drive personal accountability to ensure quality in everything we do and in every product we deliver. We promote quality with our people, our culture, metrics and oversight.\n\nThe Boeing Quality Management System (QMS) has a foundation in AS9100, which is the internationally recognized and premier aerospace QMS standard. Boeing aims to flow down AS9100 certification and compliance to its suppliers in order to enable effective and efficient processes that meet multiple customer, statutory and business requirements.\n\nQMS and the company\u2019s Safety Management System (SMS) work together and are built into the company\u2019s organizational structure, policies, processes, procedures and resources. Our customers and our regulators have extremely high expectations of Boeing, and these systems help to operationalize safety and quality in order to meet those expectations.\n\nWe incorporate safety and quality metrics into our primary annual incentive structures, further driving our focus across the enterprise at every level of the organization. We operate with four enterprisewide operations councils focused on strengthening quality, manufacturing, supply chain and program management in every program. We deliver quality through a relentless commitment to integrity, safety and sustainability, which is fundamental to our mission.\n\nLearn more about our approach to quality.\n\nA sustainable approach to supplier quality success\n\nBoeing is expanding a new proactive quality tool called Requirements Consumption Review (RCR) to ensure suppliers fully understand all requirements prior to building a product \u2014 and it\u2019s significantly reducing waste and rework down the line to enable first-time quality.\n\nWhy it matters: The program is having a positive impact on quality.\n\n- Boeing conducts the review for newly designed products or products that have moved to a new supplier and that may generate a defect, for example, given the part\u2019s complexity.\n- RCRs have resulted in a 95% first-time quality yield, compared to 60% for similar parts that did not involve the tool.\n- First deployed across Boeing\u2019s Defense, Space & Security business, RCRs are now being implemented across Commercial Airplanes and Global Services as well.\n\n\u201cWhen we send a purchase order to a supplier, it can be a detailed process to ensure we receive high-quality products that meet our exacting requirements. This early involvement approach involves a cross-functional team that works proactively with the supplier to go through the purchase order together, including all the critical technical requirements, and establish confidence and clarity from the start. It also demonstrates that we are invested in their success.\u201d\n\nDoug Ackerman, vice president of Supplier Quality\nDigital factory of the future\n\nBoeing is utilizing an industry-leading technology to transform the way we design, test and build airplanes. Today, Boeing engineering teams are studying how recent lessons learned from across the company could shape the factory of the future \u2014 with digital transformation as a major driver.\n\nWhy it matters: Stability and optimized performance is happening.\n\n- Boeing\u2019s T-7A Red Hawk team was able to build the first several aircraft in simulations before production even started and then join the aft and forward fuselages in less than a half-hour, a process that would normally take days.\n- Although commercial airplanes are larger and production requirements are different from military aircraft, Boeing teams will apply those learnings to future programs. That knowledge, combined with more than a century of development experience on other programs, will guide future production.\n\nIt comes down to this: This will enable Boeing to predict performance of the production system and see how changes in the airplane design affect that performance, or vice versa. It will also allow teams to \u201cbuild\u201d the first several aircraft in a simulation, flattening the learning curve. Supplier readiness and success around first-time quality enables Boeing to operate more sustainably as a business.\n\nBy driving quality within the supply chain, Boeing demonstrates its commitment to sustainability by reducing rework and/or delayed parts in the value stream to minimize time lost and waste.\n\n\u201cCreating a digital twin of our factory operations will help to increase stability and optimize performance prior to physically building a product. We have long used models to predict aircraft performance and refine them with test data as it comes available. Similarly, we will build models to predict production system performance and refine them as systems come online.\u201d\n\nHoward McKenzie, chief engineer and executive vice president of Engineering, Test & Technology\n\nVideo: Take a look at our future factory.\nSustainable Operations\n\nBoeing appreciates sustainable aerospace starts inside our four walls. We are focused on continuous improvements in pursuit of the sustainable product life cycle across key elements including greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2), energy usage, water and waste management. We take action to decrease our impact through renewable energy procurement, targeted infrastructure and equipment investments, efficiency standards and conservation initiatives that include deployment of best practices and employee engagement strategies. Core to this strategy is the ongoing engagement of our employees each year through education and initiatives focused on ways in which they can reduce their environmental impact at work, and at home. Boeing\u2019s environmental strategy is guided by a comprehensive review and assessment of the most significant environmental challenges and risks facing the company, and our environmental priorities are set with internal and external stakeholders. The analysis includes direct input and perspectives on industry best practices and community requirements from diverse stakeholders, such as customers, environment-focused nongovernmental organizations (NGO) and the company\u2019s global leadership. The information helps Boeing identify and update our understanding of current and emerging sustainability issues that are critical to the company and our stakeholders. It also informs our next-generation environmental strategy and targets.\n\nSince 2020, Boeing has achieved net-zero GHG emissions at manufacturing and work sites by expanding conservation and renewable energy use while securing carefully selected, third-party-verified offsets for the remaining greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\nBoeing invests in sustainable operations to reduce the impact of our manufacturing sites and is focused on conserving resources. We prioritize reducing emissions, energy, water and waste throughout our global operations and have set 2025 waypoints toward 2030 goals to share our progress and remain accountable as we increase production. Boeing\u2019s sustainable operations strategy is managed within the Global Enterprise Sustainability organization, in close partnership with stakeholders across the enterprise. Through our Sustainable Operations subcouncil, we track performance across the enterprise and at the site level to assess our progress, identify challenges and opportunities, and share best practices.\n\n| Performance Area | 2025 Targets vs. 2017 | 2022 Progress Toward 2025 Targets and Drivers | 2030 Targets |\n|------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Greenhouse Gas Emissions | Reduce emissions by 25% | 31% Reduction Procurement of renewable energy and renewable energy credits, low commercial production activity and infrastructure investments. | \u2022 Net-zero emissions.4 \u2022 55% GHG reduction from 2017. \u2022 100% renewable electricity. |\n| Energy | Reduce energy consumption (natural gas, other fuels and electricity) by 10% | 11% Reduction Conservation initiatives, infrastructure investments, remote working conditions and reduced production activity. | \u2022 10% energy reduction from 2025. |\n| Water | Reduce water withdrawal by 20% | 19% Reduction Increased water intake efficiencies and low production activity. | \u2022 5% reduction from 2025. |\n| Solid Waste | Reduce solid waste to landfill by 20% | 40% Reduction Conservation initiatives, vendor management and remote working conditions. | \u2022 30% reduction in solid waste produced from 2025. \u2022 Over 90% diversion from landfill or incineration. \u2022 Zero solid waste to landfill certification where applicable at major sites. |\n| Hazardous Waste | Reduce hazardous waste by 5% | 9% Reduction Projects to reduce unused and expired materials, and partnerships to reduce waste generation. | \u2022 5% hazardous waste reduction from 2025. |\n\n1. Operational goals shown are absolute targets and not indexed to production levels or growth. 2022 performance was affected by changes associated with occupancy and operations during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as conservation and changes in how Boeing purchases energy. The targets were established against a 2017 base year. The 2025 goals will act as a milestone to guide actions and progress to the 2030 goals.\n2. All 2025 reduction goals were set with an operational boundary of the Core Metric Sites, which represent the majority (70%) of Boeing\u2019s operations, and includes emissions from electricity use and natural gas.\n3. The 2030 reduction goals set with an operational boundary of The Boeing Company and includes all Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.\n4. The net-zero achievement covers Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions for all manufacturing and work sites within the company\u2019s operational control as well as Scope 3, business travel. This is achieved by expanding conservation and renewable energy use while securing carefully selected, third-party-verified offsets for the remaining greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\n5. Energy includes natural gas, other fuels and electricity.\n6. Water data represents approximately 84% of operations square footage.\n7. Solid waste numbers represent values determined from scale-weighed containers as well as calculated weights. Nonhazardous solid waste is sent to landfill for disposal. This measure applies to all waste streams where Boeing is responsible for waste disposal service as a normal part of daily operations (excludes remediation and construction-related waste).\n8. Hazardous waste is determined from U.S. EPA hazardous manifest or equivalent government shipping documents. All types of hazardous wastes that are generated at a facility and are discarded from the site for disposal, and would be considered part of the environmental footprint of the site. Actual tons of all Production or routine wastes shipped as hazardous waste (excludes remediation and construction-related waste).\nAddressing Climate Change\n\nWe consider climate change to be an urgent issue. We support the goals of the Paris Agreement and encourage our value chain partners to do the same. Boeing achieved net-zero carbon emissions at manufacturing and other work sites and in business travel in 2022 for the third consecutive year, by expanding conservation and renewable energy use while securing carefully selected, third-party-verified offsets for the remaining greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Boeing strives to reduce operational GHG emissions, both during times of growth and during times of challenge. Our strategy for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, which we detail in the following section, aligns to a 1.5 degrees Celsius global warming potential scenario, in support of the global climate goals.\n\nTo achieve our goals related to the climate and to GHG, we actively monitor emissions, fuel use and energy efficiency. We have set 2030 targets for performance in each of these areas that aim to reduce absolute emissions, maintain net-zero emissions for Scope 1 and Scope 2, and increase our adoption of renewable energy sources. As part of Boeing\u2019s business continuity program, we also monitor the length and severity of business interruptions. The scope of monitoring includes damaging weather, natural disasters, pandemics and public health crises. It helps us understand how to increase resiliency in light of a changing climate.\n\nEnterprise GHG emissions from operations are calculated after the conclusion of the reporting year. However, the emissions from natural gas and electricity usage at Core Metric Sites are calculated and monitored on a monthly basis through the use of utility bills and are continuously validated and updated throughout the reporting year. The emissions factors for these energy sources are validated at least annually and updated when appropriate following guidance from the World Resources Institute GHG Protocol. The energy data and emissions factors are verified as part of a third-party limited assurance process.\n\nFor the third year in a row, Boeing has achieved net-zero GHG emissions at manufacturing and work sites by implementing high-impact conservation investments, emphasizing and incentivizing conservation practices by employees, and increasing renewable electricity use while securing carefully selected, third-party-verified offsets for the remaining GHG emissions.\n\nIn 2022:\n\n- **2025 GHG Target Progress:** Boeing had a 31% reduction in GHG emissions compared to 2017. GHG emissions were 8% lower than anticipated for the year. Procurement of renewable energy and renewable energy credits, low commercial production activity and infrastructure investments contributed to reduction in emissions from the operational footprint. The implementation of long-lasting infrastructure improvements and the contracting of renewable energy allow us to build on emissions reductions each year.\n\n- **2025 Energy Reduction Target Progress:** Boeing had a 11% reduction in energy consumed compared to 2017. Energy consumption was 6% lower than anticipated for the year due to the impact of conservation initiatives, infrastructure investments, remote work and reduced production activity.\nBoeing facilities prioritize conservation, energy efficiency and renewable energy\n\nAs energy consumption gives rise to GHG emissions, conservation and energy reduction measures help achieve both energy and GHG reductions.\n\nCreating sustainable facilities:\n\nGermany: Boeing\u2019s new distribution center in Hamburg meets high sustainability standards and will be seeking Gold certification from the German Sustainable Building Council. To minimize the environmental footprint, the building is equipped with a heat pump and a photovoltaic system will be installed on the roof in the later half of 2023.\n\nU.S.:\n\n- Mesa, Arizona, recently completed construction of a new composites manufacturing facility. A quarter of the electricity used at the site is solar power. This partnership between Boeing and the Salt River Project brings the company closer to achieving its 2030 goal of 100% renewable electricity.\n- Switching to LED lighting in Boeing\u2019s Everett, Washington; Frederickson, Washington; and El Segundo, California, facilities is driving an annual recurring savings of 25.3 million kilowatt-hours, which is equivalent to powering more than 2,300 U.S. homes per year.\n\nIndia: Boeing\u2019s new engineering and technology campus in Bengaluru will leverage multiple design elements, including efficient ventilation systems, LED lighting, rainwater recovery and solar power generation.\n\n\u201cSustainability is something everyone should be thinking about. What kind of planet do you want to leave behind for future generations?\u201d\n\nGregory Kurth, Mesa site facility maintenance engineer, Facilities & Asset Management\n\nBoeing expanded its strong presence in Europe with a new state-of-the-art distribution warehouse near Hamburg, Germany. (Boeing photo)\n\nIt comes down to this: Boeing will continue to invest in conservation and renewable energy projects to advance the company\u2019s operational environmental goals.\nConserving Resources\n\nEngaging Employees in Conservation\n\nBoeing has implemented multiple approaches to encourage the workforce to support conservation by fostering sustainable behaviors. Employees are a source of innovation; champions of projects and their combined actions contribute to achieving Boeing\u2019s goals.\n\nThe programs that Boeing utilizes to get employees involved and contribute to the enterprise sustainability goals are designed to reach all aspects of the workforce (Page 12). Elements of sustainability are embedded within the Boeing Production system content and linked to Lean methodologies that eliminate waste and promote more efficient, sustainable practices within operations. Additionally, Boeing provides behavior change training and encourages recognition programs to help employees develop sustainable habits and reward them for their efforts.\n\nThe approaches used include elements of gamification, which involves turning sustainable behaviors into fun and engaging programs. Key employee engagement avenues include:\n\n- **The Conservation Best Practices program**, which is deployed across the enterprise to prioritize reducing energy, water and waste at our largest areas of operation.\n- **The Energy Star Battle of the Buildings** competition to encourage employees to work together toward our sustainability goals and promote a culture of environmental stewardship.\n- **Aerospace Sustainability Foundations Training**, an internal credential training that allows employees to learn more about sustainable aerospace and practices and how they can incorporate them into their work.\n\nBy emphasizing employee engagement throughout the sustainability programs, Boeing is benefiting local communities and utilizing the capabilities of its diverse workforce to achieve its operational sustainability goals.\n\nEarth Month photo contest winners\n\nBoeing\u2019s Earth Month celebrations included a photo contest. Participants had the opportunity to submit a photograph with a description of what sustainability means to them.\n\n**Winner: Kaitlin Brush**\nBrevig, BCA, Interiors Responsibility Center\n\nFor Kaitlin, sustainability means being able to find secret beauty in nature, without negatively affecting it. Photo entitled \u201cFog Camano,\u201d located in the Puget Sound.\n\n**Runner-Up: Katie Ziegler**\n777 Fleet Chief Office\n\nFor Katie, sustainability includes protecting the honey bees that pollinate plants, sustaining food sources for humans and animals. Factors threatening honey bees include pesticides, disease and their natural predators like the giant hornet. Making honey bees a regulatory and lifestyle priority is critical.\nEmployees more than double goal in annual conservation competition\n\nWhile Boeing focuses on conservation every day, the company hosts an annual competition starting on Earth Day in April to encourage Boeing employees to take daily actions that advance sustainable operations. Employees across the globe took more than 231,000 60-second actions for the environment from Earth Day on April 22 to May 31, 2022. This was the equivalent of reducing carbon emissions by not driving 7.8 million miles (12.6 million kilometers). Top 60-second actions included using refillable water bottles, recycling and turning off equipment not in use.\n\nWinners from across the globe:\nThe Battle of the Buildings competition among sites was based on the number of actions per capita and the winners in each category were:\n\n- BGS\n- Everett, Washington\n- San Antonio\n- Winnipeg, Canada\n- Seattle Spares Distribution Center\n- Berlin\n\n\u201cWhen employees engage in taking 60 seconds for the environment, we know it cuts costs, helps protect the environment and gives employees a sense of belonging, drive and purpose.\u201d\n\nSteve Shestag, director, Sustainable Operations, Global Enterprise Sustainability\n\nAlways with quality and pride, the Boeing Spares Distribution Center employees in SeaTac, Washington, step up as Battle of the Buildings winners, including (left to right): April Nelson, Steven Yaummarath, Jo Dollente, Brandon Stanfield, Justin Roberts, Brett Nichols and AJ Flores. (Boeing photo)\nReducing Waste\n\nBoeing is making strides to protect the land, water and air in our communities by reducing waste from work sites and our supply chain. Waste streams are as complex as our facilities, which range from office space to part fabrication to assembly of aircraft and space vehicles. Solid waste includes material that has been discarded or abandoned or that is no longer useful or usable and has been designated for removal. Items that are reused or reclaimed are excluded from solid waste. Boeing has dedicated teams working to prevent waste from going to landfills and to assess opportunities to return or reuse packaging for parts.\n\nBoeing generates hazardous waste primarily from a variety of research, manufacturing and facilities maintenance processes. Hazardous waste may be recycled upstream or downstream, as on-site or off-site reclamation and avoided generation through processes that extend useful life of consumable chemicals to avoid hazardous waste. We look to reduce hazardous waste in upstream activities by preventing or reducing the amount of hazardous waste generated through extending system life through contaminant removal. Downstream, we look at hazardous waste generated from site operations. We implement several recycling and recovery activities to reduce the need for new chemicals.\n\nProgress Toward 2025 Hazardous and Nonhazardous Waste Goals\n\n- **Solid Waste** \u2013 40% reduction compared to 2017. The continued trend of increased remote working conditions influences the overall reduction in solid waste. Conservation initiatives and vendor management continue to be opportunities to drive further reductions.\n\n- **Hazardous Waste** \u2013 9% reduction compared to 2017. Hazardous waste was 1% higher than anticipated during the year. Benefits from implementing conservation initiatives were outweighed by key events across the enterprise, including a historical flood event in St. Louis, which caused an unplanned increase in hazardous waste disposal from a water treatment system.\n\nThe Stingray gets Lean\n\nAs the U.S. Navy\u2019s uncrewed aerial refueler, the MQ-25 Stingray is a model of efficiency, in the air and on the production line.\n\nThe digitally engineered aircraft features a highly efficient engine and lightweight composite skin, allowing it to stay in the air much longer, using little fuel itself to complete its mission.\n\nWithin the factory setting, robotic automation and advanced assembly techniques eliminate the need for drilling during aircraft assembly.\n\nNow, the futuristic aircraft is setting new standards for efficiency with a renewed focus on reducing waste through Lean manufacturing.\n\nAcross Boeing\u2019s production system, teams are building momentum with Lean principles. The MQ-25 is the first program within Boeing Defense, Space & Security to undergo a renewed focus on Lean.\n\nA focus on the customer: \u201cWe know what Lean means to our Navy customer \u2014 operational excellence, stability and execution,\u201d Troy Rutherford, MQ-25 vice president and program manager. \u201cWhen we focus on removing waste from the system and listening to those who do the work, then production, innovation and creativity all take a huge leap forward. We\u2019re excited to be the first program to engage with the Lean workshops.\u201d\n\nWhat is Lean? Lean is a way of thinking and acting that enables us to solve problems and continually improve. It is the foundation of Boeing\u2019s production system and embraces just-in-time delivery, error-free production and continuous flow. Lean helps spot and eliminate waste, wherever it is found, which also reduces costs.\n\nThe MQ-25 Stingray is an uncrewed aircraft system, designed for the U.S. Navy, providing robust refueling capability. (Boeing photo)\nBoeing Recognizes 2022 Environment Champion\n\nJon Kelley, Facilities & Asset Management Reclamation team member, brings heart, commitment and skill to reduce waste to landfill, conserve valuable resources and ensure the company is compliant with regulations that protect the environment and the public.\n\nIn 2022, Kelley was recognized as the Environment Champion for his environmental passion and 40 years of commitment to Boeing. Throughout his career, Kelley has done more than his job required for conservation and protection of the environment and public safety. By doing this, he has helped Boeing\u2019s Puget Sound sites maximize the conservation of materials and properly handle regulated materials, while providing guidance to business partners.\n\nKelley constantly redefines his job by raising the bar of efficiency and standard of quality. Leaning on his decades of experience, Kelley has helped Boeing\u2019s Puget Sound sites identify efficiencies, best practices and new technologies to reduce water use and effluent discharge standards beyond those set by regulation.\n\nBoeing subsidiary Liquid Robotics was recognized for its Wave Glider Ocean Microplastics Demonstrator project for ocean plastics education and demonstrated the company\u2019s commitment to sustainability. (Boeing photo)\n\nEmployee innovation recognized: Below is a sampling of the 15 environmental leader winners in six categories that focused on reducing waste, energy and water use.\n\n- In Everett, Washington, 260 Boeing employees from 40 organizations generated 1,800 sustainability ideas to consider for future products in a \u201csustainability lab.\u201d\n- Seattle employees reclaimed about 2,500 gallons of water per day at the Seattle Developmental Center by reconfiguring piping and installing a more efficient system.\n- Winnipeg employees conserved electricity equivalent to 60 homes\u2019 annual use by installing occupancy sensors and upgrading LED lights, saving almost 720,000 kWh yearly.\n- A Mesa team worked with the local utility company to lessen demand on high peak utility days during summer months by programming the Building Automation System to improve processes and generate 5,400 kWh, which earned rebates of $30,000 annually.\n- An Everett team reduced the amount of solvents required to flush paint pumps by removing filter housing. The result cut solvent use by 12 gallons per airplane and more than 10,000 pounds per year, saving almost $19,000.\n- In Chennai, India, employees reduced GHG emissions by consolidating shipments and transitioning from air to sea shipments for India suppliers.\n\nReducing water consumption\n\nBoeing sets rigorous water use reduction targets at our manufacturing sites to preserve this natural resource for the environment and our communities. Boeing\u2019s water is sourced from local public utilities (surface, ground and reclaimed water) and company generation (on-site well, on-site reclamation and rain capture). This sourced water supports manufacturing, sanitation, drinking water, cooling and irrigation across the company. The majority of our water is from public water supply systems, and most consumption measurement is from water system revenue-grade meters. Water used within our facilities is discharged to public sanitary sewer systems. In some cases, Boeing pre-treats wastewater before discharging it to public sanitary sewer systems, in compliance with regulatory requirements. Boeing does not set voluntary effluent discharge standards beyond those set by regulation.\n\nBoeing specialists work to identify efficiencies, best practices and new technologies to reduce water use and identify alternatives. We monitor irregularities that may require action and created a Conservation Best Practice program to minimize water use, applying many water management techniques endorsed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nIn 2022, we achieved a 19% reduction compared to consumption in 2017. Water consumption was 7% lower than anticipated with sites implementing conservation initiatives to increase water intake efficiencies and with production activity remaining low. Building off the reductions seen by 2025, Boeing will transition to an absolute reduction goal to focus on the most water-intensive processes across the company.\nBiodiversity and Environmental Compliance\n\nBoeing owns thousands of acres of habitat across five locations that are being protected or restored. Each habitat is actively managed and maintained by site employees, nonprofit organizations or contract biologists. For some locations, additional agreements and monitoring are in place to ensure all legal, contractual and certification requirements are met.\n\nEach habitat is certified by the Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC), with three certified at the Gold level. The WHC\u2019s certification program is the only voluntary sustainability standard designed for broad-based biodiversity enhancement and conservation education activities on corporate landholdings.\n\n- **Avian Project Award:** Awarded to Boeing for monitoring targeted species and food sources \u2014 and being managed by adapting to the environment. The Grasshopper Sparrow is also a happy recipient.\n- **Grasslands Project Award:** Awarded to Boeing for monitoring of vegetation, wildlife use of vegetation, wildlife use and evaluation to create next steps for the project.\n- **Pollinator Project Award:** Awarded to Boeing for monitoring targeted species and food sources yearly, and recognizes a policy integrated into overall site operations to minimize, eliminate or apply responsible use practices of pesticides and herbicides.\n\nSustaining biodiversity from Seattle to Charleston\n\n**The big picture:** The WHC helps companies like Boeing advance biodiversity, sustainability, employee engagement and community relations goals with programs that translate sustainability goals and objectives into tangible and measurable on-the-ground actions. WHC Awards recognize programs and projects that demonstrate excellence in corporate conservation. Boeing\u2019s restored Emery Landfill in Wichita, Kansas, was recognized with three awards in 2022 (see left column for details).\nBoeing biodiversity efforts are virtual with real impact\n\nBoeing encouraged virtual volunteering for employees during the pandemic, including, Zooniverse \u2014 the largest platform for people-powered research where over a million volunteers assist professional researchers to amplify their biodiversity, and other work, to advance science and the humanities.\n\nWhy it matters: Organizations like Zooniverse accelerate important research by volunteers and professionals making real discoveries together. Boeing volunteers access photos captured in various habitats to identify species and their activities. The goal is to enable research that would not be possible, or practical, otherwise. 2021 Environment Champion, Kristin Marshall, has organized monthly online Zooniverse events with employees.\n\nEngagement in 2022: In 2022, 186 employees volunteered 420 hours through Zooniverse, spotting and identifying animals, and generating thousands of dollars in gift-matching by Boeing\u2019s gift-match program.\n\nIt comes down to this: A wide range of animals, plants and microorganisms create the healthy ecosystems that all living beings depend on for clean air, land and water. This research results in new discoveries, data sets useful to the wider research community and many publications.\n\n\u201cBoeing\u2019s work with Zooniverse underscores two important lessons. Many hands make light work and biodiversity reminds us that we\u2019re part of something bigger than ourselves.\u201d\n\nChris Raymond, Chief Sustainability Officer\n\nEnvironmental Compliance is Good for Business, People and the Planet\n\nA fundamental element of Boeing\u2019s environmental policy is to maintain regulatory compliance. When noncompliance is identified in our environmental management systems, Boeing evaluates and analyzes the incident, implements corrective actions and shares process improvements to build the learning into the organization.\n\nBoeing paid one significant environmental penalty in 2022, where \u201csignificant\u201d is determined by a fine greater than $10,000. At the end of 2021, stormwater samples collected at the Santa Susana Field Lab exceeded the site-specific permit limits for copper, chronic toxicity, iron, manganese, dioxin (TCDD), and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) at one or more outfalls. The penalty incurred was $22,000. The site experienced high-intensity rain events in the fourth quarter of 2021 that resulted in higher-than-normal rates of erosion from the site; the excess levels are believed to be attributable to natural sources \u2014 such as increased erosion of natural soils, decaying vegetation or waterfowl waste \u2014 and nonindustrial sources \u2014 such as road runoff and soils adjacent to telephone/utility poles. Excess copper and chronic toxicity were not attributed to an identifiable source and were episodic in nature where laboratory error was suspected.\n\nOn July 26, 2022, a significant rainfall event in the St. Louis region caused flooding that impacted the St. Louis site Industrial Wastewater Treatment Plant (IWTP). Floodwaters overtopped the IWTP, resulting in a release of untreated wastewater and associated sludges, as well as approximately 100 gallons of diesel fuel from a ruptured above-ground storage tank. The release was reported to the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, the National Response Center, and the St. Louis Metropolitan Sewer District, and appropriate response actions were completed after the flooding subsided.\nResponsible Supply Chain\n\nResponsible supply chain practices are key to advancing industry sustainability standards. It requires transparency about business processes and supplied goods, meeting stakeholder expectations, addressing regulations, and creating positive environmental and social impact. Boeing is driving a holistic approach to responsible supply chain practices that align with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct.\n\nIn 2021, we co-founded an industry effort through the International Aerospace Environmental Group (IAEG) to establish a voluntary sectoral framework for ESG engagement, including assessment and awareness, throughout the aerospace manufacturing industry.\n\nEthical, responsible and sustainable business conduct is at the core of how Boeing operates. These core principles extend to our suppliers. The Boeing Supplier Code of Conduct, based on the International Forum on Business Ethical Conduct for the Aerospace and Defense Industry\u2019s model code, provides suppliers with a set of responsible business conduct expectations consistent with our policies, principles and sustainability efforts. Read our Supplier Code of Conduct here.\n\nStepping up for sustainability: Boeing deploys supplier assessments\n\nBoeing is taking the next step to advance sustainability efforts by deploying an industry voluntary approach to sustainability assessments established by the IAEG and implemented by EcoVadis. This allows Boeing to address sustainability considerations in procurement processes and manage risk in its supply chain.\n\nWhy it matters:\n\n- Boeing has an opportunity to help influence and drive positive sustainability change because of the size of its supply chain with more than 11,000 Tier-1 suppliers around the globe.\n\n\u201cBoeing seeks to ensure that our supply chain operates ethically, sources responsibly and creates economic opportunities for diverse communities. An industry voluntary approach is key for efficiency and demonstrating ESG maturity to customers, investors and regulators.\u201d\n\nWilliam Ampofo, chair, Boeing Supply Chain Operations Council, and vice president, Parts & Distribution Services and Supply Chain, Boeing Global Services\n\nBoeing Logistics Analyst Omur Muhittinoglu develops new processes and solutions to streamline the supply chain. (Boeing photo)\nResponsible supply chain: Advancing sustainability together\n\nThe big picture: How suppliers operate is just as important as how Boeing operates. Boeing is driving supply chain sustainability awareness and advances by collaborating with its supplier network and promoting responsible business practices.\n\nLead through industry\n- Founding member of the International Aerospace Environmental Group.\n- Demonstrated commitment to collaborate, adopt and amplify industry solutions.\n\nLead by engagement and education\n- Creating understandable, actionable educational materials.\n- Driving enduring change by transparently addressing key topics, risks and opportunities.\n\nLead with commitment and reporting\n- Benchmarking through voluntary standard assessments.\n- Setting expectations for supplier sustainability performance.\n\nGlobal network and Tier-1 suppliers\n\n| Region       | Tier-1 Suppliers |\n|--------------|------------------|\n| Africa       | 5+               |\n| Asia         | 215+             |\n| Australia    | 900+             |\n| Europe       | 570+             |\n| Middle East  | 40+              |\n| North America (Non-U.S.) | 515+ |\n| South America | 1               |\n| U.S.         | 8,800+           |\n\n11,000+ Tier-1 suppliers\n229 tons of packaging waste diverted from landfill (2022)\n114M pounds (51.7M kilograms) recycled aerospace titanium (2013-2022)\nBoeing ships, stores and manages parts and supplies sustainably\n\n**Why it matters:** Getting supplies from point A to point B in a large supply chain takes expertise. Add a passion for reducing waste, maintaining quality, preventing workplace injuries and saving money, and you\u2019ve got what motivates Boeing\u2019s Transportation, Warehousing & Logistics (TWL) team.\n\n**In 2022, TWL team members:**\n\n- Eliminated packaging waste by converting from single-use and disposable packaging to reusable containers, preventing waste, which resulted in 234 metric tons diverted from landfills. For example, certain 787 parts previously came in a roughly built, wooden crate that took six people to unload. TWL\u2019s new reusable container is safer, allows faster processing and will prevent damage to parts. These 787 packaging improvements will result in 161 metric tons of crating wood diverted from landfills annually once fully implemented.\n\n- Repurposed and refurbished containers and carts saved 26 metric tons of containers and packaging materials.\n\n- Prevented 18,500 cardboard boxes from being shipped to Puget Sound factories, saving time and eliminating material waste. Consolidation centers continue to enable the use of generic reusable containers, such as shipping reusable containers through Southern California.\n\n- Boeing also began using cross-docking \u2014 a logistics procedure where products from a supplier or manufacturing plant are distributed directly to a customer with marginal to no handling or storage time. Cross-dock benefits include reduced transportation costs, fewer lost or damaged parts, and predictable pickup and delivery schedules. As a result, 145 suppliers and Boeing sites across Commercial, Services and Defense businesses reduced transportation costs, standardized pickups and optimized transportation routes using cross-docks.\n\n- Reduced GHG emissions \u2014 Regional truck pickups consolidated shipments at the sorting center to better use long-haul trucks while reducing less-than-full shipments and transit time, which reduces GHG emissions.\n\n**What\u2019s next:** The team continues to optimize the Boeing logistics network by analyzing shipment volume, truck utilization, supplier distance from cross-docks, identifying consolidation opportunities and route changes on shipments from overseas suppliers.\n\nEdison Energy\u2019s Chris Rader (senior Clean Energy adviser) and Julia Berg (director, Business Development) are part of the team that provides strategic sustainability services, energy management and clean energy supply advisory to Boeing. (Edison Energy photo)\n\n**2022 Sustainability Supplier of the Year: Edison Energy**\n\nEdison Energy received Boeing\u2019s inaugural Sustainability Supplier of the Year award for its demonstrated leadership and partnership to help Boeing achieve its renewable energy and GHG emissions reductions. This partnership:\n\n- Supported Boeing\u2019s renewable procurement strategy, resulting in Boeing using 35% renewable electricity in 2022.\n\n- Enabled several Power Purchase Agreements that will increase Boeing\u2019s renewable energy use.\n\n- Helped develop a 15-year purchasing plan for energy purchases \u2014 with renewable energy being a requirement.\nSupplier\u2019s landmark delivery milestone showcases Boeing\u2019s commitment to \u201cMake in India\u201d\n\nRossell Techsys, a supplier in Bengaluru, India, completed 120,000 deliveries of wire harnesses, electrical panels and modification kits for multiple Boeing defense programs. Boeing\u2019s continued collaboration with suppliers and investment in India\u2019s aerospace and defense ecosystem has helped build local infrastructure, capabilities, workforce development and partnerships, while harnessing the strength of Indian talent and its growing network of more than 300 suppliers.\n\nWhy it matters: It\u2019s producing positive results.\n\n- Diverse suppliers and small businesses are vital to Boeing; their innovation, agility and ability to provide creative product and service solutions are essential to delivering greater value to customers.\n- Boeing\u2019s partnership with Rossell Techsys demonstrates its commitment to small and diverse businesses.\n\n\u201cIndian suppliers are integral to Boeing\u2019s global supply chain. We work closely with our suppliers in India to support supply chain health, identify new ways to drive innovation and deliver greater value to our customers.\u201d\n\nAshwani Bhargava, senior director, Supply Chain Management, Boeing India\n\n- Rossell Techsys, the Aerospace & Defense division of Rossell India Limited, was established in 2011, and is a key supplier in India\u2019s \u201cAatmanirbhar Bharat\u201d vision, promoting people native to the area and self-reliance in defense manufacturing.\n- The company was the inaugural partner for Boeing\u2019s \u201cSkill India\u201d initiative to train and develop Indian workers and students in aerospace skills. They also provide development opportunities for individuals with disabilities.\n- Rossell Techsys received a Boeing Supplier of the Year Award in 2016 and 2019.\n\nNext steps: Boeing will continue to collaborate with suppliers around the globe to create an agile and resilient aerospace supply chain, and support a healthy, stable supply base reflective of the company\u2019s global customers and communities.\n\nSupplier diversity is essential to Boeing\n\nSupplier diversity and small business utilization are key elements in responsible and sustainable supply chain practices. Boeing is committed to collaborating with and providing opportunities to diverse suppliers (including women-owned, veteran-owned and minority-owned businesses) and small businesses.\n\n2022 Highlights\n\n| Total Diverse Suppliers\u00b9 and Small Businesses\u00b2 | 5,240 |\n| Total Amount Spent with Diverse Suppliers and Small Businesses | $4.6B |\n| Women Owned | 770 |\n| Veteran Owned | 420 |\n| Minority Owned | 550 |\n| New Diverse Suppliers and Small Businesses Onboarded | 560+ |\n\n1. Diverse suppliers refer to women-owned, veteran-owned, minority-owned, LGBT-owned and disability-owned businesses (whether small or large).\n2. Small business refers to a business that is independently owned and operated, is not dominant in the field of operations in which it is bidding and meets the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) size standards and Code of Federal Regulations, Title 13, Part 121.\nEnterprise Security and Data Privacy\n\nBoeing\u2019s Global Privacy Office is responsible for overseeing the management, use and security of personal information held by the company, including personal data from employees, customers and suppliers. Our privacy program focuses on protecting data, respecting privacy and enabling trust. To safeguard personal information, we employ a principles-based approach to data privacy that aligns with key privacy laws and frameworks in the U.S., European Union and other jurisdictions.\n\nBoeing has also established a Global Security Governance Council to further strengthen governance and enhance coordination of our security activities. Learn more about the work of our council in our Proxy Statement.\n\nBoeing Enterprise Security is critical to Boeing\u2019s operations around the world, and we continue to employ industry-leading security practices, while leveraging software and product security engineering to protect our people, property, networks, systems and information from physical and cyber threats. Boeing\u2019s security strategy prioritizes detection, analysis and response to known, anticipated or unexpected threats, effective management of security risks and resiliency against incidents. In order to protect both commercial and defense-related businesses and support our production operations, Boeing has adopted security principles that align with global security standards, such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework, and adheres to contractual and regulatory security requirements.\n\nBoeing self-phishing program helps reduce security threats\n\nBoeing Enterprise Security\u2019s Self-Phishing Program educates employees about phishing, which involves sending simulated emails to create a \u201csense-of-urgency\u201d response to click on a link, enter sensitive information, or, best-case scenario, report the \u201cfake\u201d phishing scam.\n\n2022 by the numbers:\n\n- 22% drop in employee clicks on phishing simulations from 2021.\n- 17% improvement from 2021 in simulated suspicious email reporting.\n\nIt comes down to this: Phishing is the most typical way companies are hacked. It\u2019s important for employees to be vigilant against cyberattacks to protect the business and personal data.\n\n\u201cPhishing is one of the most effective ways threat actors exploit people and companies. It relies on pushing a high volume of phishing-related content and distraction \u2014 the worst condition in the modern workplace today. If users aren\u2019t careful and trained to spot a phishing email, they may carelessly click on a link or attachment, thus placing Boeing at risk.\u201d\n\nRichard Puckett, chief security officer and vice president, Boeing Enterprise Security\n\nEmployees get ongoing updates on their phishing results on the company\u2019s internal website.\nCOMMUNITIES\n\nPurposeful Partnerships\n\nJacqueline Mercier, Defense Procurement.

The penalty incurred was $22,000. The site experienced high-intensity rain events in the fourth quarter of 2021 that resulted in higher than normal rates of erosion from the site; the excess levels are believed to be attributable to natural sources \u2014 such as increased erosion of natural soils, decaying vegetation or waterfowl waste \u2014 and nonindustrial sources \u2014 such as road runoff and soils adjacent to telephone/utility poles. Excess copper and chronic toxicity were not attributed to an identifiable source and were episodic in nature where laboratory error was suspected.

As cyber threats increase in volume and sophistication, the risk to the security of these systems and networks \u2014 and to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data they house \u2014 continues to evolve, requiring constant vigilance and concerted, company-wide risk management efforts. Boeing takes a risk-based approach to managing the security of its data and has a documented low-risk appetite for cybersecurity and data protection, while recognizing that business requirements may necessitate adjustments to that risk tolerance. To address these risks, we maintain an extensive network of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight. We also have established a Security Council to strengthen governance and coordination of cyber and physical security activities. While these measures are designed to prevent, detect and respond to unauthorized activity, there is no guarantee that they will be sufficient to prevent or mitigate the risk of a cyberattack or data loss or the potentially serious reputational, operational or financial impacts that may result. A strong partnership exists between IT, Enterprise Security, Corporate Audit, and Legal to ensure identified issues are addressed in a timely manner and incidents are reported to the appropriate regulatory bodies as required. |\n| Description of approach to identifying and addressing data security risks in products | RT-AE-230a.2 | Product Security Engineering provides a disciplined approach to the development and sustainment of our products, which is essential to ensuring mission assurance, resiliency and security. Security is integrated into our engineering processes, starting from concept development, ensuring that we develop products that are secure by design. Key cyber attributes and adversity (or threat) to the system are identified during requirements engineering, allocated throughout design, implemented and validated during development, fully tested and supported during sustainment. Additionally, Boeing works to ensure that our products are designed to anticipate, withstand, recover and adapt to cyberattack. Specifically, our security processes ensure that we have high-level requirements to baseline and monitor data flow and system behavior, detect anomalies and actively manage system configuration. The ability of our systems to understand normal operations and rapidly detect and mitigate the abnormal, combined with the security engineering focus of our development processes, provides Boeing\u2019s programs with a proactive approach to risk management. Product Security is also integrated into the Boeing enterprise Incident Response process, and we work seamlessly with stakeholders to rapidly identify, analyze, and mitigate vulnerabilities and breaches across our portfolio. |\n\n1.

Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification of the sources could take a year or more. During 2022, as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war, we suspended purchasing titanium from Russia. This has not disrupted our operations as we have been able to use inventory on hand and identify alternative sources. Many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basis.

The industry\u2019s ambition of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 has multiple levers to work toward meeting this target. |\n| Partnerships for the Goals | 17.16 17.17          | \u2022 In July, Boeing became the founding member, in partnership with the University of Sheffield, of the Energy Innovation Center to drive SAF development. In early 2023, the EIC was announced as the UK\u2019s SAF Clearing House, in partnership with the University of Dayton, reinforcing the critical role that this key facility, with Boeing\u2019s support, will play in the global ecosystem that is seeking to accelerate SAF development.  \n\u2022 Boeing and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries agreed to study sustainable technologies for a low-carbon society. Their focus areas include green hydrogen, carbon capture, electrification, sustainable materials, zero emissions technologies, new aircraft design concepts, and new feedstocks and technologies for SAF production.  \n\u2022 Boeing is supporting the Pan American Development Foundation (PADF), which is active in eight countries, working with teachers, and primary and university or post-university students to find solutions to local environmental issues. In Bolivia, PADF works with partners to develop a curriculum about alternative energy, waste management, natural resources and identifying local solutions. In Ecuador and Mexico, local partners will work with teachers to design lessons that address local needs such as reducing pollution, using plastic alternatives or storing electricity. |\nAwards and Recognition\n\nPeople\n- AAEYOY recognized Vishwa Uddanwadiker as Asian American Executive of the Year in 2022\n- Career Communications Group Inc.
