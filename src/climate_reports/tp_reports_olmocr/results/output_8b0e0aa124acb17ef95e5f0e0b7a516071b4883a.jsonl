The website owner\u2019s Terms of Use and Privacy Policy will apply.\nAt The Walt Disney Company, we strive to **inspire a better world through the power of stories**. We aim to tell stories that mean something to people\u2014stories that illuminate the world around us, spark hope, and bring people closer together. Making a positive difference in our world is part of our DNA as storytellers, and it also guides how we conduct ourselves. We are working together to grow the positive impact we have as a Company\u2014especially in areas where we are uniquely positioned to make a lasting difference. This letter and the report that follows are dedicated to sharing the actions we are taking in our operations and in our communities to address the critical issues facing our planet and fellow human beings.\n\n**We embrace a world of belonging** through our continuing efforts to promote Diversity, Equity & Inclusion in our workforce and beyond. We believe that greater representation and diversity of thought and experience make us a stronger, more capable, and creative company. To this end, over the past year we took a number of important steps in this area, ranging from implementing new content inclusion standards, to creating platforms where employees and cast members can express themselves and share their personal experiences with others. To enhance transparency and accountability, we expanded reporting of workforce diversity through our Diversity Dashboard. This commitment to diversity is reflected in our Board of Directors as well, with 7 of our 11 Directors representing racial/ethnic or gender diversity, including our Chairman and all four of our committee chairs. This year we also directed more than 50% of the Company\u2019s annual charitable giving to programs serving underrepresented communities, translating to over $150 million.\n\n**We support a world in balance** through our environmental sustainability efforts aimed at helping to protect the planet we all share. We\u2019re pleased to be making progress towards our ambitious 2030 Environmental Goals, which include a commitment to achieve net zero emissions for our direct operations. In April, we announced we are teaming up with local utility providers to build two new solar facilities expected to come online near Walt Disney World in 2023 that\u2014along with existing solar sources\u2014will power up to 40% of the resort\u2019s annual electricity needs. And we are working diligently towards defining a science-based reduction goal for the Company\u2019s Scope 3 emissions by the end of 2022. We also remain committed to saving wildlife and protecting the magic of nature by continuing to invest millions annually through our Disney Conservation Fund.\n\n**We inspire a world of hope** and bring comfort and optimism to our communities. This past year we donated more than $290 million in cash and in-kind charitable giving in support of impactful causes. And through the Disney VoluntEARS program, our employees and cast members dedicated more than 340,000 hours to helping others. Whether it\u2019s through food donations, wish granting, our children\u2019s hospital initiative, our COVID-19 response, or other means, we will continue to do our part to help people in need and make the world a better place for everyone.\n\n**We invest in our people** and recognize that our employees and cast members are the most important drivers of our success. At Disney, we offer a total rewards package with competitive pay and benefits and we seek to foster a safe, flexible, and inclusive work environment where employees are empowered to do their best work. In 2021, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we introduced hybrid and remote work options to allow employees whose roles do not require them to be on site to balance their professional and personal needs. Our human capital management strategy prioritizes providing opportunities for growth, development, and career mobility, and our education investment program Disney Aspire continues to offer eligible employees and cast members the opportunity to achieve their career dreams, with more than 12,500 employees enrolled at the end of 2021.\n\n**We are committed to operating responsibly** at Disney. We are proud of our achievements to date and remain committed to operating our businesses in a responsible and ethical way\u2014from journalistic integrity, to our supply chain, to guest and product safety, and so much more. This is a priority because it is the right thing to do, and it is what our employees and fans expect of us.\n\nAs you read through this report, I hope you will share my excitement about the progress we\u2019ve made, as well as the opportunities that lie ahead as we prepare to embark on our second century, while continuing to create the unique brand of magic that only Disney can.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBob A. Chapek\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nThe Walt Disney Company\nOur Approach\n\nThe Walt Disney Company has a longstanding commitment to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). In 2021, we refreshed our CSR strategy to connect it more deeply to Disney\u2019s corporate mission and commercial offerings, and to embrace our unique opportunities for leadership.\n\nSetting Our Priorities\n\nOur refreshed CSR strategy was informed by more than 50 interviews with internal stakeholders, including our CEO and his direct reports, executives, employees in every business and region, and our content creators. We also examined what makes us different. The combination of our expansive global reach and the widespread trust consumers have in the Disney brand, along with our unique and lasting bond with children and families, gives us the ability through our one-of-a-kind storytelling to not just positively impact the present, but also inspire the future.\n\nAs a global Company operating in many industries and geographies, Disney\u2019s CSR strategy is further built around our consideration of a wide, complex, and evolving set of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues. In FY21, our ESG priorities continued to be informed by an evaluation of each issue\u2019s importance to our businesses and society, as well as input from our proactive engagement with internal and external stakeholders; ongoing tracking of expert and proprietary research; benchmarking of peer companies; consulting third-party studies to understand what issues are important to our consumers and other stakeholders and what they expect from Disney; and a review of relevant reporting and evaluation frameworks.\n\nThese priority ESG topics, including human capital management, diversity, equity, and inclusion, and climate change, informed the selection of our CSR focus areas, and are addressed in this report as well as on our website. In 2022, we plan to conduct a deeper assessment of our priority issues, including engagement with a third-party expert in this space.\n\nOur Refreshed CSR Strategy\n\nOur aim is to inspire a better world through the power of stories. Throughout this report, you\u2019ll read about how Disney inspires a world of belonging by embracing diversity, equity, and inclusion in our workplace, our storytelling, our other offerings, and our communities; a world in balance by taking action to help protect our planet; and a world of hope by supporting our communities and especially children. We also detail how we further our CSR strategy by investing in our employees and cast members and by always striving to operate responsibly.\n\nWe are activating our new CSR strategy across our offerings\u2014including our content, experiences, and products; our operations\u2014including how we conduct ourselves behind the scenes; and our charitable giving to maximize the impact of our efforts.\n\n\u201cEvery company has a unique impact on the world. At Disney, creating stories and experiences that inspire and bring people together is ours. Our stories encourage children and adults to see the world in a positive light, to believe that anything is possible, and to take action to make their world a better place.\u201d\n\nJENNIFER COHEN\nEXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY, THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY\nInspiring a better world through the power of stories\n\nFocus Areas:\n\nWorld of Belonging\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion\nEmbrace stories and storytellers who reflect the rich diversity of our world.\n\nWorld in Balance\nEnvironmental Sustainability\nHelp change the course of our planet\u2019s story, creating a healthier home for people and wildlife.\n\nWorld of Hope\nCommunity\nBring comfort, optimism, and joy to our communities and inspire hope, especially for children.\n\nFoundational Pillars:\n\nInvesting in Our People\n\nOperating Responsibly\n\nEmbedded Into Our Businesses:\n\nOfferings\nCommercially successfully content, experiences, and products\n\nOperations\nResponsible business practices\n\nPhilanthropy\nGrants and in-kind support aligned to our CSR goals\nFY21 Highlights\n\nWorld of Belonging\n\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion\n\nThrough authentic stories, experiences, and products, and our new Reimagine Tomorrow digital destination, we champion representation in media and entertainment, advance opportunities for diverse communities, and embrace a diverse and inclusive workplace.\n\nDEI Transparency\nEnhanced through our new Diversity Dashboard\n\n46% of Employees\nSelf-identify as people of color in the U.S.\u00b9\n\n50% of Employees\nSelf-identify as women globally\u00b2\n\n7 of 11 Board Directors\nRepresent gender, racial, or ethnic diversity, including Chairman & committee chairs\n\nHBCU Engagement\nDeepened through Disney on the Yard launch\n\nInclusion Standards\nIntroduced to drive representation in front of and behind the camera\n\nWorld in Balance\n\nEnvironmental Sustainability\n\nThrough our 2030 Environmental Goals, we are working to reduce emissions, use and waste less, lower the impact of our products, build sustainably, and inspire communities to protect the magic of nature together.\n\nSolar Arrays Installed\nOn Castaway Cay and at Hong Kong Disneyland\n\nNew Solar Announced\nIncluding two new 75MW facilities in Florida, expected in 2023\n\nPlastic-free Packaging\nIntroduced for our line of classic dolls\n\n61% or 80,000+ Tons\nOf total Company operational waste diverted from landfill\n\nSustainable Seafood\nMade up 95% of seafood served in our U.S. parks, resorts, and cruise line\u00b2\n\n$120M+ Invested\nIn community conservation efforts since 1995\n\nWorld of Hope\n\nCommunity\n\nWe support communities around the world in ways only Disney can, leveraging the power of our stories and beloved characters, reach of our platforms, and employee and cast member talents.\n\n$290M+ Charitable Giving\nTotal in FY21, including $150M+ directed to underrepresented communities\u00b3\n\n400,000+\nDisney-themed products delivered to 500+ children\u2019s hospitals in the U.S. & Canada\n\n5 Hospital Installations\nBrought Disney experiences to 4 children\u2019s hospitals in the U.S. and 1 in Singapore\n\n320+ Tons Food Donated\nBy Disney Parks to support communities impacted by COVID-19 (=540,000 meals)\n\n340,000+ Service Hours\nContributed by employees and cast members through Disney VoluntEARS\n\nNearly $95M Matched\nIn employee giving through Matching Gifts & VoluntEARS grants in the past decade\n\n\u00b9 As of the end of FY21.\n\u00b2 See Footnote 9 on p. 32.\n\u00b3 See Footnote 4 on p. 11.\n**FY21 Highlights (Continued)**\n\n**Investing in Our People**\n\nOur employees are at the heart of every one of our stories and are the reason we can entertain, inform, and inspire people all over the world.

She works in close collaboration with our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Human Resources Officer, Chief Diversity Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, General Counsel, Investor Relations, our business leaders, and their respective teams. Together they work to develop strategies, policies, programs, compliance practices, and other initiatives to address our priority ESG issues and to infuse our social responsibility priorities into our offerings, operations, and philanthropic giving.\n\nAdditionally, the Board of Directors has oversight of ESG. In FY21, the Board delegated general oversight of ESG programs and reporting, such as receiving updates on environmental and sustainability policies and initiatives, to its Governance and Nominating Committee. Our EVP of CSR provides updates on ESG topics at least annually to the Governance and Nominating Committee and to the full Board as needed.\n\nThe Board also delegated oversight of specific ESG issues to certain committees. For example, in FY21, the Board delegated oversight of workforce equity matters to the Compensation Committee, and our Chief Human Resources Officer reports to the committee at least annually. In FY21, we also incorporated ESG metrics into the executive bonus plan by emphasizing diversity, equity, and inclusion, which had the highest weighting among non-financial objectives.\n\n\u25ba Read more about our approach to Corporate Governance in the Operating Responsibly section of this report and about our compensation structure in our Proxy Statement.\n\nFramework Alignment\n\nTo demonstrate where our efforts align with specific United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a collection of global goals intended to create a better and more sustainable future for all, and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) indicators, a set of standards to guide the disclosure of sustainability information by companies to their investors, you will see relevant icons embedded in line in various sections throughout this report.\n\n\u25ba Read more about how our efforts align with specific SDGs and SASB indicators in the Data & Reporting Frameworks section.\n## Stakeholder Engagement\n\nWe maintain strong relationships with our stakeholders through open, transparent, and responsive dialogue. We work with a variety of stakeholders representing diverse perspectives\u2014including consumers, employees, government, industry and business partners, nongovernmental and social impact organizations, shareholders, and members of the investment community\u2014as we believe this enhances our ability to identify opportunities and find solutions to some of our most pressing challenges. Ongoing and frequent engagement with key stakeholders informs our CSR strategy by helping us to define and prioritize our ESG issues and better understand current and emerging ESG topics.\n\n| Stakeholder Group | Examples of Engagement | Objective of Engagement |\n|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Consumers         | Consumer surveys       | As the world\u2019s premier entertainment company, we have a unique opportunity to reach a wide global audience through our storytelling.

Guided by our charitable giving guidelines, we focus on social impact investments that align to our CSR focus areas, leverage our unique assets and expertise, and address pressing social needs. In the past decade, we have also matched nearly $95 million in employee and cast member personal donations of money and time through our Matching Gifts program and our Disney VoluntEARS Grants.\n\nCharitable Giving Strategy\n\nCommitment to direct >50% of annual charitable giving to programs benefiting underrepresented communities, with a focus on:\n\n- **World of Belonging**\n  - Diversity, Equity & Inclusion\n  - Grants that advance authentic representation and increase access and opportunity in media and entertainment.\n\n- **World in Balance**\n  - Environmental Sustainability\n  - Grants that protect species and habitats and inspire kids and families to take action for wildlife and the planet.\n\n- **World of Hope**\n  - Community\n  - Grants that bring comfort, optimism, and joy to our communities and inspire hope, especially for children.\n\nIn FY21, we contributed a total of $290+ million in cash and in-kind charitable contributions.\n\nIn FY21, successfully contributed >50% of our charitable giving to programs supporting underrepresented communities.4\n\n---\n\n1 Charitable giving that we report includes grants specifically directed towards historically underrepresented and protected communities, including the Asian American, Pacific Islander, Black, Hispanic, Native American/Indigenous, and LGBTQ+ communities, as well as People with Disabilities, Veterans and Women. We also include grants to organizations where a percentage of their services reach underrepresented and protected communities. If the organization spends a majority of their efforts on these communities, we count the entire grant, and if the organization does not spend a majority, we count a proration of the grant. For grants to these two types of organizations, we rely on their self-reported percentages regarding communities served. On a sample basis, we validate the percentages that we report.\nCOVID-19 Support\n\nWe continued to support our communities impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic. We donated medical supplies and other aid to charities to get critical support to those in need, hosted COVID vaccine administration sites at Disneyland and ESPN\u2019s campus, and communicated critical public health messages across our networks and other platforms.\n\nExamples of our efforts in FY21 included:\n\n- Disney Parks shared more than 320 tons of food to support local communities heavily impacted by COVID-19 around the world, translating to more than 540,000 meals. Since the start of the pandemic, Disney Parks has donated nearly 1,300 tons of food, translating to more than 2.1 million meals.\n\n- Disney, ESPN, ABC, Freeform, FX, Hulu, and National Geographic supported the Ad Council and COVID Collaborative\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s Up to You\u201d COVID-19 vaccine education campaign that focused on empowering the American public to get the latest information about COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n- Disney Japan supported Save the Children Japan\u2019s initiative to provide more than 1,000 single-parent households with a support box that included food and daily supplies.\n\n- In India, Disney and Star India made a pledge to provide critical healthcare and essential medical equipment to support relief efforts. The team collaborated with CARE India and the United Way of Mumbai to roll out the support.\n\n- ESPN launched the Return to Play Fund, to inspire and support youth in communities of color across North America hardest hit during the pandemic. The support of local community sports organizations encourages kids to exercise and move and provides them with opportunities to grow, succeed, and find pathways to a positive future.\n\nHong Kong Disneyland joined with Foodlink Foundation to launch Disney Meal Box Express. Since June 2021, the program has provided thousands of healthy, freshly cooked meal boxes to those most impacted by the pandemic in Hong Kong.\nOur Businesses in FY21\n\nThe mission of The Walt Disney Company is to entertain, inform, and inspire people around the globe through the power of unparalleled storytelling, reflecting the iconic brands, creative minds, and innovative technologies that make ours the world\u2019s premier entertainment company. The Company is a leading diversified global family entertainment and media enterprise that, in FY21, included Disney Parks, Experiences and Products; Disney Media & Entertainment Distribution; and three content groups\u2014Studios, General Entertainment, and Sports.\n\nDisney Parks, Experiences and Products\nDisney Parks, Experiences and Products is the global hub that brings Disney\u2019s stories and characters to life through theme parks and resorts, cruise and vacation experiences, and consumer products.\n\nDisney Media & Entertainment Distribution\nDisney Media & Entertainment Distribution is responsible for delivering The Walt Disney Company\u2019s unparalleled storytelling to fans and families around the world in the evolving ways they prefer to view our content.\n\nContent Groups\nOur Studios, General Entertainment, and Sports Content Groups produce world-class entertainment, news, and sports programming globally.\nWorld of Belonging\n\nWe inspire a world of belonging through stories and storytellers who reflect the rich diversity of our world.\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion\n\nThe Walt Disney Company has the opportunity and the responsibility to create authentic, unforgettable stories, experiences, and products that capture the imagination of generations of people around the world. In 2020, we launched a Company-wide initiative to accelerate progress towards a diverse and inclusive workplace, leverage the Company\u2019s resources to advance opportunities for diverse communities, amplify underrepresented voices, and champion the importance of representation in media and entertainment.\n\nWe aim to achieve these goals through our People, Culture, Content, and Community efforts and to make our intentions clear through Transparency and Accountability. We call this collective endeavor Reimagine Tomorrow, and in September 2021, we launched a digital destination at ReimagineTomorrow.Disney.com where employees, community partners, and fans can explore the actions we have taken and view diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) performance and data updates. A standalone DEI report will be published and made available to the public on the Reimagine Tomorrow digital platform later this year.\n\n\u201cAt Disney, we amplify underrepresented voices and untold stories and champion a multitude of perspectives, recognizing that we are all greater than a single story and we all deserve to feel seen, heard, and understood.\u201d\n\nLATONDRA NEWTON\nSENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, CHIEF DIVERSITY OFFICER,\nTHE WALT DISNEY COMPANY\nPeople\n\nThe more our workforce reflects our consumers worldwide, the better we\u2019re able to serve them. Additionally, when our employees perceive that Disney\u2019s culture supports their professional development and advancement, they can be authentic, contribute freely, and take pride in our Company.\n\nOur Intention: To progress towards a workforce reflective of the diverse audiences we serve.\n\nTalent Acquisition (TA):\nOur talent recruiting, retention, and development efforts prioritize the cultivation of a strong, diverse, and thriving workforce. Disney utilizes many tools to recruit diverse talent and we take care to follow industry best practices, including marketing roles on platforms that reach diverse audiences, incorporating inclusive and accessible language in our job descriptions, interviewing diverse candidate slates, and putting diverse interview panels in place. Our Business Employee Resource Groups (BERGs) share open roles, present at career-focused events and conferences, and provide feedback on our talent sourcing strategies.\n\nWe are also developing the DEI confidence and competence of our TA organization to increase representation via recruitment and retention of underrepresented talent. In 2021, we launched a learning curriculum for both TA and hiring leaders with the objective of prioritizing inclusive practices throughout the hiring life cycle. The curriculum, which includes self-directed learning, virtual facilitated experiences, and leader-led trainings, is designed to build knowledge and awareness; support our teams in identifying, attracting, engaging, and advocating for underrepresented talent; and guide leaders through an inclusive interview and selection process. We have laid out a path to reach our global TA professionals and hiring leaders across the enterprise in FY22.\n\nTalent Development & Retention:\nWe are working to engage, develop, and retain a diverse workforce and leadership team. For example, we promote accessible workplaces and work to recruit, train, and integrate employees with disabilities following industry best practices. In December 2020, Shanghai Disney Resort demonstrated this by hosting an accessibility forum to share inclusion initiatives and career progression advice for people with disabilities. Further, our Black Talent Network has an explicit goal to accelerate exposure for Black Vice Presidents to senior leaders across the enterprise and provide opportunities for development. And Disney General Entertainment\u2019s two-year Executive Incubator Program works to create a pipeline of the next generation of diverse creative executives.\n\nWe are also developing the DEI confidence and competence of our TA organization to increase representation via recruitment and retention of underrepresented talent. In 2021, we launched a learning curriculum for both TA and hiring leaders with the objective of prioritizing inclusive practices throughout the hiring life cycle. The curriculum, which includes self-directed learning, virtual facilitated experiences, and leader-led trainings, is designed to build knowledge and awareness; support our teams in identifying, attracting, engaging, and advocating for underrepresented talent; and guide leaders through an inclusive interview and selection process. We have laid out a path to reach our global TA professionals and hiring leaders across the enterprise in FY22.\n\nImagineer and Disney Research Fellow Lanny Smoot Receives His 100th U.S. Patent\nIn August 2021, longtime Disney Imagineer and Research Fellow Lanny Smoot received his 100th career patent from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\u2014a first for anyone at The Walt Disney Company. Achieving his 100th patent, \u201cSystems and Methods of Presenting a Multi-Media Entertainment in a Venue,\u201d is a milestone not often realized by many inventors and makes Lanny one of the most prolific Black inventors in American history.\n\n\u25ba Read more about Lanny\u2019s achievement here.\nSPOTLIGHT: Disney on the Yard\n\nWe continue to strengthen our partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to build a robust, long-term pipeline of Black talent. This year, through an enterprise-wide HBCU Engagement Task Force, Disney launched Disney on the Yard, a multifaceted initiative to deepen our relationships with HBCUs through student internships, mentorship opportunities, and engagement efforts.\n\n900+ students from 39 HBCUs joined interactive virtual panels\n\n100+ professional interns were hired from HBCUs in 2021, and 23 interns hired were Disney United Negro College Fund scholars\n\n200+ students enrolled in our mentorship program in 2021\n\nIn addition to Disney on the Yard, in 2021 we announced the Disney United Negro College Fund (UNCF) Corporate Scholars Program. Through a new $1 million commitment, Disney will support 50 scholars over the course of three years, providing a scholarship, summer internship, and\u2014if applicable and based on location\u2014relocation and housing assistance. In 2021, interns from HBCUs represented 12% of Disney\u2019s total intern population, an increase from the average over the last five years.\n\n\u201cAs an HBCU graduate, I am incredibly passionate about the relationships we are forging with HBCUs for greater representation and inclusion at Disney. This collaborative relationship will allow us to better engage, inspire, and hire the next generation of Disney leaders.\u201d\n\nAVIS LEWIS\nVICE PRESIDENT, HUMAN RESOURCES, WALT DISNEY IMAGINEERING AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS, GAMES AND PUBLISHING\nCulture\n\nWe strive to design work environments that inspire optimism and drive innovation for all employees, at all levels. And because we recognize that maintaining an inclusive, supportive workplace requires mindful attention and intention, we continually adapt to the evolving needs of our people.\n\nOur Intention: To put the responsibility for an inclusive culture in the hands of our leaders and employees through comprehensive education and engagement efforts.\n\nAcross Disney, we value and encourage curiosity, innovation, collaboration, and ideas from everyone. We support a diverse and inclusive culture through education and engagement efforts and believe these experiences encourage equitable behavior change and promote a foundation of belonging.\n\nBusiness Employee Resource Groups (BERGs):\nDisney is proud to support more than 90 BERGs globally, our voluntary, employee-led groups formed around shared identity, interests, and pursuits. This year, our India team launched its first LGBTQ+ and Women\u2019s BERGs. In EMEA, chapters increased from five in FY20 to 20 in FY21 across the UK, Benelux, France, Germany, Italy, and South Africa, and we added an ENABLED regional BERG. The ENABLED BERGs are Business Employee Resource Groups focusing on all areas of accessibility and abilities.\n\nBERGs are key partners in cultivating an inclusive culture and a sense of belonging for Disney employees globally. They offer opportunities to network with peers, participate in outreach and mentoring programs, acquire new skills, enhance leadership capabilities, and drive cross-cultural business innovation. Our BERGs help facilitate inclusive conversations, creating space for employees to come together to share their experiences and show their support.\n\nPrior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we held our 2020 BERG Summit at The Walt Disney Company headquarters in Burbank, California.\nInclusive Conversations:\nIn FY21, the Reimagine Tomorrow Conversations Series, our internal DEI speaker series, hosted virtual Company-wide events for employees on various inclusion topics. Brave Space Conversations were also conducted with employees, providing employees safe spaces to discuss relevant social topics.\n\nAdditionally, employees have access to several DEI learning programs, including Everyday Inclusion, Leading Inclusively, and Hiring Inclusively. In FY21, there were more than 400 workshops and 12,000 attendees across these DEI learning programs.\n\nThe Fifth Key:\nLast year at our Parks and Resorts, we added Inclusion to our \u201cFive Keys\u201d approach that guides our renowned service, demonstrating our deep commitment to making everyone who experiences Disney to feel welcome. In FY21, we expanded upon this by updating the guidelines for how our cast members show up for work. Our new approach provides greater flexibility with respect to forms of personal expression surrounding gender-inclusive hairstyles, jewelry, nail styles, tattoos, and costume choices. We\u2019ve updated these policies not only to remain relevant in today\u2019s world, but also to enable our cast members to better express their cultures and individuality at work.\n\n500+ employees have volunteered to serve as Belonging Advocates to instill greater inclusion in their work.\nContent\n\nWe believe that forging meaningful connections with our consumers contributes to the growth and viability of the Company, so we purposefully champion a multitude of voices and perspectives in our storytelling.\n\nInclusive Storytelling:\nWe champion perspectives across dimensions of identity. The nuanced and intersectional portrayal of underrepresented communities can change the way communities are seen and the way they see themselves. Recent examples include Walt Disney Animation Studios\u2019 Raya and the Last Dragon; Disney and Pixar\u2019s Soul; Marvel Studios\u2019 Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings; Disney+\u2019s Diary of a Future President, Doogie Kame\u0101loha, M.D., and the French Original Oussekine; Disney Junior\u2019s Mira; ABC News\u2019 six-part series Soul of a Nation on Hulu; ABC\u2019s The Wonder Years; FX\u2019s Mayans M.C., POSE, and LGBTQ+ docuseries Pride; FX\u2019s Reservation Dogs on Hulu; Hulu, Searchlight, and Onyx Collective\u2019s Summer of Soul; Freeform\u2019s Good Trouble; Pixar\u2019s SparkShorts Twenty Something and Nona; Star Original\u2019s Sultan City; and more.\n\nOur efforts to tell inclusive stories have been recognized by leading organizations. We received 17 NAACP Image Awards in 2021 for promoting social justice through creative endeavors, the most for any network or distributor that year. We also received seven GLAAD Media Awards, which honor media for fair, accurate, and inclusive representation of the LGBTQ+ community. A more extensive list of acknowledgments recognizing Disney\u2019s efforts can be found on the Reimagine Tomorrow digital hub. While we take pride in our inclusive storytelling, we recognize that we still have much to do and will continue to work to grow representation and promote inclusive narratives.\n\nOur Intention: To broaden access and diversity in our industry by adopting inclusion standards across Disney General Entertainment and live-action Studio productions by the end of 2022, with the goal of advancing representation in front of and behind the camera, in marketing, and more.5\n\n\u25ba Access our Content Representation Dashboard on our Corporate Social Responsibility website here.\n\nContent Inclusion Standards:\nContent inclusion standards hold us accountable to our DEI intentions and serve as a catalyst for real and sustained change. Disney General Entertainment (DGE), with ABC Entertainment and National Geographic leading the way, has launched standards to increase inclusion of underrepresented groups onscreen, in writing and directing jobs, and below the line. Other content engines within Disney have initiated their brand-specific standards and will roll them out in the future.\n\n1Disney General Entertainment is the collection of The Walt Disney Company\u2019s entertainment and news properties creating content across a portfolio of television brands and businesses, including ABC Entertainment, ABC Signature, ABC News, Freeform, ONYX Collective, Twentieth Television Studios, FX Networks and FX Productions, Hulu Originals, Disney Branded Television (including the Disney Channel networks), and National Geographic. Disney Studios Content is the collection of The Walt Disney Company\u2019s entertainment properties creating content across a portfolio of brands. The live-action brands include Disney Live Action, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Studios, and Searchlight Pictures.\nIncreasing Diverse Talent Behind the Camera:\n\nIn 2021, Disney General Entertainment (DGE) announced Onyx Collective, a new content brand on Hulu designed to curate a slate of premium entertainment by creators of color and underrepresented voices.\n\nAdditionally, DGE\u2019s Creative Talent Development & Inclusion team connects talent to our creative community of executives through a series of professional development and relationship building events and via an expansive creative talent database. The team contributes to the foundation of diverse talent through the DGE Writing Program, DGE Directing Program, and DGE PA Program. These annual programs provide mentorship, professional development, and staffing opportunities on DGE series to emerging and diverse writers, directors, and production assistants. DGE also has a two-year Apprenticeship Program aimed at creating access to careers in media.\n\nDisney Launchpad: Shorts Incubator serves as an entry point for emerging filmmakers from underrepresented backgrounds. In 2021, the program expanded to include writers, in addition to directors. The effort produced and delivered six short films to Disney+, and some were also accepted into film festivals.\n\nDisney is also a founding sponsor of the groundbreaking industry incubator National Association of Latino Independent Producers\u2019 (NALIP) pipeline program, which addresses the underrepresentation of Latino creatives in the entertainment industry. This unique partnership pairs seasoned producers with fellows in order to develop the next generation of Latino producers. Disney Studios Content is working with NALIP to pilot this program at Searchlight Studios.\n\nAdditionally, the Africa Story Lab builds skills and provides on-set apprenticeships to the next generation of storytellers from across the African continent, particularly those from underrepresented groups. In front of the camera, The Story Lab features African children telling their stories, like that of Kiya, which will be featured on Disney Junior and Disney+.\n\nBreaking Down Stereotypes Through Sport:\n\nSince 2013, ESPN has been a Global Presenting Sponsor of Special Olympics Unified Sports\u00ae, which is dedicated to promoting social inclusion by bringing people with and without intellectual disabilities together to play, train, and compete. ESPN also serves as the Global Broadcast Partner of signature Special Olympics events, including the World Games, World Winter Games, and USA Games.\nChampioning Accurate & Diverse Representation in our Content:\n\nInclusive and authentic storytelling is an endeavor we embrace globally. We are committed to representing communities authentically so people not only see the best in themselves, but the world can see it too. In 2020, we created a council of experts from organizations on the forefront of accurate representation in media and entertainment to advise us in our assessment of our content, products, and experiences. See Stories Matter for more information on this initiative. We also have task forces in different countries and regions that assess and inform content creation and production through a more local diversity and inclusion lens. In 2021, we joined the Mental Health Storytelling Coalition with leading media companies and mental health experts in recognition of the powerful role storytelling can play in addressing mental health challenges and debuted a Mental Health Media Guide. And to support authentic Native representation in media, Disney also sponsored the creation of IllumiNative\u2019s industry guide THE TIME IS NOW: The Power of Native Representation in Entertainment.\n\nAdditionally, in 2021 ABC Entertainment Talent and Casting celebrated their milestone 20th year of the Disney Television Discovers: Talent Showcase. With the partnership of Disney\u2019s Creative Talent Development & Inclusion team, the showcase has served as a launchpad for discovering and championing new and diverse talent, including Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Chadwick Boseman, Gina Rodriguez, Pedro Pascal, Randall Park, Jesse Williams, and many more.\n\nInclusive Products and Experiences:\n\nWe are reimagining our products and attractions to be more inclusive, such as the Jungle Cruise and a new attraction based on The Princess and the Frog. Disney\u2019s annual collection of Pride-themed merchandise was rolled out in May 2021 alongside contributions benefiting organizations globally that support LGBTQ+ communities. We released adaptive, sensory-friendly costumes and wheelchair coverings, bringing special accessibility features for kids and adults with disabilities. Disney also launched a collaboration with Irish-based Izzy Wheels, creators of colorful wheelchair covers for children and adults around the world to help bridge the gap between disability and fashion. The covers feature Disney\u2019s much-loved characters and 10% of proceeds will be donated to Whizz-Kidz.\n\nDisney\u2019s Adaptive Costumes and Wheelchair Cover Sets allow fans who use wheelchairs and have other accessibility needs to transform into some of their favorite characters across the Disney portfolio.\nCommunity\n\nBy making social investments and forming partnerships with organizations, we provide access to our industry for those who might otherwise be overlooked. These efforts create significant opportunities in the short-term and nurture future generations.\n\nOur Intention: To direct more than 50% of our annual charitable giving to programs supporting underrepresented communities (beginning with FY21); and to spend at least $1 billion with diverse suppliers by 2024.\n\nIn FY21, we achieved our goal of directing more than 50% of our charitable giving to programs supporting underrepresented communities. That equated to more than $150 million of our giving directed to programs that support Asian American, Pacific Islander, Black and African American, Hispanic and Latino, Native American and Indigenous, and Multicultural communities, as well as women, veterans, people with disabilities, and those who identify as LGBTQ+.\n\nFor example, we invested in organizations that advance authentic representation of underrepresented communities in media and entertainment (such as Gold House, Array Alliance, and The National Association of Black Journalists), increase access and economic opportunity in companies (such as Catalyst, Exceptional Minds, and NAACP), promote positive messages of inclusion (such as StopAAPIHate and Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network), and empower the next generation of diverse storytellers and innovators (such as Ghetto Film School, Hispanic Scholarship Fund, American Indian College Fund, and UNCF).\n\n\u25ba Read more on our philanthropy in the Charitable Giving section.\n\nSupplier Diversity:\n\nIn FY21, we set a goal to spend at least $1 billion annually with diverse suppliers by 2024. Reaching this goal would place Disney among the top U.S. companies spending with diverse suppliers and would impact the communities where we do business by creating jobs and opportunities.\n\nIncluding diverse suppliers in our sourcing process provides us the greatest opportunity to develop the most innovative and high-quality business solutions\u2014strengthening our Company on the inside and supporting communities on the outside.\n\n\u25ba Access additional information on our Supplier Diversity page.\n\nThe Black Agency Spotlight: Proof Creative Group, a boutique creative agency focusing on key art for motion picture and television marketing and advertising for family entertainment.\n\n6 See Footnote 4 on p. 11.\n7 We validate diverse status through certification compliance using WBENC, NMSDC, Department of Veterans Affairs, NGLCC, and Disability:IN.\nInvesting in the Next Generation of Storytellers and Innovators:\n\nWe invest in initiatives that bring foundational arts, STEM, journalism, and sports to youth, and scholarships and training programs for the next generation of storytellers and innovators.\n\n**PRODUCT DESIGN**\nMarvel launched a three-year partnership in Europe with The Prince\u2019s Trust charity, offering a mentorship programme for youth ages 16 to 30 from underserved and underrepresented backgrounds interested in taking their first steps in product design.\n\n**STEM**\nDisney and Lucasfilm teamed up once again with a $1.5 million investment in global robotics nonprofit FIRST to inspire the next generation of innovators through the Star Wars: Force for Change philanthropic initiative. In 2020-2021, with the support of Disney funding, FIRST provided STEM program access to more than 318,000 students worldwide, including more than 50,000 students from underrepresented communities in the U.S.\n\n**CODING**\nSince 2015, high school girls and non-binary youth across the U.S. have been given the opportunity to learn to code while experiencing the magic of The Walt Disney Company. Using distinctly Disney elements to make this an unforgettable experience, the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program provides participants with computer science education and exposure to technology jobs through Disney guest speakers and mentors from across the Company.\n\n**SPORTS**\nESPN awarded more than $1 million of its youth sports grant funding to benefit Black and African American youth, supporting efforts such as the Women\u2019s Sports Foundation Sports 4 Life program and the USTA National Junior Tennis League.\nCREATIVE WRITING\nIn Latin America, Disney presented Historias Para Armar, a digital DIY storytelling platform developed jointly with Chicos.net and with support from Eidos Global. This initiative helps youth develop creativity, learn collaboration, and think critically. Our internal creative and production teams also developed a mini-series to accompany the platform.\n\nPERFORMING ARTS\nThrough partnerships with non-profit theater organizations in the U.S. and working directly with schools in the UK, Disney Theatrical Group invited students to a free virtual field trip for an exclusive screening of Newsies: The Broadway Musical! At a time when theaters were closed and many schools were remote, this helped students from diverse backgrounds access theater education.\n\nART DESIGN\nAs part of its commitment to inspiring young people in the pursuit of their future projects, Disneyland Paris organized a unique masterclass for art students. Marvel Artist Olivier Coipel shared his career journey and creative experiences, including how he redesigned and reinvented Thor, one of the most iconic Super Heroes of the Marvel universe.\n\nREADING\nWe launched our ninth Magic of Storytelling campaign, a collaboration with First Book that shares the joy of reading and provides new books to educators serving children in need. In 2021, First Book was able to distribute more than 100,000 Disney books in connection with the campaign. In total, we distributed more than 4.5 million books to First Book in 2021, and since 2000 we\u2019ve distributed more than 87 million books.\nTransparency & Accountability\n\nAchieving our goal of a reimagined tomorrow demands transparency and accountability. From our culture to our content and experiences, we are working together to translate our intentions into actions.\n\nWe increased transparency around our workforce representation in our Diversity Dashboard and through our 2019 EEO-1 and 2020 EEO-1 Employer Information Reports. We intend to continue publishing our Diversity Dashboard and EEO-1 reports annually.\n\nOur Senior Vice President and Chief Diversity Officer, Latondra Newton, leads the Company\u2019s strategic DEI initiatives and partners with business segments and leaders across the enterprise to translate our intentions into actions. Additionally, Disney\u2019s Board of Directors has delegated oversight of workforce equity matters to the Compensation Committee. For FY21, the Compensation Committee determined that diversity, equity, and inclusion objectives have the highest weighting among the executive compensation bonus plan\u2019s non-financial Other Performance Factors.\n\nIn addition to our content inclusion standards, we hold ourselves accountable to our DEI intentions through a set of policies and councils and a leadership team focused on creating meaningful change. Disney\u2019s CEO Diversity and Inclusion Council, comprised of a global group of senior leaders across the Company, is accountable for establishing and advancing DEI goals, objectives, and outcomes.\n\nFocused on storytelling, the Creative Inclusion Council, which includes leaders from across our creative mediums, works to challenge Disney to scale existing best-in-class inclusive content practices from across our businesses, dismantle bias in the creative process, and challenge long-held assumptions in content creation and the systems that surround it.\n\nFurther, our Equal Employment Opportunity Policy specifies that employment actions and decisions\u2014including recruitment, hiring, promotion, compensation, transfer, training, and more\u2014are consistent with our principle to provide equal employment opportunities for all employees and applicants. Our Prohibition of Harassment Policy details our expectation that employees treat others in the workplace with respect. And our Speak Up Policy encourages employees who observe or suspect misconduct, including discrimination or harassment, to speak up to provide the Company the opportunity to address the issue. These three policies cover all U.S.-based employees, while employees outside the U.S. are covered by policies reflecting these principles but tailored to the specific region.\n\nAccess our most recent DEI data on our Reimagine Tomorrow digital destination.\n\n46% of our U.S. employees self-identify as people of color.8\n\n50% of our employees worldwide self-identify as women.9\n\n8 As of the end of FY21.\nWorld in Balance\n\nWe come together to help change the course of our planet\u2019s story, creating a healthier home for people and wildlife.\nEnvironmental Sustainability\n\nOur commitment to environmental stewardship goes back to our founding nearly 100 years ago. Walt Disney himself said that \u201cconservation isn\u2019t just the business of a few people. It\u2019s a matter that concerns all of us.\u201d This is a call to action that guides us.\n\n2030 Environmental Goals\n\nDisney is committed to protecting the planet and creating a positive environmental legacy for future generations as we operate and build our businesses. We are working to reduce emissions; implement localized watershed strategies; maximize waste diversion through reductions, recycling, and reuse programs; lower the impact of our products; design and build sustainably; and inspire diverse global communities to protect the magic of nature together. Despite the continued impacts of COVID-19, in the past year we began making incremental progress towards our ambitious 2030 Environmental Goals, as described in the following pages.\n\n\u25ba For more information about our environmental goals and how we plan to achieve them, read our 2030 Environmental Goals white paper.\n\nEnvironmental Action Through Coalitions:\n\nWe are a member of several initiatives and organizations with which we engage to support climate actions consistent with the Paris Agreement, for example:\n\n- Business Alliance to Scale Climate Solutions\n- Business for Social Responsibility\n- Business Roundtable\n- Ceres Corporate Network\n- Climate Solutions working group\n- Cruise Lines International Association\n- Clean Energy Buyers Alliance\n- Sustainable Apparel Coalition\n- The Chamber of Commerce Climate Task Force\n- The World Resources Institute Corporate Consultative Group\n\nDisney supports the management and conservation of healthy forests around the world.\n\n\"Walt Disney Imagineering has always been focused on how our creativity, innovation, and ingenuity can make a positive impact on the future of our world. Sustainability is such an important and central part of our work\u2014woven into the earliest stages of the creative development process through project delivery.\"\n\nBARBARA BOUZA\nPRESIDENT, WALT DISNEY IMAGINEERING\nWe believe that business plays an integral role in the transition to a low-carbon future and we are committed to achieving net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for our direct operations by 2030. GHGs from our direct operations primarily derive from energy use at our parks and resorts sites, major corporate campuses, and from the fuel used by our cruise ships. We address our direct emissions footprint (Scope 1 and 2) through a science-based reduction hierarchy: avoiding emissions through sustainable design, reducing emissions through efficiencies, replacing high-carbon energy sources with lower carbon alternatives, and investing in certified natural climate solutions.\n\nOur extended value chains, including those associated with the production of consumer products, also generate substantial emissions (Scope 3). We are working to identify all sources of our Scope 3 emissions, which are many, given the diversity of our businesses. By the end of 2022, our intention is to define a science-based reduction goal for the Company\u2019s Scope 3 emissions footprint.\n\n\u25ba For more information about our environmental efforts, read our 2021 CDP Climate Change Survey Response. We follow the global frameworks established by GHG Protocol to measure Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gases. Click here to learn more.\nProgressing Toward Net Zero GHG Emissions:\nFor the past 15 years, Disney Parks alone have invested $24 million in energy efficiency projects calculated to reduce a cumulative 1.1 million megawatt hours (MWh) of energy use. Among our efforts, both Walt Disney World and Hong Kong Disneyland installed Edison-style LED bulbs that reduce energy consumption while maintaining the iconic Disney Main Street nostalgia.\n\nAdditionally, fuel efficiencies and utilizing low carbon fuels will also help us reach our net zero goal. Disney is participating in a low-carbon shipping pilot with Maersk ECO Delivery, as well as in the Clean Cargo initiative.\n\nStriving For Zero Carbon Electricity:\nWe are committed to purchasing or producing 100% zero carbon electricity by 2030. In FY21, we completed the installation of a solar array on Castaway Cay, which will power 70% of the island. Hong Kong Disneyland has installed more than 5,000 solar panels and is the single largest solar panel site in Hong Kong. In Florida, Walt Disney World and Reedy Creek Improvement District teamed up with local utility partners to begin development of two new 75MW solar facilities, which are expected to come online in 2023. The new facilities, paired with two existing facilities, will provide up to 40% of Walt Disney World theme parks\u2019 electricity needs\u2014the avoided emissions amount to the removal of 40,000 cars from the road annually. And at Disneyland Paris, once operational, the solar canopy plant\u2014under construction in the main guest parking lot\u2014will produce enough renewable clean electricity to account for ~17% of the resort\u2019s current consumption.\n\n\u25ba Watch how Disney Parks make a difference.\n\nInvesting in Natural Climate Solutions:\nNatural climate solutions provide immediate emission reductions until technological solutions are available and accessible. We invest in high-quality, verified, and rigorously vetted natural climate solutions that generate meaningful carbon reductions as well as positive social and economic impacts. For example, our investment with Wildlife Conservation Society in the conservation of the Keo Seima forest in Cambodia includes the sustainable use of land and resources, protects habitat, prevents further release of carbon into the atmosphere from deforestation, and supports alternative livelihoods to reduce pressure on the forest. The project preserves forest that provides basic needs and cultural identity for more than 2,500 Bunong households, increases water quality, and provides access to clean water for more than 4,000 people. Read more online about our approach and the Natural Climate Solutions projects we support.\n\n\u25ba Access emissions data in the Data & Reporting Frameworks section.\nDisney recognizes that water is a critical component for ecosystems, and a vital resource for communities and our operations around the world. In keeping with the latest science and standards, we updated our water strategy to recognize that water is a highly local issue, with unique considerations in each geography.\n\n2030 goals:\n- Implement localized watershed stewardship strategies\n- Source sustainable seafood\nWater Stewardship:\nIn 2021, we began implementing site-specific watershed stewardship strategies at our high-impact sites, including our global parks and resorts, our corporate campus in Burbank, and our Aulani resort in Hawai\u2018i. We are identifying critical regional water issues and beginning to work with partners to engage meaningfully on those issues locally. Additionally, through the Disney Conservation Fund, we funded watershed protection and restoration projects in Florida and Southern California in FY21. For example, one of the grants supported The Nature Conservancy\u2019s project to transform a brownfield into publicly accessible space and addressed water quality and habitat enhancement along the Los Angeles River.\n\nSustainable Seafood:\nWe are committed to minimizing our impact on the ocean by sourcing environmentally responsible seafood in our U.S. parks, resorts, and cruise line. In fact, we achieved a 95% sustainable seafood sourcing rate in FY21. Our U.S. sites have partnered with the Monterey Bay Aquarium since the beginning to provide the primary scientific background for Disney\u2019s sustainable seafood planning. Along with Disneyland Paris, Hong Kong Disneyland, and the Shanghai Disney Resort, our U.S. sites are collaborating with Sustainable Fisheries Partnership to rebuild depleted fish stocks and reduce the environmental and social impacts of fishing and fish farming. In addition, we are leveraging the scientific expertise on our team and grants through the Disney Conservation Fund to develop solutions that minimize the impact of fisheries on marine life.\n\nWater Conservation:\nWe remain committed to focusing on water conservation strategies, annual data reporting, and engagement with employees, cast members, guests, and community stakeholders. We will release an updated water conservation goal in the near future. In the meantime, we continue to evolve our infrastructure. For example, Shanghai Disney Resort converted 100% of the toilets in their Team Disney Administration building restrooms from potable water to non-potable in 2021. This conversion will result in an annual potable water savings of two million gallons. The project is now expanding at the Resort, with a second backstage building and an in-park guest restroom coming online in 2022.\n\nAccess water data in the Data & Reporting Frameworks section.\n\nPhotos: (Left) Disney is supporting The Nature Conservancy to safeguard local water resources and increase public access to the Los Angeles River.

(Center) Sustainable seafood is available at all Disney table service restaurants in the U.S. (Right) Non-potable water used at the Shanghai Disney Resort is pulled from Wishing Star Lake.\nThe growing amount of waste produced today poses a threat to our environment, ecosystems, and communities. Disney is helping through food waste capture, food and product donations, material sorting and reuse, reducing single-use and other plastics, and recycling. We also intend to make commitments to further reduce single-use plastics in the future. A few examples of our FY21 efforts include:\n\n- At Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom, we are testing a fully compostable experience at a Quick Service Restaurant that includes compostable plates, napkins, cutlery, and cups, new sorting waste stations, and signage for proper disposal. Meanwhile, organic waste from Walt Disney World is sent to an off-site commercial composting facility where it is turned into a nutrient-rich soil product and used to fertilize onsite plants.\n\n- Shanghai Disney Resort has eliminated disposable cutlery at all owned and operated dine-in food and beverage locations, eliminating the majority of disposable cutlery across the resort.\n\n- The FX show Y: The Last Man on Hulu was the first production in the Toronto Area to collect compostable waste while filming on location. With funding and support from Disney, they worked with local vendors to develop a waste management system for food and organic materials that can now be replicated for future productions in the area.\n\n- In addition to their own waste diversion efforts, Disneyland Paris joined forces with Ecovidrio, a non-profit organization responsible for glass recycling in Spain, for a one-of-a-kind awareness campaign: \u201cDreams matter more than ever ... so does glass recycling!\u201d Recycling containers bearing popular Disney, Marvel, and Pixar characters collected glass in 17 major Spanish cities during the busy summer tourist season.\n\nAccess waste data in the Data & Reporting Frameworks section.\nDisney brings beloved stories and franchises into the daily lives of families and fans through products that can be found around the world. To address the environmental impacts across our consumer products portfolio, we identified a set of materials that are consistently used in high volumes or are known to have other environmental concerns associated with their production and use. Such materials include paper, wood, and palm oil from forest products, as well as textiles and plastics. Additionally, we established a cross-functional consumer products task force to advance our environmental goals and produced comprehensive training materials to help our global teams and external partners understand how to help us achieve our 2030 goals. In an effort to report progress on our goals, we are building new tracking systems. We aim to begin reporting progress with select quantitative measures for FY24. In the interim, we will provide qualitative updates on our progress.\n\nGuidelines Support Procurement Suppliers:\nIn FY21, we introduced new guidelines to help our procurement sourcing professionals embed environmental expectations into vendor contracts and requests for proposals. Using our first module, which outlines practices for sustainable packaging, Hong Kong Disneyland worked with an existing vendor to reduce cardboard and plastic in shower head packaging, reducing waste by 70% and costs by 10%. Future guideline modules will focus on emissions, waste, sustainable design, water, and oceans.\nSustainable Design\n\n2030 goals:\n- New projects will be designed to achieve near net zero greenhouse gas emissions, maximize water efficiencies, and support zero waste operations\n- New construction projects in the U.S. and Europe will achieve 90% diversion of construction waste\n\nDesigning and building in a sustainable way has been a part of Disney\u2019s strategy since the beginning. Our built environment, ranging from theme parks to offices, accounts for the majority of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. We are embedding sustainability throughout the design process, utilizing a culture focused on continuous improvement, choosing innovative solutions, and remaining committed to telling sustainable stories.\n\nFor example, The Journey of Water\u2014an upcoming attraction inspired by Moana\u2014will not only conserve water with best-in-class principles, but it will also highlight the importance of the natural water cycle. This guest experience will be found at EPCOT World Nature, which is dedicated to understanding and preserving the beauty, awe, and balance of the natural world.\n\nIn collaboration with our various design teams across the Company, and leveraging the creative expertise of our Disney Imagineers, we have also established a new, rigorous set of internal Sustainable Design Standards, aligned with our 2030 goals.\n\n\u25ba Read our 2030 Environmental Goals white paper to learn more about our goals for new projects across emissions, water, and waste.\nSPOTLIGHT: Disney Stories Inspire Environmental Action\n\nDisney is a founding member of the Sustainable Production Alliance, a consortium of the world\u2019s leading film, television, and streaming companies dedicated to advancing sustainability while reducing the entertainment industry\u2019s overall environmental impact.\n\nThrough National Geographic, Disneynature, and our other content platforms, Disney also enjoys a rich and growing library of programming that connects audiences with the wonders of our natural world and inspires people to act, such as I Am Greta, Secrets of the Whales, and The Last Ice. We generated awareness for these stories with a dedicated Earth Month Collection on Disney+, and in FY21, approximately one in three subscribers streamed one or more of our Earth Month titles.\n\nAdditionally, the Environmental Media Association (EMA) Awards honor films and shows that increase public awareness of climate change, sustainability, and other environmental topics in their storylines. In 2021, we were nominated for five EMA Awards and won two. EMA also awards Green Seals and Gold Seals, which recognize the actions taken to reduce the environmental impacts of physical productions. In 2021, we won 36 Green Seals and 22 Gold Seals.\n\n\u25ba Read more about our EMA Awards here.\n\nIn 2021, we received Environmental Media Association awards for titles including Hulu\u2019s documentary I Am Greta (top right) and Disney Channel\u2019s Sydney to the Max (bottom right). EMA awards celebrate television and film titles that address climate change, sustainability, and other environmental topics.\nDisney Conservation\n\nDisney is committed to supporting and inspiring diverse global communities to protect the magic of nature together through dedicated teams, best-in-class programs, and impactful conservation investments. The Disney Conservation Fund (DCF)\u2014a Disney philanthropic initiative\u2014was created more than 25 years ago to build on Walt Disney\u2019s legacy of saving wildlife, inspiring action, and protecting the planet. Since then, we have helped protect hundreds of species globally and helped safeguard more than 315 million acres of habitat\u2014an amount equal to 10,000+ Walt Disney Worlds.\n\nDisney Conservation deploys our team and resources to advance inclusive and community-led approaches that help both people and wildlife thrive. Our grants have helped bring wildlife back from the brink of extinction, plant millions of trees in critical forests, remove more than a thousand tons of debris from the ocean, advance conservation education for underrepresented youth, engage people around the world in conservation, and more. In FY21, DCF continued its commitment through more than $6 million in grants, supporting 60 non-profit organizations working across 30 countries. Each year, the Fund also honors Disney Conservation Heroes\u2014indigenous and local leaders dedicated to the protection of nature in their communities.\n\n\u25ba Learn more about our Disney Conservation efforts online.\n\n$120M+\ninvested in community-led conservation efforts since 1995, spanning half the countries of the world and all five oceans.\nConservation of Species and Habitats:\nDisney Conservation Team Wildlife brings together the expertise of our cast members and employees\u2014scientists, educators, veterinarians, and storytellers\u2014to find solutions that benefit people, wildlife, and the planet. In FY21, Disney continued to advise and support capacity building for staff to care for critically endangered orphaned gorillas at the Gorilla Rehabilitation and Conservation Education Center in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nNatural Resource Protection:\nOur conservation scientists provide invaluable counsel and credibility when it comes to habitat and biodiversity protection in environmental impact assessments and lend their expertise to land management strategies across our properties. As an example, for nearly 15 years, our teams have worked to protect and restore the coral reefs outside Disney Castaway Cay in The Bahamas, with more than 2,000 corals planted. Based on recent surveys, these reefs are a leading example of successful coral restoration in the country.\n\nRaising Awareness:\nIn FY21, National Geographic joined forces with the non-governmental organization SOS Pantanal and Brazilian singer Luan Santana for O Pantanal Chama. This four hour musical event raised funds for the recovery and protection of the Pantanal, the largest wetland in the world, which recently lost 26% of its forest to wildfires. This event was part of the ongoing O Que Voc\u00ea Faz Importa initiative to raise awareness for creating sustainable habitats; the experience raised more than $250,000 and trended at number one on Twitter through the live event.\nWorld of Hope\n\nWe bring comfort, optimism, and joy to our communities and inspire hope, especially for children. Through our support of children's hospitals, wish granting, and the contributions of thousands of passionate employee volunteers around the world, we deliver joy when it\u2019s needed most.\nCommunity\n\nChildren\u2019s Hospitals\n\nWe support children facing serious illness and their families around the world in ways only Disney can, leveraging the power of our stories, beloved characters, unique experiences, employee ingenuity, and cast member talents. As part of our $100 million commitment announced in 2018, we continue to help reimagine the patient journey in children\u2019s hospitals through transformative murals and interactive wall art, Disney Institute training designed for hospitals, film screenings, Disney+ access, and much more.\n\nEasing the Anxiety of a Hospital Stay:\n\nDespite the profound impact of COVID-19 on hospitals, and enhanced health and safety protocols, in 2021 our teams worked remotely whenever possible, and were still able to successfully install our children\u2019s hospital concepts and experiences at four hospitals in the United States and one in Singapore\u2014positively impacting children and families during nearly one million visits to these hospitals each year.\n\n\u201cDisney stories and characters provide a shared vocabulary between our young patients and their medical team. The magic of Disney restores some childhood innocence during a very difficult time and allows us as caregivers to be at our very best.\u201d\n\nDR. JAMES B.

These include Disney-themed Starlight Gowns, as well as toys, books, games, and more. To better meet the needs of vulnerable and underserved pediatric patients, we collected hospital data on factors such as diversity of patient population, socioeconomic status of patients, rural referral facilities, and more. In FY21, we used this data to develop a weighted ranking of factors to help inform our product delivery placement recommendations, with diversity of patient population and socioeconomic factors weighted heaviest. We utilized this method to donate more than 400,000 Disney-themed products valued at more than $5.6 million.\n\nCreating Moments of Comfort:\nWe shifted our Disney Movie Moments program to a new digital platform, and piloted Disney+ access for Child Life teams in nearly 100 U.S. hospitals. We continued to screen new films in 2021, and stars from Walt Disney Animation\u2019s Raya and the Last Dragon, Disney\u2019s Cruella and Jungle Cruise, and Marvel Studios\u2019 Black Widow and Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings recorded special greetings for hospitalized children.\n\nFeedback from hospitals and families shows that our support is having a positive impact.10\n\n91% of patient family respondents indicated that the Disney experiences have had a positive impact on their child\u2019s hospital visit.\n\n98% of hospital survey respondents reported that Disney Movie Moments and Disney+ have had a positive impact on patients and their families.\n\nPhotos: (Top) Starlight Gowns, like these featuring Star Wars characters, empower pediatric patients with choice and help ease the anxiety of a hospital stay.

In total, we\u2019ve trained nearly 11,000 hospital workers since 2018.\n\nEasing Anxiety During MRI Procedures:\n\nIn Europe, we teamed up with Royal Philips, a global leader in health technology, to explore the effects of customized animated stories and Disney characters in helping to reduce fear and anxiety in children and to improve the experience during pediatric MRI procedures. The initiative will incorporate Disney characters into original stories at six European hospitals as part of a first-of-its-kind clinical research pilot program. Each story is specially designed to calm and support the child through their MRI experience, with personalized lighting, video, and sound.\n\nMickey Mouse, ready to bring some much-needed comfort to children as part of Royal Philips\u2019 MRI ambient experience.\n\nThe collaboration draws on the strengths of Disney\u2019s powerful storytelling and Royal Philips\u2019 clinical expertise and deep understanding of patient needs; empowering children to select their favourite character, such as Ariel, to help provide them with a sense of familiarity, control, and comfort.\nSPOTLIGHT: Disney Fun House Brings Joy to Pediatric Patients Across China\n\nWe recently opened Disney-themed fun houses at children\u2019s hospitals across China, including at The Children\u2019s Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Yichang Women and Children\u2019s Hospital, and a space-themed fun house at Shanghai Children\u2019s Medical Center. Our most recent fun house opened in July 2021 at Hebei Children\u2019s Hospital, joining 34 other installations in cities including Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Nanjing, Changsha, and Kunming. The goal is to reach 50 fun houses.\n\nIn compliance with social distancing mandates, Disney VoluntEARS pay regular visits to the fun houses to spend time with children playing games and engaging in craft activities. We also announced a donation to train pediatric medical workers through a five-year National Pediatric Social Work Training Program to help further enhance the hospital experience for young patients and their families.\nWish Granting\n\nBeginning with the first wish that Make-A-Wish\u00ae ever granted more than 40 years ago, Disney has fulfilled more than 145,000 magical wishes with Make-a-Wish globally\u2014from Sydney to Orlando and Bogot\u00e1 to Athens. In 2021, we reinforced our commitment by announcing a $1 million donation to Make-A-Wish as part of the grand reveal of Disney Cruise Line\u2019s newest ship, the Disney Wish.\n\nWhile the number of wishes granted this year was lower than usual due to COVID-19 restrictions, we found creative ways to let 8,000 children and their families across the globe who were waiting for their wishes know that we were thinking of them. This included sending toys and games themed to children\u2019s wishes, video messages from favorite characters, and access to our content on Disney+\u2014all with a special note letting them know that we look forward to granting their wishes as soon as it\u2019s safe to do so. We also continued The Wish Effect, a video series that takes a deeper look at the journeys of some amazing wish kids and their unforgettable stories.\n\n(Left & Center Photos): Ella (left; Wales, UK) is 8 and has a metabolic condition. Watch how Disney delivered joy to Ella as her wish to meet her fairy godmother came true. Noah (center; Wales, UK) is 5, and his wish to meet Spider-Man came true last September, following treatment for leukemia. Both wishes were fulfilled by Disney, Make-A-Wish UK, and The Kentown Wizard Foundation, who collaborated to create the Disney Wish Experience, where we transformed a country home in Hampshire, England into an enchanted manor for more than 140 families. Children who had their wishes put on hold due to the pandemic enjoyed a three-day immersive experience where they could safely interact with their favorite characters and enjoy truly magical events. Cast member VoluntEARS also gave their time and skills, contributing more than 2,000 volunteering hours. You can get a glimpse of the magic here.\n\n(Right Photo): While battling cancer, Jordan started a non-profit organization called JZips, which modifies T-shirts to allow for easier port access during chemotherapy and donates them to children undergoing treatment. In 2021, the now cancer survivor got his wish to meet with Disney executives, as well as executives from Starlight Children\u2019s Foundation, to learn about Disney\u2019s product development processes and Starlight\u2019s charitable distribution model. Inspired by his story, Disney donated to JZips to help support their mission of making treatment easier for children with cancer.\nVolunteerism\n\nVolunteerism is a central and enduring part of our Company\u2019s culture and at the heart of our community engagement efforts. For more than 38 years, our employees and cast members around the world have contributed more than 12 million hours of service supporting the communities where they live and work. In FY21, cast members and employees contributed more than 340,000 hours of service through the Disney VoluntEARS program, with volunteering mostly virtual due to COVID-19 restrictions.

Participants recorded approximately 80 stories and our non-profit partners helped distribute them in rural areas.\n\nDisney VoluntEARS across the U.S. collected more than 20,000 school supplies, donated more than 3,000 Disney-themed backpacks, and raised thousands of dollars to help underserved kids get ready to head back to school.\n\nDisney VoluntEARS walked through water to deliver gift baskets with snacks and drinks to flood victims in towns surrounding Disneyland Paris.\n\nIn California, VoluntEARS worked with Community Action Partnership of Orange County and MOMS Orange County to provide diapers, wipes, and other essential baby items to families at a drive-through distribution event. With a touch of pixie dust, families also went home with Disney books from Disney Publishing and plush toys donated by Disneyland Resort.\nStories of Hope in Communities Around the World\n\nSupporting Toys for Tots:\nDisney has been a longtime supporter of the Marine Toys for Tots program. For more than 70 years, the Company has supported Toys for Tots in bringing comfort, happiness, and inspiration to children and families in need during the holiday season.

That\u2019s why we introduced Flexibility @ Disney, a new way of working that introduces more permanent flexibility through three options: on-site, hybrid, and remote. By offering flexible schedules and work locations, Flexibility @ Disney enables our employees whose roles and functions are suited to such arrangements to balance their professional and personal needs.\n\nUnderstanding Employee Needs:\nDisney is committed to respectfully listening to employees and supporting each individual\u2019s unique goals and aspirations. This helps us better adapt to the ever-changing needs of our employees. In FY21, we conducted a pulse survey to gather feedback on the employee experience and we plan to conduct a more comprehensive survey in FY22. We also continued our Coffee Talk sessions, which bring employees from across the Company and globe, together with executives on the CEO Diversity and Inclusion Council, to provide a safe space for informal conversation and updates on Company-wide initiatives. In FY21, thousands of employees participated in these sessions.\n\nCelebrating our Employees:\nCelebrating our employees\u2019 professional and personal achievements individually and collectively has been a critical component of our Company culture since our founding.

We carried our 2020 health and safety protocols into 2021, evolving them based on changing local, regional, and federal guidelines. We continued policies governing employee pay, leave, and benefits, including our virtual Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for those directly affected by COVID-19 and enhanced backup care resources, and have implemented new policies providing pay and/or supplemental time off for employee vaccination. For furloughed employees, we continue to cover healthcare, life, and disability insurance employee premium costs.\n\nOur two Centers for Living Well continue to offer convenient, on-demand access to board-certified physicians and counselors for Disney employees, cast members, and their family members enrolled in the Cigna or Allegiance medical plan options.\n\nDisney T.R.U.S.T. is our EMEA region affinity group that celebrates positive well-being and mental health by empowering employees to Talk, Recognize, Understand, and Support, creating a workplace where all employees can Triumph. In FY21, Disney T.R.U.S.T. launched a 12-month pledge to encourage employees to focus on mental health, and hosted safe space morning coffee sessions for employees to gather virtually with senior leaders to share and discuss mental health. As a result of its popularity, Disney T.R.U.S.T. will expand to other locations, such as India. In addition, the Company honored Mental Health Awareness Month in May 2021 as well as World Mental Health Day in October 2021 by encouraging employees to take advantage of the many resources available to them, including complimentary consultations with therapists and counselors through our enhanced EAP program and more.\n\nWorkplace Safety:\n\nSafety is one of our top priorities in the decisions we make, and we promote a culture of safety throughout the Company through the numerous internal safety standards and quality assurance programs we\u2019ve established.

And to help minimize workplace safety risks, we train employees on the safety aspects of their jobs and empower them to address any safety concerns immediately.\nCOVID-19 Efforts\n\nThe health, well-being, and safety of our employees and cast members are our top priorities. Based on the recommendations of scientists, health officials, and our internal medical professionals\u2014that a COVID-19 vaccine provides protection against severe infection from the virus\u2014in FY21 we asked that our employees across the U.S. be fully vaccinated. We made it as easy as possible for our employees to get vaccinated by offering on-site distribution centers in California, Florida, Connecticut, and France. Our Florida location alone administered approximately 1,000 doses weekly throughout the year. We also introduced a process for those with medical or religious accommodation needs and partnered with TrustAssure\u2122 to help verify employee vaccination status and communicate real-time health information.\n\nIn addition, we created educational and science-driven materials from internal and external experts to address the facts, myths, and more about COVID-19 and vaccines, which were collectively viewed more than 350,000 times by our employees from launch through the end of FY21. As a result of positive feedback from employees and their desire to share the informative vaccination courses with friends and family, similar educational material was made public through a partnership with the Health Action Alliance.

The most popular themes were health & safety; communication and listening; career management; self-care; and diversity, equity & inclusion content, which was viewed more than 20,000 times. We offered several virtual DEI sessions that brought employees together to discuss timely and relevant news\u2014such as the session Breaking the Silence: Overcoming the Fear of Saying the Wrong Thing, which drew attendance from more than 31,400 collective mentorship hours. These unique programs span the U.S., UK, Latin America, Asia, and India, connecting our employees in innovative ways across both businesses and geographies.

Our Standards of Business Conduct apply to all employees and provide resources and tools to promote ethical conduct and compliance with the law. Our Board of Directors is also expected to uphold these principles, as well as our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Directors. We regularly engage our leaders and employees on these Standards through training and other forms of communication, and employees and cast members can report ethical concerns to our internal alert hotline The Guideline.\n\nRisk Oversight\n\nThe Board, either directly or through committees, assesses major risks that relate to the Company and its performance, including risks that relate to key economic and market assumptions that inform the Company\u2019s business plans (including significant transactions) and growth strategies, and significant operational risks related to the conduct of the Company\u2019s day-to-day operations.\n\n\u25ba Read more about risk management in our latest Proxy Statement and 10-K.\nSupply Chain\n\nInternational Labor Standards:\nA critical piece of our corporate responsibility efforts comprises operating a global supply chain that fosters safe, inclusive, and respectful workplaces wherever Disney-branded products are made. Disney has set labor standards for the tens of thousands of facilities that make Disney-branded products, whether we procure products from them directly or license our intellectual property to independent businesses that use their own supply chains and distribution networks.\n\nThese standards come to life through our International Labor Standards (ILS) program. The ILS program is informed by Disney\u2019s Standards of Business Conduct, Human Rights Policy, and Code of Conduct for Manufacturers, along with a range of other responsible business expectations. Additionally, our approach is informed by the United Nations\u2019 Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD\u2019s Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Now in its third decade, the ILS program tracks the names and locations of authorized factories making Disney-branded products; sets standards for when, where, and how social compliance audits confirm compliance with our standards; and provides guidance to vendors and licensees on improving the labor conditions of their facilities, if needed.\n\n\u25ba Visit our Supply Chain page to learn more about our efforts and what\u2019s to come in 2022.\nCollaboration & Investment:\n\nThrough our Supply Chain Investment Program (SCIP), we provide financial and programmatic support to nonprofit organizations, social enterprises, and United Nations agencies whose projects aim to create scalable, long-term improvements in global working conditions. Since 2012, Disney has contributed more than $23 million through the SCIP to more than 40 unique programs. For example:\n\n- In 2021, we joined efforts with BSR HERproject to focus on addressing workplace harassment in Bangladesh. BSR HERproject engages factory workers to strengthen factory policies, support mechanisms for reporting, build enhanced worker management communications, and train staff on violence and harassment prevention.\n\n- This year, the award-winning digital training platform Quizrr is using Disney\u2019s SCIP funding to expand Quizrr\u2019s dynamic worker and manager curriculum by developing and piloting a forced labor training for factory workers and management.\n\n- RightsDD, a social enterprise building an affordable modern slavery due diligence platform, is utilizing SCIP funds to deliver technology to small- and medium-sized enterprises that may lack the capacity and resources to conduct necessary forced labor and modern slavery due diligence. To date, more than 300 companies have subscribed to RightsDD\u2019s technology.\n\n- For the first time, in 2021 SCIP funding was directed to the Global Fund to End Modern Slavery. Disney\u2019s support is being applied to scale a modular mobile app, called SafeStep, designed for vulnerable migrant workers who are at risk of exploitation and forced labor. The app will allow migrants to document and track costs associated with their work, store contracts and important identification documents, and assess local wages to prevent debt bondage and unethical recruitment.\n\n\u25ba Read more here about the SCIP projects we have funded.\nDigital Citizenship & Online Safety Grants:\n\nThrough our Digital Grant Portfolio, Disney supports NGOs working on digital issues that affect the health, safety, and success of children around the globe. Grantees provide expertise in areas including digital literacy and resilience, privacy, critical thinking, and educator training.\n\nIn 2021, we invested in expanding children\u2019s digital well-being into four new regional markets including India, Korea, Indonesia, and the Middle East and North Africa, and we established a new partner at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital that provides science-based resources for caregivers to raise healthy, smart, and kind children in a digitally saturated world.\n\nWe also increased our focus on accessibility, diversity, and inclusion. We partnered with the Dutch Media Literacy Network to create a new platform for professional caretakers of young people with cognitive disabilities to help keep them safe online.\n\nIn addition to integrating safety messages in our own content and products and supporting a number of NGO partners, we join industry coalitions to promote user awareness of online safety. We are a long-time sponsor of fragFINN, collaborate with Childnet on Safer Internet Day in the UK, act as signatories to the Alliance to Better Protect Minors Online, serve on the Board of the Family Online Safety Institute, and more.\n\n\u25ba See more on our approach to digital wellness in our Privacy Center.\n\nDigital Wellness\n\nWe recognize the promise of technology for children\u2019s education, expression, inclusion, and, of course, entertainment, as our digital lives continue to expand rapidly. Disney is committed to delivering positive, inclusive, and curated content and experiences designed for children of all ages and their families to enjoy together. Our internal policies and practices promote safety within our digital experiences, and we provide parents with recommendations on practices and tools to effectively manage their family\u2019s own digital experience. For example, our Internet Safety page includes Internet safety tips and questions for caregivers to ask children about their use of the Internet. And Disney+ provides a set of parent control options including the ability to establish individual viewer profiles with rating settings.\n\n\u25ba Read more in our Global Tax Strategy statement.\n\nTax Strategy\n\nOur global tax strategy supports our commitment to high standards of corporate governance, transparency, and responsibility in supporting the execution of our global business strategy. Our tax strategy, and its underlying principles, applies to all controlled subsidiaries of The Walt Disney Company and guides the decisions we make relating to corporate tax matters. We operate with a zero-tolerance approach to tax evasion and the facilitation of tax evasion.\n\nDigital campaign in the Netherlands, teaching digital wellness to young people with cognitive disabilities.\nPrivacy & Cybersecurity\n\nDisney has implemented a robust and comprehensive global privacy program based on the principles of privacy by design, accountability, transparency, and giving consumers meaningful controls over their personal data. We regularly assess and update our program to meet the requirements of emerging privacy laws and regulations across the world, as well as to keep up with rapid advancements in technology and new business initiatives. Day-to-day management of our data privacy policies is currently overseen by our Senior Vice President, Global Public Policy, who reports directly to our General Counsel. We have incorporated privacy topics into the Company\u2019s Standards of Business Conduct training and conduct ongoing specialized training for relevant groups that handle consumer and employee data.\n\nOur Senior Vice President, Information Security and Risk Management, currently oversees day-to-day management of data security and updates the Board of Directors or Audit Committee, at least annually, on the Company\u2019s information security objectives and program. This role works closely with our Executive Vice President of Enterprise Technology and Chief Information Officer, and both roles report directly to our Chief Financial Officer.\n\nThe Company\u2019s information security program incorporates the core functions of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework, which provide a strategic view of the organization\u2019s management of cybersecurity risk. These functions cover areas such as asset management, governance, risk management, identity and access management, awareness and training, data and information protection, response and recovery, and communication protocols\u2014each as they relate to cybersecurity. Internal and external assessors periodically evaluate and benchmark the Company\u2019s information security program from both a design and effectiveness perspective.\n\n\u25ba Read more about our approach to privacy in our Data Privacy Center, and our approach to cybersecurity in our TWDC Information Security Management System document.\n\nResponsible Marketing\n\nAt Disney, we carefully consider the rights as well as the cognitive and emotional maturity of children and maintain internal guidelines that apply to marketing to support taking a leadership position in protecting children. Our guidelines and policies are designed to take extra care to promote the digital and physical safety of children in our products, experiences, and communications, as well as encourage children to make good choices. Our Nutrition Guideline Policy guides our promotion of healthier foods and beverages to kids and families. These guidelines apply to our studio promotions, food and beverage licensing, third-party advertising on our kids\u2019 networks, and kids\u2019 meals in our Disney Parks. Ongoing reviews of these global guidelines help us reflect up-to-date dietary guidance and consider the evolving social and scientific understanding of children\u2019s physical and digital lives. In FY21, we continued to meet our target of having all food and beverage advertising on our owned and controlled media platforms oriented to kids and families meet our Nutrition Guideline Policy.\n\n\u25ba Read more about our approach to responsible marketing online.\nOur dedication to high-quality journalism and editorial integrity guide our news operations and content. This means a commitment to fairness, compelling storytelling, and accuracy across ABC News and ESPN. In 2021, ABC News was granted numerous prestigious industry awards, including nine Edward R. Murrow Awards across broadcast and radio, more than any other network. ESPN established the Inclusive Content Committee in FY21, a team of 15 employees striving to enhance ESPN\u2019s storytelling by serving as a diverse resource for content creators.\n\n\u25ba Read more about journalistic integrity in the SASB Index and World of Belonging sections of this report.\n\nGuest & Product Safety\n\nThe safety of experiences and products bearing Disney brands, characters, and other intellectual property is of the utmost importance to Disney.\n\nIn our parks and resorts around the world, Safety is the first of the \u201cFive Keys\u201d of Disney\u2019s standards for theme park excellence. Our cast and crew members regularly receive safety training and communications through formal instruction, on-the-job training, and a structured communications process, and we have Safety professionals from a broad range of disciplines including medicine, engineering, quality, maintenance, attraction operations, ergonomics, human factors, industrial hygiene, occupational safety, and food safety. Additionally, in 2021, we continued increased health and safety measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to help keep our guests and cast members healthy and safe.\n\nCreated and launched in 2003, Disney\u2019s Wild About Safety program features The Lion King\u2019s Timon and Pumbaa, on a mission to spread important safety and health messages at Disney\u2019s domestic and international theme parks and resorts and to families worldwide through illustrations, activities, videos, and curriculum.\n\nOur product integrity function administers Disney\u2019s policies, procedures, and operating requirements designed to help us achieve our safety objectives and commitments with respect to physical products containing Disney intellectual property. Disney requires that licensees and vendors contractually commit to follow reasonable and proper procedures for verifying that Disney-branded products comply with applicable regulatory requirements and any additional requirements that may be specified by Disney.\n\n\u25ba Read more online about Disney Parks\u2019 commitment to Health & Safety for our guests and cast members, including our continued commitment to COVID-19 measures, and our leadership in response to COVID-19 in the Investing in Our People section of this report.\nLooking Ahead and Data & Reporting Frameworks\nLooking Ahead\n\nIn 2021, we focused our enterprise-wide CSR efforts on inspiring a better world through the power of our stories. We realigned our CSR priorities to key areas\u2014World of Belonging (Diversity, Equity & Inclusion), World in Balance (Environmental Sustainability), World of Hope (Community), Investing in Our People, and Operating Responsibly\u2014to clearly communicate our priorities to internal and external stakeholders.\n\nAs we look ahead to 2022 and beyond, we will continue to strengthen our CSR commitments through our offerings, operations, and philanthropic efforts using these focus areas as our guide.\n\nIn 2021, we rolled out a Diversity Dashboard and launched the Reimagine Tomorrow website, and in 2022, we will inspire a World of Belonging by prioritizing and continuing to measure how we embed inclusion and belonging into our content, products, experiences, and more.\n\nOur 2030 Environmental Goals will help us support a World in Balance. While we aim to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions for our direct operations, zero waste to landfill at our wholly owned and operated parks and resorts, and more by 2030, in 2022, we will continue to expand our commitment to solar energy and invest in alternative energy technologies. While we do our part to mitigate the impact of our operations on the environment, we will also use our programming, experiences, dining, and sustainably produced products to inspire action to care for our planet.\n\nWe also remain committed to creating a World of Hope, especially for children and families. We will continue to utilize the power of our stories and characters, the unparalleled reach of our platforms, and the passion of our cast member and employee VoluntEARS, to bring comfort, optimism, and joy to our communities.\n\nAs our Company continues to grow, so do our aspirations. Our commitment to Inspire a Better World through the power of our one-of-a-kind stories is both our key differentiator and how we will continue to play a unique role in the future of our world.\n\nRecent Awards & Recognition\n\n- Fortune 2021 World\u2019s Most Admired Companies (#4)\n- Comparably 2020 Best Places to Work (#39)\n- Fast Company 2021 Best Workplaces for Innovators, Walt Disney Imagineering (#38)\n- Forbes 2021 Best Employers for New Grads (ESPN #16, Disney #247)\n- Forbes 2021 America\u2019s Best Mid-Sized Employers (ESPN #19)\n- HR Executive\u2019s 2021 Most Admired for HR (#8)\n- JUST Capital\u2019s 2022 JUST 100 list (#72 overall, #1 in Media)\n- FTSE4Good Global Index\n- 2021 Edward R.

Disney\u2019s fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30.\n\nEnvironment\n13. Historical data prior to FY21 does not include businesses acquired with TFCF. FY19 and FY20 Emissions and energy data will be restated later in 2022 to reflect changes in company boundaries and updates to calculation methodologies.\n\n14. The boundary for Disney\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reporting includes owned and operated assets (such as Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, Disney Cruise Line, and commercial spaces), leased assets (such as Disney Stores and office locations), as well as Productions and fuels.\n\n15. Greenhouse gas emissions are measured and calculated according to the principles in the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol\u2019s \u201cA Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, 2004 revised edition\u201d (GHG Protocol).\n\n16. Market based emissions are used where available in calculating carbon credit retirements, total emissions, and net emissions.\n\n17. Carbon credits are from projects developed according to recognized standards (e.g., Climate Action Reserve, Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard, etc.). All credits are verified by and granted third-party reviewers.\n\n18. Total energy includes electricity, natural gas, chilled water, hot water, steam, renewable energy, and fuels.\n\n19. Percentage grid electricity is purchased electricity consumption divided by total energy consumption. Renewable energy consumed includes renewable fuels and renewable electricity either directly or purchased through a third party.\n\n20. Percentage renewables is energy consumed divided by total energy consumption. Renewable energy consumed includes renewable fuels and renewable electricity either directly or purchased through a third party.\n\n21. Percentage zero carbon electricity is any type of electricity generation that does not generate greenhouse gases such as solar, wind, and geothermal resources, but also including existing zero carbon assets on the grid, like nuclear and large-scale hydropower.\n\n22. Waste diverted includes operational waste prevention, donations, recycling, compost, anaerobic digestion, and thermal waste to energy. Total waste generated includes diverted waste, waste sent to landfill, and incineration without energy recovery. Incineration without energy recovery is not counted in total waste sent to landfill nor total waste diverted, thus the two do not add to total waste generated. For Total Company data, facilities include Theme Parks & Resorts, Disney Cruise Line, ESPN, enterprise-owned commercial and office spaces, and Pixar. Excluded are all leased properties, Disney Stores and Distribution Centers, TV stations, and all construction materials.\n\n23. The boundary for Disney\u2019s water volume reporting includes owned and operated assets (Theme Parks & Resorts, Disney Cruise Line, owned commercial and office spaces, Studios, and ESPN). Water consumption for owned and leased assets are excluded. Water data for Shanghai Disneyland was not included in data prior to FY21, however it is included in FY21 data.\n\n24. Diversion rate includes data from annual facility asset planning construction projects and construction for new assets that became operational in FY21 in the U.S. and Europe only.\n\nSocial Impact\n25. Corporate give back includes contributions made by the Disney Foundation.\n\n26. In-kind support refers to non-cash contributions comprised of tangible items or non-tangible support. Donations may include but are not limited to estimated values for merchandise, theme park tickets, food, public service airtime (PSAs), character/tenant appearances, and other charitable support. Due to differences in distribution, viewership, programming, availability, pricing, marketplace demand, and other variables, PSAs are valued differently across our media platforms. For example, in some cases, PSAs are valued based on an average sales price for the time period. In other cases, the value is based on an average sponsor value across a disparate rotation. Therefore, we do not have a single method to value PSAs.\n\n27. Includes grants directed towards historically underrepresented and protected communities, including Asian American, Pacific Islander, Black and African American, Hispanic and Latino, Native American and Indigenous, and LGBTQ+ communities, as well as People with Disabilities, Veterans, and Women. We also include grants to organizations where a percentage of their services reach underrepresented and protected communities. If the organization spends a majority of their efforts on these communities, we count the entire grant, and if the organization does not spend a majority, we count a proration of the grant. For grants to these two types of organizations, we rely on their self-reported percentages regarding communities served. On a sample basis, we validate the percentages that we report.\n\n28. Disney VoluntEARS data includes hours logged by employees of The Walt Disney Company and its subsidiaries.\n\n29. Supplier Diversity data includes Tier I spend with firms that have obtained certification from a third-party agency as being 51% owned, controlled, and operated by a minority, woman, disabled veteran, service-disabled veteran, or lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender person.\n\nWorkforce\n30. Employee statistics reflect our employment base at the end of each fiscal year.\n\n31. Headcount includes employees at TWDC, Hulu, Pixar, Disneyland Paris, and TFCF. Excludes dailies, freelancers, contractors, and domestic TWDC employees not paid in the last 60 days.\n\n32. Consistent with our 10-K, Global Employee numbers are rounded to the nearest thousand. FY18 percentages that we report.\n\n33. Prior Collective Bargaining Agreement percentages revised to exclude College Program. This includes grants directed towards historically underrepresented and protected communities, including Asian American, Pacific Islander, Black and African American, Hispanic and Latino, Native American and Indigenous, and LGBTQ+ communities, as well as People with Disabilities, Veterans, and Women. We also include grants to organizations where a percentage of their services reach underrepresented and protected communities. If the organization spends a majority of their efforts on these communities, we count the entire grant, and if the organization does not spend a majority, we count a proration of the grant. For grants to these two types of organizations, we rely on their self-reported percentages regarding communities served. On a sample basis, we validate the percentages that we report.\n\n34. Disney VoluntEARS data includes hours logged by employees of The Walt Disney Company and its subsidiaries.\n\n35. Supplier Diversity data includes Tier I spend with firms that have obtained certification from a third-party agency as being 51% owned, controlled, and operated by a minority, woman, disabled veteran, service-disabled veteran, or lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender person.\n\n36. Headcount includes full-time and part-time employees at TWDC, Hulu, Pixar, Disneyland Paris, and TFCF, except for FY18, which excludes DLP, Hulu, and TFCF. Excludes dailies, freelancers, contractors, casual seasonal, interns, and domestic TWDC employees not paid in the last 60 days. Domestic counts exclude Disney Cruise Line Shipboard. Percentages for Women based on Global full- and part-time headcount. Percentages for People of color include U.S.-based full- and part-time employees only. People of color includes employees that identify as Asian, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, Native American or Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, or Two or More Races. Prior-year Gender and People of Color numbers have been revised to include full- and part-time employees only in order to align with Reimagine Tomorrow.\n\n37. Executive includes employees with Director levels and above at TWDC, Hulu, and Pixar, and Vice President levels and above at TFCF. Manager includes employees with Manager levels at TWDC, Hulu, and Pixar, and Directors and Managers at TFCF. Below Manager includes employees that do not meet Executive or Manager criteria.\n\n38.

Percentages include ABC Entertainment, ABC Signature (previously known as ABC Studios), Disney Branded Television, Freeform, FX, Hulu Originals, National Geographic, Onyx Collective, 20th Television, and feature films from Disney, Disney Animation, Pixar, Lucasfilm, 20th, Searchlight, and Marvel. Excludes daytime, unscripted, global content developed in region, and Star. News & Sports Representation includes executive, project hire, full-time, and part-time employees. Excludes contingent workers, student programs, daily employees, and seasonal employees.\n\nSupply Chain\n39. The supply chain for Disney-branded products experiences routine fluctuations in active facilities. In any given year, a significant number of new facilities may become authorized to produce Disney-branded products, which complicates any year-to-year comparison. In FY21, the facility count should include approximately 1,000 beyond the 1,000 that are subject to the purview of the Disney International Labor Standards (ILS) program.\n\n40. Facility footprint data includes all facilities authorized to manufacture Disney-branded products at any point during the fiscal year. With respect to TFCF intellectual property, as contracts are newly executed, renewed, or amended with respect to the manufacturing of products, the facilities producing such goods fall under the purview of the Disney ILS Program and are included in the facility footprint data. Facility data is rounded to the nearest hundred.\n\n41. For country facility data, total facilities are approximate and rounded.\n\n42. Disney uses the World Bank\u2019s Governance Indicators (WGI) as the primary resource for identifying and comparing areas of risk and determining where to focus our monitoring resources and requirements. Please refer to our Permitted Sourcing Countries policy.\n\n43. The Disney ILS Program works towards ongoing and sustainable improvement in working conditions at facilities producing Disney-branded products. All Code of Conduct violations identified in active facilities as the result of audits or assessments must be corrected or remediated within the time period and in the manner established by the Disney ILS Program as a condition of continued use of the facility for the production of Disney-branded products.\n\nHealthy Living\n44. Healthy living licensing results do not include TFCF businesses.\nThe Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) developed a voluntary framework for companies to provide climate-related information to stakeholders. In line with TCFD\u2019s recommendations, each year we publicly disclose our climate-related information primarily through our CDP Climate Change survey response. In the following index, we provide a mapping of TCFD\u2019s disclosure recommendations to our CDP responses to make clear where to find comparable information regarding how we approach and manage climate risks and opportunities.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company is committed to protecting the planet and delivering a positive environmental legacy for future generations as we operate and grow our businesses. In addition to our annual response to CDP\u2019s Climate Change survey, in late 2020 we launched ambitious new goals to continue making progress in addressing our environmental impacts, and in 2021 the Board delegated oversight of ESG programs and reporting to the Governance and Nominating Committee, including with respect to environmental and sustainability policies and initiatives.

There are three pillars to ABC News\u2019s Diversity & Inclusion efforts:  \n\u2013 PEOPLE\u2014Our people, at all levels, should reflect the life experiences of our audiences. This is reflected across all staffing levels, correspondents, executives, managers, producers, writers, editors, and junior staff.  \n\u2013 CONTENT\u2014Our work is relevant to a rapidly diversifying audience. This is reflected in the growth of content and story coverage that focuses on the experiences and interests of diverse audiences at the intersection of race, politics, culture, and lifestyle.  \n\u2013 CULTURE\u2014Our environment promotes curiosity, innovation, and ideas from everyone. This is reflected in a number of initiatives including the News Division-wide \u201cEveryday Inclusion\u201d program, relevant employee committees, and frequent Diversity & Inclusion workshops and discussions programed throughout the year. | SV-ME-260a.2 |\n| TOPIC | ACCOUNTING METRIC(S) | LOCATION/RESPONSE | SASB CODE |\n|-------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------|\n| Media Pluralism (Continued) | Description of policies and procedures to ensuring pluralism in news media content | ABC News\u2019s commitment to the straightforward pursuit of truth drives all our work across platforms in established and new-and-emerging technologies. Our success lies in our dedication to the highest quality journalism, which means a commitment to fairness, compelling storytelling, and, of utmost importance, uncompromising accuracy. We expect employees to approach their work with rigor, to question thoroughly and skeptically, and to analyze deeply. We continue to build on the exceptional legacy of ABC News, upholding high standards in journalism, while also leading in innovation. Our editorial integrity and commitment to accuracy provide the foundation for the outstanding work that we do. | SV-ME-260a.2 |\n| Journalistic Integrity & Sponsorship Identification | Description of approach for ensuring journalistic integrity of news programming related to: (1) truthfulness, accuracy, objectiveness, fairness, and accountability, (2) independence of content and/or transparency of potential bias, and (3) protection of privacy and limitation of harm | \u2022 (1) Truthfulness, accuracy, objectivity, fairness, and accountability: It is the mission of ABC News to inform the public on matters of interest and importance to them. The credibility we have with our audience is essential to this mission and we, therefore, attach great importance to the maintenance of our fairness and integrity\u2014both real and perceived\u2014as we gather and report the news. Company policies on Business Ethics, Fairness, and Insider Trading apply to all employees in every division, and those policies are particularly important to ABC News employees. We share responsibility for maintaining our reputation for fairness and accuracy. Action that damages that reputation, or even gives the appearance of compromising it, harms both ABC News and the individuals involved. All employees of ABC News are, therefore, required to abide by the letter and spirit of the fairness policies and to be alert to subtle efforts that could have the effect of compromising the integrity of ABC News. \u2022 (2) Independence of content and/or transparency of potential bias: ABC News employees are hired to report and record news events, not to participate in them. News employees should remain professionally detached in all situations and not take action that would be seen as favoring one side or the other. We take particular care to act in a neutral and professional manner where the passions of others are engaged or aroused. We must all share an uncompromising commitment to accuracy and fairness in reporting the news. We should seek out knowledgeable and credible sources of information, and we should reach out for and carefully evaluate comment from those accused of wrongdoing and others with relevant information and perspectives on the matters that we are covering. When ABC News covers stories about The Walt Disney Company or other affiliated or subsidiary companies, we make clear disclosures about the relationship. \u2022 (3) Protection of privacy and limitation of harm: News staffers receive extensive guidance and training on privacy concerns and other legal issues through legal and standards training sessions. And as a regular part of our newsgathering process, there are targeted reporting meetings to discuss journalistic and legal issues. Similarly, the mission of ESPN is to provide credible, timely, contextual, and trustworthy information. This mission is supported by detailed editorial guidelines intended to protect ESPN\u2019s journalistic credibility across platforms and with the oversight of the ESPN Editorial Board. ESPN reviews its performance against these standards on an ongoing basis and regularly reviews and provides training on guidelines for personnel. Ultimately, every member of the ESPN editorial teams is responsible for upholding the reputation and integrity of ESPN reporting. | SV-ME-270a.3 |\n| TOPIC                        | ACCOUNTING METRIC(S)                                                                 | LOCATION/RESPONSE                                                                                                                                                                                                 | SASB CODE |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Nutritional Content          | Number of advertising impressions made on children, percentage promoting products that meet national dietary guidelines for children | \u2022 100% of food and beverage advertising on Disney-branded media platforms oriented to kids and families meets Disney Nutrition Guideline standards.  \n\u2022 Disney Nutrition Guideline standards are informed by national dietary guidelines and focus on limiting calories, fats, sugars, and salt while promoting consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and low-fat dairy. | FB-RN-260a.3 |\n| Data Privacy                 | Description of policies and practices relating to behavioral advertising and user privacy | \u2022 We are committed to giving consumers transparency into our data collection and use practices and robust controls over how we use that data. Our privacy policy describes how consumers\u2019 information is collected and used, as well as the very limited circumstances under which consumer data may be shared with third parties. That policy also contains information about choices consumers must make to limit the use of their data for targeted advertising and direct marketing purposes. Links to the privacy policy, as well as the control mechanisms for limiting targeted advertising, can be found on our Privacy Center. | TC-IM-220a.1 |\n| Data Privacy                 | Number of users whose information is used for secondary purposes                     | \u2022 As described above, we are committed to giving consumers notice about how their data will be used, and we only share data with third parties in very limited circumstances, such as when the consumer gives their consent or where the third party is acting as our service provider. Accordingly, we do not have a policy of using consumers\u2019 data for secondary purposes. | TC-IM-220a.2 |\n| Data Security Standards      | Description of approach to identifying and addressing data security risks, including use of third-party guidelines for children | \u2022 Our approach to cybersecurity is addressed in the Operating Responsibly section of this report on p. 59, and in greater detail in our Information Security Management System document online. | FB-RN-260a.3 |\n| Intellectual Property Protection & Media Piracy | Description of approach to ensuring intellectual property (IP) protection | \u2022 Disney strives to foster a culture that values intellectual property protection to promote creativity, storytelling, and innovation as well as maintain consumer trust. We engage in practices that protect Disney\u2019s intellectual property, including our brands, characters, and content. We also respect the intellectual property rights of others, and do not knowingly use the intellectual property of third parties without appropriate rights. Disney also requires all contributors to respect third-party intellectual property rights. We have also implemented internal intellectual property policies and trainings to increase awareness and respect for intellectual property rights among all Disney employees. | SV-ME-520a.1 |\n| TOPIC
