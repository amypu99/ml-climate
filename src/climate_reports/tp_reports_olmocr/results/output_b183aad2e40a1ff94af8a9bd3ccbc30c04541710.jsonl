But the pace of change is accelerating. The start of this century has been filled with breathtaking technological change. Advancements in mobile technology, cloud computing and machine learning have ushered in seismic transformations to how we live.\n\nDespite being wired for change, humanity\u2019s ability to adapt and remain resilient was challenged during the past three years. We lived through lockdowns and quarantines. We utilized new technologies to reimagine how we shop, learn and work. We found new ways to connect with friends and care for loved ones.\n\nWhat began as an acute health and humanitarian crisis in 2020 has evolved to a new post-pandemic normal. But that \u201cnormal\u201d has played out differently in the various parts of our lives. Many pandemic-driven changes to our society and economy were short-lived and have proven to be temporary spikes on an otherwise consistent path of gradual change. In other areas of our lives we have seen an acceleration of inevitable endgames. Some changes resulting from the pandemic will be permanent and positive for humanity.\n\nIn the 28 years that Capital One has been an independent public company, we have been focused on building a company that can succeed over the long-term. And decades before the acronym was a ubiquitous part of corporate disclosures, we recognized that the focus areas of our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) framework were key to our success. The underpinnings of ESG have always been important factors in how we manage risk and have been integrated into how we grow our businesses and measure our impact.\n\nOur environmental efforts are rooted in our belief that climate change will have a wide-ranging impact on our customers, clients and the communities. Our sustainability journey began over a decade ago, and we\u2019ve made meaningful progress each year since. We named an accountable executive for our enterprise climate efforts and established a cross-functional working group to drive our climate strategy. In 2022, we invested in measurement and analysis capabilities in order to deepen our understanding of the risks that come from a warming planet and the opportunities that come from the continued decarbonization of our economy. And we have worked to embed climate change-related considerations into the range of factors we use to evaluate strategy and risk management across the enterprise.\n\nWe have also taken advantage of opportunities to drive meaningful progress on environmental initiatives outside our walls. We have been investing in solar and wind energy projects since 2014. In 2022, we launched our Green Auto Hub to educate our auto finance customers on the increasing availability and affordability of electric and hybrid vehicles. And through the Impact Investing practice of our Capital One\nVentures team, we back startups focused on making a positive impact in our communities and on the environment.\n\nAt Capital One, we serve tens of millions of customers and are committed to helping them succeed. Our rewards cards deliver exceptional value and our flagship bank products feature no minimum balances and no monthly fees. In 2022, we launched new innovative products, signed exciting credit card partners \u2014 like REI \u2014 and continued to provide exceptional customer experiences. Our teams worked with thousands of entrepreneurs and businesses to help them access capital and build for the future. We also invested in our modern and interactive Capital One Caf\u00e9s, which serve customers, non-customers and community members. For the third year in a row, Capital One was named No. 1 in Customer Satisfaction among National Banks in the United States by J.D. Power, and our customers remain our best advocates as they recommend our company to their family and friends.\n\nIn 2022, we fully implemented our no-fee overdraft policies for our consumer banking customers. We were the first top-10 retail bank to announce the elimination of all overdraft and non-sufficient funds fees. Overdraft protection is a valuable and convenient feature and can be an important safety net for families. And our move to eliminate the fees associated with this service has saved our customers tens of millions of dollars while providing an important \u2014 and now free \u2014 service that many customers depend upon. Our announcement prompted a number of large banks to take steps to reduce customer fees on checking accounts, though few have gone as far as Capital One. We were excited to see TIME\u00ae recognized Capital One as one of the 100 Most Influential Companies,* in part due to this industry-moving announcement.\n\nOur ability to serve customers and help them succeed stands on the shoulders of our decade-long technology transformation. We have been recognized as one of the most cloud-capable companies in the world, and we continue to invest in modern infrastructure and expand our customer-facing digital tools and experiences. Capital One\u2019s digital assistant, Eno, watches out for a customer\u2019s money even when they are not actively monitoring their accounts. Millions of consumers use CreditWise, which allows users \u2014 whether they are a Capital One customer or not \u2014 to understand and improve their credit score. And Capital One Shopping has saved users hundreds of millions of dollars by automatically searching for coupons, better prices and valuable rewards at over 30,000 online retailers.\n\nSince our founding, we have focused on attracting, developing and empowering the world\u2019s best talent. In 2022 we continued to support increased diverse representation through our recruiting efforts, including expanding our candidate pipeline to maximize exposure to underrepresented groups.\n\n* From TIME. \u00a9 2022 TIME USA LLC. All rights reserved. Used under license.\nAnd we have continued to increase diverse representation in our executive ranks through internal promotions and external recruiting. We continue to focus on fostering leadership opportunities, expanding inclusion and deepening skills training to help associates thrive in their roles and grow in their careers. And we are committed to harnessing technology and new ways of working to unleash the greatness of our associates. The vast majority of our non-customer-facing associates now work in a hybrid model, where associates spend meaningful time working both in-person and virtually. Our company and our associates continue to value the flexibility provided through our initial hybrid approach as we seek to adapt to the changing landscape of today\u2019s workforce while investing in our associates\u2019 growth and development.\n\nThroughout the past year, we maintained high associate engagement, morale and inclusion scores as measured through our all-associate surveys, and I am heartened that we have been recognized as an exceptional place to launch and accelerate careers. Capital One was ranked No. 10 on the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For list, which marks our second year in the Top 10, our 11th consecutive year and our 16th year overall on this prestigious list. We were named as No. 22 on DiversityInc\u2019s list of Top 50 Companies for Diversity, up six spots from 2021. And we were ranked No. 61 on The Wall Street Journal\u2019s 250 Best-Managed Companies, including No. 34 on Innovation.\n\nOur associates are committed to giving back to their communities, and they contributed hundreds of thousands of hours of their time to service in 2022. Notably, over 900 Capital One associates engaged in pro bono and nonprofit consulting, delivering almost 20,000 hours of skilled advice, counsel and problem-solving to community groups and nonprofit partners. Capital One also committed over $70 million in grants to nonprofits in 2022, which includes over $50 million to help advance socioeconomic mobility as a part of our Impact Initiative. And we financed thousands of new affordable housing units and resident services at housing facilities across the United States.\n\nIn this report, you will learn more about who we are and how we\u2019re helping our associates, customers and communities thrive. I appreciate your interest in Capital One and the impact we are having at this exciting moment in human history. Every day, I am humbled to lead a passionate and talented team who are all-in to drive our company forward. Together with the exceptional people of Capital One, I look forward to continuing our quest to change banking for good, and along the way build one of America\u2019s great companies.\n\nRich Fairbank\nFounder and CEO\nAbout this Report\n\nCapital One\u2019s Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Report covers the period January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022 unless otherwise noted.

As a financial institution, employer and corporate citizen, we understand that we have unique opportunities to strengthen the communities around us in a rapidly-changing world. By actively engaging with a wide range of stakeholders \u2014 including our customers, employees, regulators and investors \u2014 we are better able to understand how we can drive sustainable value over the long-term.\nOur Approach to ESG\n\nWe recognize the wide-ranging impact that climate change will have on the world and are focused on embedding climate-related considerations throughout our strategy and risk management. We have also set operational emissions goals informed by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) and aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C target ambition, although they have not been reviewed by that organization.\n\nWe have undertaken efforts to understand our carbon footprint and explore the key levers we can use to reduce our own operational emissions and ways we can work with our suppliers and clients to support their decarbonization efforts. Other efforts supporting our environmental goals include purchasing renewable energy, investing in energy-efficient buildings for our new office construction or comprehensive renovations and reducing our water use.\n\nWe also integrate climate risks into our risk management processes so that we can escalate climate risk issues to senior management or the Board of Directors, as needed.\n\nOur social efforts seek to leverage our company\u2019s impact on the communities we serve in a positive way. By treating our employees well, they can better serve our customers who in turn will be better positioned to be successful in their personal and professional lives. We also engage with communities through strategic investments in programs including affordable housing, digital access, workforce development and small business initiatives. These efforts support Capital One\u2019s positive impact in the world and help the Company drive customer engagement, recruit top talent and deliver industry-leading financial products and services.\n\nOur governance efforts institutionalize practices that enable Capital One to operate sustainably and over the long-term despite rapidly changing circumstances. Our Board\u2019s active engagement and oversight and rigorous risk management practices will continue to allow Capital One to adapt as the world evolves. In 2022, we updated the charters for each committee of our Board to formalize each committee\u2019s role in overseeing ESG at Capital One.\n\nOver the course of the past two years, Capital One engaged in an ESG materiality process to identify our fourteen key ESG focus areas \u2014 four Environmental focus areas; five Social focus areas; and five Governance focus areas. This report provides an update of where we stand on each focus area.\n\nOur ESG practices are foundational to Capital One\u2019s corporate strategy and will enable our company to evolve to meet new challenges and circumstances so that we can best serve our customers, our associates, our investors and our communities. We hope you find this Report informative.\n\n\u201cAs a company that has always worked backwards from where winning is over the long-term, we recognize that it is imperative to understand and mitigate climate and environmental risks; to forge strong bonds with all stakeholders, including our associates, our customers, our investors and our communities; and to align on sound governance practices that drive sustainable practices and policies.\u201d\n\nMATT COOPER\nGeneral Counsel, Corporate Secretary and Head of ESG for Capital One\nThis report details our approach and progress within each of our 14 ESG focus areas:\n\n**Environmental**\n- Climate Risk Management\n- Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n- Consumption and Waste Reduction\n- Sustainable Finance\n\n**Social**\n- Human Capital\n- Workplace Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging\n- Consumer Well-Being and Financial Inclusion\n- Community Engagement and Social Impact\n- Privacy and Data Security\n\n**Governance**\n- Board Expertise, Independence and Engagement\n- Shareholder Rights and Governance Best Practices\n- Business Ethics\n- Political Activity\n- Risk Management\nENVIRONMENTAL\nSustainability Overview\n\nCapital One is committed to continuously improving the environmental sustainability of our business, and we recognize the wide-ranging impact that climate change will have on the world. We are focused on embedding climate-related considerations throughout our strategy and risk management. We are supplying solutions that our customers and communities will need to thrive in an economy aligned with the goals of the 2015 Paris Accords, and continue to engage our associates, customers, suppliers and other stakeholders in our environmental efforts.\nOur Sustainability Journey\n\nClimate change, and the associated efforts to address it, will be one of the biggest influences on the world in the decades ahead. This has important implications for our strategy and risk management as we consider how climate change will impact the various businesses and communities we serve over time. We can also play a significant role in addressing the future impacts of climate change and the associated transition to a lower-carbon economy, in conjunction with other businesses, governments, and future advances in technology and evolving consumer preferences.\n\nOur sustainability journey began over a decade ago with the establishment of our Environmental Sustainability Office. Since then, we have set and achieved multiple goals to improve the sustainability of our business operations. We are currently working on our fourth generation GHG reduction goal, which is to reduce Scope 1 emissions by 50 percent and Scope 3 (categories 1-14) emissions by 50 percent by 2030. This goal was informed by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) and aligns with a 1.5\u00b0C target ambition, but has not been reviewed by that organization.\n\nIn 2022, we advanced our work to improve the sustainability of our internal operations, understand the financed emissions of our customers, educate consumers, identify and manage climate risks, and work with businesses to develop and finance sustainable solutions.\n\nThe following section discusses our approach to climate, using the key components of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework.\nCapital One is Committed to the Following Goals:\n\n**REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS**\nReduce Scope 1 Direct Emissions by 50 percent and reduce Scope 3 Emissions (categories 1-14) by 50 percent by 2030 (from a baseline year of 2019).\n\n**SUPPORTING RENEWABLE ENERGY**\nPurchase 100 percent renewable electricity while increasing location-aligned procurement in the markets where we operate.\n\n**REDUCING WATER CONSUMPTION**\nReduce water use at our facilities by 20 percent by 2025 (from a baseline year of 2019).\n\n**PAPER POLICY**\nContinue to ensure 95 percent of paper purchased for operations is certified by the Forest Stewardship Council or contains 30 percent post-consumer waste recycled content each year.\n\n**OUR OFFICES**\nPursue the U.S. Green Building Council\u2019s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification, and target LEED Silver or higher for all new office construction and comprehensive renovations.\n\n**REDUCING LANDFILL USE**\nReduce landfill waste generated at our campus locations by 50 percent by 2025 (from a baseline of 2019).\nCapital One has been on its sustainability journey for more than a decade\n\n- **Set first GHG reduction target** of 10 percent (from a baseline year of 2008).\n- **Achieved original GHG reduction target one year early**, driving an 18 percent reduction.\n- **Met second GHG goal four years early**, driving a 25 percent reduction.\n- **No longer use carbon offsets to achieve our GHG reduction targets.**\n  - **Introduced goal to reduce Scope 1 emissions by 50 percent and Scope 3 (categories 1-14) emissions by 50 percent by 2030** (from a baseline year of 2019).\n\n- **Updated our baseline emissions, setting second GHG reduction goal** of 25 percent by 2020 (from a baseline year of 2012).\n- **Set goal for 100 percent renewable electricity and 3rd GHG reduction goal of becoming carbon neutral** for Scope 1 and 2 emissions and business travel emissions in Scope 3.\n- **Established internal price on carbon** of $15 per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO\u2082e).\n\n- **Joined the CDP Supply Chain program** to engage and encourage our suppliers to help reduce GHG emissions within our supply chain.\n- **Named a Senior Advisor to the CEO to serve as the Head of Climate for the enterprise.**\nClimate Governance\n\nAs we\u2019ve progressed in our environmental sustainability journey, we\u2019ve taken steps to enhance our governance and oversight of our climate-related bodies of work. We have also instituted several climate-specific governance processes at both the enterprise and line of business levels. Climate governance is integrated into our overall ESG governance framework at all levels of the Company, including the Board and senior management levels.\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nOur Board of Directors is actively engaged in the development of Capital One\u2019s enterprise climate strategy and risk management, including climate-related goals and targets. The Board receives updates from management on our enterprise-wide climate strategy and risk management at least once per year.\n\nGovernance and Nominating Committee (GNC): Our GNC has overall responsibility for Board and committee engagement with, and oversight of, policies, programs and strategies related to ESG matters, including climate, which the GNC does in coordination with other committees and the full Board.\n\nRisk Committee: Our Risk Committee oversees risk management activities for the company, including those associated with climate.\n\nAudit Committee: Our Audit Committee oversees any public climate disclosures in SEC filings.\n\nSenior Management\n\nHead of Climate: In 2021, we named a Senior Advisor to the CEO with previous senior management experience in risk, strategy and line of business leadership at Capital One, to serve as the Head of Climate for the enterprise. The Head of Climate is responsible for the formulation and coordination of our enterprise climate strategy. This individual leads a team that meets regularly to develop and review our strategy on and approach to emerging climate issues such as GHG emissions, climate regulations and climate-related challenges and opportunities in our lines of business and across the enterprise. In 2022, the Head of Climate also spearheaded work to better understand Capital One\u2019s GHG emissions, including the sources, drivers and potential levers to reduce both operational and financed emissions.\n\nHead of ESG: The Corporate Secretary and General Counsel serves as the Company\u2019s enterprise Head of ESG. This individual coordinates ESG strategies and activities at the enterprise level, including working with our Head of Climate and other senior leaders on climate issues.\n\nChief Risk Officer (CRO): Our CRO designs and oversees the implementation of Capital One\u2019s Risk Management Framework, ensuring that appropriate risks are considered during the development and execution of the corporate strategy. The CRO elevates climate risk topics to the Board of Directors and management committees, as appropriate. The CRO reports directly to both the CEO and to the Risk Committee of the Board.\n\nChief Enterprise Services Officer (CESO): Our CESO oversees some key departments related to climate, including corporate real estate and corporate procurement.\n\nLines of Business (LOB): Our LOB presidents who oversee our Auto Finance, Commercial Bank, Retail Bank and Card businesses are responsible for incorporating climate risks and opportunities into their business strategies and operating additional governance processes at the divisional level, as appropriate.\n\nChief Financial Officer (CFO): Our CFO is responsible for our emissions measurement.\nManagement Committees and Working Groups\n\nSeveral of our management committees are engaged in our climate governance processes including the ESG Advisory Committee, the Executive Risk Committee, and the Disclosure Committee. These committees discuss, review, and advise regarding ESG matters, including climate, as detailed on page 94.\n\nWe also have working groups that are focused on the day-to-day management of the risks and opportunities presented by climate change:\n\n- **Enterprise Climate Working Group**: develops and reviews our strategy on and approach to emerging climate issues.\n- **Climate Risk Working Group**: guides and manages our climate risk-related efforts.\n- **Commercial Climate Risk Steering Group**: oversees and advises on our Commercial Bank\u2019s climate risk-related efforts.\nOur Climate Strategy\n\nThe wide-ranging impact that climate change will have on our customers, clients and the communities we serve has shaped how we approach our climate strategy. Given its broad impacts, we have worked to embed climate change-related considerations into how we evaluate strategy across the enterprise.\n\nThrough our work to better understand the sources, drivers and levers for reducing emissions this year, we\u2019ve developed additional ways to engage our associates, customers, clients, suppliers and other stakeholders.\n\nThis section provides a snapshot of the progress we\u2019ve made to better understand our emissions footprint as an enterprise, and to drive sustainable solutions across our lines of business and in the communities we support. It also shares overviews of three of our key areas of focus over the past year: Auto Finance, Commercial Bank and our Capital One Ventures impact investing practice.\n\nOperational Emissions\n\nOperational emissions are inclusive of our direct GHG emissions (Scope 1), indirect GHG emissions associated with purchased electricity, steam and heat (Scope 2) and the GHG emissions associated with our supply chain (Scope 3 categories 1-14), excluding category 15 financed emissions, which are covered separately on this page. We have focused on ensuring a deep understanding of the business drivers that shape our operational emissions, with the objective of aligning processes and accountabilities with our GHG emissions reduction goals as described on page 31.\n\nIn an effort to continue our reduction in operational emissions, we performed an analysis in 2022 to gain a deeper understanding of the key business drivers and leverage points that impact these emissions. This analysis is helping to align our action plans with continued progress towards our GHG emissions reduction goals, while also building the foundation to evaluate potential future reductions in these emissions.\n\nOur work found that while macro trends like the greening of the grid can impact our operational emissions, we also have choices within our control that can affect these emissions, including those related to our corporate real estate, marketing strategies and mix, corporate travel policies, commuting policies and the emissions intensity improvements of major suppliers.\n\nThe measurement of operational emissions employs many estimates, inputs and data that are still nascent and evolving, and in many cases are owned or published by third parties. In 2022, we took strides to mature our control environment and enhanced our understanding of the many assumptions and estimates needed to measure these emissions. We also further defined the roles and responsibilities needed to better align functional areas with the ongoing measurement of these emissions.\n\nWe continue to assess regulatory and global standard-setting initiatives that may impact the measurement and disclosure of these emissions in the future.\n\nInternal Carbon Price\n\nIn 2020, Capital One established an internal price on carbon starting at $15.00 per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent, or CO\u2082e, for Scope 1, Scope 2 and verified Scope 3 (in categories 1-14) emissions. This carbon fee creates a monetary value on the GHG emissions in our carbon footprint, which can enable greater visibility and incentive alignment in the future.\n\nThe fee supports a dedicated budget to fund our carbon reduction efforts and sustainability initiatives. These initiatives have included energy efficiency improvements like LED light installations, renewable on-site energy production including solar panel installation, and water conservation efforts.\n\nFinanced Emissions\n\nFinanced emissions are the GHG emissions associated with our lending activities and investments (Scope 3, category 15). In 2022, we engaged with a third party to better understand the drivers and impact of our financed emissions. We will also be working to refine our methodologies, data and controls,\nand identify the long-term processes and infrastructure required to support potential future disclosures of these emissions.\n\nThis effort is a major undertaking given the size and diversity of our loan portfolios, in addition to the fact that many of the businesses to which we lend do not have accurate and reliable processes to measure their own emissions. This is especially true in many of the middle market segments and customers where our Commercial Bank has significant focus.\n\nWe have completed an initial assessment of our financed emissions and significant concentrations. While this initial assessment is reliant on data from multiple sources, including our clients, that is not fully complete, and does not currently have the same level of rigor and controls as our public emissions disclosures, it is useful to help guide our work within our businesses toward the areas of highest leverage.\n\nCommercial Bank\n\nBased on the initial assessment, within our Commercial Bank segment, the majority of our customers\u2019 emissions are in oil and gas and a handful of smaller, high-intensity segments. We anticipate disclosing the emissions associated with our oil and gas portfolio in the future.\n\nAuto Finance\n\nIn our consumer Auto Finance business, the vehicles we finance generate emissions as they are driven, called \u2018tailpipe\u2019 emissions. As electric vehicles (EVs) have much lower \u2018tailpipe\u2019 emissions than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, having an Auto Finance business with minimal GHG emissions would require a lending book that is exclusively made up of EVs and a significant greening of the grid which charges them. While the exact trajectory of change in the U.S. is uncertain, we expect decreases in our financed emissions for Auto Finance to roughly follow the path of consumer adoption of EVs.\n\nWhile about 7 percent of new cars sold in the U.S. were EVs in 2022, EVs make up about 1 percent of total vehicles on the road today. Similarly, a small but growing portion of the new and used vehicles in our portfolio are EVs. While the passage of recent legislation is expected to meaningfully increase the pace of EV adoption in the U.S., the exact timing will be a product of many factors and is difficult to predict with precision, and the percentage of EVs in the used car market will lag the new car market for some time.\n\nThere are also many important affordability and logistical considerations related to the transition to EVs. For example, while the selection of electric vehicles in the market is expanding, they are still less affordable for many consumers, and the current supply of used electric vehicles is limited. Additionally, electric vehicle charging infrastructure availability varies significantly by where customers live and work and is significantly more accessible to some consumers than others.\n\nTaking all of these factors into account, we expect the adoption of EVs to accelerate and be a key strategic vector in the auto finance market in the U.S. and we are developing the capabilities needed to be successful in the future, including EV underwriting, customer education and partnership capabilities.\n\nCredit Card\n\nIn the credit card industry, there is no established emissions calculation methodology. However, we have created a preliminary assessment of the emissions associated with our credit card business by adapting the guidance provided by the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials for other segments.\n\nGiven that we don\u2019t limit where consumers use their cards, if there were to be future industry standards for measuring emissions associated with credit card lending, we would anticipate our credit card portfolio\u2019s emission intensity to mirror the trajectory of emissions associated with U.S. consumer spending over time.\nAuto Finance: Green Auto Hub\n\nCapital One launched Green Auto Hub in 2022 to educate consumers on the benefits of electric and hybrid vehicles. Consumers now have the opportunity to learn more about vehicle types, maintenance, battery, range and tax incentives, as well as the impact on the environment and potential cost savings.\nCommercial Bank: Sustainable Finance Opportunities\n\nOur Commercial Bank has a dedicated Sustainable Finance* team that works to assess and address the risks and opportunities posed by the changing environmental and social landscape to best prepare our clients and our business.\n\nWhile we remain rooted in our local communities, we have scaled nationally and invested in our capabilities to support Commercial Bank clients who desire to transition to a low-carbon economy. Our Sustainable Finance team also analyzes sustainable finance capital markets trends and advises teams across Commercial Bank on financing products that align with their clients\u2019 sustainability strategies.\n\nOur Commercial Bank has multiple lines of business and specialized products that are particularly focused on sustainability. For example, our Commercial Bank Alternative Energy Tax Credit team leads Capital One\u2019s investment in renewable energy financing, utilizing two federal renewable energy tax credits: Production and Investment tax credits.\n\nCapital One\u2019s Commercial Bank Alternative Energy Tax Credit team has served the renewable industry by making tax equity investments in both wind and solar projects since the team was established in 2014. This team focuses on utility-scale projects, which are renewable energy projects that produce 10 megawatts or more of energy.\n\nSince this team\u2019s inception, Capital One has invested capital to support development and construction of new renewable assets with electricity generating capacity across the U.S. Additionally, our Commercial Bank\u2019s Municipal Finance team provides financing to state and local government facilities for energy efficiency improvements. Many of these projects reduce public sector energy and water usage.\n\nOur Commercial Bank also participates in a number of structured sustainable debt product offerings, including:\n\n- Sustainability-linked loans structured to incentivize the achievement of certain targets such as lowering greenhouse gas emissions\n- Green Loans and Green Bonds where the use of proceeds aims to facilitate and support environmental benefits\n- Green commercial real estate financing through Fannie Mae\u2019s Green Financing programs and Freddie Mac\u2019s Green Advantage programs\n\n* Any references to \u201csustainable finance\u201d in this report are intended as references to the internally defined criteria of Capital One only and not to any jurisdiction-specific regulatory definition.\nCommercial Bank: Supporting Renewable Energy Projects\n\nCapital One invested more than $90 million of tax equity alongside Duke Energy Renewables in the Jackpot Solar project, located in Twin Falls, Idaho. With a total generating capacity of 120 megawatts, the Jackpot solar project is currently the largest operating solar project in Idaho. Capital One\u2019s Commercial Bank Alternative Energy Finance team supplied 100 percent of the tax equity for the Jackpot project.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to invest alongside Duke Energy Renewables, a leading developer of wind and solar projects, and be able to finance such an important renewable energy project,\u201d said George Revock, Head of Capital One\u2019s Alternative Energy team. \u201cProjects like these are an investment that benefits the local community in Idaho and advances Capital One\u2019s sustainability efforts.\u201d\n\nLocated in Twin Falls County, the project comprises 372,000 solar modules. Idaho Power Company, a regulated utility serving 600,000 customers in Idaho and Oregon, has signed a 20-year power purchase agreement for energy generated by the facility.\nCapital One Ventures: Impact Investing\n\nCapital One Ventures, the strategic investment arm of Capital One, funds startups that are driving the future of data, technology and financial services. A portion of these companies are mission-driven businesses that live at the intersection of commerce and climate. These startups show potential to be economically viable and aim to deliver measurable impact through their core business.\n\nFor example, Capital One Ventures invested in Trove, a company working to scale back waste in the business of fashion. By enabling major brands to profitably engage in the resale of their own products, Trove and its partners ensure high-quality merchandise doesn\u2019t end up in a landfill, while sparing the precious water and materials that would go into replacement products. According to Trove, collectively among its partners, over 200,000 kilograms of waste was diverted away from landfills in 2022, representing two million kilograms of CO\u2082e.\n\nThrough Trove, consumers trade in branded items they no longer want at the more than 700 participating brand stores across the U.S. Trove\u2019s technology streamlines the full end-to-end logistics, including trade in, issuing credits to participating customers, classifying items and their condition, getting the item ready for the brand to resell and merchandising these items for their next life.\n\nThrough corporate venture capital investments in startups like Trove, Capital One Ventures aims to harness and propagate the power of emerging technology to address the challenges of climate change. Our work here is at its formative stage, but we believe Capital One Ventures can help accelerate positive change.\nClimate Risk Management\n\nWe explore climate-related risks to better understand the impact climate change will have on our business. Our team uses data and assumptions to make assessments and considers a variety of potential impacts of climate on our business over both near- and long-term time horizons.\n\nWe identify, manage and respond to climate-related risks through our risk identification process, incremental climate risk analysis and ongoing interaction with senior management and the Board. The Board primarily oversees climate-related risks through the Risk Committee and management discusses climate risk topics in a number of forums, including our senior management committees and climate risk working groups as described on pages 21-22.\n\nWe evaluate climate risks as they arise within our existing seven risk categories: credit, operational, strategic, reputational, market, liquidity and compliance risks. We also identify emerging risks that may occur across a longer time horizon, happen in the future or have a potential impact that is difficult to predict.\n\nWhen thinking about the effects of climate change, we look at risks in two forms \u2014 physical and transition risks.\n\n- **Physical risks** come from the effects of climate-related events such as hurricanes and wildfires, and chronic shifts in climate, which include rising sea levels and higher average temperatures. Increased physical risks could significantly impact our customers and clients. For example, increased flooding could cause physical damage to properties we have financed. Additionally, climate-related events could disrupt supply chains necessary for our operations and the third parties we rely on. They could also cause broader market volatility that would impact our enterprise as a whole.\n\n- **Transition risks** come from changes associated with the shift toward a lower-carbon economy, such as policy changes, shifting consumer and business sentiment and new technologies aimed at limiting climate change. For example, there could be disruptions to carbon-intensive sectors, such as oil and gas and impacts to the credit of borrowers in that segment. The transition could also impact the financing of Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles through our Auto Finance business.\n\nAssessing these risks allows us to better understand where we need to develop plans to monitor and mitigate these risks over time.\n\nOur initial risk identification work helped us examine the impacts that climate change may have on our company\u2019s risk inventory. While the risks are smaller in the near term (i.e., 1-2 years), we identified some emerging climate-related risks and shared them with our Board\u2019s Risk Committee as part of our broader Enterprise Risk profile.\n\nFor example, our Commercial Bank business is exposed to transition risk associated with more carbon-intensive sectors, as well as physical risk associated with our real estate lending portfolio. We continue to evaluate these emerging risks to better understand the potential impact and possible strategies to minimize the effects over time.\n\nWithin our Auto Finance business, the transition to electric vehicles may drive changes throughout the industry, including potential changes to customer behavior, credit performance and industry distribution models. We will continue to evaluate how these trends might impact our business strategy and risk practices over time.\n\nAs we continue to enhance climate risk management capabilities, we will conduct climate-specific scenario analysis to better understand the long-term impact of climate change on our portfolios. We will also continue to improve our risk identification process to take climate-related risks into consideration when making decisions across the enterprise. We have hired a third-party consultant to support us in building climate-related scenarios.\n\nFor more details on how Capital One manages risk, see the Risk Management section of this ESG Report found on page 95.\nMetrics and Targets\n\nCapital One has set GHG reduction targets since 2009 and continues to evaluate its GHG reduction targets in light of the most recent climate science and industry and market best practices.\n\nWe measure and set targets related to Scope 1 direct emissions from our operations, Scope 2 indirect emissions from purchased power used to run our business and Scope 3 indirect emissions (categories 1-14) that result from the operation of our business.\nBy 2030, Capital One is Committed to the Following Goals:\n\nReducing Scope 1 Direct Emissions by **50 percent** from our 2019 baseline:\n\nThese emissions are driven primarily by natural gas use in some of our offices, branches and caf\u00e9s. The **28 percent reduction in these emissions since 2019** has been largely due to branch and office consolidation. Future reductions can be driven by continued real estate portfolio optimization as well as the eventual replacement of some natural gas assets with electric alternatives in existing and new locations.\n\nContinuing to purchase **100 percent** renewable energy while increasing location-aligned procurement in the markets in which we operate:\n\n**Capital One\u2019s electricity use has declined by 42 percent since 2019** largely due to branch and office consolidation as well as remote work starting in 2020 and our hybrid work policy that began in 2022. While we will continue to purchase renewable energy certificates for 100 percent of our enterprise electricity use, future reductions in electricity use can come from continued real estate portfolio optimization, energy efficiency retrofitting in our buildings and on-site renewable energy generation.\n\nReducing Scope 3 Emissions (Categories 1-14) by **50 percent** from our 2019 baseline:\n\nThese emissions are driven primarily by our purchased goods and services, upstream transportation and distribution, associate commute and business travel. A majority of the **34 percent reduction since 2019** has come from reduced associate commute and business travel emissions as a result of remote work starting in 2020 and our hybrid work policy that began in 2022. Future reductions can come from our supply chain as we select more efficient vendors and current vendors reduce their emissions over time.\n### Electricity (MWh)\n\n| Year | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  | 2022  |\n|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n|      | 432,570 | 309,104 | 267,642 | 252,412 |\n\n### Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs)\n\n| Year | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  | 2022  |\n|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n|      | 432,570 | 309,104 | 267,642 | 252,412 |\n\n### Scope 1 Direct Emissions (MT CO\u2082e)\n\n| Year | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  | 2022  |\n|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n|      | 10,125 | 7,199 | 6,608 | 7,296 |\n\n### Scope 2 Indirect Emissions (MT CO\u2082e)\n\n#### Location-Based Emissions\n\n| Year | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  | 2022  |\n|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n|      | 155,990 | 111,097 | 95,911 | 83,850 |\n\n#### Market-Based Emissions\n\n| Year | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  | 2022  |\n|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n|      | 1,655 | 1,613 | 1,756 | 1,914 |\n\n### Scope 3 Emissions (MT CO\u2082e)\n\n#### Category 1 - Purchased Goods and Services (1)\n\n| Year | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  | 2022  |\n|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n|      | 154,557 | 146,334 | 152,182 | 151,845 |\n\n#### Category 3 - Transmission and Distribution Losses\n\n| Year | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  | 2022  |\n|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n|      | 8,755 | 6,432 | 5,577 | 4,152 |\n\n#### Category 4 - Upstream Transportation and Distribution (2)\n\n| Year | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  | 2022  |\n|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n|      | 58,432 | 34,925 | 53,137 | 60,563 |\n\n#### Category 5 - Waste Generated in Operations\n\n| Year | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  | 2022  |\n|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n|      | 1,846 | 2,588 | 2,091 | 2,164 |\n\n#### Category 6 - Business Travel\n\n| Year | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  | 2022  |\n|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n|      | 46,806 | 11,538 | 4,012 | 14,288 |\n\n#### Category 7 - Employee Commuting (3)\n\n| Year | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  | 2022  |\n|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n|      | 111,070 | 19,851 | 3,292 | 12,569 |\n\n#### Category 13 - Downstream Leased Assets\n\n| Year | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  | 2022  |\n|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n|      | \u2014     | 1,124 | 3,561 | 4,847 |\n\n### Total Scope 3 Emissions (MT CO\u2082e)\n\n| Year | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  | 2022  |\n|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n|      | 381,466 | 222,792 | 223,852 | 250,428 |\n\n### Total Scope 1, Scope 2 Location-Based and Scope 3 Categories 1, 3-7, and 13 Emissions (MT CO\u2082e)\n\n| Year | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  | 2022  |\n|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n|      | 547,581 | 341,088 | 326,371 | 341,574 |\n\n### Total Scope 1, Scope 2 Market-Based and Scope 3 Categories 1, 3-7, and 13 Emissions (MT CO\u2082e)\n\n| Year | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  | 2022  |\n|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n|      | 393,246 | 231,604 | 232,216 | 259,638 |\n\nAs best practices and industry standards emerge and evolve and data availability and quality continue to improve, we have continued to refine and enhance the estimation methodologies, usage of industry standard data, and quality assurance processes used to derive our GHG emissions results, including the application of emissions factors, and implemented a number of such changes in 2022. We assess the materiality of such refinements and enhancements on our baseline and other prior periods, based on quantitative and qualitative factors, and may recalculate prior period amounts or provide disclosure as appropriate. We did not recalculate any of the prior periods shown on this page as part of this reporting cycle.\n\nThe tables on this page present our electricity consumption and relevant GHG emissions from direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2 and Scope 3) sources, excluding financed emissions, for each year ended from 2019 (our base year) through 2022. Amounts are presented in megawatt hours (MWh) and metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MT CO\u2082e).\n\n(1) 2019-2022 emissions in this category were predominately calculated using spend data and inflation-adjusted direct emissions factors from the U.S. Environmentally-Extended Input Output v11 tables.\n\n(2) The majority of emissions in this category are supplied by third-party service providers and the U.S. Postal Service Blue Earth Carbon Accounting Platform.\n\n(3) 2022 emissions reflect methodology refinements and enhancements to our data collection process for estimating when an associate commutes to the office which we believe improve the accuracy of this estimate. These methodology changes and data collection enhancements were applied prospectively and resulted in a reduction to our employee commute emissions estimate.\nAdditional Goals\n\nRenewable Energy\n\nCapital One has met its ongoing goal of 100 percent renewable energy since 2017 by matching renewable energy certificates (RECs) to the total annual enterprise electricity usage.\n\nIn 2018, Capital One affirmed its commitment to renewable energy by becoming a member of RE100 \u2014 a collaborative, global initiative uniting more than 100 influential businesses committed to 100 percent renewable electricity.\n\nIn addition to our enterprise commitment to 100 percent renewable energy, Capital One has a goal to increase the procurement of location-aligned renewable energy produced within the markets in which we operate, as discussed on page 31.\n\nFor example, we deployed our first on-site solar array at the Michael Wassmer Innovation Center in Richmond, Virginia in 2018. Additional onsite projects are underway at our West Creek Campus in Richmond, Virginia, and our headquarters in McLean, Virginia, and are expected to become operational as early as 2023.\nGreen Building\n\nCapital One is pursuing LEED Silver or higher certification on all new buildings and comprehensive renovations. Our recently constructed or comprehensively renovated corporate buildings are listed here:\n\n| Certification Year | USGBC Project Name                                      | Rating System | Certification |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------|\n| 2019               | West Creek Campus Building 6 Refresh                    | LEED V3: ID+C | Silver       |\n| 2019               | Tysons Center 1 (Previously McLean 2)                   | LEED V3: BD+C | Gold         |\n| 2019               | West Creek Campus Building 2 Refresh                    | LEED V3: ID+C | Silver       |\n| 2019               | West Creek Campus Building 7 Refresh                    | LEED V3: ID+C | Silver       |\n| 2019               | Wilmington Workplace and Conference Center             | LEED V3: ID+C | Silver       |\n| 2020               | Wilmington 800 Delaware Ave                            | LEED V3: ID+C | Silver       |\n| 2020               | West Creek Campus Village Caf\u00e9                         | LEED V3: ID+C | Silver       |\n| 2020               | Melville, NY                                            | LEED V3: ID+C | Certified    |\n| 2021               | 1717 Innovation Hub                                    | LEED V4: BD+C | Silver       |\n| 2021               | 314 Main Street                                         | LEED V4: ID+C | Gold         |\n| 2021               | Tysons Center 2 (Previously McLean 1) Floors 7-10, 13, 14 | LEED V3: ID+C | Not Certified* |\n| 2021               | Capital One Chicago                                     | LEED V4: ID+C | Gold         |\n| 2021               | Capital One - 6th & 9th Floors                          | LEED V4: ID+C | Certified    |\n| 2021               | Capital One - Houston Interior Buildout                 | LEED V4: ID+C | Gold         |\n| 2022               | Tysons Center 2 (Previously McLean 1) Health Suite      | LEED V4: ID+C | Certified    |\n| 2022               | Capital One Block C - PAC (Capital One Hall)            | LEED V3: BD+C | Gold         |\n| 2022               | Block C Tower (Watermark Hotel)                         | LEED V3: BD+C | Gold         |\n| In Progress        | Tysons Center 3                                         | LEED V3       | Pending      |\n| In Progress        | Capital One Philadelphia                                | LEED V4: ID+C | Pending      |\n| In Progress        | Capital One Atlanta                                     | LEED V4: ID+C | Pending      |\n\n* Tysons Center 2 (Previously McLean 1) will be certified as part of a future existing Operations & Maintenance (O&M) Program certification.\nPaper Sourcing\n\nCapital One first instituted a corporate paper procurement policy in 2009 in which we defined our standard for Environmentally Preferred Paper (EPP) and established an initial target percentage of paper purchased for our operations that should come from EPP sources. We define EPP as paper that is certified by the Forest Stewardship Council or contains at least 30 percent post-consumer recycled content. We are exceeding our current goal of 95 percent EPP as of year end 2022.\n\nWaste Reduction and Water Conservation\n\nIn 2015, Capital One rolled out composting and centralized waste stations at our campus locations. In addition to reducing the amount of waste that is sent to landfills, composting plays a critical role in reducing methane. By 2025, we aim to reduce landfill waste generated at our campus locations by 50 percent, as measured from our 2019 baseline.\n\nWe are also working to reduce the amount of water we use at our facilities by 20 percent, as measured from our 2019 baseline. We are currently achieving this goal by consolidating our branch and office footprint, executing water-efficiency projects and employing native landscaping and xeriscaping practices \u2014 the process of designing landscapes to reduce the need for irrigation through native and drought resistant landscaping.\n\n|                      | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  | 2022  |\n|----------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Paper Purchased (Tons) | 75,060 | 44,952 | 78,811 | 77,996 |\n| EPP Percent          | 95%   | 99%   | 99%   | 97%   |\n| Campus Landfill (Tons) (1) | 1,942 | 954   | 685   | 1,028 |\n| Percent Reduction from Baseline | N/A   | 51%   | 65%   | 47%   |\n| Water Consumption (kGal) (2) | 261,268 | 190,053 | 166,161 | 136,196 |\n| Percent Reduction from Baseline | N/A   | 27%   | 36%   | 48%   |\n\n(1) Campus landfill includes: West Creek Campus (Richmond, VA), Knolls Campus (Richmond, VA) Plano Campus (Plano, TX), McLean headquarters (McLean, VA).\n\n(2) Water includes billed consumption data for Office, Branch and Caf\u00e9 locations where Capital One is responsible for the water utility service.\nMcLean campus in VA\n\nSOCIAL\nHuman Capital\n\nNamed No. 10 in Fortune\u2019s 100 Best Companies to Work For in 2022, we are honored to be recognized as an employer of choice through our critical work on behalf of our associates.\nOur associates take pride in driving our mission to Change Banking for Good and fueling their own professional growth through learning and development. They spend their days immersed in a fast-moving, technology-forward environment where collaboration and a culture of belonging foster breakthrough ideas. They\u2019re empowered to take on interesting, impactful work that\u2019s disrupting an entire industry \u2014 all while having the support and flexibility to take care of what matters most to them in their personal lives.\n\n**We Support Total Well-Being**\n\nCapital One was founded on a simple principle: recruit great people and give them the opportunity to be great. We recognize that the ability to be great starts with caring for our associates.\n\nOur Total Rewards (benefits and pay) package cares for our associates\u2019 well-being so that they can feel healthy all around \u2014 physically, emotionally and financially. With more than 48,000 U.S. associates with individual needs, caring for total well-being can look very different person to person. That\u2019s why inclusivity is at the forefront of our design. It\u2019s in our DNA to listen to associates and use their feedback to inform our Total Rewards offerings.\n\nCapital One offers full-time and part-time associates a choice between two Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) health plans with a Flexible Spending Account (FSA), or a Consumer-Driven Health Plan (CDHP) with a Health Savings Account (HSA). All plans are highly subsidized by Capital One and we offer an associate match of up to $500 to an associate\u2019s FSA. We also offer up to $500 to an associate\u2019s HSA ($1,000 if the associate is covering dependents).\n\nIn order for new parents to focus their time and energy on their families, we provide paid leave at 100 percent for all full-time associates. All new parents receive 8 weeks of paid leave including those who grow their family through adoption, foster care or surrogacy. Associates who give birth receive additional time off for healing for a total of 18 weeks paid leave.\n\nWe continue to focus on supporting associates\u2019 well-being and offering opportunities to come together as a community to support the diverse needs of our workforce. We\u2019ve hosted a variety of education webinars on health, sleep and mental health across gender and identity groups. Over 7,900 associates have participated year to date.\n\n**2022 Workplace Awards**\n\n- Canada\u2019s Top Employers for Young People\n- Dave Thomas Foundation\u00ae Best Adoption-Friendly Workplaces\u2122\n- Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For\u00ae\n- Fortune Best Workplaces for Millennials\u2122\n- Fortune Best Workplaces for Women\u2122\n- Great Place to Work\u2019s Best Workplaces for Parents\n- Greater Toronto\u2019s Top 2022 Employers\n- PEOPLE Companies That Care\n- Wall Street Journal Top 250 Best-Managed Companies of 2022 (ranked No. 61)\nTotal well-being extends beyond health and wellness. As a financial institution, we believe that our associates should get the same support we give to our customers. It is important that associates feel both secure in and knowledgeable about their financial situations.\n\nIn our 401(k) plan, we offer a market-leading match of 7.5 percent, which includes an automatic 3 percent company contribution before any associate contribution. Other pathways we provide to support associates\u2019 financial well-being in the short and long term include free one-on-one financial planning with Fidelity, monthly financial education Q&A sessions and webinars, and the expansion of online and self-guided financial literacy courses that educate associates on the three pillars of financial wellness \u2014 budgeting, savings and debt management.\n\nWe have also advanced our \u201cwin with base pay\u201d strategy to compel the best people to join and stay at Capital One by providing associates with the largest base pay increases in over a decade this past January, making additional increases at mid-year for associates with higher performance and in higher growth job families, and increasing start rates for all entry level roles.\n\nWe Encourage Career Development and Growth\n\nWe invest in the development of every associate through growth opportunities and access to new roles or responsibilities. If we\u2019re going to change the way our customers experience banking, we must continually challenge our associates to pursue positive change. We challenge our associates to be continuous learners and teachers, focusing on developing skills of the future.\n\nIn 2022, Capital One delivered 3.6 million online and instructor-led courses for our associates and contractors through our learning platforms that enabled associates to search and engage with a variety of learning plans and online training.\n\nThis included:\n\n- **Peer Learning Community**: a developmental program that supports learning through sharing knowledge, experiences and perspectives with each other. In 2022, we delivered more than 89,000 peer-to-peer learning experiences across Capital One.\n\n- **Learning Hive**: a training program that allows associates to consume, create and share learning content. In 2022, we had more than 43,000 active learners use Learning Hive, with more than 411,000 unique items viewed.\nWe Prioritize a Healthy Work-Life Balance\n\nWe know that our associates\u2019 lives extend beyond their professional roles, which is why we\u2019ve built a culture that seeks to care for our associates and their families, allowing them to achieve balance.\n\nWe recognize life is full of surprises and unexpected challenges, and our associates may require last-minute child or family care for aging parents. When regular care plans are not available, Capital One offers all associates reliable dependent care benefits, including 15 days of backup care through a national network of fully screened and vetted care centers or in-home care options. Due to this benefit, parents and caregivers saved more than 11,400 work days between January and December 2022.\n\nAssociates also have the flexibility to convert their backup care days into one-on-one virtual sessions with Varsity Tutors, a live learning platform, at no additional cost. This program was added in 2021 to help school-aged children stay on track after learning disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This year, almost 600 users have gained over 27,500 hours of tutoring support.\n\nCapital One also recognizes 12 holidays and two floating holidays for associates to observe the cultural observances and holidays that are important to them, or just to take time for themselves. Holiday time and pay is available to full- and part-time associates. Non-exempt associates who work on a nationally recognized holiday receive holiday premium pay and exempt associates receive an incremental floating holiday for their time worked.\n\nOur Total Rewards programs have had a positive impact on associates throughout 2022, as 92 percent of associates said that they are \u201cencouraged to balance their work life and their personal life.\u201d\n\nCapital One\u2019s Hybrid Work Model\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has brought wide ranging, and we believe permanent, changes to how people and companies work. From early 2020 through the fall of 2022, the vast majority of Capital One associates performed their roles virtually. Operations have run smoothly, business outcomes have been strong and associates have remained engaged and productive.\n\nTo harness the benefits of both in-person community and collaboration as well as the individual flexibility provided by virtual work, Capital One transitioned to a hybrid work company in the fall of 2022.\nWe have found that virtual work provides a number of benefits, including personal flexibility and efficiency that associates value, and that it holds long-term promise as an important way of working.\n\nThere also continue to be many benefits to the office environment and in-person engagement. Offices and campuses provide unique opportunities for learning, planned and unplanned collaboration, creativity and innovation, personal mentorship and team building. The significant majority of our associates want and expect both in-office and virtual work to be part of the Capital One work experience.\n\nFlexibility is a hallmark of Capital One, and we know that flexibility can help unleash the potential of our associates. The goal of our hybrid model is to allow associates to match the work they do to the environment that best supports that work. In order to maximize the collaboration and relationships that are an important part of our culture, our initial hybrid approach attempts to concentrate the time when associates are in the office while effectively supporting remote work across Capital One.\n\nAs has been our focus over three decades, our goal at Capital One is to find great people and give them the opportunity to be great. How and where we work has always been a critical part of that journey. We are keenly aware of the pandemic\u2019s long-term impact on the workplace, but our goal to unleash the best of our associates remains the same. We will continue to listen and learn about how this initial approach works for our associates, teams, and customers, and we will make appropriate adjustments as necessary.\n\n**All Associate Survey Results**\n\nFor more than 25 years, we\u2019ve conducted an All Associate Survey (AAS) to gather associate feedback on our mission, strategy, benefits, workplace flexibility and enablement. Year over year, our associates place their trust in the AAS to capture their collective voice and identify ways to improve the associate experience and how we work as a company. The survey is distributed three times per year and we adapt the survey regularly to ensure we\u2019re addressing what\u2019s top-of-mind for associates \u2014 like the use of technology, COVID-19 or environmental concerns.\n\n---\n\n**All Associate Survey Results**\n\n- **92%** of associates surveyed are proud to work for Capital One\n- **92%** of associates believe Capital One is a great place to work\n- **93%** of associates feel their manager encourages an environment where individual differences are valued and respected\n\n*Results from Capital One\u2019s Q2 2022 All Associate Survey*\nWorkplace Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging\n\nAt Capital One, diversity, inclusion and belonging (DIB) are at the core of our culture. We\u2019re deeply committed to growing the diversity of our talent and building a culture of belonging where everyone can thrive. We strive to leverage our expertise and resources to build stronger, more inclusive teams and communities.\nCapital One empowers associates to do great work by creating an open culture that values diverse perspectives, fosters collaboration and encourages innovative ideas \u2014 a place where associates can bring their authentic selves to work. Our commitment to DIB is anchored by three core principles:\n\n**GROW**\nthe diversity of our talent\n\n**CREATE**\na culture of inclusion and belonging where all can thrive\n\n**PROMOTE**\nfairness in our systems and programs\n\nMeasuring impact and ensuring accountability are central to our work. Progress is tracked regularly and shared with senior leadership across Capital One. We also recognize that our journey to diversity, inclusion and belonging is ongoing and we appreciate the importance of engaging with various partners to assess performance and hold us accountable.\n\n**Fostering an Environment of Belonging**\n\nWe believe that when associates feel a sense of belonging, they thrive and find greater meaning, purpose and connection in their work. This, in turn, makes Capital One a stronger and more vibrant place for our associates, our customers and our communities.\n\nTo nurture a culture of belonging, we offer programming designed to spark curiosity as well as courageous conversation and invite associates to share their personal stories of identity and belonging in monthly \u201cStories of Us\u201d features. We want Capital One to be a place where associates can confidently bring their authentic selves to work, sharing their experiences and learning from one another, as well as from experts in the field of DIB.\n\n---\n\n**2022 Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Awards**\n\n- AnitaB.org\n  Top Companies for Women Technologists\n- Bloomberg\n  Gender-Equality Index\n- CAREERS and the disABLED Magazine\n  Top 50 Employers\n- DiversityInc\n  Top 50 Companies for Diversity\n- Forbes\n  America\u2019s Best Employers for Diversity\n- Hispanic Association on Corporate Responsibility (HACR)\n  Corporate Inclusion Index\n- Human Rights Campaign Foundation\n  Corporate Equality Index (100 percent)\n- National Business Inclusion Consortium\n  Best-of-the-Best Corporation for Inclusion\n- National Organization on Disability (NOD)\n  Leading Disability Employer\n- Seramount\n  100 Best Companies\n- Seramount\n  Best Companies for Multicultural Women\n\nFor a current list of all workplace awards and recognition, read more [here](#).\nDIB Town Hall on Race: Two Years Later \u2014 Reflect and Recalibrate\n\nIn 2022, Capital One welcomed back DIB experts Dr. Johnnetta Cole and Howard Ross to discuss the lasting effects of the racial reckoning that unfolded in 2020, in an event drawing more than 8,000 associates.\n\nIn the Town Hall on Race: Two Years Later, Cole and Ross provided a lens on understanding the past, while offering hope for the path forward and guidance on how individuals can influence change within their own spheres of influence.\n\nA Commitment to Growing Representation\n\nSince our founding, we have been focused on unleashing every associate\u2019s talents and potential \u2014 no matter their race, ethnicity, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, ability or background.\n\nWe have built a company that endeavors to be a welcoming and inspiring place for all. To foster a representative workplace, we diversify talent pipelines to hire and develop individuals across all identities and backgrounds. We aim to give associates the tools and resources they need to grow and thrive.\n\nWe remain firmly committed to the representation and inclusion of all underrepresented groups at Capital One, and we are focused where we see the greatest opportunities for sustained growth: with Black and Hispanic associates.\n\nWe engage early and through non-traditional avenues to increase the likelihood that candidates will find fulfilling careers. This takes shape through a series of summits, skill-building internship opportunities and cohort-based programming.\n\nFor example, we work with Year Up, a national nonprofit organization that offers a one-year intensive program designed to train, support and empower young adults. Each Year Up student takes on an internship for six months with corporate organizations like Capital One. Its mission is to close the opportunity gap by ensuring that young adults gain the skills, experiences and support that will empower them to reach their potential through careers and higher education.\n\nAdditionally through our Catapult program, we offer young adults from underrepresented communities \u2014 who hold a high school diploma, GED or equivalent certification \u2014 with opportunities to transition into meaningful careers at Capital One and to be successful with the skills, experiences and support that will empower them to reach their full potential through professional training, financial education and workplace mentoring. This level of support for development and growth extends to current associates as well.\n\nWe provide associates with meaningful opportunities to build their talents and careers. Through the Customer-Facing Associate Mobility (CFAM) Program, we open new pathways for associates who interact directly with our customers to advance their careers and transition into new roles. And with Advancing Black and Hispanic Leaders, we invest in emerging leaders with the tools, resources and relationships to accelerate growth and career development into the executive ranks.\n\nLearn more about our efforts to develop a diverse workforce.\n\n\u201cHere at Capital One, we are committed to creating conditions of belonging and thriving, shaping positive change on behalf of our associates, customers and the communities we serve.\u201d\n\nTHERESITA RICHARD\nManaging Vice President for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at Capital One\n## Workforce Representation\n\n| Race/Ethnicity (U.S.) (2) | 2019 | 2022 | 3-year change\u207d\u00b9\u207e | 2019 | 2022 | 3-year change\u207d\u00b9\u207e | 2019 | 2022 | 3-year change\u207d\u00b9\u207e |\n|--------------------------|------|------|------------------|------|------|------------------|------|------|------------------|\n| Asian or Pacific Islander| 12.5%| 16.0%| 28.0%           | 16.1%| 21.8%| 35.4%           | 16.9%| 20.3%| 20.1%           |\n| Black                    | 2.8% | 6.4% | 128.6%          | 6.0% | 6.5% | 8.3%            | 20.3%| 18.4%| -9.4%           |\n| Hispanic                 | 3.6% | 4.2% | 16.7%           | 5.3% | 4.9% | -7.5%           | 9.8% | 9.5% | -3.1%           |\n| White                    | 80.3%| 72.0%| -10.3%          | 71.4%| 64.9%| -9.1%           | 49.7%| 48.5%| -2.4%           |\n| Women by Level (U.S.)    | 30.6%| 33.2%| 8.5%            | 35.8%| 38.5%| 7.5%            | 52.7%| 50.9%| -3.4%           |\n\n| Gender (Global)          | 2019 | 2022 | 3-year change\u207d\u00b9\u207e | 2019 | 2022 | 3-year change\u207d\u00b9\u207e |\n|--------------------------|------|------|------------------|------|------|------------------|\n| Men                      | 47.1%| 48.8%| 3.6%             |      |      |                  |\n| Women                    | 52.4%| 50.9%| -2.9%            |      |      |                  |\n| Undisclosed/Non-Binary    | 0.5% | 0.3% | -40.0%           |      |      |                  |\n\n| Additional Dimensions (U.S.) | 2019 | 2022 | 3-year change\u207d\u00b9\u207e |\n|------------------------------|------|------|------------------|\n| Associates with Disabilities | 4.6% | 11.5%| 150.0%           |\n| Associates with Military Service | 3.6% | 3.3% | -8.3%           |\n| LGBTQ+                       | 0.90%| 4.0% | 344.4%           |\n\n(1) Percent Change from year end 2019\u20132022  \n(2) Race/ethnicity shown for identities with greatest representation  \n(3) Leadership are VP+ associates  \n(4) Mid-Level Managers are generally Director and Senior Director associates\n\n---\n\nWe invite associates to self-identify so our culture is one where all associates are seen, heard and supported.

In the three year-period from 2019 to 2022, in the U.S., Asian and Pacific Islander VP+ representation has grown 28 percent, Black VP+ representation has grown 128.6 percent, Hispanic VP+ representation has grown 16.7 percent and women\u2019s VP+ representation has grown 8.5 percent.\n\nWhile we are excited about the progress made, we are committed to sustaining our efforts to improve representation among senior leaders both in the U.S. and internationally.\n\nAdditionally, we will work to ensure that all leaders at Capital One have what they need to thrive, including a strong support network, clearly defined roles and expectations, thoughtful engagement with their senior leaders and alignment with their people leaders.\n\nDiversity, Early Engagement and Partnership Recruitment\n\nWe are committed to increasing the number of candidates and new hires from underrepresented groups across the company and developing a diverse talent pipeline. We remain focused on growing relationships, investment and campus presence at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) in the United States and expanding talent pipelines in Canada and the United Kingdom.\n\nFrom small networking events to career fairs, conferences and workshops, our recruiting team and business partners engage in more than 100 events annually to engage with talent from underrepresented groups.\nWe are focused on expanding and deepening relationships with partner schools and believe our engagement should reflect the unique circumstances and institutional needs of each university.\n\nIn 2022, Capital One hosted the inaugural HBCU and HSI Presidents\u2019 Roundtable, engaging with educational and government leaders and deepening our relationships.\n\nWe sponsor the Hispanic Scholarship Fund\u2019s National Leadership Conference which provides students an inside track to academic and professional excellence through a combination of mentoring, professional insights and career guidance.\n\nIn 2022, we unveiled Delaware State University Riverfront, a $4.7MM facility donated to Delaware State University. The project is a shining example of the critical role public-private partnerships play in strengthening HBCU infrastructure and expanding graduates\u2019 career pathways.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, we hosted Black Heritage careers events and worked closely with partner organizations including upReach to support underrepresented applicants from a wider range of universities.\n\nCapital One will continue efforts to engage with underrepresented talent early in their careers and continue to grow our presence at HBCUs and HSIs over the coming years.\n\nExpanding DIB Learning\n\nWe are committed to promoting understanding of underlying historic and systemic issues that create unequal outcomes for underrepresented communities. Our aim is to strengthen our culture of inclusion and belonging by intentionally growing DIB awareness and capability through associate initiatives like:\n\nExecutive Education Program:\nAn immersive diversity education experience that develops deep knowledge and empathy among executives for historical and systemic constructs that have created bias in the workplace. More than 90 percent of all VP+ executives that joined Capital One prior to July 15, 2022 have completed the program, and 90 percent of participants who responded to the survey report having a better understanding of the history of racial bias and inequality and the impacts it has had on others.\n\nDIB Learning and Development Team:\nA team dedicated to building DIB education across our organization and strives to embed DIB in all associate learning content.\n\nDIB Learning Portfolio:\nIn 2022, included more than 100 micro-courses, eLearnings, videos, podcasts, articles and learning resources all associates can access on demand.\n\nAs part of our effort to maintain an inclusive workplace for our associates, we invest in analytical tools and resources to help us gauge what is important to our associates and what improvements they expect on this journey.\n\nPay Equity\n\nPay equity is central to our values of Excellence and Do the Right Thing and has long been a core tenet of our pay philosophy.\n\nWe review groups of associates in similar roles, accounting for factors that appropriately explain differences in pay such as job location and experience. Based on this annual analysis, our most recent results show that through our efforts we continue to pay women globally 100 percent of what men are paid, and in the U.S. we continue to pay non-white associates 100 percent of what white associates are paid.\nBusiness Resource Groups\n\nBusiness Resource Groups (BRGs) are voluntary, associate-led groups that provide forums for connection, cultural celebration, community service and professional development. BRGs enrich our culture of belonging and deepen our understanding of diversity across people and experiences.\n\nEach BRG is sponsored by a senior leader at Capital One and supports Capital One\u2019s commitment to attract, develop and retain talent from all backgrounds and experiences.\n\nBRGs are open to associates of all identities, and more than 60 percent of associates belong to at least one BRG.\n\nWorkforce by the numbers\n\n29,900+ associates in BRGs*\n\n60%+ of Capital One workforce are in BRGs*\n\n8 Enterprise BRGs\n\n4 Tech BRGs\n\n*U.S. Associates only\nEnterprise BRGs\n\nIn 2022, Capital One launched the &family BRG \u2014 the first new BRG in nearly a decade \u2014 to support associates who are balancing career and caregiving.

HOLA believes we are stronger together, and strives to ensure that all members feel a deep sense of belonging, discover valuable avenues to participate and feel invested.\n\nOut Front fosters open channels of communication and engagement among LGBTQ+ associates, leaders and allies across Capital One and focuses on raising awareness within and outside of Capital One as well as in our communities.\n\nSalute enables military, military spouse and veteran associates to thrive through associate engagement, active duty transition, recruiting, community engagement and reserve support. Salute members and allies are actively involved in Hiring Our Heroes, Capital One\u2019s partnership with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation to find meaningful employment for veterans and military spouses.\n\nVOICES helps build an environment where Black associates and allies are empowered to drive change, break barriers and make an impact across Capital One. VOICES provides associates with opportunities to network with colleagues and obtain dynamic development resources to further their careers at Capital One.\nTech BRGs\n\nOur Tech BRGs are empowering associates to tackle obstacles, succeed and thrive in Tech through an infrastructure that seeks to grow diverse representation, unites and engages associates, increases a sense of belonging, showcases technical capacities and equitably grows careers.\n\nThe four Tech BRGs (Blacks in Tech, Hispanics in Tech, Women in Tech and Equality Allies) drive these results through community engagement, development programs and recruiting efforts.\n\nBlacks in Tech (BIT) is committed to cultivating, inspiring, educating, and supporting Black technologists at all stages of their careers. BIT\u2019s goals are to create an impact, amplify the voices of BIT members, engage peers to strengthen our inclusive culture and help to recruit, attract and retain top talent from all backgrounds.\n\nHispanics in Tech (HIT) works to support Capital One\u2019s focus on growing the diversity of our talent, building an inclusive work culture where technologists can thrive and promoting fairness and equity in our systems. HIT is building a community where members feel connected \u2013 one that is focused on helping them to continue growing in their careers.\n\nWomen in Tech (WIT) focuses on developing a love of technology in young women in our communities, improving the representation of associates in technology who identify as women, highlighting role models at Capital One and in the industry and supporting the career development of its members across Capital One.\n\nEquality Allies works together with the BIT, HIT and WIT BRGs to address inequities in the tech industry by helping to raise awareness of the issues that underrepresented groups (URG) face in tech and identify ways that allies can take action to support URGs. Equality Allies focuses on positively influencing the URG recruiting pipeline and candidate experience, advancing our culture of inclusion and belonging, supporting the growth of associates in URGs and increasing allyship engagement.\n\n\u201cHere at Capital One \u2014 and especially in Tech \u2014 we have long recognized that strength comes from different perspectives and expertise. Teams that can pull from a wide variety of experiences build better products that better serve customers\u2019 needs. Our Tech Business Resource Groups help us attract and grow great diverse talent, build a more inclusive culture and create opportunities where all of our associates can thrive.\u201d\n\nROB ALEXANDER\nChief Information Officer at Capital One\nEquity by Design\n\nTo create more equitable experiences for associates and customers, Capital One launched Equity by Design. Through this new program, experience designers serve as thought partners and service providers, partnering across the company to elevate equitable, inclusive and human-centered design practices for internal and external products and services. They engage in research and reporting, help to establish design frameworks, perform design consultation and offer design training and coaching.\n\nThe program was inspired by the belief that centering the fullness of the lived experiences and perspectives of those we are seeking to serve as well as those contributing to the design process can transform associate and customer experiences.\n\nIn 2022, Equity by Design, in partnership with HmntyCntrd, created space for a personal and professional growth community of hundreds of designers at Capital One, introducing them to rich, nuanced learning and development into workplace culture that measurably raised their DIB literacy and application within real work contexts as opposed to academic theory.\n\nDIB Partnership and Support\n\nWe understand that advancing diversity, inclusion and belonging is not solo work. It requires strategic partnership and support both within our company and beyond. We use our platform to influence positive change on behalf of our associates, customers and communities. For example, in 2022 we hosted sessions during the Out & Equal Workplace Summit, enabling the development of our associates. True to our value of Do the Right Thing, we aim to make a difference as we work alongside external partners like Out & Equal to address the work that still needs to be done to build more inclusive and equitable communities.\nSupplier Diversity\n\nSupplier diversity is an integral part of the way Capital One does business. We create mutually beneficial relationships with businesses owned by underrepresented groups including people with disabilities, LGBTQ+ individuals, veterans, women and individuals from historically underrepresented racial and ethnic identities.\n\nCapital One invests in growing supplier diversity and provides development programs that help businesses be successful. In 2022, Capital One spent $984 million (13.9 percent of procurable spend) with diverse suppliers, an increase of $280 million from 2021.\n\nIn 2022, Capital One:\n\n- **Spent** $984 million (13.9 percent of procurable spend) with diverse suppliers, an increase of $280 million from 2021\n- **Supported** 100+ businesses through Supplier Diversity Mentoring\n- **Engaged** 175+ associates as advisors, mentors and instructors in Supplier Diversity Development Programs\nCapital One\u2019s Supplier Diversity Development Programs\n\nWe view our vendors and contractors as representatives of our team. We support, mentor and coach our suppliers to enable them to scale.\n\nCapital One\u2019s Supplier Diversity Mentoring Program provides Black and Hispanic business owners in Texas and Virginia with the tools, resources and guidance needed to be competitive and succeed in today\u2019s marketplace.\n\nAmong a number of initiatives, we are increasing and accelerating our investments in partners and suppliers across our businesses and provide development programs that enable businesses to be competitive in the marketplace, whether they are a supplier of Capital One or not. Two of these programs are:\n\n- **Catapult**: an immersive six-month program designed to help businesses bridge the digital skills gap through instructional courses, collaborative thinking workshops, access to one-on-one meetings with subject matter experts and regular meetings with a dedicated Advisory Board of Capital One associates.\n\n- **SAGE**: an education program developed in partnership with the Women Business Enterprise Council \u2014 Greater DMV and Metro New York that assists women-owned businesses in creating a three-year business plan and growth through customized sessions delivered by successful women business owners and Capital One associates.\n\nIn 2022, Capital One\u2019s Supplier Diversity programs, including Mentoring Program, Catapult and SAGE, supported 132 businesses. Over 175 associates participated as advisors, mentors and instructors across the various developmental programs.\n\nIn addition to these initiatives, Capital One also works with five major nonprofit organizations that provide access to industry best practices and help us to identify suppliers through curated databases:\n\n- Women Business Enterprise National Conference (WBENC)\n- National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC)\n- National Veteran-Owned Business Association (NaVOBA)\n- National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC)\n- DISABILITY:IN\n\n\u201cCapital One understands the richness that businesses owned by underrepresented groups can bring to our organization, and we are focused on opening doors for these companies to help them compete. We remain committed to increasing our investment to support business enterprises owned by people with disabilities, LGBTQ+ individuals, veterans, women and individuals from historically underrepresented racial and ethnic identities.\u201d\n\nCLINT GRIMES\nSenior Vice President and Chief Procurement Officer at Capital One\nInaugural Supplier Diversity Summit\n\nCapital One launched a new Supplier Diversity Summit, a forum for education, networking and celebrating accomplishments in the Supplier Diversity space. By bringing suppliers and community partners together with Capital One associates, the Summit offered a platform to further highlight the benefits of having a diverse supply chain base representative of the communities we serve.\n\nHundreds of attendees participated in the Summit, where leaders shared strategies on how to educate, connect and align on advancing opportunities for businesses owned by members of underrepresented groups.\n\n\u201cThe energy in the room was palpable and the feedback we received has been overwhelmingly positive,\u201d said Reuben Essandoh, Head of Supplier Diversity at Capital One. \u201cOne key takeaway I am hoping our business leaders left with is to be comfortable being uncomfortable, and to grant partnership opportunities for diverse business owners.\u201d\n\nLearn more about how our Supplier Diversity Program is supporting diverse small business leaders.\nEngaging Women and Minority-Owned Firms in Capital Markets Transactions\n\nCapital One\u2019s support of women and minority-owned firms through our capital markets funding programs furthers our mission to advance diversity, inclusion and belonging.\n\nOur Capital Markets team raises wholesale funding for the Bank through issuance in the debt and equity capital markets. The team supports firms that advance DIB through underwriting mandates on these funding transactions as aligned with our own mission.\n\nFor over a decade, Capital One has been a leader in including women and minority-owned firms in our Capital Markets transactions. In 2021, we also became an early leader in setting up a structure for lead underwriters to serve as a Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) coordinator for our transactions. This innovative model has led to mutually beneficial outcomes such as:\n\n- Deepening our investor base by providing access to smaller clients and minority investors that may not have coverage from our larger bank partners\n- Providing opportunity for women and minority-owned firms to earn greater fees through increased engagement on our transactions\n\nThe firms we partner with have been vocal about the benefits of working with a D&I coordinator in creating a smooth process, ensuring inclusion from beginning to end of the transaction and securing allocations for priority investors.\n\n7\nWomen and minority owned firms engaged in funding transactions in 2022\n\n$2.7M\nIn fees committed to women and minority firms in 2022\n\n$13.6M\nIn fees committed to women and minority firms since 2012\n\n\u201cThe Capital One relationship is longstanding and has been instrumental in creating opportunities for us to demonstrate our investor reach.\u201d\n\nARION WILLIAMS\nCorporate Finance Senior Vice President at Siebert Williams Shank\nConsumer Well-Being and Financial Inclusion\n\nEveryone deserves a bank that actively works to help them succeed.

Disparities in housing, education and employment, among other factors, can create inequities in a person\u2019s financial health and overall well-being. This is particularly true for many marginalized communities historically precluded from full participation in the economy.\n\nCapital One has a unique history and business model in banking. The notion of investing in people \u2014 taking a chance on them and then growing with them \u2014 is our north star.\n\nBy leveraging the power of public-private partnerships, data and innovation \u2014 combined with our human-centered approach to meet the individualized needs of a diverse range of customers and clients \u2014 we believe we are uniquely positioned to help individuals and communities along their financial journey.\n\nIn the pages ahead, we share some of our most impactful community impact case studies from 2022.

Since 2011, Capital One has supported APAH\u2019s effort to bring nearly 450 affordable housing units to the Washington, D.C. area as part of the bank\u2019s broader commitment to affordable housing.\nTerwilliger Place is billed as the first Housing Credit development in the state with a leasing preference for veterans. It offers 160 units of affordable housing with half of those units set aside for veterans.\n\n\u201cWhen young Americans sign up to serve in the military, we make them a promise: if you fight for us, we\u2019ll fight for you,\u201d U.S. Secretary of Veteran Affairs Denis McDonough said while speaking at Terwilliger Place\u2019s grand opening ceremony in September 2022. \u201c[Terwiliger Place] can be a successful blueprint to help increase the stock of housing dedicated to Veterans and provide more opportunities for those who have served... Because no veteran should be homeless in the country they fought to defend.\u201d\n\nThe idea for creating Terwilliger Place came to be in 2016 when the American Legion Post 139 selected APAH to redevelop their site in Virginia Square to transform their site, programs and services.\n\nThis chapter of the largest wartime veterans service organization in the U.S. now offers veteran-focused resident services within Terwilliger Place, including a new 6,000 square foot space that features a gathering area and private counseling spaces.\n\nAdditionally, Capital One provided APAH with grant funding to help enroll 50 residents, 20 of which are veterans, to pilot an Individual Development Account program to encourage residents to save towards a personal goal such as homeownership or starting a small business.\n\nThe financing of the $80 million development of Terwilliger Place underscores the power of public-private partnerships through funding including:\n\n- The Virginia Housing Development Authority allocated 9 percent and 4 percent low income housing tax credits\n- The Virginia Housing Development Authority provided two direct permanent loans, in addition to loans from the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development\u2019s Housing Trust Fund and Arlington County\n- Capital One originated $37 million through a Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) equity investment\n- Capital One also provided $24 million in construction debt\n\n\u201cI watched them build this building from the ground up. Everyday I walk in here I\u2019m just excited to be home and have a place I can call my own.\u201d\n\nROBERT DAVIS\nU.S. veteran and current resident at Terwilliger Place\nRevitalizing Communities Through the New Markets Tax Credit Program\n\nCapital One participates in the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) program \u2014 a federal initiative that provides incentives for private investment and development in economically distressed communities through federal tax credits.\n\nThe company\u2019s efforts come to life as a lender, investor and as an allocatee through its community development entity (CDE), Capital One Community Renewal Fund (COCR). In 2022, Capital One financed 27 NMTC projects and invested nearly $439 million of capital in projects that increased access to food and shelter, provided more equitable health and education facilities and created quality jobs.\n\nSince establishing its CDE in 2005, Capital One has helped shape the impact of the federal NMTC program through supporting organizations such as the Historic District Development Corporation (HDDC).\n\nFounded by Coretta Scott King, her sister-in-law Christine King Farris and civil rights advocate John Cox in 1980, HDDC pioneered the \u201cblock-by-block\u201d redevelopment strategy in the 1990s by building new properties adjacent to where they were rehabilitating existing structures to avoid displacing residents.\n\nIn 2022, COCRF provided $3 million in federal allocation towards a $30.5 million New Markets Tax Credit transaction towards the development of The Front Porch \u2013 a 100,000 square foot development of a mixed-use space in Atlanta.\n\nAs HDDC moves into commercial development, it will focus on sustaining local businesses integral to the historic culture of the area, providing technical assistance for entrepreneurs and the incorporation of sustainability, urban agriculture and community wealth building initiatives. Additionally, it will include 31 units of affordable rental housing, as well as 16 for-sale condominium units to encourage asset building.\n\nThe development will serve as the signature early stage project in what will be known as the SAGE (Sweet Auburn Green and Equitable) District, located in a severely distressed census tract with a poverty rate of nearly 33 percent and a median-family income at 29 percent of the national average.\n\n\u201c...The Sweet Auburn neighborhood historically had been a beacon of activity and inspiration in Atlanta, where African American entertainers, civic leaders and businesspeople once established their careers, found success and advocated for equity. With this new investment, we are hopeful that it will once again be restored to its original status as a bustling hub for the next generation to build wealth, live, work and enjoy arts and entertainment.\u201d\n\nCHENEE JOSEPH\nPresident and CEO of HDCC\nStrive USA: Building a more Inclusive Economy through Support for Small Businesses\n\nCapital One joined forces with Strive USA, a new program led by the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth to provide support for five million businesses over the next five years, with a focus on underserved business owners. Strive USA will support and enhance delivery of federal dollars dedicated to small business growth.\n\nOur company began working with Strive USA as a founding member of the Economic Opportunity Coalition, a public and private effort to align billions in investments to underserved communities.\n\nThrough support to this program, Capital One aims to enact change by:\n\n- Providing capital to Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs)\n- Accelerating investments with underserved partners and suppliers\n- Building a suite of financial products specifically designed to support business owners with varying needs\n- Expanding digital access, mentoring, training, advisory programs, network development and wraparound services that help small business owners succeed as they gain access to funding\n- Producing custom research aimed at closing information gaps to advance greater equity and opportunity in the small business ecosystem through the Capital One Insights Center.\n\nStrive USA\u2019s key objectives include providing small business support to improve the financial resilience and growth of U.S. small businesses and address the systemic inequities that underserved entrepreneurs face.\n\nThis program aims to leverage data science and digital tools to help small businesses drive growth and resiliency. Additionally, Strive USA will expand CDFI digitalization and capital access efforts to include Community Financial Institutions (CFI), such as community banks, credit unions and depositories.\nData\n\nData is a powerful tool for social change and is critically important for understanding complex problems, creating tailored solutions and fostering a world where more people can achieve financial well-being and thrive.\n\nOur approach includes being grounded in data, building the data capacity of our nonprofit partners and disseminating data and insights that equip those at the forefront of change to deliver on their mission through timely information.\n\n\u201cHaving the right talent, tools and data can serve in a multitude of ways \u2014 from identifying populations and geographies in need of investment to informing business and funding decisions to assisting with policy research and advocacy. Data as a resource can lead to lasting impact.\u201d\n\nSHENA ASHLEY\nVice President of Community Impact & Investment and Head of Capital One Insights Center\nFeed More: Understanding Food Insecurity Through Data-Backed Pro Bono\n\nBy investing in the ability of the organizations we support to develop and use data, Capital One aims to help build their capacity to enact social change.\n\nIn 2022, a team of Capital One associates composed of business analysts and data scientists volunteered to assist Feed More, a Richmond-based food bank that collects, prepares and distributes food to those in need across Central Virginia. The collaboration focused on exploring data sets that could better predict food insecurity at a zip code level.\n\nIn 2022 alone, Feed More distributed 36 million pounds of food, prepared and delivered a half million meals and touched over 40,000 households across 29 counties and five cities.\n\nCapital One associates, working alongside Feed More built a model that better assesses food insecurity based on a variety of data sets (many of which were under leveraged in national meal-gap models). Feed More now has the tools and visualization techniques to better understand geo-specific client need. These advancements are reshaping their operational strategy, advancing their understanding of food insecurity and helping them serve more individuals struggling with hunger.\n\nIt was amazing to work with Capital One \u2014 great people with diverse experience, inspired by a common purpose. What we learned was extensive, and the resulting model was beyond what we could\u2019ve imagined. We\u2019re validating it across our service area but it\u2019s already evolving our understanding of client need and the effectiveness of our distribution network.\u201d\n\nSARAH GRAVITT-BAESE\nChief Marketing Officer at Feed More\n\n| Associates Involved | Total Hours | Pro Bono Value |\n|---------------------|-------------|----------------|\n| 7                   | 140         | $27,300*       |\n\n* Based on the Taproot Foundation\u2019s valuation of a pro bono hour at $195\nBlack Economic Alliance: Leveraging Predictive Analytics to Address the Racial Wealth Gap\n\nIn addition to leveraging the talents of our Capital One associates, our company\u2019s philanthropic support to organizations helps to improve their capacity to use data to examine and pose solutions to address key issues facing their communities.\n\nThe Capital One Foundation in partnership with Capital One is assisting the Black Economic Alliance Foundation (BEA Foundation) in its journey to build a comprehensive data tool to analyze and reliably predict the impact of investments and interventions on the Black community. This simulation tool will better support real-time data that reflects and provides critical context on the current circumstances facing these communities. This technology enables the BEA Foundation to forecast the most impactful ways that businesses and lawmakers can execute strategies and construct interventions that exponentially increase future wealth in the Black community.\n\nIt will also highlight gaps in the market, in turn providing real-time opportunities for the private, social and public sectors to take action to invest in impactful pipeline building. Ultimately, the hope for this development is to ensure consistent and rigorous assessment across stakeholders and help leaders take better-informed action to support Black economic prosperity.\n\n\u201cWith Capital One\u2019s partnership and generous support, the Black Economic Alliance Foundation is creating a first-of-its-kind predictive modeling tool to help corporate and philanthropic leaders forecast the impact of investments on expanding Black economic prosperity and wealth-building. This rigorous analysis tool will help leaders make data-rich choices about how and where to deploy their resources for maximum effect on combating the racial wealth gap.\u201d\n\nSAMANTHA TWEEDY\nCEO at Black Economic Alliance\nCapital One Insights Center: Amplifying Survey Insights to Support Data-Driven Decisions\n\nThroughout 2022, the Capital One Insights Center partnered with researchers across Capital One to conduct and disseminate surveys to uncover insights around consumer and small business sentiment in an effort to understand the barriers to building credit, wealth and financial well-being.\n\nThe Capital One Insights Center Credit Beliefs Survey and the Small Business Outlook Survey are two examples where we have produced timely and nationally representative survey data to equip business, public policy and community leaders with insights to inform programs and actions related to financial literacy and small business supports.\nInnovation\n\nComplex community challenges require creative solutions and interventions.\n\nOur ability to innovate is grounded in our close engagement with our partners and honed by actively listening to their challenges and opportunities. Together, we seek to glean unconventional insights that inspire new paths for action.\n\nWe approach these challenges with the same discipline and rigor we apply to our business, seeking to incubate, accelerate and invest in ideas that help propel the sector forward.\n\n\u201cInnovation is powered by new and diverse perspectives and collaboration whether through fundamental shifts to practices or a convening of minds. Capital One has long been a disruptor in the banking industry and we seek to do the same in the social impact space to create change in our communities.\u201d\n\nKERONE VATEL\nSVP, Community Impact & Investment at Capital One\nDriving Inclusive Hiring Practices and Creating a Diverse Workforce Through Collaboration\n\nBuilding upon our longstanding support to five nonprofits in the Washington, D.C. area working to advance college access and workforce development, Capital One helped stand up the Talent for Tomorrow Alliance. This organization is the first collaborative group in Washington, D.C. to convene multiple nonprofits supporting workforce development.\n\nThis unique collaborative model brings an innovative approach to co-developing solutions for the community through sharing resources and promoting individuals graduating from one program and going on to the next.\n\nThe Talent for Tomorrow Alliance partners include:\n\n- **Spark the Journey** (formerly Capital Partners for Education), which provides one-to-one mentoring for low-income high school students in D.C. to help prepare them for college and their career.\n\n- **Genesys Works**, which supports high school seniors for college readiness and workforce training with a summer technical and professional skills bootcamp and a yearlong paid internship program.\n\n- **New Futures**, which provides scholarships and other support for students to pursue post-secondary education.\n\n- **Per Scholas** (National Capital Region), which advances economic equity through rigorous training for tech careers and connects skilled graduate talent to leading employers.\n\n- **Year Up** (National Capital Region), which provides a yearlong, college accredited workforce training program and professional internships for young adults (ages 18-26).\n\nAfter providing an initial investment of $500,000 in 2021 to stand up the Alliance, Capital One renewed support for the Alliance\u2019s work with an additional grant of $125,000 in 2022. Since 2007, Capital One has hosted more than 300 Year Up interns and has hired more than 160 of those interns into roles across the company.\n\nThe Talent for Tomorrow Alliance also raises awareness and educates employers on more inclusive hiring practices and the importance of a diverse workforce. Additionally, it will serve as a model for other cities as to how nonprofit workforce development organizations can collaborate to empower diverse talent to launch careers.\n\nThe Alliance has already proven to expand employment outcomes for young adults. On average, students who only attend either Per Scholas or Year Up earn $20-$22 per hour, while those who attended both programs and gained an industry certification earn $32 per hour.\n\n\u201cBy working together, the Alliance addresses a larger social justice issue around the inequitable distribution of economic opportunity in the DC metro area. The Alliance will leverage each nonprofit\u2019s strengths and will work purposefully to close racial, income and opportunity gaps by developing a new collaborative paradigm that invests in a diverse and skilled talent pipeline to drive growth in the region.\u201d\n\nJOHN GALANTE\nManaging Director of Financial Services at Year Up\nCatalyzing Economic Resilience Through Direct Cash Transfers\n\nCapital One joined forces with THRIVE East of the River (THRIVE), a partnership of four community-based organizations in Washington D.C. created to address the disproportionate economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic east of the Anacostia River.\n\nTHRIVE provided direct cash payments and grocery assistance to help stabilize 590 households living in D.C.\u2019s Ward 8 neighborhood, an area in which one-third of residents have incomes below the federal poverty level.\n\nCapital One supported THRIVE through $200,000 in grant funding during that period to help stabilize families, foster mobility and accelerate recovery. In turn, THRIVE provided an unconditional direct cash transfer of $5,500 to enrolled households \u2014 one of the largest short-term private emergency cash relief payments ever offered in the United States.\n\nIn 2022, The Urban Institute evaluated the impact of THRIVE\u2019s program and concluded that its cash transfer policy created fast and flexible means of supporting residents through housing stability, food security and small business support.\n\nUnlike more traditional conditional cash transfers in which money is only transferred to individuals under specific circumstances, these payments were unconditional, meaning no strings were attached to how recipients could use them. Enrolled households also received weekly groceries, monthly dry goods and assistance securing additional resources, such as pandemic stimulus payments, unemployment insurance, financial literacy training, mental health support and workforce training.\n\nThis nonprofit and private sector collaboration ultimately provided a new approach to responding to the most pressing needs of Ward 8 residents. While ensuring efforts that include direct cash transfers will ultimately show the effectiveness of this model, Thrive\u2019s efforts demonstrated the overwhelming success of that type of intervention.\n\n\u201cThe biggest takeaway is that while there is often a concern around direct cash transfers, the individuals supported through this program spend the money on their greatest needs: housing, food and services for their children. The results pierced the bubble that those in need were going to be irresponsible with unconditional funds.\u201d\n\nSCOTT KRATZ\nDirector of 11th Street Bridge Park\n\nIn 2022, The Urban Institute evaluated the impact of THRIVE\u2019s program and concluded that its cash transfer policy created fast and flexible means of supporting residents through housing stability, food security and small business support.\n\nUnlike more traditional conditional cash transfers in which money is only transferred to individuals under specific circumstances, these payments were unconditional, meaning no strings were attached to how recipients could use them. Enrolled households also received weekly groceries, monthly dry goods and assistance securing additional resources, such as pandemic stimulus payments, unemployment insurance, financial literacy training, mental health support and workforce training.\n\nThis nonprofit and private sector collaboration ultimately provided a new approach to responding to the most pressing needs of Ward 8 residents. While ensuring efforts that include direct cash transfers will ultimately show the effectiveness of this model, Thrive\u2019s efforts demonstrated the overwhelming success of that type of intervention.\nSupporting Diverse Real Estate Developers\n\nCapital One\u2019s Agency Finance team provided financing for Langdon Park Capital (LPC), a Black-owned real estate investment company, to close on a $63.2 million acquisition of a 304-unit apartment complex located near Washington, D.C. in Fort Washington, Maryland. Rebranded as Langdon Park at Fort Washington, this property is in a predominantly Black community with most residents earning below 70 percent of area median income. LPC is committed to preserving that affordability while providing housing that meets the needs of its residents.\n\nRather than striving solely to maximize return on investment, LPC\u2019s acquisition places an emphasis on uplifting and strengthening communities by providing the resources, tools and services that residents need, including financial literacy programs, workforce development training and rental assistance.\n\nLPC has identified three community-focused partners to provide support for residents:\n\n- **Washington Jesuit Academy**: an organization that provides comprehensive education for promising students from underserved communities\n- **Employ Prince George\u2019s**: a workforce development service provider\n- **Esusu**: a minority-owned fintech platform that will allow residents to have their rental payments reported to major credit bureaus to help establish or improve their credit profiles and build stronger credit histories.\n\nLPC has committed more than $5 million for capital improvements at the property, including upgraded interiors of units, building exteriors, common areas and the on-site community center. As part of its value-add to residents, LPC will work with organizations to provide access to a range of social services from financial education to workforce development support.\n\n\u201cThe lack of affordable housing is a pervasive issue within the country and our partnership with Capital One has been critical as we endeavor to provide high-quality homes for hard-working families. At Langdon Park, we\u2019re confident that our team\u2019s lived experiences, cultural competency and investment acumen will help to create long-term value for residents and investors alike.\u201d\n\nMALCOLM JOHNSON\nFounder and CEO of LPC\nCommunity Advisory Council\n\nCapital One established the Community Advisory Council (CAC) in 2013. The CAC is a forum where Capital One convenes leaders from the nonprofit sector twice a year to learn about and provide feedback on the company\u2019s strategy, products and services \u2014 especially those related to underserved communities.\n\nWe believe cross-sector partnerships can deliver powerful results in addressing issues such as socioeconomic mobility \u2014 but only if the organizations have shared priorities and work collaboratively to advance a common goal.\n\n\u201cAs a new Capital One leader, I was so excited to learn about our Community Advisory Council,\u201d said David Rabkin, Head of Business Cards and Payments. \u201cI value the opportunity to hear directly from community representatives who have such a deep understanding of the needs of small businesses. They reiterated what we know to be true \u2014 great products alone aren\u2019t sufficient; we also need to make sure they\u2019re accessible to a wide spectrum of small businesses and help customers be successful with those products.\u201d\n\nThe CAC reflects Capital One\u2019s commitment to working with the community to create products and services that meet the needs of consumers and communities who have not always been well served by traditional banks, including low- and moderate-income individuals, individuals from historically underrepresented racial and ethnic identities, immigrants and microenterprises.\n\nIn 2022, business leaders sought input from CAC Members about initiatives that are meant to promote socioeconomic mobility for our customers. For example, leaders invited feedback on Capital One\u2019s exploration of innovative new platforms to provide credit to small business owners in low and moderate income communities who have been historically underserved. Capital One is focused on researching and operationalizing targeted programs to work with community partners and others to provide wraparound support beyond financing to these business owners \u2014 to create the conditions for success that help level the playing field and close gaps in opportunity.\n\nCAC Members shared several ideas about how to deliver technical assistance that is tailored to the unique needs of businesses of different sizes and tenures as well as across industries.\n\n\u201cCapital One\u2019s commitment to be a full spectrum consumer lender is already known, and it was encouraging to hear from the bank\u2019s leadership that this objective applies to small businesses too. All business owners, especially early stage entrepreneurs, need access to capital to make their vision a reality. Capital One is meeting this need through fair, simple products.\u201d\n\nGUSTAVO LASALA\nPresident and CEO of PeopleFund\nCommunity Reinvestment Act (CRA)\n\nCapital One is committed to an effective CRA program that provides significant benefits for low- and moderate-income individuals, families and communities.\n\nOur commitment to upholding CRA is evidenced by many years of strong examination results as measured by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). For our most recent examination covering the three-year period of 2017 through 2019, both our chartered institutions earned the highest overall rating of \u201cOutstanding.\u201d\n\nOur retail bank achieved an \u201cOutstanding\u201d rating on the lending and investment tests in each of the fifteen geographic rating areas. Our limited-purpose credit card bank once again achieved \u201cOutstanding\u201d levels of community development lending, investments and services.\n\nCapital One\u2019s well-established community development programs and activities are not only core to our Mission, they continue to be a critical driver of our CRA performance. We reported $7.19 billion in community development loans in 2022 and have been an industry leader in community development lending for many years.\n\nThe vast majority of that lending supported affordable housing for low- to moderate-income households. Our continued excellence in this field reflects the efforts of our specialized unit that provides high-impact affordable housing through loans and investments, as well as our commercial business, which provides loans supporting affordable housing, community services, economic development and neighborhood revitalization.\nPrivacy and Data Security\n\nAs a business that relies on trust, Capital One is committed to implementing leading policies and data protection standards to protect consumers\u2019 private information, and to maintain their confidence in our ability to safeguard their personal and financial information.\nCapital One collects information in order to better serve our customers and potential customers, and we seek to be transparent in the ways in which we collect, use and share data. Depending on how consumers interact with us, they have the ability to make certain choices regarding our collection, use and sharing of their information. In addition, some of their data is made available for access upon consumer request.\n\nCapital One\u2019s complete privacy policy can be found online here.\n\nWe also believe that a strong enterprise cybersecurity program is vital to effective risk management. As part of its program of regular oversight, the Risk Committee of the Board is responsible for overseeing cyber risk, information security and technology risk, including management\u2019s actions to identify, assess, mitigate and remediate material cyber issues and risks. The Risk Committee receives quarterly reports from the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and the Chief Technology Risk Officer (CTRO) on Capital One\u2019s technology and cyber risk profile, enterprise cyber program and key enterprise cyber initiatives. In addition, the Risk Committee discusses matters escalated to it by the Technology and Cyber Risk Committee, a management-level committee dedicated to the discussion of enterprise-wide cybersecurity and technology risks. The Risk Committee coordinates with the full Board regarding the strategic implications of cyber and technology risks.\n\nThe Chief Information Officer (CIO), CISO and CTRO also follow a risk-based escalation process to notify the Risk Committee outside of the quarterly reporting cycle when they identify an emerging risk or material issue. The Risk Committee annually reviews and recommends Capital One\u2019s information security policy and information security program to the Board for approval. At least annually, the Board reviews and discusses our cybersecurity strategy with the CISO and CTRO; and approves our technology strategic plan.\nCorporate Governance and ESG Oversight\n\nStrong corporate governance is essential to a well-functioning enterprise and vital to preserving the trust of our stakeholders, including customers, stockholders, regulators, suppliers, associates, our communities and the general public. Capital One has an active and engaged Board of Directors and robust policies for risk management, business ethics and responsible political engagement.\nBoard of Directors\n\nCapital One is dedicated to strong and effective corporate governance that provides our Board of Directors (Board) with the appropriate framework to engage in ongoing oversight of the Company. Our Board develops, oversees and reinforces sound corporate governance principles and practices that enable the Board and its committees to remain attuned to significant developments in our business and the industry.\n\nOur Board plays a critical role in supporting and overseeing Capital One\u2019s corporate culture, mission and values and sets the \u201ctone at the top\u201d \u2014 including through its oversight of the Company\u2019s ESG priorities. Among other things, the Board oversees management\u2019s development and implementation of Capital One\u2019s strategy, financial performance and associated risks; the enterprise-wide risk management framework, including cybersecurity risk; and succession planning for Capital One\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and other key executives. The Board regularly engages with management to provide guidance on important operational and strategic matters, and is key to the future success and growth of Capital One.\n\nThe Board also regularly reviews and approves key governance policies, including our overall strategic plan, technology strategic plan, information security policy and program, our Code of Conduct and the Corporate Governance Guidelines, including Director Independence Standards.\n\nOur Corporate Governance Guidelines formalize the Company\u2019s governance practices and facilitate efficient and effective Board oversight. These Guidelines enable our Board to engage in responsible decision-making, work with management to pursue Capital One\u2019s strategic objectives and promote long-term shareholder interests.\n\nRichard D.

This diversity is a key enabler of the Board\u2019s ability to provide management with strategic guidance, oversight and effective challenge as the Company navigates the opportunities and risks presented by a rapidly-evolving world.\u201d\n\nANN FRITZ HACKETT\nLead Independent Director and Chair of the Governance and Nominating Committee, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\n*As of March 1, 2023\nSenior Management\n\nOur executive officers are stewards of Capital One\u2019s culture and implement our corporate values through their leadership and management of our day-to-day business affairs. Our CEO and executive officers report regularly to the Board so that the Board can fulfill its oversight responsibilities, satisfy its fiduciary obligations and further the safety and soundness of Capital One.\n\nOur executive officers serve on senior management committees, which are forums for leaders to share information and advise the CEO and other executives on strategies to address new risks and opportunities.\n\nThese committees operate as subject matter expert advisory panels in the management of Capital One\u2019s strategy, financial results, business operations, compliance with laws and regulations (including those pertaining to consumer protection) and enterprise risk matters, including Capital One\u2019s performance against risk appetites and limits. The senior management committees are important links between Capital One\u2019s management and the Board. Accountable executives for each senior management committee are responsible for ensuring that matters discussed at committee meetings are escalated to the Board for discussion, as appropriate.\n\nOur senior management committee structure consists of an Executive Committee and the Executive Risk Committee, which has five subcommittees: the Asset Liability Committee, Credit Policy Committee, Operational and Compliance Risk Committee, Technology and Cyber Risk Committee and Enterprise Programs Committee.\n\nThe Executive Committee supports the CEO and serves as a forum for escalating key issues and encouraging alignment with respect to matters relating to Capital One\u2019s operations and management, including business strategy, significant transactions, financial performance, talent management and key initiatives.\n\nThe Executive Risk Committee works in coordination with its subcommittees to advise and assist the Chief Risk Officer in managing all aspects of corporate risk. For more details on how Capital One manages risk, see the Risk Management section of this ESG Report found on page 95.\nOversight and Management of ESG\n\nAt Capital One, oversight and management of ESG is integrated into our existing governance structure at the Board and management levels of the Company.\n\nBoard Oversight of ESG\n\nThe Board and its committees, as appropriate, coordinate to provide comprehensive oversight of Capital One\u2019s ESG strategy and activities. In 2022, our Board Committees amended their charters to formalize their ESG roles and responsibilities.\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nThe full Board oversees all enterprise business operations and ensures efficient and effective oversight of the Company\u2019s strategic direction, including the development and implementation of ESG-related objectives. The Board engages with its committees and management on significant strategic and risk-related ESG matters including certain aspects of climate strategy, DIB efforts and human capital management.\n\nBoard Committees\n\n- **Governance & Nominating Committee**\n  Has overall responsibility for Board and committee engagement with, and oversight of, Capital One\u2019s ESG-related policies and programs.\n\n- **Risk Committee**\n  Oversees risks within Capital One\u2019s risk management framework, including risks related to ESG strategy and activities.\n\n- **Audit Committee**\n  Oversees management of compliance with ethical standards and ESG-related information in SEC filings.\n\n- **Compensation Committee**\n  Oversees compensation policies and practices, including the consideration of ESG in executive compensation.\nManagement Oversight of ESG\n\nAt the management level, we oversee ESG issues through our senior management committees and other management-level committees.\n\nESG Accountable Executive: Our Corporate Secretary and General Counsel serves as the Company\u2019s enterprise Head of ESG. This individual coordinates ESG strategies and activities at the enterprise level, chairs the ESG Advisory Committee and provides regular updates to the Board regarding the Company\u2019s ESG strategy, plans and activities.\n\nDedicated Climate Executive: We have also designated a Senior Advisor to the CEO to serve as the Head of Climate for the enterprise.

This leader is also a key participant in our climate governance processes, which are detailed in the Climate Governance section of this ESG Report on page 21.\n\nSenior Management and Select Management-Level Committees\n\nEach of these committees acts in accordance with a charter that is regularly evaluated and updated to enable the groups to respond to emerging developments, including issues related to ESG.\n\nESG Advisory Committee\nForum for senior executives from across the Company to discuss and guide ESG policies, programs, activities and initiatives.\n\nExecutive Risk Committee\nForum for integrated discussions by senior management regarding risk management and alignment of risk management activities across all risk categories, including certain risks related to ESG, as appropriate.\n\nExecutive Committee\nAdvises and assists the CEO in management of corporate strategy and operations, including ESG-related initiatives.\n\nDisclosure Committee\nReviews ESG-related information in SEC disclosures as well as the ESG Report.\nEffective risk management and control processes are critical to our safety and soundness, our ability to predict and manage the challenges that Capital One and the financial services industry face and, ultimately, our long-term corporate success.\nRisk Management Framework\n\nOur enterprise-wide risk management framework defines the Board\u2019s appetite for risk taking and enables senior management to understand, manage and report on risk. Our risk management framework is implemented enterprise-wide and includes seven risk categories: compliance, credit, liquidity, market, operational, reputation and strategic. ESG-related risk management is integrated across our risk management framework. For details on how Capital One manages climate risk, see the Climate Risk Management section of this ESG Report found on page 29.\n\nOur risk management framework sets consistent expectations for risk management across Capital One and consists of the following elements:\n\n- Governance and Accountability\n- Strategy and Risk Alignment\n- Risk Identification\n- Assessment, Measurement and Response\n- Monitoring and Testing\n- Aggregation, Reporting and Escalation\n- Capital and Liquidity Management (including stress testing)\n- Risk Data and Enabling Technology\n- Culture and Talent Management\nOur risk management framework also sets expectations for our \u201cThree Lines of Defense\u201d model, which defines the roles, responsibilities and accountabilities for taking and managing risk across Capital One.\n\n| First Line | Second Line | Third Line |\n|------------|-------------|------------|\n| **Definition** | **Advises and Challenges** | **Provides Independent Assurance** |\n| Business areas that are accountable for risk and responsible for: i) generating revenue or reducing expenses; ii) supporting the business to provide products or services to customers; or iii) providing technology services for the first line. | Independent Risk Management and Support Functions (e.g., Human Resources, Accounting, Legal). | Internal Audit and Credit Review. |\n| **Key Responsibilities** | Independent Risk Management: Provides advice and effective challenge to the first line risk-taking activities, in addition to defining the policies that guide the risk-taking activities of the first line of defense. Support Functions: Centers of specialized expertise that provide support services to the enterprise. | Provides independent and objective assurance to the Board and senior management that our systems and governance processes are designed and working as intended. |\nRisk Appetite\n\nCapital One\u2019s risk appetite defines the Board\u2019s tolerance for risk outcomes at an enterprise level and enables senior management to manage and report within these boundaries in pursuit of our business objectives. Our risk appetite aligns with our mission, core values and strategies and is approved by the Board. Our goal is to ensure that risks taken in pursuit of business objectives do not create undue risk of us exceeding our defined risk appetites.\n\nRisk Appetite Statement\n\nRisk management is important to our business, as we will take certain risks in order to meet our business objectives. Our Risk Appetite aligns with our mission, core values and strategic imperatives. We strive to Change Banking for Good by protecting our customers and shareholders and ensuring the safety and soundness of our business. We consider the impact of ongoing and emerging risks on our business. We take risks in a well controlled manner to create long-term shareholder value and to maintain a well-capitalized bank with a strong brand and reputation.\nRisk Governance\n\nOur risk governance structure is designed to effectively and consistently oversee the management of risks across Capital One. Our Board, CEO and management establish the \u201ctone at the top\u201d regarding the culture of Capital One, including management of risk. The Board, directly and through its committees, oversees Capital One\u2019s risk-taking activities.\n\nThe Risk Committee of the Board oversees the risk management framework, including policies and practices established by management to identify, assess, measure, monitor, control and report risks across all risk categories.\n\nAt the management level, senior management committees serve as governance forums for the CEO, Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and other management executives to receive and discuss risk management information, reports and escalated matters from the first, second, and third lines of defense.\n\nThe Executive Risk Committee (ERC) is chaired by the CRO and serves as a forum for management to have integrated discussions regarding risk management to ensure prioritization, awareness, alignment and coordination of risk management activities among key executives across all risk categories. The ERC oversees and delegates specific authority across five senior management committees to focus on specific risk categories and business activities.\nBusiness Ethics and Responsible Business Practices\n\nBuilding an enduring company requires an unwavering commitment to living our values and demonstrating the highest standards of integrity and professionalism. Our core values of Excellence and Do the Right Thing embody our commitment to fairness and honesty and inspire our culture and the decisions we make each day.\nCode of Conduct\n\nCapital One\u2019s culture is built on two core values: Excellence and Do the Right Thing.\n\nTo promote these values, our Code of Conduct (Code) memorializes Capital One\u2019s commitment to comply with applicable laws, regulations and Capital One policies governing our conduct and operations. Following these policies helps us to ensure that honesty, fair dealing and integrity are hallmarks of our business dealings. By adhering to our Code, associates live our values and ensure that Capital One is recognized for modeling the highest standards of business conduct in everything we do. Our Code is more than just a set of \u201cdo\u2019s and don\u2019ts.\u201d It provides guidance, practical information and resources that help us enhance our relationships with our customers, each other and all of the people that play a role in Capital One\u2019s success.\n\nThe Board reviews and approves our Code. The Ethics Office, which is managed by the Chief Compliance & Ethics Officer, has day-to-day responsibility for administering our Code and managing Capital One\u2019s Ethics program.\n\nIn addition, the Ethics Office is responsible for managing the Ethics Line, a confidential reporting tool operated by an independent third party. Reports may be submitted to the Ethics Line online or through a call center that operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Ethics Line complaints may be submitted anonymously and phone calls are not recorded.\n\nAll newly hired associates receive the Code with their employment offer and within their first 30 days must complete a 30-minute interactive computer-based training course, agree to comply with our Code and demonstrate their understanding of its content. Thereafter, all associates are required to complete the Code training annually and agree to comply with the Code and all related policies, standards and procedures.\n\nDoing the right thing includes speaking up. We expect all Capital One associates to immediately report any suspected or potential violations of law, our Code, our company\u2019s policies or other actions inconsistent with our values.\n\nAssociates may report concerns to their manager, our Associate Relations team, our Ethics Line or to our Ethics Office. Raising concerns within Capital One does not prevent associates from reporting the same concerns to law enforcement or the relevant government entity if there is a suspected or potential violation of law. Further, Capital One prohibits retaliation against any individual for making good faith claims regarding possible violations of law, our Code or other Company policies. Capital One also prohibits retaliation against any individual for participating in or cooperating with any investigation.\n\nPlease see our website for a full copy of the Code of Conduct.\n\nAnti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery\n\nOur Code prohibits associates from engaging in bribery or corruption of any type and requires disclosure and written pre-approval for gifts or entertainment over a certain value to or from anyone, including government officials, in connection with actual or potential Capital One business. Associates who are offered a gift or other item of value that would result in a violation of Capital One\u2019s policies are required to immediately report the incident to our Ethics Line, Ethics Office or Associate Relations. All Capital One associates are required to complete anti-corruption and anti-bribery training annually.\n\nCapital One also has an executive dedicated to our Anti-Corruption Anti-Bribery program, who has an escalation path to the Chief Compliance & Ethics Officer. Capital One has an Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Standard, which requires associates to comply fully with all applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, including the Bank Bribery Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. This Standard, which incorporates the guidance contained in our Code, establishes Capital One\u2019s requirements to conduct business activity in an honest and ethical manner, with a zero tolerance for bribery and corruption.\n\nAnti-Money Laundering\n\nCapital One is committed to upholding all applicable laws and regulations relating to Anti-Money Laundering (AML), combating terrorist financing and the government\u2019s imposition of economic sanctions on foreign persons, locales or entities.\n\nCapital One\u2019s AML Policy and compliance management program are designed to\nidentify, manage and report AML compliance risks across all Capital One business activities, its subsidiaries, affiliates and partners. The Board approves the AML Policy and has oversight of the policy\u2019s implementation. Additionally, the Board receives AML risk reporting on a regular basis.\n\nCapital One also maintains a comprehensive AML training program to ensure appropriate personnel have the relevant knowledge of applicable laws and regulations, and underlying policies, procedures and processes needed to perform their risk management duties. All Capital One associates are required to complete AML training annually.\n\n**Compliance Training**\n\nOur Corporate Compliance team develops training courses on a range of topics such as our Code of Conduct, ethical business practices and combating illegal conduct, including financial crimes, regulatory compliance, financial product safety and consumer protection.\n\nIn 2022, Capital One associates completed approximately 525,000 hours of mandatory training. There were approximately 1 million mandatory training sessions assigned and the annual completion rate was 99.7 percent.\nAt Capital One, we believe that engaging in the legislative and regulatory rule-making processes is important for our business, customers, associates and communities.\nCapital One's Policy Nexus\n\nCapital One is impacted by the legislation enacted by lawmakers in Washington, D.C., state capitals and certain local governments, as well as regulations issued at the federal, state and local levels. Given the highly regulated nature of our business, we focus the majority of our time and attention on banking and financial services policy.\n\nLegislation and regulation touch all aspects of the Company, and often take years of planning, dialogue and cultivation to develop and implement. Thus, Capital One believes in engagement throughout the entirety of the policy-making life cycle. Relevant issues include, among others, the payments systems, macro-prudential banking regulation, privacy, tax, technology, cybersecurity, employment, community development lending and consumer protection.\n\nWe embrace the role that regulation plays in ensuring the safety and soundness of our industry and protecting the vital interest of our customers \u2014 be they individual consumers, small businesses or large corporations.\n\nWe recognize the diverse political viewpoints of our associates and seek to provide them with the tools and information needed to engage on the issues that matter most. To this end, we provide access to quality, bipartisan resources, including a speaker series, policy communications and non-partisan \u201cGet Out the Vote\u201d drives.\n\nPolitical Contributions and Expenditures\n\nCapital One engages in political expenditures through a voluntary associate-funded Political Action Committee (PAC). The Center for Political Accountability (CPA) in conjunction with the Zicklin Center for Governance and Business Ethics at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania has consistently recognized Capital One for its commitment to transparent political disclosure and effective governance and accountability. In 2022, Capital One was once again named to the CPA Zicklin Index's \u201ctrendsetter\u201d list of companies with the highest level of oversight and transparency, and is in the top rank for financial services companies. Capital One's score of 97.1 percent compares to an average score of 87.46 percent for similarly situated financial services peers and an average score of 85.7 percent for technology peers.\n\nCriteria for Political Contributions\n\nCapital One\u2019s political contributions during 2022 were all made in accordance with its Corporate and PAC Political Contributions Guidelines. Contributions for federal offices and some state and local offices are made through the Capital One PAC. The PAC is funded by voluntary contributions from our associates and Board leadership. Capital One also makes some corporate contributions in states where permissible by law. These contributions are directed to statewide offices, state legislators and local offices. Capital One does not contribute to presidential or judicial candidates. Capital One did not use any PAC or corporate funds to make any direct independent expenditures on behalf of candidates running for office in 2022, nor did Capital One use any PAC or corporate funds in support of or opposition to any ballot measures.\n\nWe support candidates, on a bipartisan basis, who responsibly evaluate and take action on issues of concern to the Company and our associates and customers. We generally focus on members of leadership, members of relevant committees and members from states or districts where Capital One has facilities. We also seek to support candidates who focus on broader issues of importance to our communities and associates, including community support and efforts that help achieve a more diverse and inclusive workforce and society. Capital One will also make contributions to certain trade association PACs to which we belong. In addition, contributions are made to leadership PACs of particular members of Congress and general purpose committees supporting coalitions of candidates.\n\nPolitical spending reflects Capital One\u2019s interests and not those of individual associates. We report political contributions semi-annually, based on the time at which they are approved, which may differ from when recipients report receiving the contribution.\n\nBoard of Directors Oversight\n\nCapital One\u2019s Board of Directors plays an important role in overseeing Capital One\u2019s public policy engagement and political participation. The Governance and Nominating\nCommittee of the Board, which is composed entirely of independent directors, oversees Capital One\u2019s governance policies regarding political activity and expenditures.\n\nThe Governance and Nominating Committee approves on an annual basis Capital One\u2019s contribution criteria, spending guidelines and total corporate expenditure budget. The Governance and Nominating Committee also reviews on an annual basis Capital One\u2019s political contributions, including contributions to candidates, political action committees, corporate contributions, PAC-to-PAC contributions (e.g., trade associations PACs) and Capital One\u2019s Government and Policy Affairs Group Annual Report.\n\nMore information on our political activity can be found within Capital One\u2019s 2022 Government and Policy Affairs Semi-Annual Report. The 2022 Government and Policy Affairs Annual Report will be posted on Capital One\u2019s website in June of 2023.\n## SASB Commercial Banks\n\n| Metric                                                                 | Code          | Disclosure/Addtional Information                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| (1) Number of data breaches, (2) percentage involving personally identifiable information (PII), (3) number of account holders affected | FN-CB-230a1   | Please refer to the Privacy and Data Security section of this report.
