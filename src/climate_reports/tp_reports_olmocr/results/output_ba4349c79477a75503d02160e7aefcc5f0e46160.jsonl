One of our latest Tomahawk5 switches replaces 48 Tomahawk 1 switches in the network, resulting in over 95% reduction in power requirements. Tomahawk 5 with co-packaged optics that uses Broadcom\u2019s Silicon Photonics Chiplets in Package (SCIP) platform also provides more than a 50% decrease in the power needed for optical connectivity.\n\nMINIMIZING POWER CONSUMPTION IN MOBILE PHONES, SMART WATCHES AND TABLETS\nFor 15 years, our engineers have minimized both active and idle power consumption that optimize mobile phone battery life for customers. They do this through low-power circuit design and with intelligent software that turns off parts of the chip that are not needed.\n\nFor example, reducing GNSS power consumption is crucial to extending the battery life of phones, smart watches and tablets. Our BCM4778 \u2013 the world\u2019s lowest power L1/L5 GNSS receiver chip \u2013 consumes five times less power, which increases the battery life on a smart watch by 30 hours, compared to the previous generation chip.\nMaking Green Refrigerant Gas Alternatives Safer with Infrared Sensor Technology\n\nDue to regulatory changes and increased focus on reducing GHG emissions, many businesses are moving away from using established refrigerant gases, such as chlorofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and moving towards alternative refrigerants that are more environmentally friendly. However, one of many challenges in adopting these alternative refrigerants is flammability.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s ezPyro SMD pyroelectric detector products are implemented in gas detection systems and support our customers\u2019 movement towards alternative refrigerants and sustainability. These sensors allow for the detection of small and large flames, nearby or over larger distances.\n\nInfrastructure Software Solutions\n\nAs a leader in infrastructure software solutions, our Broadcom Software Group is uniquely positioned to help customers drive key initiatives that increase their operational efficiency and support their sustainability efforts.\n\nOur infrastructure software solutions support customers by improving monitoring processes, monitoring scale, network configuration management practices, optimizing resource utilization, and reducing manual efforts involved in finding and fixing performance, availability and network security issues quickly.\n\nOptimizing the Mainframe for Sustainability\n\nThe modern mainframe offers opportunities for our customers to accelerate their environmental sustainability initiatives.

Our Mainframe Operational Intelligence and SYSVIEW products help customers identify ongoing anomalies and avoid mainframe overloads, resulting in lower energy consumption by the mainframe.\n\nOur Mainframe Software Division is also a member and sponsor of Making our Strong Community Stronger (MSCS)\u2014the first-ever, executive-level initiative on DEI in the mainframe industry. Our Senior Vice President and General Manager of the Mainframe Software Division, Greg Lotko, represents Broadcom on MSCS and is a leader in DEI in the mainframe industry.\nProduct Quality\n\nOur reputation for product excellence is built upon innovation, quality and reliability. We continue to achieve this by establishing strict quality standards and continuously improving the effectiveness of our quality management system, processes and products to enhance value for our customers, stockholders and employees.\n\nOur Vice President of Quality reviews quality issues, including customer returns, every month. The President of our Semiconductor Solutions Group also reviews quality issues on a quarterly basis with our Vice President of Quality. We expect our employees to provide products that meet legal requirements and are safe for their intended markets and applications, as outlined by our Product Safety and Regulations Policy and Quality Policy.\n\nISO Certification\n\nOur quality management system and processes are aligned with the requirements of International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001, and we choose suppliers with quality management systems of equal rigor. We expect our suppliers and partners to comply with our Suppliers & Partners Quality System Requirements. Certain of our sites are ISO 9001 certified. For more information, please refer to our certificates: ISO 9001 Certificate and International Automotive Task Force (IATF) 16949 Certificate.\nEnvironment\nOur Commitment to the Planet\n\nAt Broadcom, we understand that climate change poses an immense challenge for society and that a collective effort is required to effectively mitigate the impacts. We seek to manage our business in a sustainable manner that considers the impact of both our direct operations and supply chain on the planet. We also strive to continuously improve our operations by managing resources effectively and finding innovative ways to produce our products more efficiently.\n\nOur semiconductor solutions business primarily operates through a fabless production model where we outsource the vast majority of the manufacturing of our semiconductor products to trusted third-party suppliers and foundries.\n\nManaging our environmental impact allows us to be prepared for climate-related risks and capitalize on climate-related opportunities, making Broadcom more resilient to climate change while allowing us to increase operational performance and reduce costs.\n\nIn this report, we have disclosed four categories of Scope 3 emissions. We have also increased our efforts to collect and analyze utility and other environmental data from our globally owned facilities, such as non-hazardous waste data.\n\nOur 2022 total Scope 1 and Scope 2 (market-based) GHG emissions decreased by 17% from 2021 GHG emissions levels. The decrease was primarily driven by abatement activities at our Fort Collins, Colorado manufacturing facility, procurement of renewable energy certificates (RECs) and energy efficiency initiatives at our global facilities.\n\nBecause it is important that we share the responsibility of combating climate change, we continue to evaluate additional Scope 3 GHG emissions categories that are relevant to our business for data collection and reporting in future ESG Reports. We are also carefully reviewing additional climate- and environment-related goals.\nManaging our Environmental Impact\n\nEnergy use and efficiency, water management, GHG emissions reductions and waste management represent Broadcom\u2019s priority environmental impact areas, both directly at our proprietary manufacturing locations and indirectly through our outsourced manufacturing activities.\n\nTo help us manage these impacts, we employ robust environmental management practices and have implemented a global Environment and Sustainability Policy, which requires that we:\n\n- Ensure our products and operations comply with applicable environmental legislation and other related compliance obligations\n- Operate and continually improve an environmental management system that strives to align with our business practices and set objectives that enhance environmental performance\n- Conduct our operations in a manner that supports recycling, conservation of resources, prevention of pollution and protection of the environment\n- Responsibly manage the use of hazardous substances in our operations and products\n- Inform our suppliers, partners and contractors of our environmental expectations and encourage them to adopt sound environmental management practices\n- Promote environmental stewardship and sustainability within our organization\n- Publicly communicate our environmental priorities and performance annually\n\nOur environmental management system, which serves as a framework for our global operations, is aligned with International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 and guides our efforts in achieving the expectations set forth by our Environment and Sustainability Policy.\n\nWe also monitor and track our environmental data, such as GHG emissions, energy consumption, water withdrawals and waste generated. We continuously look for ways to improve our environmental performance over time.\nFort Collins Manufacturing Facility\n\nOur Fort Collins facility is our largest manufacturing facility. We are proud that our Fort Collins facility has been recognized as a Gold Environmental Leader by the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment since 2010 for going beyond compliance requirements and has been a Platinum ClimateWise Member of the City of Fort Collins Sustainability Partnership since 2000 for voluntarily reducing our carbon emissions.\n\nEnvironmental Sustainability Projects at Fort Collins\n\nOur Fort Collins facility routinely reviews the efficiency of equipment, technologies and processes to reduce our energy consumption, water consumption and GHG emissions. Examples of recent long-term sustainability projects include:\n\n- In 2021 and 2022, we implemented an industrial water reuse project to redirect process rinse water from our water purification system to three wet scrubber systems, instead of using fresh water. This initiative is expected to result in approximately 4.7 million gallons of water being reused per year.\n\n- In 2022, we installed five new abatement units on individual dry etch and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) tools, which mitigate GHG emissions. This installation is estimated to have achieved Scope 1 GHG emissions reductions of 6,000 tCO\u2082e in 2022 compared to 2021.\n\n- In 2022, we refurbished a chiller to increase energy efficiency and provide greater capability, with an anticipated savings of approximately 78,200 kWh of electricity per year.\n\n- In 2022, we started to replace and convert a heat transfer fluid used in certain specialized manufacturing equipment to a fluid with a significantly lower global warming potential.\n\nManaging Climate Change Impacts at Fort Collins\n\nWe recognize that climate change is a serious concern for the state of Colorado and western U.S. regions. Our Fort Collins facility has installed improved outside air filtration to overcome increased particles in the air from wildfires and other particles, such as dust from winds and dry soil. We have also optimized HVAC systems through incoming air damper adjustments, increased use of carbon filters for odor reduction and introduced high efficiency pre-filters to minimize outside particulates from entering the office space and manufacturing areas.\nGlobal Energy and Emissions\n\nWe actively monitor and collect data on the electricity and fuel we consume in our facilities and the process gases, including perfluorocarbons (PFCs) used in equipment, which are the primary sources of our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions.\n\nFor this report, we calculated GHG emissions associated with our electricity, natural gas, fuel, refrigerant, PFCs and other process gas consumption for our global facilities and operations where we have operational control. PFCs and other process gases are required for certain tools in the semiconductor manufacturing process, including CVD chamber cleaning and etching equipment. Semiconductor manufacturing process chemicals include PFCs, HFCs, nitrogen trifluoride, sulfur hexafluoride, fluorinated heat transfer fluids and nitrous oxide.\n\nElectricity usage at our facilities accounts for approximately 75% of our total energy consumption and approximately 65% of our overall Scope 1 and Scope 2 (location-based) GHG emissions.\n\nOur second largest source of GHG emissions is PFCs, which are used in processing equipment at our manufacturing facilities, and account for approximately 25% of our overall Scope 1 and Scope 2 (location-based) GHG emissions.\n\nThe following table summarizes our fuel and energy consumption for our global facilities in 2022 and 2021.\n\n| Fuel and Energy Consumption** (kWh) | 2022       | 2021       |\n|-------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Electricity                         | 411,559,154| 409,247,257|\n| Natural Gas                         | 138,546,040| 141,081,273|\n| Other Fuels                         | 1,503,572  | 1,456,980  |\n| **Total Energy Consumption**        | 551,608,766| 551,785,511|\n| **Total Energy per million dollars of revenue** | 16,615 kWh/$M | 20,101 kWh/$M |\n\n*See Environmental Metrics in the Appendix for more information on the calculation methodology.\n\n\u2021Updated as of June 2023.\nThe following table summarizes our greenhouse GHG emissions for our global facilities in 2022 and 2021.\n\n| Greenhouse Gas Emissions*\u2020 (tCO\u2082e) | 2022 | 2021 |\n|------------------------------------|------|------|\n| **SCOPE 1**                        |      |      |\n| PFCs and Process Gas               | 70,192 | 98,602 |\n| Natural Gas                        | 24,760 | 24,840 |\n| Refrigerants                       | 3,018  | 3,120 |\n| Other Fuels                        | 388   | 329  |\n| **Total Scope 1 Emissions**        | 98,358 | 126,891 |\n| **SCOPE 2**                        |      |      |\n| Total Scope 2 Emissions (location-based) | 181,474 | 187,519 |\n| Total Scope 2 Emissions (market-based) | 153,304 | 176,604 |\n| **SCOPE 1 & 2**                    |      |      |\n| Total Scope 1 & 2 Emissions (location-based) | 279,832 | 314,410 |\n| Total Scope 1 & 2 Emissions (market-based) | 251,661 | 303,495 |\n| **Total Scope 1 & 2 Emissions (location-based) per million dollars of revenue** | 8.4 tCO\u2082e /$M | 11.5 tCO\u2082e /$M |\n| **SCOPE 3**                        |      |      |\n| Fuel-and Energy-Related Activities | 12,063 |      |\n| Waste Generated in Operations      | 4,350  |      |\n| Business Travel                    | 3,050  |      |\n| Employee Commuting                 | 7,713  |      |\n| **Total Scope 3 Emissions**        | 27,177 |      |\n\n*See Environmental Metrics in the Appendix for more information on the calculation methodology.\n\u2020Updated as of June 2023.\n\nThe reduction in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions was primarily driven by GHG emissions abatement activities at our Fort Collins facility. We also sourced 28,000 MWh of Green e-certified renewable energy certificates (RECs) for our Fort Collins facility, which reduced our total Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by an additional 14,625 tCO\u2082e.\nEnergy Saving and Emission Reduction Projects\n\nWe have many on-going long-term energy efficiency improvement and emission reduction projects throughout our global facilities, including the following projects that we implemented in 2022:\n\n- Our Breinigsville, Pennsylvania manufacturing facility installed a variable frequency drive control panel on our ultra pure water system pump motors. We expect to save up to 148,500 kWh of electricity and reduce emissions by 44 tCO\u2082e annually from this initiative.\n\n- Our San Jose Ridder Park, California office replaced our fluorescent lighting with LED lighting. We expect to save approximately 181,000 kWh of energy and reduce emissions by 42 tCO\u2082e annually from this initiative.\n\n- Our San Jose Ridder Park, California office replaced several inefficient rooftop units. We expect to save approximately 157,000 kWh of electricity and reduce emissions by 37 tCO\u2082e annually from this initiative.\n\n- Our Singapore-Depot manufacturing facility replaced our fluorescent lighting with LED lighting. We expect to save approximately 49,000 kWh of energy and reduce emissions by 19 tCO\u2082e annually from this initiative.\n\n- Our Irvine, California office implemented building management system programming to adjust the heating and air conditioning settings in our labs to \u2018unoccupied\u2019 during after-hours and weekends. We expect to save up to 1,300,000 kWh of electricity and reduce emissions by 304 tCO\u2082e annually from this initiative.\n\n- Our Colorado Springs, Colorado office replaced our old air conditioning systems with new energy efficient HVAC units. We expect to save more than 244,000 kWh of electricity per year from this initiative.\n\nREDUCING CARBON IMPACT OF DATA CENTERS\n\nAs part of our efforts to modernize, optimize and reduce our carbon impact, our cloud services that previously operated in a combination of co-located data centers and a third-party cloud platform migrated to a new cloud platform that uses 100% renewable energy. This transition has provided significant customer value and increased software efficiencies for our various software business units and product portfolios, and helps support our customers\u2019 sustainability goals.\n\nIn 2022, Broadcom received the Switch Sustainability Certificate for using 100% renewable energy within the Switch ecosystem, which houses our largest data center in Las Vegas, Nevada. Our co-located data center in Singapore also received both LEED Gold Certification and the BCA Green Mark Platinum award for our outstanding achievements in environmental sustainability.\nWater Management\n\nWe recognize that water scarcity and quality are challenges that many communities encounter around the world, and we strive to use water responsibly in our operations.\n\nSemiconductor manufacturing uses a significant amount of water. We operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing model, with over 85% of our semiconductor wafer manufacturing performed by third-party foundries. We also outsource the substantial majority of our assembly and test operations to third parties. Our contract manufacturers and other supply chain suppliers are expected to abide by our Supplier Environmental and Social Responsibility Code of Conduct, which requires water management.\n\nWe regularly monitor our own water use at facilities where we have operational control and make efforts to conserve and use it efficiently in our facilities. Water is monitored and managed locally, and we have implemented various technologies to reduce water consumption. At our global facilities, these efforts reduced our water use by approximately 5 million gallons in 2022.\n\nIn the U.S., our Fort Collins facility is the primary driver of our water consumption. We actively monitor our water consumption and evaluate our water efficiency efforts at this manufacturing facility. We continue to invest in substantial improvements to conserve, recycle and reclaim water used at our Fort Collins facility. Our installation of a water reuse system in 2022 at the Fort Collins facility is expected to save an additional 4.7 million gallons of water each year.\n\nThe following table summarizes our water withdrawals at our global facilities in 2022 and 2021.\n\n| Water (gallons) | 2022 | 2021 |\n|----------------|------|------|\n| Total Water Withdrawn* | 510,709,763 | 515,406,712 |\n\n*Water withdrawals based on actual data where available. Where actual data was not available, water withdrawals were estimated using square footage intensity factors by facility type.\n\nWATER ENVIRONMENTAL EXCELLENCE - PLATINUM AWARD\n\nIn 2022, our Charlotte, North Carolina manufacturing facility received the Water Environmental Excellence - Platinum Award from the City of Charlotte in recognition of five consecutive years of good stewardship in the management of our process wastewater stream.\nWaste Management\n\nWe monitor our processes that generate waste as part of our overall environmental impact management. Our facilities around the world are focused on reducing and recycling waste as well as diverting waste from the landfill.\n\nIn 2022, we used more reusable plates, utensils and containers at our North American facilities to reduce waste from single-use kitchenware at the facilities. We expect to save approximately 11% in cost per year from this initiative.\n\nWe also aggregated our waste and diversion data across our globally owned facilities, which was previously managed at the local facility level until 2021. We now track waste and diversion data across all of our globally owned offices and manufacturing facilities and e-scrap waste data across all of our global facilities.\n\nWe actively monitor hazardous waste and industrial process waste streams at our global manufacturing facilities. In 2022, our manufacturing facilities diverted nearly 99% of all hazardous waste from landfill through reuse, recycling, incineration or other means.\n\nElimination of Hazardous Substances\n\nThe elimination of hazardous substances from products is a global initiative. We offer a broad portfolio of RoHS-compliant products. Rigorous testing procedures ensure the performance integrity of our portfolio of products, regardless of the materials and processes employed. Our efforts are outlined in our Product Material Environmental Specifications and General Specification for the Environment.\n\nE-WASTE RECYCLING\n\nWe partner with a third-party service provider to decommission and recycle all of our e-waste. In 2022, we recycled over 48 metric tons (100,000 lbs) of e-waste from our facilities globally.\n\nTo celebrate Earth Day in 2022, we sponsored an e-waste recycling initiative at 30 of our global sites and collected approximately 26 metric tons (over 57,000 lbs) of e-waste.\n\nThe following table summarizes our waste data in 2022.\n\n| Non-Hazardous Waste (short tons) |\n|----------------------------------|\n| GLOBAL OWNED OFFICES AND MANUFACTURING FACILITIES |\n| Total Waste Generated | 11,127 |\n| Total Waste Diverted from Landfill | 3,894 |\n| Diversion Rate | 35% |\n\n| Hazardous Waste and Industrial Process Waste (short tons) |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| GLOBAL MANUFACTURING FACILITIES\u00b9 |\n| Incineration (with Heat Recovery) | 1,878 |\n| Incineration (without Heat Recovery) | 101 |\n| Sent to Landfill/Surface Impoundment | 69 |\n| Other Disposal Operations | 3,002 |\n| Total | 5,050 |\n\n| E-scrap Waste (short tons) |\n|----------------------------|\n| GLOBAL FACILITIES |\n| E-scrap\u00b2 | 183 |\n\n\u00b9 Hazardous and industrial process waste data is based on reported data from all global manufacturing facilities.\n\u00b2 E-scrap data is presented separately here for visibility into e-scrap waste generation at all global facilities. E-scrap waste generated at all global owned offices and manufacturing facilities is also included above in Total Waste Generated in the Non-Hazardous Waste table.\nWorkforce\nAt Broadcom, we understand that our workforce is the foundation of our success. Having a talented, engaged and diverse workforce, many of whom have joined Broadcom via acquisitions, makes us a strong, resilient and innovative company.\n\nWe are able to recruit and retain our highly skilled and dedicated workforce due to our workplace culture, which encourages our employees to push for excellence and innovation, and rewards and supports them for giving their best.\n\nEmployee Engagement\n\nWe measure our employees\u2019 engagement by our voluntary attrition rate and our annual Employee Ethical Culture Survey. We use this important feedback to continuously improve and create a supportive environment for our employees where they feel their contributions are valued.\n\n**VOLUNTARY ATTRITION RATE IN 2022**\n\n6.5%\n\nOur global voluntary attrition rate in 2022 (which does not include employees who left as a result of restructuring, divestitures or involuntary terminations) was 6.5%, which is below the technology industry benchmark (AON, 2022 Salary Increase and Turnover Study \u2014 Second Edition, September 2022).\n\nIn 2022, we were recognized as one of the American Opportunity Index\u2019s Best Workplaces to Stay and Thrive at One Company and Best Workplaces to Advance without a College Degree. These awards reflect the opportunities and growth potential for our employees at Broadcom.\n\n**IN OUR 2022 EMPLOYEE ETHICAL CULTURE SURVEY**\n\n91.3%\n\nSAY BROADCOM IS A GREAT PLACE TO WORK\n\n92.6%\n\nSAY THEY ARE PROUD TO WORK AT BROADCOM\nWorkforce Snapshot\n\nAt the end of 2022, Broadcom had approximately 20,000 employees in 30 countries around the world. Our EEO-1 report for our employees in the U.S. can be found at the Corporate Citizenship webpage on our external company website.\n\nHere is a snapshot of our workforce as of October 30, 2022.\n\nGlobal Workforce by Gender\n\nGlobal Workforce by Location\n\nU.S. Workforce by Race/Ethnicity\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nBroadcom is a global company that employs people of many different nationalities, ethnicities, cultures, abilities, backgrounds, faiths and beliefs. Our goal is to create a welcoming and inclusive culture, which empowers our workforce to give their best, collaborate and contribute to our collective success. We recognize that the greatest ideas can come from a diverse workforce and the need to continue to champion these different perspectives to foster our culture of innovation.\n\nDiversity@Broadcom\n\nOur Diversity@Broadcom initiative encourages a diverse, equitable and inclusive community at Broadcom. Our DEI Working Group launched the Diversity@Broadcom initiative in 2021 with our executive sponsor Sally Doherty, who is Vice President and General Manager of our PreAmp Components Division. The Diversity@Broadcom initiative is also supported by a steering committee that is comprised of several of our executives and general managers who lead business units at Broadcom.\n\nOur Lean In Circles program provides our employees with peer mentorship and a safe space where they can share their experiences, build new skills and lead. Our Lean In Circles cover a range of identities and experiences. We are proud to continue to support this important community network for our employees.\n\nCELEBRATING INTERNATIONAL WOMEN\u2019S DAY IN INDIA\n\nInternational Women\u2019s Day (March 8) is a global holiday that celebrates the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women. Our Broadcom team in India conducted a series of programs, including sessions on financial independence, leadership and professional development, to support the holistic development and empowerment of our female employees.\nDiversity@Broadcom Leadership Talks\n\nThrough our Diversity@Broadcom initiative, we host global Leadership Talks featuring Broadcom executives and other industry and community leaders. The Leadership Talks provide a forum for leaders and our employees to share their experiences and discuss leadership and DEI within Broadcom and our industry.\n\nIn 2022, we hosted Leadership Talks to recognize the contributions of military veterans in the workplace and to celebrate Black History Month, Asian-American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month and Hispanic Heritage Month. We also featured an inspirational disability awareness advocate who spoke to our employees about overcoming perceived limitations and tackling challenges with courage and creativity.\n\nSally Doherty, Ph.D.\nIn honor of U.S. Veterans Day, Dr. Doherty (Vice President and General Manager of our PreAmp Components Division and U.S. Air Force veteran) led a panel discussion with other Broadcom military veterans to highlight the unique and valuable skills that military veterans bring to the workplace and how to best support their transition from military to civilian job roles.\n\nQuincy Brown, Ph.D.\nDr. Brown, who has degrees in electrical engineering and computer science, is currently the Director of Space STEM and Workforce Policy in the Office of the Vice President of the United States. In recognition of Black History Month, Dr. Brown shared her professional journey and her work to promote DEI in STEM.\n\nJessica Cox\nJessica Cox, a well-known disabilities rights advocate, shared her inspirational journey\u2014from being born armless to earning the Guinness World Record for being the first armless airplane pilot. She spoke about her passion for overcoming perceived limitations and tackling challenges with courage and creativity. In Jessica\u2019s words, \u201cdisability does not mean inability.\u201d\n\nFrank Ostojic\nFrank Ostojic (Senior Vice President and General Manager of our ASIC Products Division) shared his leadership journey, noting that overcoming language and cultural obstacles helped create resilience and a drive to excel. Mr. Ostojic spoke to the importance of DEI in the workplace and having multiple viewpoints at the table to make us a better and stronger company.\nM&A\n\nBroadcom takes a thoughtful and comprehensive approach when integrating workforces from our acquired companies and businesses. We spend a lot of time learning about the values and culture of our acquired companies and businesses. We are proud that many knowledgeable and talented employees from our acquired companies and businesses, such as LSI, Brocade, CA Technologies and Symantec Enterprise Security, have decided to join us at Broadcom.\n\nWe do not take this challenge of integrating our workforce lightly. Our Chief Executive Officer, executives and many different groups, such as Human Resources, Finance, Legal, Global Technology Organization, Global Operations and Workplace Services, are actively involved in planning integration and ensuring a supportive transition upon closing the acquisition.\n\nWe provide employees who have decided to join us with orientation, compliance and product trainings, and assistance with onboarding and transition so that they can quickly integrate into Broadcom and be part of the Broadcom team from \u201cday one\u201d of closing the acquisition. We also look for ways to create professional opportunities and growth for the employees who join us.\n\nLeaders from the acquired companies and businesses have joined Broadcom upon the closing of the acquisitions, and they are important in ensuring that employee morale is maintained and attrition is limited. Currently, 47% of our executives and general managers who lead business units within Broadcom have joined us through acquisitions.\n\n\u201cOnce I joined Broadcom, I had more responsibilities and a more diverse portfolio. I got to try new things and do things that I might not have had the opportunity to do had we not been acquired.\u201d\n\nSunjeet Randhawa, Director of Government Affairs\n\n\u201cWhen I first learned that Broadcom was acquiring Symantec, I was a bit nervous \u2014 a lot of changes, the unknown... And really at the end of the day, it\u2019s working with the same great people that I like working with, and still having that family culture where I don\u2019t just work with other coworkers, I work with friends.\u201d\n\nClelia Canova, Technical Product Owner\n\nCharlie Kawwas, Ph.D., President of our Semiconductor Solutions Group and executive chair of our ESG Steering Committee, joined Broadcom through our acquisition of LSI in 2014. As an integral member of our executive management team, Dr. Kawwas oversees our broad semiconductor portfolio in addition to overseeing our worldwide semiconductor sales and global operations.\n\nKirsten Spears, our Chief Financial Officer and a member of our ESG Steering Committee, joined Broadcom through our acquisition of LSI in 2014. Ms. Spears was promoted to Chief Financial Officer in 2020 and is responsible for all financial functions and investor relations at Broadcom.\nHiring\n\nWe strive to recruit and hire diverse candidates and advance qualified women, minorities, veterans and individuals with disabilities. We are continuing our efforts to increase our goal of building a diverse pipeline of Broadcom employees through our science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education programs and scholarships.\n\nWe regularly monitor and assess our various programs and policies related to employment decisions, equal opportunity and affirmative action to identify and address areas of potential improvement.\n\nSTEM Pipeline\n\nAt the end of 2022, approximately 64% of our employees worldwide were in R&D roles. It is important to Broadcom that we improve the representation of women and people from underrepresented communities in technical roles in our pipeline of candidates.\n\nWe partner with Broadcom Foundation, a non-profit organization established in 2009 and funded from our subsidiary Broadcom Corporation, to advance STEM education for women and underrepresented youth. We and Broadcom Foundation believe that cultivating interest in STEM, achieving digital literacy, providing equitable access to STEM education and preparing students to be college- and career-ready to succeed in STEM fields is key to creating the engineers, scientists and innovators of tomorrow.\n\nBroadcom Foundation has made a four-year commitment to support a STEMNext Opportunity Fellow for two years at the Executive Office of Science and Technology Policy and two years at the U.S. Department of Labor. The Fellows use their knowledge, skills and expertise to advance DEI and access to STEM education and workforce development.\n\nWith annual grants of over $4 million, Broadcom Foundation has supported regional, national and international science fairs, code clubs and after/out-of-school programs for middle school students. Our employees volunteer their time to mentor, participate in Broadcom Foundation sponsored STEM education programs and judge science fair competitions.\n\nSTEM Scholarships\n\nIn 2022, we provided scholarships focused toward electrical engineering and computer science students from underrepresented communities at San Jose State University, Colorado State University and Spelman College\u2019s Center of Excellence for Minority Women in STEM, all of which are located near some of our larger locations in the U.S. In addition, we sponsored scholarships with the Society of Women Engineers.\n\nINCLUSIVE LEADERSHIP TOOLKITS\n\nWe integrate diversity, inclusion and belonging principles in how we attract, retain and motivate our employees. We developed and launched in 2022 Inclusive Leadership toolkits for our executives and managers to help us accelerate DEI at Broadcom and provide a strong foundation for future progress.\n\nThese toolkits empower our leaders with practical guidance and resources and raise awareness of important DEI issues, such as unconscious bias, in recruiting, hiring, onboarding and retention. Our HR Group also provided one-on-one trainings to our executives and hiring managers and created a checklist so that these toolkits can become an integral part of the hiring process.\nCompensation and Benefits\n\nCompensation\nBroadcom\u2019s success depends on its continued ability to attract, motivate and retain our workforce. Competition for talented employees is significant in many locations where we operate, such as Silicon Valley and Southeast Asia.\n\nAs a result, we provide competitive compensation and benefits programs to our employees, including performance-based compensation (such as our annual cash bonus program, sales incentive plans and spot bonuses) and equity awards.\n\nBroadcom is different from its peer companies because a vast majority of our employees receive equity awards that vest over time. We grant equity to our employees because we want our employees to share in Broadcom\u2019s success.\n\nWe believe that equity compensation aligns the interest of our employees with our stockholders, is a key factor in recruiting and retaining top talent, and assists in the successful and rapid integration of our employees who join Broadcom through acquisitions.\n\nBenefits, Health and Well-Being\nThe health and well-being of our employees is important to Broadcom. We offer a range of benefits to our employees beyond the traditional healthcare benefits and insurance.\n\nOur U.S. benefits include:\n\u2022 Employee Assistance Programs, including mental health services\n\u2022 Paid parental leave, including maternity, paternity and adoption leave\n\u2022 Adoption assistance\n\u2022 Increased sick-leave flexibility in response to COVID-19\n\u2022 Fertility benefits\n\u2022 Medical coverage for gender transition care\n\u2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\n\u2022 Retirement planning\n\u2022 Education Assistance Program\n\u2022 24/7 telemedicine support\n\nTo help reduce stress and encourage mindfulness, we provide wellness and prayer/meditation rooms. We also subsidize our on-site cafeterias that feature healthy dietary options, including vegetarian and halal options where available.\n\nPAY EQUITY IN 2022\nAs part of our effort to ensure employee equality and pay equity, we engaged a third-party firm to conduct an annual pay equity evaluation focusing on subsets of our global population, including the U.S.\n\nAfter accounting for factors such as job and location, this evaluation in 2022 revealed that, on average, pay was equitable for employees in the same job doing the same work when comparing women to men globally, or when comparing Asian, Black/African American or Hispanic/Latinx to White/Caucasian employees in the U.S.\n\nCOUNSELING WEEK AT BROADCOM INDIA\nTo assist and guide employees in their physical, emotional, social and mental wellbeing, we partnered with 1 to 1 Help and launched \u201ccounseling week\u201d for our employees in India. The initiative provided over a hundred counseling sessions to employees, gave them a glimpse of how counseling can help with their wellbeing and reduced the barrier of receiving counseling and mental health support from a professional.\nDevelopment and Feedback\n\nTraining\nWe encourage our employees to continuously learn new skills and to strengthen their existing skills. We provide structured, job-specific technical training and testing for our manufacturing and operational employees. We also provide numerous technical product trainings to our sales personnel.\n\nAll of our employees (including part-time employees) and contractors are required to complete trainings that support Broadcom\u2019s values and culture, such as our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, harassment prevention, cybersecurity and data privacy, human rights, anti-corruption and anti-trust.\n\nFeedback\nOur managers have multiple opportunities throughout the year to provide performance feedback to their team members, including feedback on career and skill development. Our reviews and decisions on annual salaries, bonuses, equity award grants and promotions occur in different quarters throughout the year, and at each of those times managers are required to evaluate their team members\u2019 performance and provide them feedback.\n\nEducational Assistance Program\nOur Educational Assistance Program is available to all employees (including part-time employees) and provides them with financial assistance to take academic classes or relevant degree programs that are work-related and provide knowledge and skills to enhance their job performance.\n\nDuring 2022, we reimbursed employees approximately $520,000 in tuition expenses under this program.\n\nUnleashing Your Leadership Potential\nEach of our divisions has the ability to create and customize its own training and development programs, including intern and mentor programs.\n\nOur Agile Operations Division (AOD) Learning and Development Program provides employees with opportunities to learn and grow at work through activities such as knowledge share events, mentoring programs and a variety of learning communities. Over 93% of AOD employees participate in this program.\n\nAOD invests in our current and future leaders through an extensive leadership program \u2014 Unleashing Your Leadership Potential \u2014 that provides them with practical tools and experiences, like peer coaching sessions, to drive real business results. AOD\u2019s Unleashing Your Leadership Potential program was shortlisted as a DEI Initiative of the Year at the Women in IT Awards USA 2022 organized by DiversityQ.\n\n100,000+\nASSIGNED LEARNING HOURS IN 2022\n\nIn 2022, our employees and contractors completed a total of over 100,000 assigned learning hours, including over 41,000 assigned learning hours of technical training.\nEmployee Health and Safety\n\nMaintaining a safe and healthy work environment is important for the well-being and productivity of our employees.\n\nWe continue to make strides in engaging our employees to design and implement safe work processes that eliminate hazards and reduce occupational health and safety (OHS) risks in our operations.\n\nEHS Management System\n\nOur Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) management system and processes apply to all of our facilities globally, and we maintain third party ISO 14001 certification at certain sites. To drive EHS compliance across Broadcom facilities, we assign site coordinators and develop and implement site-specific EHS Compliance Plans that consider local OHS risks in our operations, the environment and legal requirements. EHS Compliance Plan implementation is tracked and regularly reported to senior management.\n\nOur Occupational Health and Safety Policy is aligned with international and Singapore OHS management system standards (ISO 45001:2018 and SS 651:2019).\n\nCommunication and Training\n\nOur EHS intranet site provides information to our employees, including COVID-19 pandemic information, emergency action plans, work-related injury reporting systems, EHS Compliance Plans and other EHS programs, procedures and guidelines.\n\nWe also provide self-paced online EHS training courses to help our employees understand their responsibilities and the resources available to them. In 2022, we updated and deployed company-specific EHS training courses.\n\nHealth and Safety Performance\n\nWe have standard processes for reporting occupational injuries and illnesses so global rates are consistently managed and tracked. Once an occupational injury or illness is reported, we conduct an incident investigation and root cause analysis, as needed, to determine appropriate corrective and preventive actions.\n\nOur semiconductor manufacturing and laboratory operations represent our most significant health and safety risks, due to higher potential exposure to chemicals and equipment-related hazards at such sites.\n\nContinued focus on managing and reducing OHS risks has helped us maintain U.S. occupational injury and illness lost-time case rates significantly below the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) occupational injury and illness incidence rate averages for the semiconductors, computer system design and software publishers industries in which we operate over the last five years.\n\nIn 2022, we had 26 recordable cases and 12 lost workday cases representing a total of 122 lost workdays globally.\n\nIn 2022, global total injury and illness case rate was 0.13 cases per 100 employees, and our global lost workday case rate was 0.06 cases per 100 employees. There were no work-related fatalities globally in 2022.\nHealth and Safety During COVID-19\n\nFor most of 2022, we have been able to return to the office and maintain on-site operations because we have implemented and continue to implement numerous additional proactive measures to protect and invest in the health and well-being of our workforce.\n\nAt the start of COVID-19, we proactively consulted with third-party certified industrial hygienists and epidemiologists in adopting additional protective measures on top of complying with government mandated safety protocols and industry standards, including:\n\n\u2022 Provided masks, gloves, hand sanitizers and disinfecting cleaning supplies for all on-site personnel, and mandated that personnel wear masks\n\u2022 Maintained thermal scanning cameras and infrared contactless thermometers at all locations\n\u2022 Required regular COVID-19 rapid antigen testing for employees, sub-tenants and visitors at most sites\n\u2022 Reconfigured work space arrangements to reduce employee density in our facilities and promote social distancing\n\u2022 Significantly enhanced cleaning protocols, including frequent intraday sanitization of high contact common areas and surfaces and daily electrostatic disinfection of common areas and conference rooms in many of our locations\n\u2022 Maintained HVAC systems to meet or exceed American Society of Heating and Air-Conditioning Engineers\u2019 guidance, which optimizes outdoor air, increases ventilation, and uses MERV 13 or higher filters\n\u2022 Deployed portable HEPA filtration units for conference rooms and limited the number of people permitted in a conference room at a time\n\u2022 Provided mental health support to our employees through our EAP and various health insurance provider sponsored initiatives\n\nOn-site Health Clinic\n\nBeginning in March 2018, our Fort Collins facility has partnered with UCHealth to provide our employees with access to medical care through an on-site health clinic. The clinic is open during hours that overlap all employee shifts and is staffed by a physician assistant and a medical assistant, who can provide both personal primary care and occupational surveillance and treatment.\n\nSince September 2020, the clinic has had over 5,500 employee visits covering a range of services such as workers\u2019 compensation injury/illness evaluation, treatment and medical surveillance, medical consultation and COVID-19 mitigation.\n\nThe clinic also provides personal primary care such as immunizations, blood draws, rapid diagnostic testing and drop-in vital sign measurements. Beginning in June 2022, our onsite third party contractors could access the clinic in addition to Broadcom employees, resulting in almost 3,000 employee and contractor visits in 2022.\nResponsible Supply Chain\nSupply Chain Management\n\nWe are committed to supporting ethical business conduct, respecting human rights and responsibly sourcing materials throughout our global supply chain.\n\nOur Supplier Environmental and Social Responsibility Code of Conduct (Supplier Code), which reflects the Responsible Business Alliance\u2019s Code of Conduct, is the foundation of our responsible sourcing practices. Our Supplier Code, along with our contract and purchase order terms, establish our expectations regarding workplace standards and business practices for our suppliers\u2014including with respect to labor and human rights, health and safety, the environment and anti-corruption.\n\nWe outsource most of our manufacturing and strive to work with responsible supply chain partners that are leaders in the industry.\n\nOur integrated approach in managing human rights in our business and supply chain is set forth below.\n\nIn 2021, Broadcom became a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA). We are committed to upholding RBA\u2019s vision of a global electronics industry that creates sustainable value for workers, the environment and business.\n\nAs a member of RBA, we have leveraged some of RBA\u2019s tools in our supplier assessment program, including their Self-Assessment Questionnaires and Validated Assessment Program.\nHuman Rights in Supply Chain\n\nHuman Rights Policies\nIn 2022, we published our Human Rights Principles, which reflects our commitment to respecting human rights and avoiding complicity in any human rights abuse throughout our company, operations, supply chain and communities.\n\nOur employment and supply chain practices and policies, including our Supplier Code, support the fundamental human rights principles of freely chosen employment, non-discrimination, the elimination of forced and underage labor, and the rights of workers to engage in peaceful assembly, organize, freely associate and bargain collectively, as articulated in the International Labour Organization Conventions.\n\nRespecting human rights, particularly the rights of people in vulnerable communities (women, children and migrant workers) is a shared responsibility, and we strive to align our approach and actions with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n\nSalient Human Rights Impact Assessment\nOur Human Rights/Supply Chain Working Group conducted a human rights impact assessment (HRIA) to identify our most salient human rights concerns that could impact our supply chain. The assessment included input from and collaboration with key stakeholders, risk assessments and results of our internal audit of our supply chain.\n\nBased on the HRIA, the following is a list of human rights concerns that we particularly focus on in our supply chain:\n\n- Forced labor (including recruiting fees and retaining worker identification documents)\n- Working hours and rest days\n- Young workers\n- Worker disciplinary practices (e.g., use of wage fines as punishment)\n- Accurate worker agreements\n- Fair wages\n- Safe and healthy working conditions\n- Freedom of association and collective bargaining\n\nSupplier Human Rights Engagement\nOn an annual basis, we identify and survey our significant suppliers globally (that were not part of our prior surveys) for human rights-related issues. The suppliers surveyed in 2020, 2021 and 2022 collectively represent over 99.9% of our supply chain (based on our 2021 supplier spend).\n\nAll new suppliers are also screened for potential human rights issues as part of our onboarding process.\n\nWe found no instances of forced labor, child labor, slavery or human trafficking among Broadcom\u2019s suppliers. However, through the 2022 screenings, we identified a supplier in Japan with a policy that allows its employees to be fined as permitted by local laws. While this practice is legal in Japan, we have engaged with this supplier and requested the discontinuance of this practice.\n\nThrough this survey process, we have identified suppliers that we can support in developing more robust human rights programs, policies and/or training and have begun to engage with those suppliers.\n\nAll surveyed suppliers, as well as certain categories of new suppliers, are placed in our third-party continuous monitoring program to alert us to emerging human rights issues that might arise with the suppliers.\n\n99.9+% SUPPLY CHAIN SUPPLIERS SURVEYED FOR HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES\nSupplier Human Rights Audits\n\nOur Global Operations and Internal Audit teams regularly audit our suppliers\u2019 operations and compliance with various Broadcom and human rights-related requirements. In their audits, our teams review wage and hour labor laws, working conditions, employment agreements and recruitment fee payments.\n\nWhile these audits are typically on-site audits at the supplier location, many audits were still conducted remotely in 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The audits that were conducted on-site included worker interviews.\n\nThe human rights-related findings from these audits in 2022 identified three suppliers that required remediation. Two suppliers needed to improve their worker hours tracking systems to ensure their workers did not work beyond permitted hour limits. Another supplier needed to provide clearer communication with its workers on employment agreement terms. We required action plans for these suppliers and the findings have been remediated.\n\nHuman Rights Training\n\nAs part of our ongoing efforts to educate and raise awareness of forced labor and human trafficking issues, we require annual human rights awareness and forced labor prevention training for relevant employees in our Global Operations, Human Resources, Legal, Procurement and supply chain functions who have a direct responsibility for supply chain management. Our employees working with our U.S. government customers complete combating trafficking in persons and prevention of forced labor training on an annual basis. In 2022, we achieved a 100% completion rate for both of these trainings.\n\nHuman Rights Communication\n\nIn addition to publicly reporting on human rights annually in our ESG Reports, we publish an annual Statement Against Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking in compliance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, the U.K. Modern Slavery Act and the Australian Modern Slavery Act.\n\nAnyone inside or outside of Broadcom can communicate with Broadcom\u2019s Compliance Officer and Compliance Team via our Ethics and Compliance Hotline (available in all relevant languages) to report any human rights-related issues. We take all reported issues seriously, and we promptly investigate and take disciplinary actions as appropriate (which may include senior management discussions, employee communications, trainings, process and controls improvements and corrective action measures).\nResponsible Minerals Sourcing\n\nWe are committed to socially responsible sourcing of conflict minerals (cassiterite, columbite-tantalite, gold, wolframite, and/or their derivatives tin, tantalum and tungsten) that are included in our products. We also strongly support our industry\u2019s efforts to expand the smelter certification program and the audit process, including expanding these efforts to include cobalt.\n\nWe are a member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), and leverage RMI\u2019s resources to conduct our conflict minerals supply chain due diligence, including using RMI\u2019s database of suppliers that are listed on the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP) Conformant Smelter List. Because we outsource most of our manufacturing, we do not typically have a direct relationship with the smelters and refiners (SORs).\n\nIn 2021, 93% (243 out of 260) of the active SORs potentially in our supply chain were certified \u201cconflict free\u201d under the RMAP audit process. This high level of conformance is due to our on-going efforts to identify conflict minerals risks in our supply chain and encourage our suppliers to purchase materials only from SORs that are certified as \u201cconflict free\u201d in compliance with RMAP protocols.\n\nFor more information, see our Conflict Minerals Policy and 2021 Conflict Minerals Report.\n\nSupplier Diversity\n\nWe provide relevant employees with training on supplier diversity and integrate supplier diversity considerations into our supplier onboarding process.\n\nWe seek to source goods and services from minority-owned, woman-owned, historically underutilized businesses, veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, small and disadvantaged businesses that are able to provide quality goods and services in a timely and competitive manner.\n\nCOVID-19 and Business Continuity\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continued in 2022, we worked closely with our supply chain to safeguard their workers\u2019 health and ensure continued supply of products and services. As we enter into 2023, we will continue to monitor and engage our supply chain to ensure human rights are protected while focusing on business continuity.\nCybersecurity & Data Privacy\nAt Broadcom, cybersecurity and data privacy form a core part of our corporate mission and are critical to protecting our customers, employees, company and the broader digital ecosystem.\n\nUpdates on cybersecurity and data privacy risks and initiatives are provided to the Board\u2019s Audit Committee on a quarterly basis by our Chief Security Officer.\n\nProtecting our Communities\n\nOur Symantec cybersecurity solutions strengthen the defenses of global institutions against organized crime syndicates operating online. In addition to providing the latest technical countermeasures against cyber threats, we frequently collaborate with law enforcement agencies and other partners around the world to help neutralize transnational cyber threats.\n\nOur technical expertise and unique visibility into threat actors\u2019 tactics have helped authorities break up cyber-crime networks and successfully prosecute or disrupt criminal offenders worldwide, including actors responsible for prolific Trojans, ransomware, distributed-denial-of-service campaigns and crypto-mining hijacks.\n\nThe Symantec Threat Hunter team also has been vigilant in responding to cyber activity around the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We were able to share indicators of compromise relating to Russian attacks against Ukrainian network infrastructure in the hours preceding the launch of the invasion, and, since then, have regularly published updates with new information on threats.\n\nJOINT CYBER DEFENSE COLLABORATIVE\n\nBroadcom is a member of the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC), a joint collaboration between U.S. federal agencies and the private sector to strengthen U.S. cyber defenses. As a member of the JCDC, we are proud to help lead the development of cyber defense plans to protect our nation against cyber activity targeting U.S. critical infrastructure.\n\nIn 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security recognized Broadcom for its contributions to the mission of the JCDC, including providing the JCDC with unique intelligence that alerted other national governments to the presence of cyber threat actors on their networks. Actionable intelligence shared by Broadcom with government partners has also been credited with thwarting ransomware and other malicious attacks on critical infrastructure.\n\nCYBER SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\nWhile our researchers aggressively pursue online thieves and spies, our Cyber Social Responsibility Policy imposes responsible and ethical guardrails on our collection and sharing of cyber threat intelligence and includes controls designed to prevent the misuse of our commercial cybersecurity technologies.\nProtecting our Customers\n\nWe strive to incorporate cybersecurity and privacy into the full lifecycle of our products and to be transparent with our customers and other stakeholders about our cybersecurity and privacy policies and practices.\n\nOur Secure Software Development Policy mandates the use of security- and privacy-by-design principles throughout the software development lifecycle. This enables us to improve the privacy-enhancing capabilities of our products, to maintain accurate information as our products evolve and to improve the speed of our public disclosures as part of our regular transparency efforts.\n\nWe also assess the compliance of our products and processes with new laws such as the EU Digital Operational Resilience Act and the California Privacy Rights Act to ensure our readiness to meet our compliance obligations and our ability to offer sound and compliant solutions to our customers.\n\nWe maintain a Privacy and Data Protection Portal on our external company website that includes our privacy policies, standard contractual clauses for international data transfers and product-specific transparency statements that disclose categories of data collection and processing, the identities and locations of sub-processors and privacy-enhancing product features.\n\nProtecting our Company\n\nWe have a dedicated privacy group that reports to the Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer and oversees all aspects of our corporate privacy program. We also have an internal privacy working group that consists of global, cross-functional employees from our Global Technology Organization, Legal and business units and works to promote a uniform and coordinated approach to various privacy challenges.\n\nWe log and track cybersecurity and privacy matters from emergence to resolution, including data subject access requests, data processor risk management, privacy impact assessments, records of processing activities, incident response activities and other privacy compliance issues. We also actively engage in matters related to data governance by responding to regulatory consultations and providing public policy feedback based on our real-life experiences across the regions where we do business.\n\nWe revamped our vendor risk management policy and introduced additional security and privacy reviews to ensure that personal and other confidential data that our employees and our customers entrust us with are handled to the highest standards by our own service providers.\n\nBROADCOM 2022 SECURITY CONSORTIUM\n\nAs a demonstration of our commitment to cybersecurity within Broadcom, we brought together dozens of engineers, security practitioners and compliance professionals from across business units for a first-of-its-kind corporate Security Consortium in September 2022. Over the course of three days participants from around the globe collaborated and shared insights about trends and best practices in product security.\nAs a part of our own enterprise security program, we maintain a comprehensive portfolio of information security management system policies designed around the ISO/IEC 27001 standards, and we maintain an ISO 27001:2013 certification for the Customer Support infrastructure of our software businesses.\n\nOur cloud-based Software-as-a-Service solutions also undergo routine audits for compliance with applicable security-controls standards such as the American Institute of CPAs\u2019 Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality and Privacy (SOC 2) and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS).\n\nWe conduct third-party penetration testing of our corporate and customer-facing networks at least annually and routinely scan servers, applications, endpoints and network devices for vulnerabilities. All issues identified as critical, high or medium risks are remediated in a timely manner.\n\nIn addition, we are actively involved in the international and professional communities and organizations that design the future standards that make tomorrow\u2019s digital ecosystem a safer, more secure and more privacy-friendly space, such as the United Nations International Telecommunication Union, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, the Internet Engineering Task Force, and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute.\n\nDue to an increase in high-profile cyber-attacks and to ensure the data security and privacy of our employees, customers and other stakeholders, we strive to continuously enhance our employees\u2019 awareness and knowledge of security and privacy issues by:\n\n- Conducting quarterly email phishing simulations that target a majority of our employees and provide them with crucial cybersecurity self-defense skills\n- Requiring all of our employees to complete annual data security and privacy awareness trainings that covers cybersecurity, phishing, data protection and privacy topics\n- Conducting an annual cybersecurity tabletop exercise for our employees responsible for our data security\n- Running a National Cybersecurity Awareness Month campaign in October, including providing additional guidance and resources, such as real-life phishing examples and best practices in cybersecurity and privacy, and delivering targeted training to top executives\n\nWe conduct an extensive, multi-day, real-life scenario tabletop exercise for our employees responsible for our data security to stress-test our incident-response procedures and response time. Our annual tabletop exercise requires global, cross-functional participation from our employees. We have made updates to our incident response policy based on learnings from our tabletop exercise to ensure that we continue to effectively address the growing cybersecurity threat as our company and products evolve in a fast-changing geopolitical environment.\nGovernance\nWe are committed to conducting business with integrity and maintaining the highest ethical standards. Our corporate governance framework embeds accountability at the Board and executive levels and delivers transparency to our stakeholders.\n\n**Board Governance**\n\nOur Board is led by Chairman Henry Samueli, Ph.D. and Lead Independent Director Eddy Hartenstein. Broadcom\u2019s Board is comprised of nine members. Seven of our nine directors are independent. Three of our nine directors are women, and four of our nine directors are underrepresented minorities, pursuant to the Nasdaq Stock Market\u2019s listing standards.\n\nOur Board has four standing committees: Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Nominating, Environmental, Social and Governance Committee and Executive Committee.\n\nOur Board adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines that cover various topics relating to the Board and its responsibilities, such as composition, overboarding, succession, performance evaluations and operations.\n\nOne of the Board\u2019s responsibilities is to evaluate Broadcom\u2019s business risks, including climate-related risks and opportunities and cybersecurity risks, and enterprise risk management practices. Our senior management team regularly reviews and discusses with the Board these risks and enterprise risk management, the measures in place to address these risks and the effectiveness of those measures.\n\n**Board Diversity**\n\n- **ETHNIC DIVERSITY**\n  - Underrepresented Minority\n  - Caucasian\n\n- **GENDER DIVERSITY**\n  - Female\n  - Male\n\n- **INDEPENDENCE**\n  - Independent\n  - Not Independent\nEthics and Integrity\n\nThe foundation of our corporate governance framework is our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (Code) and Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy. It is important to Broadcom that our employees, officers, directors and contractors understand and comply with our Code and Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy.\n\nCode of Ethics and Business Conduct\n\nOur Code guides our employees, officers, directors and contractors in how we conduct our business and work with each other. Our Code reflects our values, standards and expectations. Complying with the Code is a condition of continued employment or engagement with Broadcom.\n\nOur Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer, who is our Compliance Officer, actively monitors and audits compliance with our Code and policies under the direction and oversight of the Audit Committee.\n\nInternal Audit, with our Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer, reports to the Audit Committee at each quarterly meeting regarding any alleged violations of our Code and actions taken to investigate, address and remediate alleged violations.\n\nEmployee Engagement on Compliance\n\nOur Compliance Team is continuously looking for ways to encourage a culture of ethical conduct and compliance.\n\nOur Global Compliance Ambassador program strengthens our compliance culture at a local level. Designated employees in our global offices serve as local Compliance Ambassadors, supporting our ethics and compliance culture in their offices and regions. Our Compliance Team regularly updates the Compliance Ambassadors on upcoming trainings, policy updates or compliance developments, so the Compliance Ambassadors can communicate and engage with the local employees on these topics.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s quarterly newsletter is sent to all employees globally and includes a compliance section. The compliance section provides an update on upcoming trainings and encourages our employees to ask questions and raise concerns, including potential violations.\n\nOur compliance toolkit provides managers with additional information on how to foster a compliance culture, including useful links to our policies, videos and presentations.\n\nReporting Concerns\n\nIf our workforce becomes aware of a potential violation of our Code, other Broadcom policies, human rights or applicable laws, it is their responsibility to report it to their manager, Human Resources or the Compliance Officer.\n\nWe provide a number of avenues to contact our Compliance Team, our Compliance Officer and the Audit Committee to report concerns or potential violations, including our Ethics and Compliance Hotline that is available in all appropriate languages and is hosted by an external firm not associated with Broadcom.\n\nThe Ethics and Compliance Hotline is available via telephone and online, and employees, contractors and any other third party can report concerns anonymously (where permitted by local law). In 2022, we received inquiries on a range of topics such as human resource matters, conflicts of interest concerns and allegations of misconduct.\n\nWe take all concerns and allegations seriously. We address them promptly, investigate to the extent necessary and take disciplinary actions as appropriate (which may include senior management discussions, employee communications, trainings, process and controls improvements and individual corrective action measures).\n\nThe Audit Committee receives information on every allegation submitted via our Ethics and Compliance Hotline, as well as reports and updates on investigations that are in progress or completed.\nFostering a Speak-Up Culture\nWe strive to create an environment where employees can speak openly about our business practices, including ESG-related matters, and we encourage our employees to ask questions and raise concerns. We have an Open Door Policy and make it very clear that retaliation for raising a concern in good faith or reporting questionable behavior or possible misconduct in good faith is prohibited.\n\nEmployee Ethical Culture Survey\nWe conduct an annual Employee Ethical Culture Survey with an external firm to better understand our employees\u2019 engagement in and perception of our ethics and compliance culture and to find areas where we can continuously improve.\n\nThrough this survey, we know that our employees are aware of our ethics and compliance program and have confidence in and trust our management. In 2022, we again scored above the external firm\u2019s company peer group benchmark in all categories that were surveyed.\n\nIN OUR 2022 EMPLOYEE ETHICAL CULTURE SURVEY\n\n95.3% believe the conduct, values and communication of our senior executives are honest and ethical.\n\n98.1% are familiar with the efforts of the compliance team.\n\n95.3% believe the communication, training and support provided by the compliance team are effective.\n\nAnti-Corruption\nWe prohibit our directors, officers, employees and anyone acting on our behalf from engaging in corruption and bribery. Our Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy is summarized in our Code, including the rules and procedures for providing or accepting gifts, meals and entertainment.\n\nInternal Audit, with our Compliance Team, regularly assess our operations for corruption risks, including conducting audits of our distributors and resellers and on our partner program. Our Compliance Team conducts anti-corruption diligence on our new suppliers, distributors and resellers before onboarding them and on companies and businesses before we acquire them.\n\nIn addition, our Compliance Team and Internal Audit work with an external firm to biennially review our anti-bribery and anti-corruption compliance program. The results and recommendations from the biennial review are discussed with the Audit Committee and reported to the Board.\n\nEthics and Compliance Trainings\nWe require our employees and contractors to complete annual trainings that support Broadcom\u2019s values and culture, including our Code, bullying and harassment prevention, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, protection of confidential information, data privacy and security, human rights, insider trading prevention, conflicts of interest and anti-competition prevention, as applicable.\n\nWe also require our employee and contractors to certify that they understand and agree to abide by the applicable Broadcom policies, including our Code and Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy, when they complete their trainings.\nIN-HOUSE PRODUCTION OF COMPLIANCE TRAININGS\n\nIn 2022, to make compliance trainings more relevant and engaging for our employees, we produced our own series of training videos \u2013 customized solely for Broadcom employees. We drafted scripts featuring our fictionalized character, Griffin Peabody, and then filmed the videos in our Broadcom office with Broadcom employees. Our goal was to make our compliance trainings fun, relevant, memorable and create a lasting impact with our employees.\n\nWe included Griffin Peabody videos on bullying, anti-corruption and insider trading in our 2022 annual compliance training to the delight of our employees.\n\nIn addition, our leaders and managers are able to select and use the other Griffin Peabody videos we created that cover a wide variety of topics, such as videos on expenses, side letters, books and records, phishing and competitive intelligence.\n\nCustomized Compliance Trainings\n\nWe provide our employees located in certain regions and working in certain business groups with additional customized in-person or video-conference trainings on specific topics such as harassment, anti-corruption, anti-competition prevention and conflicts of interest.\n\nIn addition, we provide live and online anti-corruption and compliance trainings to our partners, distributors and resellers worldwide. In 2022, we provided anti-corruption training to over 500 employees and contractors of our partners, distributors and resellers.\n\nOn an annual basis, our Compliance Team evaluates the compliance trainings and makes appropriate adjustments, based on feedback from our employees, hotline data, the annual Employee Ethical Culture Survey and other compliance trends, to provide the most relevant trainings.\n\nCOMPLIANCE TRAININGS AT FORT COLLINS\n\nIn 2022, our Compliance Team visited our largest manufacturing facility located in Fort Collins, Colorado to conduct live ethics and compliance trainings. Over the course of several days, we trained over 1,000 of our manufacturing employees in small interactive groups on ethics and compliance topics tailored to their roles and job functions.\nInvesting in our Communities\nAs part of our Connected by Broadcom mission, we engage with and support the local communities where we work and live. We are proud to support causes that are important to our employees and their communities and that promote educational opportunities in the STEM fields to help develop the next generation of engineers.\n\nHelping our Communities\n\n$1 MILLION+\nEMPLOYEE DONATIONS MATCHED\n\nThrough our employee charitable donation matching program, in 2022, we matched over $1 million in donations made by our employees to charities and non-profit organizations around the world, including donations to Second Harvest Food Bank, Unity Care, Doctors Without Borders, UNICEF and St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital.\n\nENCOURAGING BLOOD DONATIONS TO SAVE LIVES\n\nIn 2022, Broadcom and Broadcom Foundation made a joint pledge to donate $600,000 over the next three years to the San Jose Aspires program.\n\nThe San Jose Aspires program provides financial awards to high school students located in San Jose, California who will also be first generation college students. We are proud to sponsor a program that supports college-and career-readiness activities for these students.\n\nCIRCULAR ECONOMY \u2013 REPURPOSING LAPTOPS FOR A GOOD CAUSE\n\nEmployees in our Global Technology Organization have helped hundreds of students (while simultaneously reducing our environmental impact) by refurbishing and donating corporate laptop computers to educational non-profit organizations and schools. Since 2018, we have donated almost 4,000 laptop computers around the globe and gave new life and new purpose to these laptop computers.\n\nENCOURAGING BLOOD DONATIONS TO SAVE LIVES\n\nIn the face of the COVID-19 Omicron surge and at a time when blood donations declined and blood supply at blood banks dropped to critical levels, our employees at our Jitra, Malaysia manufacturing facility stepped up to help Hospital Sultanah Bahiyah Alor Setar raise bloodstock supplies. Our Jitra employees held a blood donation drive to raise awareness and encourage employees to donate, resulting in dozens of donors being qualified to donate.\nConnected by Broadcom in India\n\nSince 2018, Broadcom has donated over $4.5 million to charitable causes in India. While continuing to support the education of disadvantaged women and children in India, we expanded our focus areas in 2022. We are proud to also support environmental sustainability that focuses on water conservation and clean water and young women\u2019s health and hygiene.\n\nEducation\n\nBroadcom has partnered with various organizations to expand education opportunities throughout India to disadvantaged women and children. For example, we partner with Agastya, which provides hands-on science learning through 90 science centers and over 200 mobile and iMobile labs across 22 states in India.\n\nWe also partner with Vidya, which focuses on addressing literacy with a multifaceted approach. Vidya includes academics, vocations, mental and physical wellbeing, life skills and communication skills in its projects and initiatives at schools systems in Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Pune.\n\nGENDHER\n\nWe are supporting United Way of Bengaluru\u2019s GENDHER program which provides reproductive health and gender sensitivity education at schools, creates safe spaces for young women at schools and provides young women with feminine hygiene kits. We are proud to sponsor this important work as part of our efforts to support gender equality and education for young women.\n\nOne Billion Drops\n\nThrough United Way of Bengaluru, we are supporting the One Billion Drops program to enhance the depleting groundwater levels in and around Bengaluru by conserving rainwater. The goal of the program is to build 10,000 percolation pits and thereby conserve 1 billion liters of rainwater every year.\n\nIn addition, we are sponsoring a project to provide access to safe drinking water to villages in rural areas.\nBroadcom Foundation collaborates with community non-profit organizations, non-governmental organizations and universities worldwide to inspire and empower young people through team building, digital literacy and project-based programs that help prepare them to enter careers in STEM fields.\n\nIn 2022, Broadcom Foundation expanded the number of science fair sponsorships to connect with more students in urban and rural communities as it shifts its focus to digital literacy through the Broadcom Coding with Commitment\u2122 program.\n\nBroadcom Coding with Commitment\u2122\n\nThe Broadcom Coding with Commitment\u2122 program sponsors fifty regional science and engineering fairs and coding events to encourage using coding to solve STEM problems that impact the students\u2019 communities, such as health, sanitation, energy, climate change and other challenges outlined in the United Nations SDGs. Our employees volunteered as judges and helped award the winners of Broadcom Coding with Commitment\u2122 at Raspberry Pi Foundation\u2019s 2022 Coolest Projects Global and Broadcom MASTERS\u00ae in Washington, D.C.\n\nWith Broadcom Foundation, we also participated on a panel at the United Nations SDG Media Summit panel to discuss the Broadcom Coding with Commitment\u2122 program and highlight two of our students who code with commitment.\n\nRaspberry Pi Coding Partnership\n\nBroadcom Foundation partners with the Raspberry Pi Foundation (RPiF) as a lead sponsor in the international \u201cCoolest Projects\u201d exhibition that showcases the works of coders of all ages. This partnership helps expand access to RPiF\u2019s code clubs and coder dojos that offer online free resources, bringing greater diversity and inclusion to digital literacy by reaching more girls and underserved communities of color.\n\nIn 2022, Broadcom Foundation made a grant to the University of California, Irvine to create a Spanish speaker curriculum for RPiF code clubs and is working with RPiF to help build free Spanish language coding resources.\nAppendices\n## GRI Content Index\n\nBroadcom considered the Global Reporting Standards (Core Option) when creating this report.

Our Nominating, Environmental, Social and Governance Committee (NESG Committee) of the Board is responsible for reviewing and reporting to the Board on matters of corporate responsibility and environmental sustainability (including climate-related risks and opportunities in our business), and our public reporting on these topics. The NESG Committee receives quarterly updates from our executives on ESG matters. The feedback we receive from our stakeholders on ESG matters is also regularly communicated to the NESG Committee and the Board. On a quarterly basis, the NESG Committee updates the Board on ESG matters. In addition, our Audit Committee of the Board has oversight responsibility for enterprise risk management at Broadcom. Enterprise risks are updated and discussed with the Audit Committee on an annual basis with additional updates provided for select risks throughout the year. | ESG Governance |\n| b) Describe management\u2019s role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities | Our ESG Steering Committee is led by the President of our Semiconductor Solutions Group who reports to our Chief Executive Officer. Our ESG Steering Committee includes our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer and senior leaders in Global Operations (including supply chain and procurement), Human Resources, Legal and Workplace Services. The ESG Steering Committee meets quarterly and is responsible for preparing the ESG Report, providing status updates to the NESG Committee and engaging with our ESG Working Groups who champion our ESG initiatives across Broadcom on behalf of the ESG Steering Committee. We currently have three main ESG Working Groups that focus on diversity, equity and inclusion, environmental sustainability and human rights/supply chain issues and initiatives. | ESG Governance |\na) Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the organization has identified over the short, medium, and long term.\n\nb) Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization\u2019s businesses, strategy, and financial planning.\n\nc) Describe the resilience of the organization\u2019s strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including under a 2\u00b0C or lower scenario.\n\nFor purposes of climate-related risk and opportunities, Broadcom defines short, medium and long-term time horizons as follows:\n\n- **Short-term:** 0-5 years\n- **Medium-term:** 5-10 years\n- **Long-term:** 10-15 years\n\n**CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS**\n\nWe have not identified any inherent climate-related risks with the potential to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on our business in the short, medium or long-term. Potential physical risks in our supply chain are considered and integrated into our Global Operations Business Continuity Plans. In addition, our response to the COVID-19 pandemic has shown our resilience to potential physical risks to our operations, including our employees\u2019 ability to work remotely if needed. Our company risk-factors are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n**CLIMATE-RELATED OPPORTUNITIES**\n\nWe have identified areas of climate-related opportunities for our business, including:\n\n- **Products and Markets** - Developing new products, as well as evolving existing products, through research, development and innovation has the potential to increase revenue through higher demand for our products and access to new and emerging markets. A key focus is to develop optimized products for each market segment, providing the right combination of high performance and low power consumption. Our engineers use leading-edge process technology and low-power designs to develop innovative methods of minimizing power consumption in our products for our customers.\n\n  For example, reducing GNSS power consumption is crucial to extending the battery life of phones, smart watches and tablets. Our BCM4778, the world\u2019s lowest power L1/L5 GNSS receiver chip, consumes five times less power, increasing the battery lifetime on a smart watch by 30 hours, compared to the previous generation chip.\n\n  In addition, as the world moves toward green energy systems and away from fossil fuels, our industrial products continue to help support these green energy systems. We provide a wide range of industrial fiber optic transceiver, isolated gate driver, isolation amplifier and digital optocoupler products, which are used in wind turbines and solar energy systems. These products support various functions inside these green energy systems, including power conversion, electrical current/voltage sensing, battery bank charging and system control and status communications.\n\n- **Resource Efficiency** - We strive to use our resources in the most efficient manner possible. We have implemented a number of projects across the company, which have the effect of reducing our environmental impact and increasing our resource efficiency. These efficiencies, including site consolidation and energy and water usage efficiencies, result in reduced operating costs. We will continue to look for ways to further increase our operational efficiency, while reducing our environmental impact.\n\nWe have not conducted a formal scenario analysis, but will continue to assess approaches for incorporating climate scenario analysis into our existing risk and opportunity assessment processes.\n### Risk Management: Disclose how the organization identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks\n\n| TCFD Recommendation | Broadcom Disclosure | Disclosure Location |\n|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| a) Describe the organization\u2019s processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks | As part of our enterprise risk management processes, various risks are assessed across the company by the relevant stakeholders and in collaboration with our Internal Audit Team, as needed. Actual and potential risks, including the risk factors in our periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are reviewed by management and the Audit Committee at least quarterly. Updates for select risks are also provided to the Audit Committee throughout the year. In addition, on an annual basis, enterprise risks are updated and discussed with the Board and/or the relevant committees of the Board, including the Audit Committee which has oversight responsible for enterprise risk management at Broadcom. | Annual Report on Form 10-K; ESG Governance |\n| b) Describe the organization\u2019s processes for managing climate-related risks | We manage actual and potential enterprise risks through various processes, policies and mitigation activities. For example, our Global Operations, which includes our procurement and supply chain activities, use detailed Business Continuity Plans to manage potential climate-related interruptions to its operations, among other risks. All of our global sites have Site Control Plans, which provide our response plans in the event of various emergency situations, including climate-related weather events, like wildfires, hurricanes, floods and blizzards. We also proactively engage with our stakeholders to understand the potential impacts of both changing regulatory requirements and changing stakeholder expectations, including our stockholders, customers, employees and local communities where we do business. | |\n| c) Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organization\u2019s overall risk management | | |\n\n### Metrics and Targets: Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant climate-related risks and opportunities where such information is material\n\n| TCFD Recommendation | Broadcom Disclosure | Disclosure Location |\n|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| a) Disclose the metrics used by the organization to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process | Refer to the Environment section of this report for GHG emissions, energy use and water use data, as well as our GHG emissions reduction target. | Environment |\n| b) Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the related risks | | |\n| c) Describe the targets used by the organization to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets | | |\n## Diversity Metrics\n\n### U.S. Employees (Race/Ethnicity)\n\n| Race/Ethnicity                  | 2022  | 2021  | 2020  |\n|---------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| American Indian/Alaska Native   | 0.3%  | 0.2%  | 0.2%  |\n| Asian                           | 40.3% | 39.6% | 38.8% |\n| Black/African American          | 1.5%  | 1.4%  | 1.3%  |\n| Hispanic/Latinx                 | 3.6%  | 3.4%  | 3.3%  |\n| Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander| 0.2%  | 0.2%  | 0.3%  |\n| Other/not declared              | 5.7%  | 5.9%  | 7.6%  |\n| Two or more                     | 1.1%  | 1.0%  | 0.9%  |\n| White/Caucasian                 | 47.5% | 48.2% | 47.7% |\n\n### U.S. People Managers (Race/Ethnicity)\n\n| Race/Ethnicity                  | 2022  | 2021  | 2020  |\n|---------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| American Indian/Alaska Native   | 0.1%  | 0.1%  | 0.1%  |\n| Asian                           | 39.0% | 38.9% | 38.3% |\n| Black/African American          | 0.8%  | 0.9%  | 1.0%  |\n| Hispanic/Latinx                 | 3.1%  | 3.0%  | 2.8%  |\n| Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander| 0.1%  | 0.1%  | 0.2%  |\n| Other/not declared              | 4.4%  | 4.5%  | 5.9%  |\n| Two or more                     | 0.6%  | 0.7%  | 0.4%  |\n| White/Caucasian                 | 51.9% | 51.8% | 51.4% |\n\n### Global Employees (Gender)\n\n| Gender | 2022  | 2021  | 2020  |\n|--------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Male   | 79.3% | 79.2% | 78.8% |\n| Female | 20.7% | 20.8% | 21.1% |\n\n### Global People Managers (Gender)\n\n| Gender | 2022  | 2021  | 2020  |\n|--------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Male   | 86.1% | 86.5% | 85.5% |\n| Female | 13.9% | 13.5% | 14.5% |\nEnvironmental Metrics\n\nFor all environmental metrics, we apply an operational control boundary. We use the methodology outlined in the World Resource Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development\u2019s (WBCSD) GHG Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) and the WRI/WBSCD\u2019s GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance \u2013 an amendment to the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard to calculate Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions generated by our global facilities.\n\nWe calculate the GHG emissions associated with the fossil fuels we utilize for heating our facilities and operating our backup emergency generators, as well as the refrigerant losses from HVAC operations and PFCs and other process gases used in our manufacturing processes (Scope 1 emissions). The GHG Protocol defines PFCs as one of the seven gases listed in the Kyoto Protocol, which also includes carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, HFCs, sulfur hexafluoride and nitrogen trifluoride.\n\nTo measure the other indirect emissions occurring in our value chain, we used the methodology outlined in the WRI/WBSCD\u2019s GHG Protocol: Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions (version 1.0).\n\nGHG emissions are reported in metric tonnes of CO\u2082e (tCO\u2082e).\n\nFuel and Energy Consumption Table\n\n- The 2021 historical data and associated Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions have been restated due to improvements in data availability.\n- Our energy consumption is limited to natural gas, diesel, liquefied petroleum gas, kerosene and electricity use.\n- We calculate energy consumption and GHG emissions based on actual data when available. When actual consumption data is not available, we estimate utilizing square footage intensity factors by facility type.\n- Other fuels include diesel, liquefied petroleum gas and kerosene.\n\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions Table\n\n- The 2021 historical data and associated Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions have been restated due to improvements in data availability.\n- Emission factors used in Scope 1 emissions calculations include the U.S. EPA\u2019s Climate Leaders, Emissions Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories (published April 2022). Specific to PFC emissions, the IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR) guidance was used.\n- Emission factors used in Scope 2 GHG emissions calculations include the U.S. EPA\u2019s Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID) 2020 (published February 2022), IEA\u2019s Statistics Data Service: Emission Factors (published September 2022) and the Association of Issuing Bodies (AIB): European Residual Mixes 2021 (published June 2022) Residual Mix factors. In 2022, Scope 2 emissions take into account the procurement of Green-e certified RECs at the Fort Collins, Colorado facility. We follow the hierarchy outlined in Table 6.3 of the WRI/WBSCD GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance for selecting appropriate emission factors for Scope 2 market-based method. Scope 2 emissions include colocation data center electricity consumption, estimated using a 8760 energy model.\n- Emissions from Fuel-and-Energy-Related-Activities (Scope 3, Category 3) capture emissions from fuel and energy (market-based) consumption not already included in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions calculations. Grid loss percentages and emission factors are from the U.S. EPA\u2019s eGRID 2020 (published February 2022) for U.S. locations and the IEA (published September 2022) for international locations. International grid loss percentages are from the World Bank Electric Power Transmission and Distribution Losses.\n- Emissions factors used in the calculation of emissions from Scope 3 Categories 5-7 include the U.S. EPA\u2019s Climate Leaders, Emissions Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories (published April 2022), and 2021 (published January 2022) Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (\u201cDEFRA\u201d).\n- The waste emissions boundary includes data outlined in the Waste Management section: non-hazardous waste from global owned facilities, e-scrap waste from global owned and leased facilities, and hazardous waste data from global manufacturing facilities.\n- We exclude activity data related to hotel nights incurred during business travel from Scope 3 Category 6.\n- Employee commuting emissions are calculated by multiplying average commute distances by emission factors from typical transportation modes. We currently exclude emissions related to remote working (optional emissions) from Scope 3 Category 7. Emissions factors used in the calculation of Scope 3 Category 7 include the U.S. EPA\u2019s eGRID 2020 (published February 2022), and the U.S. EPA\u2019s Climate Leaders, Emissions Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories (published April 2022).\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis report contains forward-looking statements and are based on our current expectations, beliefs and assumptions.
