For 45 years that mission has remained steadfast, and so has our commitment to acting as a responsible corporate citizen. We believe this is as important as ever and we focus our efforts under four key pillars:\n\n- Our Workplace\n- Environmental Sustainability\n- Our Communities\n- Responsible Business\n\nMany of our corporate responsibility reporting initiatives take into consideration various global standards and reporting frameworks. For example, we have reviewed and incorporated a number of relevant human rights standards enunciated by international organizations, such as the United Nations and the International Labour Organization, into our Global Social Compliance Program. We also map our global corporate responsibility report to certain frameworks, including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, the International Sustainability Standards Board\u2019s SASB standards, and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs). In addition, we have responded to the CDP Climate Change Questionnaire since 2010.\n\nOur Global Corporate Responsibility Executive Steering Committee reviews and considers our corporate responsibility efforts from a cross-functional and cross-divisional perspective. In doing so, the Committee, among other things, guides corporate responsibility strategies to align them with TJX business priorities, supports our global corporate responsibility efforts across functions and geographies, facilitates corporate responsibility information exchange, recommends additional program efforts, and, through the Committee\u2019s executive sponsor, periodically reports on our progress to the Company\u2019s senior management and Board of Directors. The committee is led by a Senior Executive Vice President (SEVP), Group President, who, among his other duties, provides management oversight of TJX\u2019s environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives.\n\nWe think of our global corporate responsibility program as ever evolving, and we are pleased to present our continued progress here. Corporate responsibility has been part of the fabric of who we are from day one, and we strive to make a meaningful impact on the world, with our efforts reflecting our core values of honesty, integrity, and treating each other with dignity and respect.\n\n\u201cIt is clear to us that our commitment to continuing to develop and implement meaningful environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices is as important as ever. It\u2019s what we believe our customers, communities, and other stakeholders expect of us\u2014and it\u2019s what we demand of ourselves.\u201d\n\nERNIE HERRMAN\nChief Executive Officer and President\nAt TJX, our global corporate responsibility efforts are part of the fabric of who we are and reflect our core values of honesty, integrity, and treating each other with dignity and respect. We are proud of our accomplishments \u2013 both those achieved this year and in years past. At the same time, we recognize that corporate responsibility is a journey. We remain passionate about continuously improving our programs and working to make a positive, sustainable impact on the world. After all, we believe that the real value we bring to the world is as important as what we sell. Please note that references to items accomplished or completed throughout this report denote TJX\u2019s Fiscal 2022, which ended January 29, 2022.\nLETTER FROM ERNIE HERRMAN\n\nTO OUR ASSOCIATES, CUSTOMERS, NEIGHBORS, VENDORS, AND SHAREHOLDERS:\n\nAt TJX, our mission to deliver great value to our customers every day drives everything we do. We strive to be a good corporate citizen, balancing what\u2019s right for the company and the broad range of our stakeholders\u2019 priorities.\n\nToday\u2019s challenges are many\u2014our world is still struggling with a global pandemic, social injustice, war, the threat of climate change, and so much more. It is clear to us that our commitment to continuing to develop and implement meaningful environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices is as important as ever. It\u2019s what we believe our customers, communities, and other stakeholders expect of us\u2014and it\u2019s what we demand of ourselves.\n\nI am so proud of our ever-evolving global corporate responsibility programming, which has been part of the fabric of who we are for 45 years. Our reporting is organized around the pillars where we believe we can make a significant difference for our stakeholders \u2013 Workplace, Communities, Environmental Sustainability, and Responsible Business. Our work in these areas helps us contribute towards the ongoing development, implementation, and evolution of meaningful initiatives and practices across our operations designed to be inclusive and more sustainable and that demonstrate our commitments and progress to operate our off-price business responsibly.\n\nFor example, in April 2022, we announced plans to expand and accelerate our goals as part of our ongoing environmental sustainability strategy. The new goals focus on climate and energy, waste, and product packaging, including a plan to achieve net zero emissions in our global operations by 2040.\n\nAdditionally, we are committed to continuing to build a more inclusive and diverse workplace where our Associates feel welcome, valued, and engaged. In Fiscal 2022, we completed a global inclusion and diversity survey of our Associates and used the findings to help define three core areas of focus for our work moving forward: increase the representation of diverse Associates along our talent pipeline; equip leaders with the tools to support difference with awareness, fairness, sensitivity, and transparency; and empower all Associates to integrate inclusive behaviors, language, and practices in how we work together and understand our role and responsibility in inclusion.\n\nAs we work toward making ongoing progress, we expect corporate responsibility will continue to be a valuable part of how we do business. We look forward to continuing to report on our efforts and progress in our annual Global Corporate Responsibility Report, in addition to the rolling updates on our efforts that we share on TJX.com. As always, I want to thank our global Associates for their efforts, hard work, and dedication to TJX.\n\nSincere regards,\n\nErnie Herrman\nChief Executive Officer and President\nThe TJX Companies, Inc.\nFY22 AWARDS & RECOGNITION\n\nBARRON'S\nMost Sustainable Companies 2022\n\nForbes 2022\nCANADA'S BEST EMPLOYERS\nPOWERED BY STATISTA\n\nForbes 2022\nTHE BEST EMPLOYERS FOR DIVERSITY\nPOWERED BY STATISTA\n\nCollegeGrad.com\nTop 100 Entry Level Employer\n\nCollegeGrad.com\nTop 50 Intern Employer\n\nBlack of Journal\n\nHISPANIC network\n\nProfessional WOMANS magazine\n\nThe JobCrowd\nTOP COMPANY\nFOR APPRENTICES TO WORK FOR 2021/22\n\nFTSE4Good\nASSOCIATES BRING OUR BUSINESS TO LIFE\n\nAssociates bring our business to life, and we aim to support them by making TJX a terrific place to work. It\u2019s very important for us to attract talented individuals, teach them our off-price model, and support their careers. We are also very proud of our culture and are committed to our core values of honesty, integrity, and treating each other with dignity and respect. In fact, developing talent and championing our culture have been global business priorities year in and year out. We believe this encourages many Associates to join us not just to find a job, but to build a career.\n\nInclusion and diversity have long been a priority at TJX, and we are continuing our work to do more.\n\nThe diversity of our Associates makes us a stronger Company and better able to serve our broad and diverse base of customers around the world. We strive for an inclusive workplace where our Associates feel welcome when they walk in the door; valued for their diversity of thought, background, and experience; and engaged with our mission to deliver great value to our customers every day. Our programming is grounded in the understanding that inclusion welcomes a range of differing backgrounds, opinions, and perspectives. Our decades-long, open door philosophy not only supports, but encourages this. We embrace that our workforce encompasses people of different races, ethnicities, ages, sexual orientations, gender identities, abilities, experiences, religions, and much more, who come together to move our business forward. As a business, we do not tolerate discrimination or hate of any kind. We believe every one of us can play a part in helping to build a better world.\nWORKPLACE INITIATIVES\n\nWe report our efforts to make TJX a terrific place to work around the following areas:\n\nFY22 HIGHLIGHTS\n\n- **68%** of people in managerial positions globally were women\n- **63%** of managerial positions in stores and field offices were filled by internal promotions\n- **23,000+** attendance in Global Leadership Curriculum courses since 2017\n- **80%** of promotions globally were earned by women\n- **35%** of people in managerial positions in the U.S. were people of color\n- **49%** of promotions in the U.S. were earned by people of color\nEXTERNAL RECOGNITION\n\nWe\u2019re proud of what we are doing. However, we are striving to move our programs forward with a goal of continuous improvement. Below are some distinctions our work has received:\n\n/ In 2022, Forbes Magazine listed TJX among America\u2019s Best Employers for Diversity and Canada\u2019s Best Employers. Additionally, in 2021, TJX was included on Forbes\u2019 Best Employers for Women list.\n\n/ In 2022, TJX was named a Best of the Best Employer by Black EOE Journal, Hispanic Network Magazine, and Professional Woman\u2019s Magazine.\n\n/ TJX scored 90 on the 2021 Corporate Equality Index of the U.S.-based Human Rights Campaign.\n\n/ For the seventh consecutive year, TJX Europe was recognized by TheJobCrowd, receiving first place for Top Graduate Programmes in Retail in 2021, and for the fifth consecutive year received first place by TheJobCrowd for Best Apprentice ship Programme in Retail in 2021.\n\n/ T.K. Maxx Germany was listed as One of the Most Desirable Employers in Germany by the F.A.Z. Institute in 2021.\n\n/ 2021 U.K. GENDER PAY GAP STATEMENT\nRECRUITMENT\n\nATTRACTING TOMORROW\u2019S LEADERS, TODAY\n\nAs a Fortune 100 company, operating nearly 4,700 stores in nine countries, the need to attract, develop, and retain talent is crucial to support our growth. We are continually looking for diverse, enthusiastic, and dedicated individuals to join our team, and we remain committed to building our internal talent pipeline to develop Associates into our global leaders for tomorrow.\n\nWe take a multi-faceted approach to recruiting to reach potential candidates with diversity of races, ethnicities, ages, sexual orientations, gender identities, abilities, experiences, and much more. We are also committed to hiring locally from the communities we serve.\n\nBuilding a More Diverse Workplace\n\nBuilding a more diverse talent pipeline is a priority for TJX. In recent years, we have scaled up the use of tools and internal diversity trainings to support our recruiting efforts. In fiscal 2022, leaders across our recruitment teams participated in unconscious bias training to help us continue creating an inclusive recruitment process. Additionally, we have implemented a new tool in the U.S., Canada, and Europe in an effort to reduce potential unconscious biases in job descriptions and other recruitment communications and to identify language that may inadvertently undermine our inclusion efforts. We also benchmark periodically against peers to better understand how we can leverage opportunities to expand awareness of TJX and our available jobs among diverse audiences.\n\nWe are actively pursuing opportunities to increase minority candidate representation when we recruit for early career positions. In the U.S., we have enhanced our outreach to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and partner with diverse on-campus organizations for recruitment events. We have developed and expanded relationships with several non-profit partners focused on increasing opportunities for underrepresented students, such as Leadership Enterprise for a Diverse America (LEDA), The Posse Foundation, and Girls Who Code. In Europe, we recruit from a diverse pool of candidates for our Graduate, Placement, and Apprenticeship Programmes and partner with organizations such as The Prince\u2019s Trust, the UK Government\u2019s Department for Work and Pensions, and the UWV in the Netherlands to create career opportunities for disadvantaged young people, including many from underrepresented communities. Globally, we continue to broaden our relationships with schools, universities, and smaller colleges to widen our reach.\n\nWe are also committed to working toward increasing the representation of diverse candidates in management-level positions, including people of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, people with disabilities, and women. In certain U.S. markets, we are also considering ways to better align the diversity of our Field\nManagement teams to reflect the demographics of the community being served.\n\n**ENHANCING EXECUTIVE DIVERSITY POLICY STATEMENT**\n\nAt TJX, we believe that the continuity and stability of our most senior leadership team, which includes decades of off-price retail and TJX experience, has been a critical factor for our success. We are also proud of our culture that prioritizes Associate development and advancement within our organization. We are working to build a more diverse pipeline of talent to support our efforts to improve the diversity at all levels of our organization.\n\nConsistent with our inclusion and diversity efforts, in March 2021, our Board approved a policy that, in the event that our Board commences a search for a Chief Executive Officer from outside TJX, or if our management commences a search for an executive-level role reporting directly to the CEO from outside TJX, the initial list of candidates will include qualified female and racially/ethnically diverse candidates. If our Board or our management engages a third-party firm for such a search, that firm will be instructed to include qualified female and racially/ethnically diverse candidates in the initial list of candidates provided to TJX.\n\n**On-Campus Recruiting: From Their Campus to Ours**\n\nHistorically, several hundred students each year have taken part in TJX internship and co-op programs operating across our divisions worldwide, in areas including Merchandising, Finance, Human Resources, Information Technology, Store Operations, Distribution Services, and more. We seek candidates who are curious and have a passion for innovation, relationship building, strategic thinking, and global relations.\n\nOur merchandising internships and co-ops are coveted among many students, especially those who have a passion for various aspects of the retail industry. Globally, many participants in these programs join us full-time after completing their college requirements.\n\n**Proudly Hiring Those Who Have Served in the U.S. Military**\n\nOur long-standing commitment to the U.S. Armed Forces is highlighted by our dedication to hiring veterans and military service members, including active Guard and Reserve, as well as their spouses. We value their strong work ethic, professionalism, and loyalty and offer a range of career options to match their talents and expertise.\n\nTJX has several initiatives supporting military hiring, including participating in career fairs for military personnel and working with military job boards to increase exposure and marketing efforts to military personnel and their families. The company also keeps in touch with current and prospective candidates through our military talent community page and email campaigns.\n\nWe are pleased to report that we have hired more than 10,200 Associates who are members of the military, veterans, or their spouses since 2013.\nCreating Personal and Professional Opportunities\n\nFor nearly a quarter of a century, TJX has been working to provide employment and training opportunities to individuals with varying levels of skills and abilities, including those who face barriers to employment or are in underserved communities. We have developed community outreach strategies to help us foster a diverse workforce that includes qualified individuals with a breadth of abilities.\n\nTeams in the U.S. and Europe participate in innovative youth programs which offer personal and professional development opportunities for disadvantaged or vulnerable young people. In fiscal 2022, TJX in the U.S. launched a program called Community Referred Associates, which is dedicated to creating training and employment opportunities for individuals that may have had difficulty with obtaining longer-term employment opportunities in the past. As part of the program, TJX has partnered with several community-based organizations to offer temporary, 90-day roles focused on job training and aims to transition eligible participants to a part- or full-time Associate. TJX also continues partnering with Junior Achievement in the U.S and supports the organization in providing work readiness, entrepreneurship, and financial literacy skills for young people. Through this connection, TJX Associates have the opportunity to volunteer in local Junior Achievement programs.\n\nTJX Europe has a long-standing commitment to help vulnerable children and young people achieve their potential in local communities. In fiscal 2022, TJX Europe launched a partnership with the U.K. government\u2019s Kickstart Scheme to support young people aged 16-24 through six-month work placements and training at T.K. Maxx and Homesense stores across England, Wales, and Scotland. More than 500 young people have enrolled in this program since it began in September 2021, committing to 25 hours of work experience and on-the-job skills training per week, coupled with employability training and resources provided in partnership with The Prince\u2019s Trust. With a combination of work experience and trainings, the program aims to help young people secure sustained employment when their Kickstart placement ends.\n\nTo support its field recruitment efforts, our Canadian team partners with various organizations through our Find Your Stride charitable initiative, which aims to help women get the skills and support they need to move forward. Through our partnership with the Calgary Women in Need Society, we support the TJX Retail Ready Program\u2014an eight-week program that provides in-class training, on-the-floor retail experience, and mock interview support to help prepare women for careers in retail.\n\nIn the U.S., TJX partners with Best Buddies International, a nonprofit organization dedicated to creating opportunities for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Our teams partner closely with Best Buddies volunteers and participants to find roles in our T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods, Sierra, and Homesense stores that match the job seeker\u2019s interests and talents. To date, we\u2019ve been excited to hire more than 250 Best Buddies participants to serve in a variety of functions at our stores, including cashiers, dressing room attendants, greeters, merchandise organizers, and product assemblers, and are working to expand opportunities within our offices and distribution centers.\nMAKING A DIFFERENCE: SUPPORTING YOUNG PEOPLE THROUGH THE PRINCE\u2019S TRUST\u2019S PROGRAMS\n\nTJX Europe has worked with The Prince\u2019s Trust since 2014, supporting young people through the \u201cAchieve\u201d and \u201cGet Into\u201d programs in the U.K. Since 2016, Homesense has helped over 2,700 young people who are at risk of struggling with, or who may have been excluded from, mainstream education by supporting The Prince\u2019s Trust\u2019s Achieve program. Achieve is for those aged 11-19 and is designed to help young people boost confidence, develop new skills, and effectively work in teams. Meanwhile, as one of the largest partners of the Get into Retail program, we are proud to have engaged with over 1,500 young people since the program began in 2013. Get into Retail provides training, development, and employment opportunities for successful participants, and approximately 70% of our Get into Retail participants have gone on to secure roles with us. In addition to these programs, our Loss Prevention team partners with The Prince\u2019s Trust to help disadvantaged young people who face adversity to create new futures for themselves through the Get Into Loss Prevention program.\n\nWARDAH\u2019S STORY\n\n\u201cHaving only very recently moved to UK, I felt that I had no relevant experience. I was very shy and reluctant to even leave the house. My social life was non-existent, and I was becoming more reliant on my husband to be my only source of a social life, which was nice of course for a time! However, it isn\u2019t practical in the long run. I had no sense of routine or activity, and this played a huge role in diminishing my mental health.\n\n\u201cI had an incredible, life-changing experience on this programme with The Prince\u2019s Trust. It really promoted my physical health and mental well-being, I met some incredible people working in T.K. Maxx which has helped to increase my social life and I have made a best friend for life from this course! Since taking part in the virtual online workshops, I have noticed within myself: increased confidence, public speaking, and time management. In my personal life I feel that I have gained my independence here in Manchester for the first time. I have been using public transport to get to work but also I was able to get a train to visit my family for Eid celebrations, something I have not been able to do up until now, without the help of my husband.\n\n\u201cI have become so much more confident; I used to be so hesitant to go out. I now have the confidence in my experiences on programme to put myself out there for other opportunities!\u201d\n\n\u2014 Wardah, Get Into Retail participant with T.K. Maxx & Homesense, Manchester\nCAREER DEVELOPMENT\n\nAttracting talent is just the start. At TJX, we believe our Associates are core to our success and, as such, it is our responsibility to train and mentor them. Our senior leaders consider teaching and mentoring an absolute priority to support the career development of our Associates.\n\nTraining happens throughout the organization and in a variety of settings, including in our stores, distribution and processing centers, and corporate offices. Some is formal, through courses offered in our classrooms and virtually, and some is informal, such as in huddles or through real-time feedback on the job. Like so many aspects of our work, training had to be reimagined with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. It has been important to us to maintain our commitment to talent development while navigating changes to our work environments. As a result, we have been approaching our learning opportunities differently, offering many formal training classes online and connecting remote Associates through virtual formats. No matter the location or format, formal or informal, our career development initiatives are designed to foster open communication and relationship building, which are both key parts of our culture.\n\nDevelopment Programs\n\nOur Leadership Development Toolkit has defined leadership competencies and cultural factors which help express our organizational values and promote consistency in leadership development. In fiscal 2022, we included new leadership competency and cultural factors focused on inclusion-based values and behaviors, which we are working to incorporate into our Toolkit over the coming year. We strongly believe that these competencies and factors benefit our business overall.\n\nOne of our goals is to foster career growth across the organization, and we are proud that in fiscal 2022, 63% of managerial positions in our stores and field offices were filled with internal promotions. Additionally, we believe that our development programs support Associates in building a career at TJX, and, in fact, 40% of people in managerial positions around the world have been at the company for 10 or more years.\n\nOur Global Leadership Curriculum is designed to offer a consistent development experience focused around our leadership competencies and cultural factors. With core and elective courses, this curriculum helps Associates gain skills in communications, achieving results, interpersonal dynamics, and more. We are currently reviewing and updating the courses to further align our leadership courses with our inclusion\nand diversity efforts. Since 2017, the Global Leadership Curriculum has had Associate attendance of more than 23,000 across all of our divisions. Our aim is to develop the potential of Associates at every level, from hourly Associates to management and beyond, so they may enjoy fulfilling careers. This year, additional programs were added to provide development for higher levels of leadership that focused on successfully transitioning and taking on new and expanded leadership responsibilities. To further extend the availability of learning opportunities, we also made available a Global Online Learning Library of over 2,000 digital, self-paced learning resources.\n\nIn addition to our Global Leadership Curriculum courses, we offer many other learning and development opportunities. Our global Emerging Leaders program is designed to help high potential Associates at the managerial level prepare to expand their leadership roles. The process consists of targeted assessments, review of feedback, and the creation of an individual development plan. Once completed, these Associates have the opportunity to participate in the Emerging Leader Action Learning, a seven month-long journey focusing on the skills needed to effectively grow from a leader of others to a leader of leaders. Participants are placed on cross-functional teams, assigned self-directed learning, participate in peer coaching, and spend time with executives, who share their stories and experiences. The program consists of critical skills training and business case scenarios, and it culminates in the Associate creating a personalized growth plan. We are also proud to have launched a mentorship pilot in fiscal 2022, which aims to connect Associates with leaders in our organization and to subsequently foster their development.\n\nMore senior-level Associates may participate in our Global Strategic Leadership program\u2014an 11-month, global development program designed to accelerate leadership readiness. The program offers a variety of opportunities, including gaining exposure to different leaders, TJX businesses, and business units. Participants receive feedback on their leadership style and interactions throughout the process, with the goal of incorporating those learnings into their leadership style. Participants learn to navigate the organization, build strategic planning skills, and deepen their understanding of the business and of themselves as leaders.\n\nIn Canada, our goal is to equip, empower, and enable our Associates to own their development in partnership with their manager. We host a National Learning Calendar that provides virtual workshops focusing on professional and leadership development, a vast set of online learning offerings, and a digital library. In our Home Office and distribution centers, a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d website provides support for building development plans, learning about our off-price business model, and enhancing personal growth through curated learning and augmented by storytelling from our Associates and leaders. We are excited to bring our \u201cBe Your Best Self\u201d developmental focus to stores this year with a focus on inspirational Associate videos, promotion highlights, and leadership messaging that supports our tuition assistance, scholarship, and other career development programs.\n\nTJX Canada also offers targeted training for many new and existing Associates to support their deepening business and leadership capabilities. These programs include Manager in Training (MIT) in our stores and district offices and tiered onboarding programs in Distribution Services. Our focus on \u201caccessible development for all\u201d means providing the tools and support Associates need to drive their career.\n\n\u201cBe Your Best Self\u201d is also our learning philosophy in Europe. TJX Europe aims to enable our Associates to own and drive their development journey, recognizing that this is as unique as each and every one of us. We offer Associates a range of learning and development options to provide skills and off-price knowledge through workshops, development programs, training, on-the-job learning, and the Graduate, Placement, and Apprenticeship Programmes. We also offer tools for self-learning and provide bespoke coaching for Regional, Country, District, Store, and Assistant Managers.\nIn addition, TJX Europe\u2019s Leader in Me program is designed to accelerate the leadership readiness of managers who show potential for more senior roles. Associates learn more about themselves as leaders, as well as how to use these leadership skills in their current roles and for future opportunities. We also have a Senior Leadership Development program in Europe for Vice Presidents and Assistant Vice Presidents, which cultivates leaders who champion and bring our distinctive culture to life. The program develops skills to help leaders thrive in unpredictable circumstances. Participants gain insight into themselves as authentic leaders and gain self-awareness, personal sustainability, and leadership perspective. We recently expanded this program to include specific workshops on inclusion and diversity. We believe the program builds stronger, more collaborative teams across the organization and elevates the capability of our senior leaders.\n\nIn Australia, corporate and processing center Associates can participate in the Be Your Best Self program, a self-led curriculum that enables Associates to drive their own development. Through various tools and manager support, participants are able to discover new skills and interests to assist them in developing a career path, whether that means growing in their current role, or exploring opportunities cross-functionally.\n\n**Merchant Training and TJX University**\n\nWe are particularly proud of our merchant training programs around the world, which we believe are some of the best and most respected in the retail industry. Our programs are designed to support Associates interested in pursuing careers as merchants and develop them as future leaders in our off-price retail business. The merchandising career path provides structured growth potential in Merchandise Planning and Allocation and Merchandise Buying, as well as potential management opportunities. The path consists of an initial, intensive training curriculum for a role as an Allocation Analyst. Afterwards, there are ongoing development opportunities and mentoring throughout the Associate\u2019s career.\n\nWe are also proud to run TJX University, where we offer merchandising Associates learning opportunities through a two-year-long, one-on-one coaching program. The program includes mentoring on negotiation skills, store exercises, and a curated curriculum to both further their development in their current role and prepare them for the next step in their careers. The coaching may take place in-person or virtually in a group learning environment, in our stores, or in the marketplace. The University has a global reach to our merchants around the world. Our focus is to teach a consistent approach to our off-price business model, negotiating fundamentals, and building strong relationships\u2014all of which have been a critical part of our success.\n\nFor some of the buyers and merchandising managers identified as having potential to rise to a leadership level, we offer a specialized learning experience called the Off-Price Leadership Center (OPLC). It brings together Associates from across our global divisions to get exposure to the critical merchant and leadership skills necessary for success. OPLC\u2019s focus is on understanding the role; integrating strategic, business, and critical relationship skills; and building a diverse, global leadership perspective.\n\n**External Partnerships**\n\nIn addition to our many internal development opportunities, we have established relationships with a variety of organizations to offer additional resources and learning. In the U.S., this includes National Hispanic Corporate Council, Catalyst, Diversity Best Practices, PFLAG, National Association of Asian American Professionals, Human Rights Campaign, and others. Our Associates also have the opportunity to participate in programs offered by some of our partner organizations. We belong to Conexi\u00f3n in Boston,\nMassachusetts, and, on a U.S. national level, The Partnership. Conexi\u00f3n pairs Hispanic/Latino Associates with a seasoned mentor at organizations in various industries and provides workshops in leadership. The Partnership offers year-long programs in leadership and cultural navigation for Associates, as well as the Next Generation Executive Program, a five-month training course. We actively bring together Associate alumni of both programs to build a network that can support participants and encourage learning. In 2020, a number of Associates had the opportunity to participate in an external leadership program designed for Black executives and early-mid-career managers. Additionally, in 2020, TJX Europe became members of the Business Disability Forum to support our efforts to help those who face barriers to employment thrive at work.\n\nCHANTAE'S STORY\n\nChantae joined TJX in 2009 as a General Warehouse Associate for our Marmaxx division\u2014first as a temporary hire and promoted to a full-time Associate shortly thereafter. During her time, she demonstrated potential and an eagerness to learn and grow, taking on multiple roles and finding mentors who believed in her and pushed her to seek out growth opportunities. As she developed her career, Chantae ultimately made her way to the Human Resources division, where she currently serves as Learning and Development Manager and leads a team of five across three distribution centers.\n\n\u201cI came in the door looking for a job and I found a career. So many people have encouraged me along the way, pushing me to act on my potential. Being part of Learning and Development has been life changing\u2014not only for my professional growth but also personally. I have stepped completely out of my comfort zone, met and built relationships with lots of great people, and found it really rewarding to support others\u2019 growth. There is so much talent on our floors. There\u2019s a world of opportunity at TJX for those who want to find it.\u201d\n\nChantae\nLearning & Development Manager\nT.J. Maxx Distribution Center Charlotte\nOUR COMMITMENT TO INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY\n\nDiversity Presents Itself in Many Ways\n\nAt TJX, inclusion and diversity have been an important part of who we are for many years. We view diversity as inclusive of many facets\u2014race, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, ability, experience, religion, perspectives, and much more\u2014and we know that a diverse workforce can help us to think creatively, remain agile, and, importantly, be true to our values.\n\nWe are strongly committed to continuing to build a more inclusive and diverse workplace where all our Associates feel welcome in the Company, valued for their perspectives and contributions, and engaged with our business mission to deliver great value to our customers every day. We strive to treat all people with dignity and respect and do not tolerate discrimination, harassment, or hate of any kind. These expectations are reinforced to all Associates in our TJX Global Code of Conduct.\n\nWe appreciate that this work is a journey. As an important part of that journey, in fiscal 2022 we completed a global inclusion and diversity survey of our Associates and used the findings to help define three core areas of focus for our inclusion and diversity work:\n\n/ Increase the representation of diverse Associates along our talent pipeline.\n\n/ Equip leaders with the tools to support difference with awareness, fairness, sensitivity, and transparency.\n\n/ Empower all Associates to integrate inclusive behaviors, language, and practices in how we work together and understand our role and responsibility in inclusion.\nAreas of Focus\n\nWhile inclusion and diversity have consistently played an important part in who we are as a Company, we are aware that our work in this area is evolving and can be more effective with input from our Associates. We provide opportunities for our Associates around the world to share their feedback, thoughts, and personal experiences with inclusion and diversity at TJX. As such, we have taken time over the past two years to listen to our Associates and re-assess our Company-wide inclusion and diversity efforts.\n\nOver the course of fiscal 2021 and 2022, we invited our global Associates\u2014who numbered more than 300,000 at the time, across all facets and functions of our business\u2014to participate in a global inclusion and diversity survey. While we found the overall results to be encouraging, the data we gathered has helped us define our global strategy to further support a more inclusive and diverse workplace.\n\nTo underpin our work in this area, we have expanded our Leadership Competencies and Cultural Factors, which help express our organizational values and promote consistency in leadership development, to include a new leadership competency and cultural factor focused on inclusion-based values and behaviors. By formally establishing inclusion and diversity as a core organizational principle, we continue to integrate inclusion into the fabric of who we are as a Company.\n\nAdditionally, to continue to hear from our Associates, this past year we launched Inclusion and Diversity Advisory Boards in the U.S., Europe, and Canada. The Advisory Boards include Associates representing a variety of functions, levels, and backgrounds across our stores, distribution and processing centers, and corporate offices. Advisory Board members are expected to provide recommendations and feedback to support our continuing inclusion and diversity work and guide us in striving to align our programming with the needs of various Associate populations.\n\nTaken together, these actions are designed to further embed inclusion and diversity within our culture and business practices. They have helped inform our near-, medium-, and long-term global inclusion and diversity strategies, plans, and initiatives\u2014including many of the activities we are proud to report on below. We recognize that as a global company, regional differences may require different approaches; therefore, as we enhance our global program, we are also empowering our regions across the globe to adjust their initiatives to meet local needs.\n\nAreas of focus:\n\nIncrease the Representation of Diverse Associates Along our Talent Pipeline\n\nWe recognize that having a diverse Associate base can help make us a stronger company and better able to serve our broad base of customers around the world. As we aim to increase the\nrepresentation of diverse Associates along our talent pipeline, we are working to increase our efforts to recruit more diverse talent while continuing to focus on providing diverse Associates greater access to development opportunities.\n\nTo support our recruiting strategies, we continue to build on the training we offer to our talent acquisition teams, including through educational opportunities focused on inclusion and diversity. We use a tool in the U.S., Canada, and Europe designed to help identify and reduce potential unconscious biases in job descriptions and other recruiting materials. Our talent acquisition department has also established an inclusion and diversity committee that aims to increase proactive outreach to diverse communities, engagement with diverse candidates, and awareness and education with internal decision-makers involved in hiring processes.\n\nWe are actively pursuing opportunities to increase minority candidate representation in early career positions, and we continue to work to expand the ways we approach our search for early career professionals. To inspire a broader range of candidates to consider careers at TJX, in fiscal 2022, we developed and expanded relationships with several nonprofit partners in the U.S.\u2014such as Leadership Enterprise for a Diverse America, The Posse Foundation, Bottom Line, and Thrive Scholars\u2014and have worked with them to support events, career development, and recruitment opportunities for under-represented high school and college students. We have also enhanced our outreach to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and partnerships with diverse on-campus organizations for recruitment events. We believe these connections can help us create a pipeline of future diverse talent with TJX.\n\nAssociates at TJX have the opportunity to access an array of development and retention opportunities internally and through external partnerships. TJX\u2019s Global Leadership Curriculum and our Emerging Leaders program are among our strong internal professional development resources. We also have partnered with community-based non-profit organizations\u2014such as The Partnership, Conexi\u00f3n, and a third-party leadership academy designed for Black executives and early- to mid-career managers in the U.S. and Europe, and through Business in the Community in Europe\u2014to create access to external professional development programs for our diverse Associates. We are proud of our culture that prioritizes development and advancement within our organization, as we simultaneously work to build a more diverse pipeline of talent to support our efforts to increase diversity at all levels of our organization.\n\n**Equip Leaders with the Tools to Support Difference with Awareness, Fairness, Sensitivity, and Transparency**\n\nTo support our efforts to fully integrate inclusion into our culture and business practices, we recognize that it is important that leaders from the very top and through every level of our organization exemplify and model a culture of inclusion. We have made it a priority to equip our leaders with the training and tools needed to better understand and embrace working with those who are different than themselves. By adding a focus on inclusion to our Leadership Competencies and Cultural Factors, we aim to formalize inclusion as a foundational value that represents who we are as a Company and how we expect our leaders and Associates to show up every day. As part of this, we are developing tools to support leaders across the Company in reflecting on and implementing inclusion-based values and behaviors. In tandem with this process, we are updating our Leadership Development Toolkit to help leaders across the Company deepen their understanding and implementation of inclusion-based values and behaviors. We are also enhancing our Global Leadership Curriculum to provide our newly\nhired and recently promoted leaders with tools to champion inclusion and encourage, empower, and engage their direct reports.\n\nIn addition to providing tools to support their own learning, we are also equipping managers with resources to help them engage in dialogue with their teams, including support for managers in our stores and distribution centers, to lead discussions with Associates around inclusion, diversity, and other challenging topics, such as unconscious bias.\n\n**Empower all Associates to Integrate Inclusive Behaviors, Language, and Practices in How We Work Together and Understand our Role and Responsibility in Inclusion**\n\nInclusion is an ongoing journey, and everyone can play a part. For many years, TJX has offered education to increase Associates\u2019 inclusion and diversity awareness. We believe this helps our Associates better understand how to foster a stronger culture of inclusion in the workplace, and we expect to continue to focus on these foundational education and awareness-building initiatives. When onboarding new hires, our orientation materials emphasize the high value we place on inclusion and diversity, and current Associates have access to an array of online learning resources. In fiscal 2022, we enhanced our education efforts to include an inclusion and diversity awareness training program, which was completed by thousands of TJX leaders globally, as well as a \u201cStanding for Racial Justice\u201d webinar series for Associates in our U.S. home office. Some of our other activities in this area include rolling out an updated unconscious bias training globally, new inclusion and diversity trainings and materials in Europe, and a speaker series on inclusion and diversity in Canada, among many additional initiatives.\n\nTo promote awareness and align with best practices, we are also working to continue to encourage honest conversations and Associate feedback. Over the past two years, our inclusion and diversity teams in the U.S., Europe, and Canada have conducted Associate listening sessions and focus groups to help guide open conversations, solicit input, and grow our collective capacity to be champions of inclusion. In fiscal 2022, we launched Inclusion & Diversity Advisory Boards in the U.S., Europe, and Canada, which are intended to empower cross-functional groups of Associates from our stores, distribution and processing centers, and offices to advise on our current and future inclusion and diversity work. Across various functions within the organization, Associates are setting up committees to better incorporate inclusion and diversity into our everyday work\u2014including in merchandising, where teams are finding opportunities to use an inclusion and diversity lens on product assortments as appropriate for our opportunistic buying and off-price business model.\n\nThis past year we also launched a new global mentorship pilot initiative to foster Associates\u2019 development by connecting them with leaders in our organization. The pilot is focused on Associates in our Associate Resource Groups and includes formal mentoring relationships, informal mentoring, and facilitated mentoring roundtables that are designed to generate group conversations on topics that were identified during focus group sessions, including career guidance, executive presence, self-awareness, and authentic leadership.\n\nAdditionally, in fiscal 2022, we also launched our new Being Inclusive framework to support all Associates, including managers and other leaders, in becoming more self-aware, committing to supporting others, and championing inclusivity. In the U.S., we are bringing this framework to life through our Being Inclusive Every Day initiative that helps leaders facilitate conversations in our offices, stores, and distribution centers.\nChampioning Inclusion\n\nBeing an inclusive organization\u2014and making Associates feel welcome, valued, and engaged at TJX\u2014is important to us as a Company, and we continue in our efforts to model and integrate inclusive behaviors, languages, and practices through our organization. One of the ways we do this is through our Associate Resource Groups (ARGs), which we have been proud to champion in the U.S. for many years and are excited to begin expanding to other regions. TJX\u2019s ARGs are informal yet well organized, and they typically develop annual business plans that outline their goals and objectives. Many ARGs also manage their own annual operating budgets and have funds available for charitable giving and/or community programs. Our ARG groups often host a wide range of events each year, including educational programming for group members and for the general Associate population, volunteer opportunities, social events, and fundraising initiatives.\n\nIn the U.S., we have 11 active ARGs that support Associate networking, development, and connection. In fiscal 2022, TJX launched its newest U.S. ARG, the Black Leadership & Associate Coalition (BLAC), to help foster workplace belonging and build a stronger community for our Black Associates. Other ARGs in the U.S. aim to support Associates with disabilities, members of the LGBTQ+ community, multicultural Associates, women, working parents, and members of the U.S. Armed Forces.\n\nWe are proud to be expanding our ARG program globally. In fiscal 2022, we piloted our first ARGs in Europe and plan to continue rolling out additional groups in the near future. In Europe, our ARGs include groups dedicated to supporting Asian, Black, female, disabled, and LGBTQ+ communities, in addition to a group dedicated to Wellbeing. Europe\u2019s pilot ARGs include Associates in corporate offices, processing centers, and stores and are currently focused on developing their individual priorities, which will help TJX Europe continue to evolve its inclusion and diversity efforts moving forward as consistent with TJX\u2019s global core areas of focus. In Canada, we have set up inclusion and diversity committees for home office Associates, distribution center Associates, and store and regional office Associates. Like ARGs, these committees aim to provide opportunities for Associates to share input, generate ideas, and develop annual plans regarding various inclusion- and diversity-related areas. As in Europe, TJX Canada\u2019s committees will also help inform the region\u2019s strategic inclusion and diversity initiatives in support of TJX\u2019s global core areas of focus.\n\nTJX is committed to doing our part to continue to support our many types of diverse Associates as well as to foster greater inclusion within our communities. Beyond ARGs, in the U.S., we enhanced our parental leave policy for benefits-eligible Associates to be more supportive of working parents, and we proudly offer transgender-inclusive healthcare, services, and transition support for benefits-eligible Associates. We also fly the flags of the countries represented by our Associates at our distribution centers; have a gender-neutral dress code policy; and, when not impacted by COVID-19 restrictions, typically have a large presence in annual PRIDE parades. We continue to stand by our 2020 commitment to stand up for our Black Associates, customers, and communities, and as we see examples of violence and discrimination, including against the Asian and Pacific Islander communities and other underrepresented groups, we are reminded that we need to continue to work toward a better future for all people.\nOur Diverse Workforce\n\nThe diversity of our Associates helps make us a stronger company and better able to serve our broad base of customers around the world. We are committed to continuing to execute our global inclusion and diversity initiatives to drive sustainable, organizational change while striving to increase diversity in our talent pipeline.\n\nWe are also proud of our culture that prioritizes Associate development and advancement within our organization and are pleased that 40% of Associates in managerial positions around the world have been at the company for more than 10 years. As we strive to create a more inclusive and diverse workforce, we recognize the importance of building out our talent pipeline with diverse talent and providing current Associates opportunities for growth and development at TJX.\n\nOur workforce reflects a diversity of races, ethnicities, cultures, nationalities, and genders. Globally, in fiscal 2022, women made up 77% of our total workforce and held 68% of our managerial positions. We are proud of the strong representation of women across our workplace, including an increasing percentage of our leadership team. Women are strongly represented in our more senior ranks and comprised 47% of Vice President and above positions in fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2022, women earned 80% of our promotions across the globe. We are also proud that in fiscal 2022, 42% of our Board of Directors were women.\n\nIn the U.S. in fiscal 2022, people of color comprised 59% of our total workforce, held 35% of managerial positions, and 60% of non-managerial positions. Within U.S. leadership roles, people of color comprised 14% of Vice President and above positions. In fiscal 2022, people of color earned 49% of our promotions in the U.S. Additionally, in fiscal 2022, 33% of our Board of Directors identified as racially or ethnically diverse.\n\nFISCAL 2022 GENDER AND RACIAL DIVERSITY STATISTICS\n\n- 77% of our global workforce is female\n- 68% of people in managerial positions globally are female\n- 79% of people in non-managerial positions globally are female\n- 47% of Vice President and above positions globally are female\n- 80% of promotions globally were earned by women\n- 59% of our workforce in the U.S. is people of color\n- 35% of people in managerial positions in the U.S. are people of color\n- 60% of people in non-managerial positions in the U.S. are people of color\n- 14% of Vice President and above positions in the U.S. are people of color\n- 49% of promotions in the U.S. were earned by people of color\nPay Equity\n\nAt TJX, we are firmly committed to pay equity and to fostering an inclusive and diverse environment that provides attractive and accessible opportunities throughout our organization. As a large, complex, and global business, we believe it is imperative that we attract and retain the right talent for TJX at all levels and in all functions. We have designed compensation structures intended to pay our Associates competitively in the market and equitably, based on their skills, qualifications, role, and abilities. We have long-standing processes in place to monitor and support the objective evaluation and approval of compensation decisions in the many geographies where we operate. Our incentive plans emphasize our core compensation objectives, including incentivizing and rewarding performance and sustaining our position of strength in a competitive and changing retail environment.\n\nIn 2019, we published our first pay equity analysis looking at gender of our U.S. workforce, and in 2020, we expanded our efforts to include race/ethnicity. We are pleased to report that our most recent analysis, based on 2021 data and accounting for job title, geography, and full- or part-time status, was consistent with findings in previous years. In the U.S., on average, there are no meaningful differences in base pay between Associates based on gender or race/ethnicity at TJX. We intend to monitor our processes and review our data periodically to support our goal of continuing to compensate our Associates equitably based on their skills, qualifications, role, and abilities.\nASSOCIATE WELL-BEING\n\nAt TJX, we aim to foster a positive and inclusive work environment so that our Associates feel welcome, valued, and engaged. As part of that philosophy, we encourage Associates to bring their whole self to work and support them in a variety of ways, including through our well-being programs. While the pandemic impacted many of our onsite offerings in fiscal 2022, we are committed to supporting our Associates and evolving to meet their needs.\n\nWe understand that Associate well-being is impacted by many factors, and our global wellness initiatives focus on three key areas: physical, financial, and emotional well-being. These programs are part of our commitment to meeting the diverse needs of our Associates across the globe, as well as promoting a happier and healthier workforce.\n\nExamples of some of our Associate well-being programs are highlighted below. While our philosophy and approach to Associate well-being is global, the availability of these programs and eligibility terms vary across our global locations based on geography, setting, and other factors.\n\n/ Physical well-being: In many locations we offer access to various fitness and wellness resources, such as virtual classes and fitness centers at our corporate offices; smoking cessation support; and, at certain locations, onsite wellness services like eye exams, flu shots, dental services, and primary care physician services. We offer additional benefits, such as medical, dental, vision, and disability coverage, for eligible Associates, which in the U.S. includes no-cost access to telehealth services, diabetes support and reimbursement of certain fitness-related expenses.\n\n/ Financial well-being: We offer retirement savings plans with a company match for eligible Associates in the U.S., U.K., Ireland, Poland, and Canada. Our Associates can also access a variety of programs and services at discounted rates, and eligible Associates can participate in an adoption assistance benefit in the U.S. and scholarship and tuition assistance programs in the U.S. and Canada. In addition, all Associates can access a discount when shopping with any of our brands. We also provide access to resources, tools and information sessions covering various financial topics such as preparing for retirement, financial literacy, tax preparation, student loan counseling, taking parental leave, and managing finances during times of crisis.\n\n/ Emotional well-being: All TJX Associates have access to Associate assistance programs that provide 24/7 free and confidential support to help balance work, family, and personal issues. Across our locations we also offer access to educational resources that may cover topics such as new and expectant parent support, resiliency and stress reduction, and support for caregivers, as well as access to resources that promote relaxation, such as meditation, Pilates, and Tai Chi.\nOur mission is to deliver great value to our customers every day. For over four decades, our deep commitment to the principles of providing value and caring for others has helped define our culture. It extends beyond the walls of our stores, distribution centers, and offices, and into our local communities around the world. The intersection of these principles defines our global community mission:\n\nDeliver great value to our communities by helping vulnerable families and children access the resources and opportunities they need to build a better future.\nSOCIAL IMPACT AREAS\n\nWe bring our community relations mission to life around the world by focusing our giving on four social impact areas where we believe we can have the most impact and are critical to helping families and children succeed and thrive.\n\nBASIC NEEDS\n\nEDUCATION & TRAINING\n\nHEALTHCARE RESEARCH\n\nEMPOWERING WOMEN\nOur Approach to Giving Back\n\nWe are a global business with stores located on three continents and in thousands of communities around the world. Supporting these communities is important to us. There are several ways in which we organize our support:\n\n/ **Foundation Giving**: Through our three foundations in the U.S., Canada, and Europe we provide philanthropic grants to selected nonprofit organizations.\n\n/ **Cause Marketing and In-store Fundraising**: Our retail chains conduct charitable campaigns that align with one or more of our social impact areas.\n\n/ **Associate Volunteerism and Giving**: We encourage our Associates around the world to contribute their time, talent, and resources.\n\nStanding for Racial Justice and Creating Opportunities\n\nAt TJX, our core values of honesty, integrity, and treating each other with dignity and respect have lived at the heart of our business since the beginning. These values play a key role in our approach to how we support the communities in which we live and work. As a business, we do not tolerate discrimination or hate of any kind.\n\nIn support of this position, in 2020, we committed an incremental $10 million in funding, delivered over two years, to provide more direct support to Black communities and other communities of color. We were pleased to expand existing partnerships and create new ones with organizations in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Australia. We worked directly with organizations to understand their needs and, together, determined how to direct the funding to support specific projects and programs.\n\nThe following are some of the organizations we were pleased to support through this funding:\n\n**IN THE U.S.**\n\n/ **Boston University Center for Antiracist Research**\n\n/ **The Dimock Center**\n\n/ **Institute for Nonprofit Practice**\n\n/ **Museum of African American History (Boston)**\n\n/ **NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.**\n\n/ **National Urban League**\n\n/ **Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of African American History & Culture**\n\n/ **Third Sector New England**\n\n/ **UNCF (United Negro College Fund)**\n\n/ **YW Boston**\n\n/ **YWCA Central Massachusetts**\n\n/ **YWCA USA**\nIN CANADA\n\n/ Black Business and Professional Association\n/ Canadian Civil Liberties Education Trust\n/ Indspire\n\nIN THE U.K.\n\n/ Access UK\n/ Runnymede\n/ Blueprint for all (previously Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust)\n\nIN IRELAND\n\n/ Irish Network Against Racism\n\nIN GERMANY\n\n/ Schule ohne Rassismus (School Without Racism)\n\nIN POLAND\n\n/ Nigdy Wiecej (Never Again)\n\nIN AUSTRIA\n\n/ Zara \u2014 Civil Courage and Anti-Racism-Work\n\nIN AUSTRALIA\n\n/ AIME Mentoring\n/ The Indigenous Literacy Foundation\n/ The Healing Foundation\n\nThrough our work with these organizations, we expanded our approach to supporting the needs of the communities where we do business. We also work to identify opportunities that allow us to be responsive to current social needs and causes that align with our social impact areas and global community mission.\n\nAt TJX, we remain committed to supporting inclusion and diversity and increased access to opportunities for all voices.\n\n*Donations in Europe were made through the T.K. Maxx and Homesense Foundation.\nCommitment to Support Ukraine\n\nWe have united with businesses around the world in our condemnation of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. To support the relief efforts providing humanitarian aid to help people impacted by the war, we have made donations to numerous organizations through our charitable foundations, both in the U.S. and internationally, including: The Polish Red Cross, The American Red Cross, Save the Children, World Central Kitchen, The British Red Cross Emergency Appeal, and The Canadian Red Cross\u2019 Ukraine Humanitarian Crisis Appeal. In addition, we initiated a fundraising campaign at stores around the world to support those impacted by the Ukraine crisis.\n\nOur thoughts are with our TJX family across the globe and all of those affected by the war in Ukraine. As a global company, we stand with the people of Ukraine and remain steadfastly committed to supporting our Associates impacted by this crisis.\n\nFY22 HIGHLIGHTS\n\n- 37 million meals provided\n- 500,000 shelter nights provided\n- 700,000 units of product donated\n- 100,000 domestic violence services provided\n- $30 million donated for healthcare research and patient care\n- 3 million young people provided access to educational opportunities\n- 7,500 young people provided workforce readiness opportunities\nCaring for others is an important part of the culture at TJX. Throughout our more than four decades, we have worked hard to be a good corporate citizen and bring value to people\u2019s lives \u2013 not just in our stores, but also in our communities.\n\nOur corporate giving follows our global philanthropic platform and is focused around our four social impact areas:\n\n- **FULFILLING CRITICAL BASIC NEEDS**\n- **PROVIDING EDUCATION AND TRAINING**\n- **SUPPORTING RESEARCH AND CARE FOR LIFE-THREATENING ILLNESSES**\n- **EMPOWERING WOMEN**\n\nIn the U.S., Canada, and Europe, we have charitable foundations that provide targeted funding to our communities. Each of these foundations has its own focus that supports our global community mission to deliver great value to our communities by helping vulnerable families and children access the resources and opportunities they need to build a better future.\n\n/ **The TJX Foundation (U.S.):** Providing value to our communities by helping vulnerable families and children access the resources and opportunities they need to build a better future.\nThe TJX Canada Foundation (Canada): Helping vulnerable women achieve economic independence so that they and their families can thrive in life.\n\nThe T.K. Maxx and Homesense Foundation (Europe): Helping vulnerable children and young people achieve their full potential in our local communities.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, our community efforts globally, including our foundation giving, supported nearly 2,500 nonprofit organizations worldwide.\n\nOur foundations proudly support a variety of organizations, from national charitable groups to local nonprofits. This support can include donations to local charities when we open a new store or grants to Associate-recommended organizations that fit our giving guidelines. Sometimes we are able to combine Associate volunteerism with our foundation giving, as we believe this makes our philanthropic efforts more meaningful to our Associates and customers and adds value in our local communities. In fiscal 2022, our community efforts globally, including our foundation giving, supported nearly 2,500 nonprofit organizations worldwide.\n\nTJX has also supported our communities when unexpected disasters strike. We have contributed generously for more than 25 years to Red Cross chapters around the globe, as well as to other nonprofit organizations that help local communities rebuild in the wake of devastating disasters.\n\nGiving Guidelines and information on how to apply for funding are available online for our U.S. foundation.\n\nMAKING A DIFFERENCE: THE COMMUNITY FUND\n\nOver the years, the T.K. Maxx and Homesense Foundation has supported local charities across Europe through our Community Fund. As in other regions, Associates from our European T.K. Maxx and Homesense stores, processing centers, and offices can nominate charities within their communities that provide opportunities to vulnerable populations. Through the Community Fund, we are pleased to have donated to charities focused on mental health, homelessness, end of life care, food insecurity, disability, and much more.\n\nSUNNY DAYS CHILDREN\u2019S FUND\n\n\u201cThe charity I nominated for the Community Fund was Sunny Days Children\u2019s Fund. They raise funds to help children under 18 with a wide range of adverse medical conditions. They create grants for families to help them where possible with things such as respite, hospital travel, and making children\u2019s remaining time as comfortable as possible. I chose this charity because the work they do is incredible: they provide so much support to not only the young children but the rest of their family.\u201d\n\nEmily (Assistant Manager for T.K. Maxx)\nASSOCIATE IMPACT\n\nAssociates contribute to the success of many of our programs through charity nominations, volunteerism, and in-store fundraising events, as well as through their own donations. In fiscal 2022, many of these efforts continued to be adapted due to COVID-19.\n\nIn the United States, Associates continued to participate in engagement activities in a pandemic-friendly, virtual format. Associate participation in our Big Brothers/Big Sisters and Read to a Child programs continued virtually, and we held several virtual events with Cradles to Crayons and Jumpstart, which included collecting and donating clothing as well as virtual and socially-distanced book readings with children in their communities. A growing number of Associates also volunteered in the past year to support students across the country in their career readiness journeys by volunteering for virtual career exploration workshops, resume coaching, and interview prep. In addition, in keeping with our tradition of more than 20 years, our U.S. Associates continue to pledge to the United Way in our annual workplace campaign to help provide families and children with opportunities for a better quality of life.\n\nOur U.S. Associates are also actively engaged in supporting other causes. In some cases, activities that may have started as smaller, localized efforts have now grown into more substantial campaigns that occur across the country. For example, our U.S. Loss Prevention group leads Associate participation in Making Strides Against Breast Cancer walks each fall. In fiscal 2022, this group rallied together 63 teams across the country for the program\u2019s virtual walks to help fund breast cancer research.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, as part of TJX Canada\u2019s community initiative, Find Your Stride, Associates from across the business volunteered to host a variety of online training sessions to help support the efforts of our community partners who put in-person programming on hold due to the pandemic. More than 25 virtual sessions were held on topics including preparing for job interviews, dressing professionally, and building self-confidence.\n\nAcross Europe, our Associates volunteer and fundraise to support vulnerable children and young people living in our local communities. In fiscal 2022, we approved more than 1,600 charity nominations submitted by Associates in Europe through the T.K. Maxx and Homesense Foundation\u2019s Community Fund. These grants supported charities whose mission is to help vulnerable children, young people, and families achieve their potential.\nThroughout fiscal 2022, TJX Associates across the globe engaged in department-wide efforts to support causes they were passionate about, including fundraising, participating in food and clothing drives, and volunteering to help women and young people access mentoring, education, and workforce opportunities.\n\nWe are very proud to have Associates around the world who volunteer their time and who are committed to doing good in their communities.\n\n**MAKING A DIFFERENCE: CELEBRATING WITH PRIDE**\n\nWinners, Marshalls, and HomeSense in Canada have supported the LGBTQ+ community for many years. In fiscal 2022, with celebrations more virtual in nature, TJX Canada continued to provide donations to various Pride organizations around the country. We also celebrated the LGBTQ+ community with our Associates, creating a video where Associates shared what Pride means to them. At TJX, we strive to do our part to create an inclusive, welcoming environment for our Associates and customers alike; supporting Pride is one way that we, together with our Associates, can help to make the world more welcoming of our differences.\nFULFILLING BASIC NEEDS\n\nIn our communities around the world, many families find themselves unable to meet their basic needs. At TJX, we understand the importance of a warm meal, clean clothing, and a safe place to sleep. This is why we are passionate about supporting nonprofit organizations that help fill these critical basic needs for vulnerable families.\n\nIn the U.S., TJX supports Cradles to Crayons, which serves children from birth through age 12 living in homeless shelters or low-income situations, and provides them with high quality, essential items they need to thrive. In addition to TJX\u2019s financial support, we have Associate engagement programs with Cradles to Crayons in Boston, Philadelphia, and Chicago. In fiscal 2022, with in-person programs suspended due to COVID-19, Associates volunteered \u201cat home\u201d as part of the organization\u2019s Pick, Pack and Give Back! pilot program where participants put together boxes of clothing and shipped them directly to children in need. In addition, TJX Interns volunteered virtually to shop for and assemble clothing kits for children as a team building project during their internship cycle.\n\nFor more than three decades, TJX has supported the Dimock Center, a community health center recognized nationally as a model for the delivery of comprehensive health and human services in an urban community. Dimock provides Massachusetts residents access to high quality, low-cost health care and whole person services. Through sponsorship and Associate volunteerism, TJX has helped Dimock increase access to education and other opportunities for more than 1,000 children and families in their early childhood education programs and family shelter. We have also supported Dimock\u2019s substance use, mental health, and trauma recovery programs, which work to improve access to care and critical resources to help individuals progress with their recovery. In fiscal 2022, TJX\u2019s partnership with Dimock included support for their ongoing COVID-19 response and health equity efforts, as well as a \u201cStuff the Bus\u201d program, in partnership with Save the Children, which provided more than 2,000 backpacks to children and families from Dimock\u2019s community.\n\nFY22 HIGHLIGHTS\n\n- 37 million meals provided\n- 500,000 shelter nights provided\n- 700,000 units of product donated\nSince 2015, our U.S. retail chains have teamed up each Thanksgiving season for an in-store fundraising campaign to support families in need of food assistance during the holidays. In fiscal 2022, through this campaign, funds from our U.S. Foundation and customer donations were provided to Feeding America for distribution to 200 food banks. According to Feeding America, this translated into an estimated 25 million meals served to those in need. Additionally, throughout the holiday season, T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods supported Feeding America through their Snowball Fight Against Hunger campaign on TikTok. Every social media post in support of the campaign helped provide the equivalent of 10 meals to Feeding America.\n\nSince the launch of the Find Your Stride initiative in 2019, TJX Canada has embarked on a mission to help vulnerable women gain the skills and support they need to thrive in life. Two of our key partners are Dress for Success Canada and the Women in Need Society (WINS). Dress for Success Canada provides professional attire, along with other support, to help women in need thrive in work and in life. While it has 13 locations across Canada, with our support, Dress for Success hopes to extend its reach to new geographies. In Calgary, WINS serves as a homegrown thrift charity. Through its Free Goods Referral program, women in poverty and their families can obtain basic needs support through a network of 80+ partnered agencies.\n\nWe are also very proud to support Habitat for Humanity Canada, to which we donated over 400 pallets of merchandise in fiscal 2022. Habitat for Humanity Canada brings communities together to help families build strength, stability, and independence through affordable home ownership. With the help of volunteers, Habitat for Humanity builds and restores safe, decent, and affordable homes, including single family and multi-unit houses. Their model of affordable homeownership bridges a gap for low-income families.\n\nMAKING A DIFFERENCE: PROVIDING COMIC RELIEF\n\nT.K. Maxx and Homesense in the U.K. have been partners of Comic Relief, a charity that helps children and young people in the U.K. and around the world get the best start in life. Comic Relief funds hundreds of organizations that support some of the most vulnerable people and communities in society. This includes vulnerable children and young people, people who are homeless or who have been forced to flee their homes, women and families at risk of domestic abuse, and those struggling with mental health challenges.\n\nRED NOSE DAY\n\nTJX Europe is an official retailer for Comic Relief U.K.\u2019s much-loved fundraising campaign, \u201cRed Nose Day.\u201d Since 2005, we have raised tens of millions of dollars thanks to our Associates and the support of our customers. In fiscal 2022, we collaborated with Pixar to create an exclusive range of charity merchandise including t-shirts and homeware. Thanks to generous donations from our customers, charity merchandise sales, and our Associates\u2019 own fundraising, we raised more than $1.9 million for the cause in fiscal 2022. Due to the pandemic, we pivoted to virtual Associate activities, which included masked singing competitions, quizzes, raffles, and virtual masterclasses.\nOUR SUPPORT INCLUDES:\n\n- Cradles to Crayons\n- Greater Boston Food Bank\n- Feeding America\n- Save the Children\n- Dress for Success (Canada)\n- Feeding America (U.S.)\n- Women in Need Society (Canada)\n- Comic Relief (U.K.)\n- Dress for Success (Canada)\n- Women in Need Society (Canada)\n- Children for a Better World (Germany)\n- Comic Relief (U.K.)\n- Rwenzori Sustainable Trade Programme\nPROVIDING EDUCATION AND TRAINING\n\nTJX has long been committed to helping unlock educational opportunities for at-risk youth and vulnerable young people to help them reach their full potential. Over the years, our support has focused on quality enrichment and out-of-school programs that provide skills, resources, and opportunities to support school and career success in the hopes of helping to create a brighter future for children, teens, and young adults. In fiscal 2022, we worked with a variety of organizations and funded education and workforce training opportunities that impacted more than 3 million young people.\n\nIn our fourth year of working with Jumpstart in the U.S., TJX was proud to support Jumpstart\u2019s vision that every child in America enter kindergarten prepared to succeed. TJX\u2019s funding went to Jumpstart\u2019s Read for the Record, a program that engages over two million children across the country in reading the same book on the same day to promote early literacy. We also supported their in-school programming, which Jumpstart says provides over 13,000 preschoolers access to curriculum focused on language, literacy, and social-emotional development. The grants also enabled Jumpstart to send additional Spanish-language books to Puerto Rico. In addition, more than 7,500 books were distributed directly to classrooms and shelter programs that are a part of TJX\u2019s partner network. Associates across the country also did virtual book readings in classrooms and daycares in their local communities.\n\nT.J. Maxx celebrated its 37th year of sponsorship of Save the Children U.S. in fiscal 2022. In addition to funding Save the Children\u2019s literacy efforts throughout the year, T.J. Maxx also supported Save the Children\u2019s 100 Days of Reading summer campaign, which needed increased support during the global pandemic.\nAt Sierra, we want the outdoors to be accessible to everyone, so we provide support in connection with new store openings through grants to nonprofits that help children in those communities get outdoors. We also partnered with KABOOM! to support programs that are committed to providing safe places for all children to play and Open Outdoors for Kids, a National Parks Foundation program that creates opportunities for children to explore nature.\n\nWe have a long history of working with underserved youth in cities around the U.S. to help teach them job readiness skills and expose them to career paths in retail. This year, we continued to support Junior Achievement, a national provider of work readiness, entrepreneurship, and financial literacy skills for young people. Their goal is to give young people the tools they need to own their economic success, plan for their futures, and make smart academic and economic choices. TJX Associates have the opportunity to volunteer in Junior Achievement programs. Additionally, we partnered with a number of nonprofits this year, including The Posse Foundation, Bottom Line, Leadership Enterprise for a Diverse America, and UNCF (United Negro College Fund), to support their work in connecting high-school and college students to internship and early career opportunities at TJX.\n\nThrough TJX Canada\u2019s Find Your Stride program, we endeavor to provide education and job training for women preparing for the workforce\u2014many of whom are young, single mothers from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds, including new Canadians. Partnerships include WoodGreen\u2019s Homeward Bound program, the Women in Need Society (WINS), and, new in fiscal 2022, Petites-Mains. Women participating in the Homeward Bound program receive housing and childcare while pursuing a no-cost, two-year college diploma. On completing the degree program, participants also receive internships and job placement assistance. For WINS, in addition to our financial support, we developed the TJX Canada WINS Retail Ready program, a six-week program that provides training and work experience to enable women to find and maintain employment within the retail industry. In fiscal 2022, we were pleased to launch our partnership with Petites-Mains, a Quebec-based organization dedicated to helping integrate Canadian newcomers into the job market through skills and knowledge training. Through these programs, TJX Associate volunteers taught at training sessions, worked with program participants in mock job interviews, and conducted store tours.\n\nThis year, TJX Canada was proud to establish a new relationship with Indspire, a charity whose vision is to enrich Canada through Indigenous education and by inspiring achievement. In partnership with Indigenous, public sector, and private sector stakeholders like us, Indspire strives to educate, connect, and invest in First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis people to help them achieve their highest potential. Our donation will support several scholarships for high school and post-secondary Indigenous students.\n\nIn the U.K., TJX Europe engages with organizations that give young people access to broader educational opportunities with a goal of preparing them for employment opportunities. For many years, we have supported The Prince\u2019s Trust through their Achieve and Get Into programs. The Achieve program is a development course designed to help young people aged 11-19 who are at risk of underachieving at school boost their confidence, learn new skills, and collaborate with others. Since 2016, Homesense\u2019s support of the Achieve program has helped over 2,700 young people. Get Into Retail provides training, development, and employment opportunities for successful participants. As one of the largest partners of Get Into Retail, we are proud to have engaged with over 1,500 young people since the program began in 2013, with approximately 70% going on to accept jobs with us. In addition, our Loss Prevention team partners with The Prince\u2019s Trust to help disadvantaged young people create new futures for themselves through the Get Into Loss Prevention program.\n\nTJX Europe also partners with Stowarzyszenie WIOSNA in Poland and Children for a Better World in Germany, two organizations that support disadvantaged children and young people through mentoring and skills development. Since our partnerships with Stowarzyszenie WIOSNA and Children for a Better World began in 2014 and 2010, respectively, our efforts have helped provide educational opportunities for over 9,500 youth in need.\nAt T.K. Maxx in Australia, we embrace community programs that equip disadvantaged youth with the resources and opportunities to rise up and build a better future. T.K. Maxx Australia is excited to have launched a new charity partnership with The Smith Family to continue this work. The Smith Family is a national, independent children\u2019s charity helping disadvantaged Australians to get the most out of their education so they can create better futures for themselves. For 100 years, The Smith Family has been tackling the problem of poverty one child at a time. Through their flagship Learning for Life program, they have helped more than 58,000 Australian students with their education by providing each student with a combination of emotional, practical, and financial support as well as vital learning and mentoring programs that help them keep up and stay motivated throughout their school years.\n\nMAKING A DIFFERENCE: SAVE THE CHILDREN\n\nSince 1984, T.J. Maxx has proudly supported Save the Children U.S. programs to help improve the lives of children and families in need through early education, literacy, and health programs. T.J. Maxx\u2019s relationship began with sponsorship of children who participate in Save the Children\u2019s national education programs. Over the years, the relationship has grown to include an annual in-store fundraising campaign, as well as sales of branded merchandise which often features children\u2019s artwork. Further, our Chief Executive Officer is a member of the Board of Trustees of Save the Children. For the third year in a row, T.J. Maxx also made a contribution to the 100 Days of Reading campaign, which encourages reading with children throughout the summer.\n\nBUILDING CONFIDENCE & SKILLS IN THE CLASSROOM\n\nWhen he started kindergarten in the fall of 2020, Trentyn was reluctant to participate in class and shrugged his shoulders when asked about the letters of the alphabet. At the time, he could recognize only a few letters and struggled with their sounds.\n\nStarting school during a pandemic also meant an unpredictable school schedule for Trentyn, with shifts from remote learning to hybrid and in-person learning \u2013 and back again \u2013 adding to his challenges. But with the help of Save the Children\u2019s afterschool program, things began to turn a corner for the Tennessee kindergartener. As the spring of 2021 began to blossom, so did Trentyn\u2019s early reading skills. He had mastered every letter of the alphabet, was gaining confidence in their sounds, and could instantly recognize nearly 20 common sight words.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned all of my sounds,\u201d said Trentyn, who noted his favorite book is \u201cClifford the Big Red Dog\u201d because \u201cit is fun!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has come a long way with his learning, but he has also learned to participate, get along, and help others more,\u201d said Trentyn\u2019s mom, Sandi. \u201cWithout the extra help from Save the Children, I feel he would still be way behind.\u201d\nOUR SUPPORT INCLUDES:\n\nWINNERS\n\n/ Indspire\n/ Women in Need Society\n\n/ Woodgreen\u2019s Homeward Bound\n/ Academy for the Future (Poland)\n/ Children for a Better World (Germany)\n/ Comic Relief (U.K.)\n/ The Prince\u2019s Trust (U.K.)\n/ Rwenzori Sustainable Trade Programme\n\nOUR SUPPORT INCLUDES:\n\n/ Big Brothers / Big Sisters\n/ Bottom Line\n/ Jumpstart\n/ The Posse Foundation\n/ Read to a Child\n\n/ YMCA of Greater Boston\n\n/ Save the Children\n/ Indspire (Canada)\n\n/ Women in Need Society (Canada)\n/ Woodgreen\u2019s Homeward Bound (Canada)\n/ KABOOM!\n/ National Park Foundation\n\n/ Stowarzyszenie WIOSNA (Poland)\n/ Comic Relief (U.K.)\n/ Indspire (Canada)\n/ The Prince\u2019s Trust (U.K.)\n/ Women in Need Society (Canada)\n/ Woodgreen\u2019s Homeward Bound (Canada)\nSUPPORTING RESEARCH AND CARE FOR LIFE-THREATENING ILLNESSES\n\nA key part of our communities work involves supporting organizations that deliver services to families and children when they are facing life-threatening illnesses, including funding organizations with missions aimed at spurring advancements in cures and care. Our Associates, our customers, and their families often have a personal connection to a health-related cause and are eager to participate in volunteer opportunities and join in fundraising efforts that help affected individuals and families.\n\nFor over 30 years, Marshalls has partnered with JDRF in the U.S. to improve the lives of children and adults living with type 1 diabetes and to support JDRF\u2019s search to find a cure. Through an annual in-store fundraising campaign and support of other local JDRF events, we are helping to fund exciting new research and support programs. We are proud to have been named a Diamond Partner, helping to fund research that may one day eliminate this devastating disease. Marshalls has also raised funds and awareness through in-store fundraising programs to benefit the Alzheimer\u2019s Association and St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital.\n\nFY22 HIGHLIGHTS\n\n$30 million donated for healthcare research and patient care\n\n$11.8 million donated for cancer research and patient care\nHomeGoods in the U.S. has been \u201cHelping Families Fight Cancer\u201d over two decades of partnering with the Jimmy Fund, St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Over the years, our Associates have raised millions of dollars for this great cause. We also have sold reusable shopping bags designed by patients at HomeGoods and Homesense stores, with 50 cents of every 99-cent bag going to the Jimmy Fund and Dana-Farber, and we have collected customer contributions during checkout at both HomeGoods and Homesense. Our support has also included participation in Jimmy Fund walks and various sponsorships over the years.\n\nFor many years, T.K. Maxx customers and Associates have raised millions for Cancer Research U.K. for Children and Young People and Enable Ireland. In fiscal 2022, we continued our ongoing support which included cause marketing and in-store fundraising campaigns, Associate fundraising, and charity merchandise sales, as well as our Give Up Clothes for Good campaign. Give Up Clothes for Good rallies people across the U.K. and Ireland to drop off their high-quality, used clothes, accessories, and homeware at our stores for donation. The items are then sold at Cancer Research U.K. and Enable Ireland thrift shops or recycled to raise funds. As an added benefit, the program promotes the reuse of clothing and other items. Over the past 15+ years, over 1.7 million bags of clothing and household goods have been collected. The partnerships have raised more than $54 million for Cancer Research U.K. for Children and Young People since 2004, and more than $4.3 million since 1997 for Enable Ireland to support children and young people with disabilities. Today, T.K. Maxx is the biggest corporate supporter of Cancer Research U.K.\u2019s research into children\u2019s cancers, helping fund life-saving research to help more children and young people survive cancer.\n\nMAKING A DIFFERENCE: FIGHTING CANCER WITH ST. JUDE\u2019S\n\nHomeGoods and Homesense in the U.S. are dedicated partners of the St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital and have raised more than $60 million to support their lifesaving mission of finding cures and saving children with cancer or other life-threatening diseases. HomeGoods and Homesense support St. Jude in a variety of ways. In our stores, we participate in the St. Jude Thanks and Giving Campaign, raising funds and awareness to support St. Jude\u2019s mission to advance cures for pediatric cancer. During the holiday season, HomeGoods and Homesense give our customers the opportunity to make donations in-store at the register, where 100% of the donations benefit St. Jude, and by purchasing any of their four limited-edition globes with 50% of the purchase price benefitting St. Jude.\n\nJAVON AND JAKAYLA\u2019S STORY\n\nJavon was 2 years old when he was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and began treatment at St. Jude. Unfortunately, the year his sister, JaKayla, was born, doctors found his cancer had returned. He underwent an additional 146 weeks of chemotherapy. In 2010, his cancer returned again. This time, he underwent chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant, with his father as donor. When JaKayla was 2 years old, she, too, was diagnosed with ALL; she, too, would suffer a relapse after two and a half years of chemotherapy, necessitating a bone marrow transplant.\n\nToday, both kids are thriving: Javon is a college student and member of his school\u2019s marching band; JaKayla is a high-schooler and choir member.\n\n\u201cWithout St. Jude, my children wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d said Javon and JaKayla\u2019s mother, Lisa, who is herself a survivor of ALL. Her family is testament to the advances in treatment of ALL made by St. Jude over the decades.\nOUR SUPPORT INCLUDES:\n\nTJX\n\n/ Joslin Diabetes Center\n\nMarshalls\n\n/ Alzheimer\u2019s Association (U.S.)\n/ JDRF (U.S.)\n/ St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital (U.S.)\n\nHomeGoods\n\n/ Dana-Farber Cancer Institute\n/ St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital (U.S.)\n\nT.J.

We support programs that provide services ranging from help for those fleeing domestic violence, to others that offer education, training, and job placement resources.\n\nFor more than 25 years, TJX has supported programs offering resources for victims of domestic violence in the U.S. In 2009, we began a partnership with the National Domestic Violence Hotline with our first foundation grant, and that partnership continues to this day. The Hotline is a free 24/7 helpline that serves as a link to safety for hundreds of thousands of people annually who are affected by domestic violence. In addition, in fiscal 2022, TJX Canada launched a new partnership with Alice House, which provides opportunities for women to create a life free from intimate partner violence by offering safe, second-stage housing, counselling, and support services.\n\nIn 2019, TJX Canada launched Find Your Stride, a community initiative with a goal of helping vulnerable women achieve economic independence so that they and their families can thrive in life. As part of the initiative, TJX Canada formed relationships with Dress for Success Canada, WoodGreen\u2019s Homeward Bound program, the Women in Need Society, and, new in fiscal 2022, Petites-Mains. These organizations provide support to women and families with basic needs like housing, food, and clothing as well as a variety of services, including work skills development, educational programs, and work placement. The pandemic has forced these organizations to put much of their in-person support on hold and\n\n**FY22 HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n- 500,000 shelter nights provided\n- 100,000 domestic violence services provided\ninstead offer virtual programming, including career coaching and online development opportunities. Many of our Associates from across the business hosted online training sessions to help these organizations continue to support their clients, including professional development, mock job interviews, and more.\n\nMAKING A DIFFERENCE: SUPPORTING CANADIAN WOMEN THROUGH PETITES-MAINS\n\nThis year, TJX Canada became an official partner of Petites-Mains, a nonprofit organization that supports women in need\u2014principally newcomers, single mothers, and those receiving social assistance or without income\u2014to break out of social isolation, learn a trade, and integrate into the workforce, in order to live with dignity. Petites-Mains has contributed to the well-being of thousands of women and works toward a more just, inclusive, and harmonious society in Canada. Through this partnership, our French-speaking Associates have volunteered to support program participants with their career development.\n\nPROVIDING HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE AND TRAINING\n\nIn partnering with Petites-Mains\u2019 work experience program, TJX Canada hosted mentorship sessions, mock interviews, and job skills trainings to provide immigrant women opportunities to learn about and develop skills to help them enter the Canadian job market. We are proud that many of our French-speaking Associates have volunteered to share their own experiences, lead skills-development, and conduct store tours for participants.\n\n\u201cThe mentoring sessions and mock interviews of our \u201cprogramme Femmes: un pas vers l\u2019emploi\u201d (\u201cWomen\u2019s program: A step toward employment\u201d) were very beneficial for our participants. It helped develop self-esteem, break misconceptions about jobs interviews, and grow confidence in speaking with potential employers. The program also provided participants with tools and experience to help them evaluate job opportunities in line with their schedules and educational interests.\u201d\n\n- Vivianne, Petites-Mains\nOUR SUPPORT INCLUDES:\n\n/ National Domestic Violence Hotline (U.S.)\n/ Watford Women's Centre (Europe)*\n\nWINNERS\n\n/ Alice House\n/ Dress for Success\n/ Petites-Mains\n/ Women in Need Society\n/ Woodgreen\u2019s Homeward Bound\n\n*Donations in Europe are made through the T.K. Maxx and Homesense Foundation.\nTJX is committed to pursuing initiatives that are environmentally responsible and smart for our business. Our global environmental sustainability program includes a wide range of initiatives that work toward reducing the environmental impacts of our operations as well as certain merchandise products and packaging. We focus our program\u2019s strategy and goals in three areas: climate and energy, waste management, and responsible sourcing.\n\nGLOBAL GOALS\nAs part of our global efforts, we are aiming to:\n\n- **NET ZERO**\n  Achieve net zero GHG emissions in our operations by 2040\n\n- **100 PERCENT**\n  Source 100% renewable energy in our operations by 2030\n\n- **85 PERCENT**\n  Divert 85% of our operational waste from landfill by 2027\n\n- **100 PERCENT**\n  Shift 100% of the packaging for products developed in-house by our product design team to be reusable, recyclable, or contain sustainable materials by 2030\nAREAS OF FOCUS\n\nWe are committed to making progress within our key focus areas by collaborating across the organization to drive our global and regional environmental sustainability initiatives and targets forward.\n\nCLIMATE AND ENERGY\n\nOur approach to managing the climate-related impacts of our own operations uses industry guidance, research, and models that are aligned with the United Nations\u2019 Paris Agreement guidelines and support an emissions growth path aimed at limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. We have set science-based goals and defined initiatives that support a decarbonization pathway for our global operations, including our goal to achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in our direct operations (Scopes 1 and 2) by 2040. Along the way, we intend to reach a 55% absolute reduction in GHG emissions from our direct operations (against a Fiscal 2017 baseline), as well as source 100% renewable energy for use in our operations by 2030.\n\nWASTE MANAGEMENT\n\nTeams throughout our business are working towards our goal to divert 85% of our global operational waste from landfill by 2027 by eliminating waste, where possible, and maximizing the reuse and recycling of materials used in our stores, distribution centers, and corporate offices.\n\nRESPONSIBLE SOURCING: SOURCING MORE SUSTAINABLY\n\nThere are many initiatives that make up our responsible sourcing efforts. As we source merchandise, product packaging, and supplies for our own operations, we may find more opportunities to procure materials with sustainable attributes. As some of our first steps along this journey, we aim to shift 100% of the packaging for products developed in-house by our product design team to be reusable, recyclable, or contain sustainable materials by 2030. Chemicals management is another workstream within our responsible sourcing focus.\narea. Our Chemicals Management Program includes our approach to addressing select chemicals of concern in our operations as well as in certain products that we sell.\n\n**Partnerships & Recognition**\n\nWe are affiliated with the following organizations focused on environmental protection and sustainability:\n\n- American Apparel and Footwear Association (AAFA)\n- British Retail Consortium Climate Action Roadmap\n- Closed Loop Partnership \u2013 Beyond the Bag initiative\n- EPA's SmartWay Transport Partnership\n- Green Chemistry and Commerce Council (GC3)\n- National Retail Federation\n- Retail Council of Canada\n- Retail Industry Leadership Association (Sustainability Committee, Zero-Waste Committee)\n- Textile Exchange\n- American Apparel and Footwear Association (AAFA)\n- The Microfibre Consortium\n\nWe are proud to be recognized and/or certified by the following organizations:\n\n- Carbon Trust Standard\n- CDP: TJX received a score of A- on the CDP 2021 Climate Change Questionnaire\n- EPA's SmartWay High Performer\n- FleetSmart\n- FTSE4Good Index Series\n\n**FY22 HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n- **28%** absolute reduction in global GHG emissions from our direct operations from FY17 (50% of our target achieved)\n- **25%** of our electricity in our global direct operations came from renewable energy sources\n- **67%** of global operational waste diverted from landfill\n- **A-** score received on the CDP 2021 Climate Change Questionnaire\nPROGRAM OVERSIGHT\n\nManagement oversight of TJX\u2019s environmental sustainability initiatives, among other ESG initiatives, is led by a Senior Executive Vice President (SEVP), Group President, who has responsibility for many other functions across the business. The SEVP provides oversight and strategic input into the development of the Company\u2019s environmental sustainability strategy and priorities, including global and regional operational environmental sustainability goals, and chairs the Global Corporate Responsibility Executive Steering Committee (CRSC), a global cross functional team that helps guide the Company\u2019s corporate responsibility strategies and align them with TJX business priorities. The Senior Vice President, Chief Risk and Compliance Officer and the Vice President, Sustainability, regularly provide updates to the SEVP on global program progress and initiatives, as well as identify, assess, and report risks and opportunities on the environmental sustainability focus areas, including climate-related issues.\n\nAdditionally, the Global Environmental Sustainability Committee (GESC) sets global program priorities, recommends goals and targets, facilitates communication and collaboration across geographies, and monitors key sustainability issues and trends. The GESC includes subject matter experts from the U.S., Canada, and Europe, who measure and manage TJX\u2019s performance in our prioritized environmental sustainability focus areas:\n\n| CLIMATE AND ENERGY | WASTE MANAGEMENT | RESPONSIBLE SOURCING |\n\nMembers of the GESC periodically report on the progress against our environmental sustainability strategy, goals, and metrics to the SEVP, CRSC, and other cross functional stakeholders as appropriate.\n\nIn each geography, members of the GESC also work with local subject matter experts (SMEs) in areas such as store and distribution operations, energy, facilities, and procurement, to develop and report progress against the roadmaps, initiatives, and tactics that support our strategy, as well as our global and regional targets. Periodically, the GESC convenes regional SMEs to discuss emerging trends and review strategies and best practices that may be reflected in both short- and long-term plans for the geographies. Topics of discussion have included circularity, chemical policies, single-use plastics, sustainable products and packaging, renewable energy, and supply chain emissions impacts.\n\nTogether with input from the SEVP and members of the CRSC, as well as our global internal SMEs, the GESC also works to prioritize initiatives that are considered to be meaningful to the Company\u2019s stakeholders (including Associates, customers, and shareholders) and supports our business in responding to sustainability regulation, reporting, and disclosure.\nCLIMATE AND ENERGY\n\nWe work across our global business operations to measure, manage, and mitigate our climate impacts. In April 2022, we announced expanded commitments to reduce the climate impacts of our direct operations, meaning our stores, home offices, distribution (or processing) centers, and certain vehicles. Our global targets include:\n\n/ **By 2030:**\n  / We expect to reach a 55% absolute reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from our direct operations (Scope 1 and Scope 2) by Fiscal 2030 (against a Fiscal 2017 baseline)\n  / We intend to source 100% renewable energy in our operations\n\n/ **By 2040:**\n  / We have a goal to achieve net zero GHG emissions in our operations (Scope 1 and Scope 2)\n\nThese commitments were developed using industry guidance, research, and models that are aligned with the United Nations\u2019 Paris Agreement guidelines and support an emissions growth path aimed at limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nAs we work toward our net zero goal, we have identified emissions reduction strategies and tactics that could reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in line with our commitment. Initially, we plan to focus on reducing emissions in our facilities and fleet through increased efficiency and switching to renewable energy. Some of our initiatives include:\n\n/ We plan to accelerate investments in some energy efficient technologies, such as HVAC and LED lighting.\n/ To reduce our Scope 1 emissions (which include natural gas and diesel) over the longer term, we are monitoring the development and deployment of alternative fuel/electric vehicles and new HVAC technologies (such as heat pumps) that could allow us to operate our stores, offices, DCs, and vehicles with zero GHG emissions.\n/ We plan to increase our sourcing of renewable energy across our global operations and are procuring renewables in a variety of ways, such as onsite solar Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), green tariffs, and unbundled renewable energy certificate (REC) contracts.\n\nAs our climate and energy strategies continue to evolve, we plan to continue to identify efforts that are impactful to our stakeholders, the environment, and that are feasible to implement within our business model.\nFY22 Climate and Energy Metrics\n\nProgress on global goals:\n\n- We expect to reach a 55% absolute reduction in GHG emissions from our direct operations (Scope 1 and Scope 2) by Fiscal 2030 (against a Fiscal 2017 baseline):\n  - 28% reduction since Fiscal 2017\n- We intend to source 100% renewable energy in our operations by 2030\n- 25% of energy sourced in our global direct operations came from renewable sources\n\nGHG Emissions:\n\n- We experienced a 7.1% increase in our absolute market-based GHG emissions in Fiscal 2022 relative to Fiscal 2021 due to a return to normal operations after COVID-19 related temporary store closures reduced our GHG emissions in Fiscal 2021.\n\nRenewable Energy:\n\n- In Fiscal 2022, we sourced over 435 million kilowatt hours of renewable energy in total, generated from a variety of technologies. Together, our renewable and low-carbon energy sourcing strategy in Fiscal 2022 enabled us to reduce our Scope 2 market-based GHG inventory by more than 196,000 metric tons of CO\u2082e, or by about 30% over the prior year.\n- In comparison to Fiscal 2021, TJX renewable and low-carbon energy sourcing increased by about 14% in Fiscal 22.\n- TJX purchased 54,600 megawatt hours more renewable and low-carbon energy, including renewable energy certificates (RECs), onsite solar power purchase agreements (PPAs), and utility-supplied renewable energy in Fiscal 2022 than in Fiscal 2021. We estimate that this incremental increase in renewable purchases decreased metric tons of CO\u2082e by 9.3%, approximately 50,200 metric tons of CO\u2082e year over year.\n\nEmissions Reductions:\n\n- Together, in Fiscal 2022, energy management and renewable and low-carbon efforts resulted in a reduction of over 202,000 metric tons of CO\u2082e from our operations saving an estimated $3.2 million.\n\n(Comparison data above includes Scope 1 and Scope 2 global GHG emissions calculated for Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2022 respectively)\nReducing Emissions: In Our Direct Operations\n\nEnergy Efficiency\n\nOperations teams in each of our geographies are actively working to manage our energy consumption and costs, analyze and improve our operational performance, and test potential technologies in the facilities we operate to help us drive progress against our operational goals. Specifically, our tactics include:\n\n- Implementing light-emitting diode (LED) technologies\n- Retrofitting lighting and HVAC systems in existing stores and distribution centers in certain geographies\n- Exploring and leveraging utility level incentives and programs\n\nWe are also exploring new technologies to optimize access and use of our energy data as well as evaluating battery energy storage and demand-control ventilation for HVAC, which may be applicable across certain facility types.\n\nRenewable and Low-Carbon Energy\n\nWe source low-carbon and renewable energy to further reduce our GHG emissions from electricity consumption. Some examples of our current sourcing strategies include:\n\n- Wholesale power purchase agreements\n- On-site power purchase agreements\n- Electricity supply contracts\n- Renewable energy credits\n\nOn-site Solar\n\nIn the U.S., distribution centers in Arizona, Connecticut, and Nevada and select stores in New Jersey, Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts, and California have installed solar panels, resulting in an estimated $640,000 savings each year. These projects are on buildings we own or where market conditions and landlord partnerships enable projects.\n\nOffsetting\n\nIn certain geographies, we leverage carbon offsets to offset emissions resulting from our direct operations and business travel.\n\nFor example, TJX Canada has been carbon neutral for its Scope 1 and 2 and reported Scope 3 (business travel and waste) emissions from operations for its fourth consecutive year. The team reduced energy usage and purchased renewable energy credits as well as carbon offsets to support this strategy. In Fiscal 2022, from a combination of projects focused on forest conservation and small-scale hydro-electric generation in countries where we actively source merchandise, TJX Canada offset emissions associated with its operations, business travel, and waste, totaling 21,000 metric tons CO\u2082e.\n\nTransportation and Fuel\n\nAlthough TJX does not generally own or lease the vehicles that transport our merchandise, we do include some emissions in our operational footprint (Scope 1) from limited sources, including those where we directly manage our logistics and distribution, such as in the U.K. and Ireland outbound store deliveries as well as fleet vehicles. Together with our partners, we work to increase fuel efficiency and reduce costs, with the goal of decreasing the impact of our vehicles on the environment. Our key strategies for reducing these emissions include:\nIn the U.S. we:\n\n- Utilize hybrid cars for a small portion of our fleet vehicles.\n\nIn the U.K. and Ireland, we:\n\n- Incorporate a \u201csustainability\u201d clause in our new logistics agreements, which covers both trucking and store delivery vehicles and commits both parties to achieving key environmental goals aligned with TJX targets.\n- Have increased the use of both our longer-semi trailers and our Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) tractor units, resulting in carbon emissions reductions of approximately 156 metric tons per year.\n- Support ongoing initiatives including the implementation of fleet analytics and tire pressure monitoring to deliver incremental fuel efficiency.\n- Regularly review our delivery schedules to reduce miles traveled, implementing measures such as reducing empty running, combining store deliveries, and maximizing vehicle sizes.\n\nBuilding Green\n\nWe have constructed new buildings and incorporated environmentally sustainable features when feasible. For example, our newly constructed distribution centers and processing centers are built to include the addition of onsite solar arrays where possible. Furthermore, when we move into existing properties, as part of the renovation process, our design teams typically consider ways to improve energy efficiency and water conservation and to develop recycling infrastructure where feasible.\n\nReducing Emissions: In Our Value Chain\n\nOur focus has historically been on the climate-related impact of our direct operations where we have the most control over our facilities energy and fuel usage (Scope 1 and Scope 2). In addition, we have begun to evaluate how our commitment to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions might be extended to certain Scope 3 emissions sources as well. Through a high-level screening of all 15 Scope 3 emissions categories, we have begun to develop a preliminary understanding of which of those categories of Scope 3 emissions are relevant to our business. We are also making progress in collecting publicly available information about the climate strategies, reduction targets, and emissions data for some of our largest vendors. These efforts are intended to help us evaluate our ability to collect data and measure certain sources of emissions from Scope 3 categories.\n\nTransportation and Fuel\n\nOur logistics teams worldwide seek out strategies and technology solutions that can help us increase the efficiency of our logistics and transportation operations and reduce fuel used to transport our merchandise throughout our distribution network. We strive to conserve fuel, reduce travel time, and decrease the number of trucks on the road. We use a variety of strategies and technologies to support this initiative, for example, using modeling software to improve the efficiency of our store delivery network, increasing utilization of trailer space, and testing new alternative fuel vehicles.\n\nIn the U.S., we have opened service centers that are smaller than distribution centers in addition to using intermodal. These service centers are located closer to store clusters and designed to improve the efficiency of our store delivery process. We also utilize these service centers to co-locate our Asset Recovery and Recycling Centers (ARRCs) and maximize our delivery trucks\u2019 utilization by backhauling re-usable and recyclable materials.\nOther efforts include:\n\n- We engage directly with our logistics partners and indirectly through third parties (such as U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) SmartWay Transport Partnership and Natural Resource Canada\u2019s FleetSmart program) to identify opportunities to reduce fuel consumption and increase fuel efficiencies.\n- In 2021, 99% of TJX\u2019s U.S. freight and logistics ton-mileage was with SmartWay-certified carriers. To achieve this result, TJX collaborated with carriers to encourage their participation in this program. TJX requires that all new U.S. carriers are SmartWay-certified.\n- Where feasible, we use rail and intermodal for shipping merchandise, which is generally more fuel efficient and produces fewer emissions than trucking. We estimate that in Fiscal 2022, intermodal shipping resulted in 450,000 fewer metric tons of CO\u2082e emissions than shipping the same volume by truck only.\n\nIn the U.K. and Ireland, we work to reduce and conserve fuels in our owned fleet vehicles, and our agreement with our carrier for our trucking and store delivery trucks has a \u201csustainability\u201d clause relating to achievement of key environmental goals.\n\nThird-Party Verification and Assurance of Emissions Data\n\n- In Fiscal 2022, 100% of our global Scope 1 and 98% of our global Scope 2, location-based emissions data are third-party verified.\n- Our Scope 1 and Scope 2 U.S. and Canada GHG inventory data is third-party verified (using AICPA (AT105) standards). This initiative has resulted in TJX obtaining third-party verification for approximately 84% of our global Scope 1 emissions (onsite fuels, refrigerants, and transport fuels) and an estimated 88% of our global Scope 2 emissions (electricity and steam calculated using location-based emissions factors) for our Fiscal 2022 reporting period.\n- In Europe, our carbon footprint has been assessed by the Carbon Trust since 2006. Additionally, since 2009, we have achieved the Carbon Trust Standard certificate, recognizing our year-on-year efforts to reduce our environmental impact in the U.K., and since 2013, the certification has included our entire Scope 1 and 2 European operations.\n- Additionally, we also third-party verify about 54% of our Scope 3 reported business travel emissions data.\n\nBuilding our European \u201cForever Home\u201d\n\nAs we planned and constructed our new European headquarters in England, Corporate Responsibility was an aspect of our decision making, and we were proud that we achieved an \u201cExcellent\u201d BREEAM certification (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method, an environmental assessment method and rating system for buildings) for the design based on the building\u2019s environmental sustainability credentials. Here are some of the ways we infused sustainability into our campus:\n\n- We chose updated fixtures in our bathrooms to help use less water.\n- We installed beehives on the roof as well as native landscaping and green walls to support improving biodiversity in the local area.\n- LED lighting has been installed throughout campus and can adjust on and off and by level automatically.\n- Enhanced waste sortation program.\nWASTE MANAGEMENT\n\nTeams throughout our business work to implement cost-effective strategies and processes to manage the many different types of waste materials resulting from our operations. We focus on eliminating operational waste, where feasible, and maximizing the reuse and recycling of materials in our stores, distribution centers, and corporate offices. These efforts support our global goal of working to divert 85% of operational waste from landfill by 2027.\n\nOur global approach to managing operational waste includes efforts to:\n\n- Maximize reuse and recycling of operational waste, of which the majority is corrugate boxes from vendors\n- Collaborate with our waste-haulers and vendors on solutions that improve our ability to divert operational waste materials from landfill\n- Update and enhance our communications on sortation and recycling procedures within certain stores\n- Address and decrease single-use plastics in our operations\n- Explore opportunities for certain geographies to expand merchandise recovery and reuse programs.\n\nFY22 WASTE METRICS\n\nProgress on global goal:\n\n- FY2022 Global diversion rate: 67%\n  - Regional diversion rates:\n    - U.S.: 61%\n    - Canada: 88%\n    - Europe: 97%\n    - Australia: 61%\n- GHG Emissions: Scope 3 (Waste Generated in Operations, Category 5)\n  - 46,700 metric tons of CO\u2082e\n  - Approximately 6% of TJX\u2019s reported GHG emissions\n\nHighlights across our geographies:\n\n- In the U.S., T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods continued programs to reuse cardboard boxes throughout the network, and over 8.1 million reusable units of packaging were sent back from our stores through our network of Asset Recovery and Recycling Centers (ARRCs) to be returned to distribution centers for reuse. This effort not only was good for the environment, but it also resulted in nearly $9 million in cost avoidance.\nMaximizing Reuse and Recycling\n\nWe have many programs across our global business that support our efforts to reuse and recycle our operational waste in our stores, distribution centers, and home offices. For example, recycling programs for common items like cardboard, plastic, paper, aluminum, and glass have been introduced across all geographies. We are working to improve our programs and find new ways to recycle other items, like polystyrene. One of our efforts involves our Asset Recovery Recycling Centers (ARRCs).\n\nIn the U.S., our 26 ARRCs are located within our service centers and have historically served as a central destination for regional recyclable or reusable store material. Select stores send used corrugated cardboard, plastic, excess hangers, store fixtures, display cases, unused boxes, and other supplies to their local ARRC, where the items are processed for reuse in other stores or recycled.\n\nOver the years, the flexibility of the ARRC organization has enabled us to test new programs as we strive to increase the types of materials that can be included in our recycling stream. For example, as our global waste stakeholders have identified polystyrene (Styrofoam) as a key area of focus, we have leveraged the ARRC to pilot strategies to improve our management and recycling of polystyrene packaging material. Thanks to efforts like this and many others, we estimate the ARRCs have helped divert more than 378,000 metric tons of waste from landfills since Fiscal 2017.\n\nIn Europe, the ARRC operates as a reuse center for equipment that is not currently required in certain stores and fulfills other stores equipment needs. The ARRC also operates as a distribution and storage function for non-stock items, such as merchandise protection.\n\nDecreasing Single-Use Plastics\n\nWe have regional efforts in place to identify opportunities to remove single-use plastics from our operations and are working with our suppliers to reduce single-use packaging.\n\nIn the U.S., we have a team who is working to improve the sustainability of the packaging used for certain products which supports our global goal to shift 100% of the packaging for products developed in-house by our product design team to be reusable, recyclable, or contain sustainable materials by 2030. Read more about our work in this area on our Responsible Sourcing page.\n\nIn our U.S. Distribution Centers, we utilize a more easily recycled material and corrugated box insert for the packaging of liquid products during shipping from distribution centers to stores that has resulted in an estimated 12 million fewer plastic bags being used across our distribution network each year.\n\nIn Canada, we established a single-use plastics committee in Fiscal 2021 comprised of representatives across several functional areas who are helping to drive our strategy around this topic. The group is reviewing where single-use plastics are used in our Canadian business and operations, and exploring and proposing alternatives where possible.\nIn Europe, we are working to reduce single-use plastics from our offices, processing centers, and stores. To date, we have removed about one million plastic button bags from our products, use a recyclable paper in our e-commerce operations, and have removed single-use plastic bottles from our European stores.\n\nSingle-use Plastic Merchandise Carry Out Bags\n\nTJX is a member of the Closed Loop Partners\u2019 Consortium to Reinvent the Retail Bag, as the Apparel and Home Goods Sector Lead Partner.\n\nIn Canada, single-use checkout bags were removed from 18 stores in Fiscal 2022 as part of a phased approach to eliminating them from all stores nationally by February 2023.\n\nIn Europe, all single-use plastics bags were removed from stores in Fiscal 2021. Customers can purchase reusable bags made from over 90% recycled plastic and a portion of the proceeds goes to one of our charity partners.\n\nProduct Packaging\n\nBy 2025, we are working to eliminate PVC from the packaging of certain top-of-bed styles, easy-care table linens, outdoor seating cushions, and outdoor pillows that are developed in-house by our product design team.\n\nBy 2030, we are working to shift 100% of the packaging for products developed in-house by our product design team to be reusable, recyclable, or contain sustainable materials.\n\nMerchandise and Product Recovery and Reuse Programs\n\nWe recognize there are environmental concerns created by textile waste, and we continue to explore how we can contribute to scalable solutions that support a more circular economy. For example, in certain parts of Canada, U.K., and Ireland, we have programs in place that support the reuse of clothing, accessories, shoes, homeware, and more.\n\nIn Canada, we partner with Brands for Canada at our distribution centers to provide second life for product by donating unsold clothing, personal care, and household items to people in need through trusted social service agencies and schools. Additionally, in an effort to streamline our store charity donations we have partnered with Habitat for Humanity to collect and manage our store donations across Canada.\n\nIn the U.K. and Ireland, our long-running Give Up Clothes For Good campaign invites customers and Associates to donate their pre-loved quality fashion and homeware at their local T.K. Maxx, which could be sold by Cancer Research U.K. to raise funds for research into children\u2019s and young people\u2019s cancers. As of Fiscal 2022, T.K. Maxx Associates and customers have donated 1.9 million bags of goods. This amounts to 9,300 metric tons of pre-loved items diverted from landfill. The initiative not only benefits the environment because it may keep pre-loved items from going to landfill, but has also raised millions of pounds for Cancer Research U.K. for Children and Young People and Enable Ireland.\nReducing Water Consumption\n\nAlthough our business operations are not water intensive, we believe reducing water usage is consistent with both our commitment to environmental sustainability and our low-cost operating philosophy. To that end, we work to monitor our water usage and identify opportunities to improve water efficiency where possible across our operations. For instance, our Energy Management groups in the U.S. and U.K. monitor water usage across our home office buildings to identify opportunities to conserve water including time-sensor technologies to control faucets in many of our restrooms.\n\nAdditionally, our TJX Vendor Code of Conduct strongly encourages our merchandise vendors to conserve and protect resources, such as water and energy, and also take into consideration environmental issues that may impact their local communities. Environmental concerns are incorporated into our merchandise vendor social compliance training materials as well, introducing high-level concepts of environmental sustainability, like water conservation. Our training includes specific cost-saving, water-conservation recommendations for our suppliers that they may consider implementing at their production facilities. We plan to continue including similar relevant water facts during future training sessions.\n\nPlastics Cleanup Efforts\n\nAs part of our efforts, TJX Europe has supported a number of projects committed to reducing plastic and waste including:\n\n- **Ocean Clean Up**: a non-profit organization with a mission to clean the world\u2019s oceans of plastic. They expect to clean up to 50% of plastic every five years, leading to more than a 90% reduction of pollution levels by 2040 (since 2018).\n- **Plastic Collective**: a project that helps turns plastic waste into income for Pacific Island communities, creating employment by training residents to operate the machinery. Our support has funded two shredder machines in Bali to help recycle plastic waste and help create valuable income.\n- **Neighbourly**: an organization that promotes grassroots, environmental clean-up projects in the U.K. Through our partnership, we\u2019re supporting environmental and clean-up initiatives in our U.K. local communities. Our donations have enabled 2,000 environmental and clean-up projects, involving 43,000 people and resulting in 103 tons of litter and waste removed.\n- **Plastic Pioneers**: a program run by Hubbub. We\u2019ve joined forces with environmental behaviour change charity to fund their Plastic Pioneers Project. Our donation supports 12 schools in the U.K. to develop a range of interventions to educate children on the reduction of plastic.\nASSOCIATE ENGAGEMENT\n\nCorporate responsibility, including environmental sustainability, is important to both current and prospective Associates. We welcome ideas that could help enable our business to reduce our environmental footprint, use less energy, and create less waste in our operations. Our Associates are encouraged to consider how to make operational decisions that can potentially minimize environmental impacts, and we communicate this in our Global Code of Conduct.\n\nAdditionally, we have organized global cross-functional teams focused on supporting the implementation of our environmental sustainability programs, goals and initiatives. Specifically, we have created teams that address key strategies focused on the following topics: Carbon and Energy, Waste Management, Green IT (Information Technology), and Sustainable Merchandise and Packaging.\n\nENCOURAGING OUR ASSOCIATES TO BE ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS\n\nWe use various internal communications platforms across all our regions to share information and training opportunities with our Associates about our environmental sustainability focus areas, goals, and initiatives.\n\nIn Fiscal 2022, we celebrated Earth Week, announcing our new environmental goals to help raise awareness about TJX\u2019s environmental sustainability programs with our store, distribution center, and office Associates. For example, in our global home offices, we:\n\n- Hosted a virtual speaker series where a line-up of our internal sustainability experts explored different topics.\n- Planted a tree through American Forests, a national forest restoration and conservation organization, for everyone in the U.S. home office who committed to doing something environmentally friendly, such as carpooling, composting, or using a sustainable product.\n- Organized an art contest for children of Associates in the U.S. home.\n- In Europe, the T.K. Maxx and Homesense Foundation Community Fund expanded its application criteria to include environmental charities, meaning Associates can now nominate charities which focus on issues such as climate change education, reducing the impact of waste, or preserving or promoting biodiversity.\nGREEN IT\n\nAs our environmental sustainability strategy and program continue to evolve, teams throughout our business are coming together to collaborate and align with our corporate sustainability priorities to further drive this progress. To that end, Green IT, is an initiative focused on managing and leveraging technology to reduce the TJX Global IT team\u2019s environmental footprint.\n\nThe Green IT Committee is sponsored by senior members of TJX\u2019s Global IT leadership team and works to:\n\n- Identify, track, and monitor current IT initiatives that support TJX\u2019s environmental sustainability strategy.\n- Compile research and measurements to help inform Green IT strategies and communications.\n- Leverage partnerships with internal stakeholders and third-party vendors to identify and understand what opportunities exist.\n\nGreen It Focus Areas\n\n- **CLIMATE**: Reduce our technology-related greenhouse gas emissions footprint by optimizing the usage of our data centers and cloud services.\n- **ENERGY**: Reduce our energy usage by sourcing energy efficient devices and related software solutions.\n- **WASTE**: We strive to responsibly manage our broken or obsolete hardware and accessories by working to identify new ways and/or partnerships that lead to increases in safe and secure recycling of or reductions in technology-related waste.\nTJX is the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions worldwide, with seven retail chains operating nearly 4,700 stores in nine countries spanning three continents. As an off-price leader and a Fortune 100 company, we recognize the obligation we have to our key stakeholders \u2013 including Associates, customers, communities, vendors, and shareholders \u2013 to operate a responsible business.\n\nOur business dealings and interactions are grounded in our long-held core values of honesty, integrity, and treating others with dignity and respect. We hold ourselves to high ethical standards and expect our Associates to comply with these standards, which are set forth in the TJX Global Code of Conduct. Likewise, our Vendor Code of Conduct sets our expectations of the vendors with whom we do business and whose relationships are key to our success. We provide periodic training, both formal and informal, to reinforce these expectations.\n\nRESPONSIBLE BUSINESS INITIATIVES\nAt TJX, operating responsibly includes focus in the following areas:\n\n- **Social Compliance Program**\n- **Governance**\n- **Stakeholder Engagement**\n\n**HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n- 82% of Board Members are independent as of June 2022\n- 64% of Board Members are women and/or self-identify as a member of an underrepresented group as of June 2022\n- 2,400+ audits were conducted in FY22, either by TJX and our third-party auditors directly or accepted from recognized sources\nRESPONSIBLE SOURCING\n\nTJX believes in the importance of responsible and ethical sourcing in our supply chain. We strongly value the relationships that we have developed with our vendors, which are built on a foundation of honesty, trust, and ethical business practices. We believe these relationships have been a key factor in our long-term success.\n\nOur responsible sourcing initiatives cover a variety of evolving areas of interest. These include our long-standing Global Social Compliance Program, as well as newer initiatives related to the environmental impact of certain products and packaging and chemicals management within our operations.\n\nResponsible sourcing and social compliance are tremendously challenging undertakings. Our efforts are rooted in continuous improvement, which we believe can be achieved by making our commitments clear to our vendors, buying agent(s), and Associates; through our auditing and training efforts; by responding to issues as appropriate for our business; and by continuing to assess opportunities to enhance reporting.\n\nGLOBAL SOCIAL COMPLIANCE PROGRAM\n\nOur Global Social Compliance Program is rooted in our Vendor Code of Conduct, which outlines our expectations for our vendors. It also includes our expectations for our merchandise factory monitoring and supplier training program, which is focused where we have more influence in bringing the products to market. This means our auditing and training typically reaches factories that produce merchandise that we have helped design or develop to be manufactured just for us. We believe this is where we are most likely to be able to have a meaningful impact.\n\nWhile we do not own, operate, or control any facilities that manufacture products we sell, we collaborate closely with our buying agent(s) and international buying offices because they have strong relationships with local production facilities and are well positioned to reinforce our expectations.\n\nHOW WE BUY: OUR OFF-PRICE BUSINESS MODEL\n\nTJX is the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the U.S. and worldwide. Our mission is to deliver great value to our customers every day. We do this by offering ever-changing selections of high quality, fashionable, brand name, and designer merchandise at prices generally 20% to 60% below full-price retailers\u2019 (including department, specialty, and major online retailers) regular prices on comparable merchandise, every day.\nThe majority of product we sell in our stores and online is brand-name merchandise. To obtain this merchandise, we work closely with our vendors and take advantage of a wide variety of opportunities, which can include department store cancellations, a manufacturer making up too much product, or a closeout deal when a vendor wants to clear merchandise at the end of a season. There are other ways we bring tremendous value to our customers. For example, sometimes when what we are seeing in the marketplace is not the right value for our customers, meaning the right combination of brand, fashion, price, and quality, we may help design or develop merchandise to be manufactured just for us.\n\nOn a worldwide basis, in Fiscal 2022, more than 1,200 Associates in our buying organization sourced product from a universe of approximately 21,000 vendors and more than 100 countries around the world. As part of TJX\u2019s purchase order terms and conditions, our merchandise vendors are required to comply with our Vendor Code of Conduct. The Vendor Code of Conduct requires that goods we sell have been manufactured and shipped in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, and, including, among other things, a commitment to respect the rights of the workers who manufacture products for sale in our stores and online. These requirements stand even if a vendor applies their own code of conduct, monitoring, or ethical sourcing guidelines. Our vendors are also required to ensure that any factories or subcontractors they use comply with our Code\u2019s principles.\n\nSUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS AND PACKAGING\n\nWe are taking initial steps to determine ways that we may reduce the environmental impact of certain products and product packaging. As we source merchandise, product packaging, and supplies for our own operations, we may find more opportunities to procure materials with sustainable attributes. As some of our first steps along this journey:\n\n- We aim to shift 100% of the packaging for products developed in-house by our product design team to be reusable, recyclable, or contain sustainable materials by 2030.\n- We have implemented our plan to phase out all phenol-based coatings on paper customer sales receipts in the U.S. and intend to complete this process in Canada by the end of Fiscal 2023.\n- By 2025, we plan to phase out use of PVC in packaging of certain soft home products designed by TJX\u2019s own fashion and style experts and specifically manufactured for us. This will include certain top-of-bed styles, easy-care table linens, outdoor seating cushions, and outdoor pillows.\n\nIn addition to our global targets for certain product packaging, we have developed a framework to define sustainable product attributes, which includes materials that can be verified by a credible third-party process or certification. Our subject matter experts have compiled a list of preferred sustainable product certifications in certain product categories that can be used across all of our divisions, globally. Examples include Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified materials; Global Recycled Standard (GRS)-certified products; OEKO-TEX-certified products; and products made from organic cotton.\n\nSome examples of materials we are using with these preferred environmental attributes include:\n\n- We have sourced FSC hangtags where feasible with certain products our style and fashion experts have designed.\n- A significant portion of our price tickets are printed on FSC-certified paper.\n- In T.J. Maxx and Marshalls within the U.S., we have converted some of our gift card styles to be printed on FSC-certified stock.\nCHEMICALS MANAGEMENT\n\nSince we operate a large, complex, international business, we focus our efforts in areas where we believe we can have a meaningful impact and that are most feasible for our business model. As we continue to learn and build our programs in this area, we are exploring ways to manage chemicals of concern that go beyond legal and regulatory requirements in our operations as well as certain products we sell.\n\nChemicals management has been identified as a strategic priority by our Global Environmental Sustainability Committee (GESC), a team of subject matter experts from each of our major geographies who lead the strategic direction of our environmental sustainability program, and a sub-committee of that group is leading the assessment of potential areas across our global business where we can limit chemicals of concern. Teams across the business support these efforts by developing tactics that support the Company\u2019s initiatives and demonstrate the Company\u2019s ongoing progress around chemicals management. Chemicals management oversight is led by our Chief Risk and Compliance Officer and our Vice President of Sustainability, who regularly provide updates to the SEVP, Group President, who was asked to lead and oversee TJX\u2019s environmental sustainability initiatives, among other ESG initiatives.\n\nOur current approach includes:\n\n- Program development including addressing opportunities in:\n  - Business operations\n  - Merchandise and packaging\n  - Industry, expert, and internal collaboration\n\nProgram Development\n\nTo aid in the development of policies limiting chemicals of concern in our operations and in certain products we sell, we are utilizing the Chemical Footprint Project (CFP) framework, specifically leveraging the Management Strategy section to review relevant industry focus areas.\n\nLate in calendar year 2021, we published TJX\u2019s Chemicals Management Program. The program outlines our expectations for vendors and suppliers to reduce or eliminate certain chemicals of concern and also identifies the initial prioritization of categories where we intend to focus our efforts. We encourage all of TJX\u2019s suppliers and vendors to become familiar with this Program as well as the best practices for safer chemicals management applicable to their industry and product type. We will continue to evolve our strategy and work to identify new and expanded policies and commitments where we may further limit the use of chemicals of concern within our complex off-price business model. We will continue to update TJX\u2019s Chemicals Management Program as new commitments in this area and additional policies are finalized.\n\nInitiatives Within Our Business Operations\n\nPhase 1:\n\n- We have implemented our plan to phase out all phenol-based coatings on paper customer sales receipts in the U.S. and intend to complete this process in Canada by the end of Fiscal 2023.\n- We replaced our serveware in our U.S. home office cafeterias with PFAS-free compostable serveware and intend to complete this in Canada by the fall of calendar year 2022.\n- Development of a TJX U.S. Operational Supplies Policy for Hand Soaps and Sanitizers.\nMerchandise and Packaging Initiatives\n\nPhase 1:\n\n- Development of a buyer tool for Winners beauty buyers to identify products free of certain chemicals of concern\n- Phase-out of PVC in product packaging of certain products sold in our stores\n- Identification of industry-accepted third-party certifications that demonstrate safer chemicals management practices for certain product categories\n\nIndustry, Expert, and Internal Collaboration\n\nWe are collaborating with others in the industry as well as outside experts and internal stakeholders:\n\n- We are members of the Green Chemistry and Commerce Council (GC3) for external industry collaboration in the area of chemical management. The mission of GC3 is to promote safer chemicals, materials, and products across retail supply and value chains.\n- In Fiscal 2021 we joined Closed Loop Partners\u2019 Consortium to Reinvent the Retail Bag, as the Apparel Sector Lead Partner. The Consortium\u2019s Beyond the Bag Initiative convenes leading retailers, aiming to identify, test, and implement viable design solutions and models that more sustainably serve the purpose of the current retail bag.\n- We believe that the innovative solutions resulting from this effort could benefit the environment in many ways and could ultimately limit the amount of plastic waste generated from retail point-of-sale bags, and associated harmful chemicals, from entering the environment. Learn more about our efforts to reduce single-use plastics in Waste Management.\n- We partnered with an outside expert to conduct a landscape review of chemicals management for certain beauty and personal care formulated products. This included peer benchmarking, a review of third-party certifications, and an overview of chemicals of concern in these products.\n- Leaders within our global Environmental Sustainability team have engaged with some of our larger merchandise vendors and other large retailers to discuss their chemicals management plans and actions. These discussions have helped to increase our knowledge of strategies and implementation tools related to management of chemicals of concern.\n- Our Sustainable Packaging Committee in the U.S., which is a cross-functional team comprised of Associates from different areas of our business, is identifying potential opportunities for shifting to more sustainable packaging solutions, free of certain chemicals of concern, for certain of our products that are designed by our own fashion and style experts and specifically manufactured for TJX.\n- Our Global Environmental Sustainability Committee (GESC), a team of subject matter experts from each of our major geographies, has collaborated to identify a list of third-party certifications for wood/paper and textile products that represent safer chemical management.\n\nGoing forward, we will assess the potential to expand our strategy and coverage around chemicals management.\nEvolving Issues\n\nBangladesh\n\nThe tragedies that have taken place in factories in Bangladesh are reminders that we must remain vigilant and continue to monitor whether our policies and practices are adequate and appropriate. Worker health and safety have always been a significant part of TJX\u2019s Global Social Compliance Program.\n\nOur audit programs are based on evolving industry recommendations, including auditing the fire safety practices of factories. We stress the importance of fire safety in our external supplier and internal buyer training programs and have posted a message about our workplace safety expectations on our vendor intranet site. Our Vendor Code of Conduct includes a statement that expands our requirements for providing safe and healthy conditions beyond the factory to include any living facilities provided to workers. Going forward, we plan to continue to follow the various initiatives of the retail industry to glean any insights that might enhance our own Global Social Compliance Program.\n\nConflict Minerals\n\nAt TJX, we are committed to complying with the rules and regulations impacting our business, including those under Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, intended to address violence and human rights abuses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the DRC) and adjoining countries. These rules require public companies to determine if they manufacture or contract to manufacture any products where \u201cconflict minerals\u201d - specifically tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold (or \u201c3TG\u201d) - are necessary to the functionality or production of the product, and if so, whether those minerals originated in the DRC or adjoining countries. Companies are required to do additional diligence about the source and chain of custody of those minerals that may have originated in the covered region to determine if they came from sources that benefited armed forces in the region.\n\nAs demonstrated by the TJX Vendor Code of Conduct and our Global Social Compliance Program, we believe in responsible sourcing. TJX is many layers removed from the mining, smelting, or refining of any minerals contained in the products we sell, so we must rely on our vendors to collect current, complete, and reliable information to comply with these rules. We expect that our affected vendors will not knowingly supply us with products that include conflict minerals that directly or indirectly benefit armed groups in the region. We further expect our vendors and buying agent(s) to comply with our requests to provide us with information and perform due diligence regarding their sourcing of the minerals at issue. We will consider appropriate remediation steps if we find that a vendor has violated this policy.\n\nFur Practices\n\nTJX\u2019s businesses around the world are fur-free. Our businesses also do not knowingly source goods containing angora (rabbit) fibers. From time to time, our businesses may offer products containing shearling, haircalf, or hide. The process of procuring merchandise for our off-price model is complex, and if an item containing fur is mistakenly sent to our stores or e-commerce sites, we work quickly to remove the item.\nWe are also committed to continuous improvement in the ethical sourcing of products intended for sale in our businesses, and as part of our ongoing considerations regarding animal welfare, we incorporated information about our fur practices into our social compliance training in 2018. Importantly, at all times, TJX is committed to conducting business in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including but not limited to, animal protection laws.\n\nModern Slavery Statement\n\n(California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 and U.K. Modern Slavery Act of 2015)\n\nThis Statement relates to our fiscal year that commenced on January 31, 2021 and ended January 29, 2022 (\u201cfiscal year 2022\u201d). This Statement generally discusses the efforts of The TJX Companies, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries to address modern slavery because we take a global approach to modern slavery compliance. The reporting entities come within our global social compliance program.\n\nAbout Our Business. TJX is an off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions with nearly 4,700 stores across three continents in nine countries offering a rapidly changing assortment of merchandise. We source merchandise from a varying and expansive universe of approximately 21,000 vendors and more than 100 countries. As an off-price retailer, we have a complex global business model that is quite different from other traditional retailers that, unlike TJX, may own, operate, or control the facilities that manufacture products sold in their stores and/or may purchase products from a generally consistent vendor base. Our strategies to acquire merchandise are intentionally flexible to allow our buying organization to react to frequently changing opportunities and trends in the market and to adjust how and what is acquired as well as when it is acquired. Sometimes, when what we are seeing in the marketplace is not the right value for our customers, meaning the right combination of brand, fashion, price, and quality, we may help design or develop merchandise to be manufactured just for us.\n\nOur Commitment. At TJX, we are committed to treating people with dignity, fairness, and respect. Both our TJX Global Code of Conduct, which applies to all of our employees (Associates) worldwide, and our Vendor Code of Conduct, which applies to our merchandise vendors, reflect these principles and prohibit involuntary or forced labor. We are aware of reports of modern slavery in apparel supply chains and, as described below, our Global Social Compliance program underscores our efforts to address and mitigate these risks, and where appropriate, take corrective action. We believe that modern slavery risks in our own workforce are minimal due to the strength of our internal employment policies and procedures.\n\nOur Global Social Compliance Program. Our Global Social Compliance program includes, among other things, our factory audit program, our Vendor Code of Conduct, our training efforts, and our grievance mechanisms for vendors. As part of our program including as part of assessing its effectiveness, we regularly review factory audits performed, remediation efforts taken, and vendor training attendance. Our Global Social Compliance Committee, which includes senior leadership, meets on a regular basis to oversee this program and review trends in social compliance. In addition to our Global Social Compliance Committee, we also have a Global Corporate Responsibility Executive Steering Committee to help guide our global corporate responsibility strategies and align them with TJX business priorities, oversee corporate responsibility efforts across functions and geographies, facilitate information exchange, and support enhanced corporate responsibility reporting. This Committee is comprised of senior executives representing functions across the Company, including two executive officers reporting directly to the CEO. These executive officers are positioned to update management and the Board on the ongoing work of the Committee.\nTo help us evaluate and address the risks of modern slavery in our merchandise supply chain, our actions have included membership in external multi-stakeholder initiatives that share resources and best practices to improve efforts to combat forced labor, including the Joint AAFA/NRF/RILA/USFIA Forced Labor Working Group, the Responsible Business Alliance\u2019s Responsible Labor Initiative, Retail Industry Leaders Association (\u201cRILA\u201d) Responsible Sourcing Committee, and the American Apparel and Footwear Association Social Responsibility Committee. TJX is also an Ambassador Sponsor of the Responsible Sourcing Network\u2019s YESS initiative, which aims to train, support, and enable spinners and mills in the middle tiers of the supply chain to end forced labor at the raw cotton level.\n\n**Vendor Code of Conduct.** As a condition of conducting business with TJX and as a means of self certification, our merchandise vendors are required to agree to comply with our **Vendor Code of Conduct** which prohibits involuntary or forced labor, including labor obtained through slavery or human trafficking. Our Vendor Code of Conduct further requires that the goods our merchandise vendors sell to us have been manufactured in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations, which include those pertaining to involuntary labor, forced labor, or human trafficking. It also requires that merchandise vendors ensure that all subcontractors and any other third parties they use in the production or distribution of goods offered for sale in our stores comply with the principles described in the Vendor Code of Conduct. This prohibits involuntary or forced labor, including labor obtained through slavery or human trafficking. Our Vendor Code of Conduct further requires that the goods our merchandise vendors sell to us have been manufactured in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations, which include those pertaining to involuntary labor, forced labor, or human trafficking. It also requires that merchandise vendors ensure that all subcontractors and any other third parties they use in the production or distribution of goods offered for sale in our stores comply with the principles described in the Vendor Code of Conduct.\n\n**Third-Party Audits.** Our Global Social Compliance Program includes factory auditing. We focus our factory auditing where we have more influence in bringing the products to market. This means our program typically reaches factories that produce merchandise that we have helped design or develop to be manufactured just for us. We focus our auditing efforts on these factories because we believe this is where we are most likely to be able to have a meaningful impact. We contract with both leading independent auditors (including UL, Intertek, and Omega) and other third parties (such as our buying agent) to conduct these social compliance audits and we also accept audit reports from recognized audit sources, including BSCI, WRAP, and SEDEX. These social compliance audits evaluate and address risks of modern slavery. In fiscal year 2022, we reviewed more than 2,400 audits. Over the last two decades, we have conducted or accepted tens of thousands of audits.\n\nWe maintain a Global Social Compliance Manual, which is available in seven languages and contains an audit procedure outline and factory evaluation checklist to help factories better understand our Vendor Code of Conduct and prepare for audits conducted on our behalf by UL, Intertek, and Omega. The audits are conducted on an unannounced basis during specified time windows, where possible, and they are intended to verify the factory\u2019s compliance with the standards contained in our Vendor Code of Conduct, including our prohibition of involuntary or forced labor. To this end, factory audits consider, among other things, whether workers are responsible for any fees associated with their recruitment and evaluate policies related to passport retention. Vendors are expected to cooperate fully with the audits and to provide the auditors with full access to their facilities, employees, and documentation. Factory audits include employee interviews in order to hear first-hand about worker treatment. We recently enhanced our audit program, with additional forced labor questions based on recommendations from industry groups. When we accept factory audit reports from recognized third party audit sources, the audit report is evaluated against our own internal audit requirements to determine the factory\u2019s audit score. The factory\u2019s score on the initial audit determines timing for re-assessment, according to a risk-based audit cycle we have developed. Our\npolicy is to take appropriate steps should we learn that a vendor is failing to meet our standards. These steps may include remediation, cancellation of purchase orders, or termination of our business relationship.\n\n**TJX Global Code of Conduct.** Our **TJX Global Code of Conduct** prohibits behavior that creates an intimidating or hostile work environment, and it requires TJX Associates to obey all applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate, including wage and hour rules. In choosing third parties to work with, our Associates are also expected to select those that act with integrity and in a manner consistent with the ethical principles stated in our Global Code of Conduct. TJX reviews reported concerns and takes appropriate action depending on the nature and severity of the violation.\n\n**Training.** We provide regular training for Associates, including management, involved in the development and buying of merchandise, as well as cyclical training for our buying agent, certain vendors, and their factory representatives around the world. Typically, we hold an average of 10-12 training sessions a year, focusing on various locations around the world that are regionally close to factories included in our factory monitoring program. Among other things, this training provides guidance on recognizing and mitigating the risks of modern slavery. Due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, we initiated virtual training in fiscal year 2021, which continued in fiscal year 2022.\n\n**Grievance Mechanisms.** TJX Associates are encouraged to raise any concerns without fear of retaliation and have multiple channels to do so, including an ethics hotline staffed by independent third-party operators. External stakeholders, including vendor personnel, may reach us via any of the phone numbers or addresses listed by locality on the \u201ccontact us\u201d section of our corporate website.\n\nWhile an overview of our efforts is provided here in response to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and the U.K. Modern Slavery Act, we invite you to explore a more comprehensive description of our Global Social Compliance program within the Corporate Responsibility section of our website at [https://www.tjx.com/responsibility/responsible-business](https://www.tjx.com/responsibility/responsible-business).\n\nThis Statement was approved on 20 July 2022 by the Boards of Directors of TJX UK, TJX Europe Buying (Deutschland) Ltd. and TJX Europe Buying Ltd., which are the TJX subsidiaries subject to the U.K. Modern Slavery Act, and signed by the undersigned Director of each of those entities as of 20 July 2022.\n\nDavid L. Averill, Director\nTJX UK, TJX Europe Buying (Deutschland) Ltd., and TJX Europe Buying Ltd.\nGLOBAL SOCIAL COMPLIANCE PROGRAM\n\nWe strongly value our vendor relationships as we believe they have been a key factor in our long-term success. On a worldwide basis, in fiscal 2022, TJX had more than 1,200 Associates in its buying organization who source merchandise in a variety of ways from a universe of approximately 21,000 vendors and more than 100 countries around the world. Sometimes when what we are seeing in the marketplace is not the right value for our customers, meaning the right combination of brand, fashion, price, and quality, we may help design or develop merchandise to be manufactured just for us. We focus our auditing efforts on the factories that manufacture this merchandise because we believe this is where we are most likely to be able to have a meaningful impact.\n\nOur philosophy towards social compliance mirrors our culture, and just as we are committed to honesty, integrity, and treating others with dignity and respect, we expect those that we do business with to do the same. We have reviewed and incorporated many of the international human rights standards enunciated by international bodies, such as the United Nations and the International Labour Organization. Our commitment to these principles is reflected in our Vendor Code of Conduct, which serves as the foundation for our program and our responsible sourcing initiatives.\n\nProgram Oversight\n\nOur Senior Vice President (SVP), Chief Risk and Compliance Officer has responsibility for social compliance across our global operations, including our Global Social Compliance Program. The SVP periodically reports to our Board of Directors on various aspects of our program, which may include training efforts, audit results, and other compliance-related topics. Our Global Social Compliance Program is part of our ongoing enterprise risk assessment.\n\nProgram management is overseen by the Assistant Vice President (AVP), Global Social Compliance, who works closely with representatives of our merchandise and purchasing functions across all of TJX\u2019s businesses and with the Global Social Compliance Committee. This committee is comprised of senior leadership representing the U.S., Canada, and Europe and from relevant disciplines within TJX, including Merchandising, Sourcing, Imports, Compliance, Audit, Legal, and Global Communications. The committee\noversees compliance of TJX\u2019s ethical sourcing initiatives, and serves in an advisory capacity, helping to\nguide the strategy and execution of the program. Our international buying offices and merchants also play\nkey roles in achieving our goals.\n\nOur approach to our Global Social Compliance Program includes:\n\n**Stakeholder Engagement:**\n\n- We believe that engaging with various audiences and a variety of industry associations and consider-\ning their guidance helps us as we strive to continually improve our program.\n\n**Auditing:**\n\n- In fiscal 2022, we accepted more than 2,400+ audits, which were either conducted directly by TJX\u2019s\n  third-party auditors or were accepted from accredited sources.9\n\n**Training:**\n\n- We offer training sessions on a regular basis to educate buying agents, vendors, and factory manage-\n  ment within our audit program on our expectations with regard to social compliance and to reiterate\n  our seriousness of purpose. TJX Associates involved in the development and buying of merchandise\n  are expected to undergo formal social compliance training biennially.\n\n**Vendor Code of Conduct:**\n\n- As part of our purchase terms, merchandise vendors are required to adhere to our Vendor Code\n  of Conduct and ensure that any factories or subcontractors they use also comply with our Code\u2019s\n  principles. Factories included in our audit program are required to undergo regularly scheduled audits.\n\n**External Stakeholder Engagement**\n\nAs we continue to develop and evolve our Global Social Compliance Program, we engage with various\naudiences and consider their guidance. We have reviewed and incorporated many of the international\nhuman rights standards enunciated by international bodies, such as the United Nations and the Interna-\ntional Labour Organization, and have received, and at times incorporated, insights and suggestions from\ninvestors. For our audits conducted by third-party auditors, we have retained and engage with several\norganizations that have extensive experience and expertise in the field of ethical sourcing \u2013 UL LLC,\nIntertek Group PLC, and Omega Compliance Ltd. Additionally, these groups assist us with program\ndevelopment, education and training, and compliance monitoring.\n\nWe are members of the National Retail Federation, the Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA),\nEthisphere\u2019s Business Ethics Leadership Alliance, Boston College Center for Corporate Citizenship,\nthe Ethics & Compliance Officer Association, and the American Apparel Footwear Association. We also\ncollaborate with various industry groups such as the Joint Forced Labor Working Group, RILA\u2019s Responsible\nSourcing Committee, Responsible Sourcing Network\u2019s Yarn Ethically & Sustainably Sourced, AAFA\u2019s Social\nContinuous Improvement\n\nThe driving tenet of our Global Social Compliance Program is continuous improvement, as we believe this is in the interest of the workers in the facilities that we audit. We expect each of our merchandise vendors and agents to adhere to the expectations set forth in our Vendor Code of Conduct, and we also encourage them to make improvements throughout their operations. To advance these objectives, we do more than test compliance; we also provide education and training to our agents, vendors, and factory management within our audit program, so that they understand our expectations and can develop meaningful processes to meet and exceed these expectations.\nFACTORY AUDITING\n\nWe focus the auditing portion of our Global Social Compliance Program where we have more influence in bringing the products to market. This means our program typically reaches factories that produce merchandise that we have helped design or develop just for us. We focus our auditing efforts on these factories because we believe this is where we are most likely to be able to have a meaningful impact. When we source these products, we require the buying agents and vendors that are involved to identify any active factories that they use, or intend to use, to produce such merchandise.\n\nTogether with our representatives, UL LLC, Intertek Group PLC, and Omega Compliance Limited, we work closely with our agents and vendors so that they understand our Global Social Compliance Program, our Vendor Code of Conduct, and our factory auditing process. Our internal teams also play an important role in educating vendors on our Program requirements and encouraging them to make improvements at their facilities, when necessary. Additionally, we have Associates that support the program in various buying offices around the world.\n\nOur TJX Global Social Compliance Manual contains, among other important guidance, an audit procedure outline and factory evaluation checklist to help prepare the factory for the audit process. This tool is available in seven languages and offers detailed information designed to help agents, vendors, and factory management in our audit program better understand the expectations of our Vendor Code of Conduct, as well as our monitoring and corrective action processes. We require our buying agents to disseminate this manual to their entire TJX vendor base and have it posted to our vendor website, which is available to all vendors.\n\nFactory Auditing Process\n\nFactories included in our audit program are required to undergo periodic audits to ensure adherence to our Vendor Code of Conduct and local laws. We reviewed more than 2,400+ audits in fiscal 2022 which were either conducted by our third-party auditors or accepted from accredited, third-party sources, like amfori\u2019s Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI), Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production (WRAP), and Sedex Information Exchange Limited (SEDEX). We believe this industry trend of collaboration...\nand accepting audits from accredited sources is beneficial in that it helps reduce audit fatigue among factories, while helping companies obtain important information to evaluate their supply chain.\n\nAudits conducted by TJX and our third-party auditors are performed by representatives from UL, Intertek, and Omega. All three of these organizations are members of the Association of Professional Social Compliance Auditors (APSCA), who agree to adhere to all quality and ethical requirements outlined in APSCA\u2019s Code and Standards of Professional Conduct. The vast majority of audits conducted on behalf of TJX are by APSCA Registered Auditors (RA), currently the highest APSCA achievable level. We have developed comprehensive compliance program guidelines for our third-party factory auditors and regularly review and modify these guidelines for consistency with evolving social compliance issues and trends. Factories are expected to cooperate fully with us and our auditors and to provide access to facilities and documents.\n\nThese audits generally include one to two full working days at each audited factory, whether in-person or remote, and include the following components:\n\n- Interview with factory management\n- Policy, payroll, and documentation review, including confirmation that factory management has verified the ages of job applicants before hiring to protect against potential hiring of child labor\n- Factory walk-through\n- Health and safety inspection\n- Chemical and hazardous materials review, including usage information and verification of Material Safety Data Sheets, chemical safety, and hazardous waste programs\n- Confidential worker interviews\n- Debrief with factory management\n\nOur AVP, Global Social Compliance, and certain Associates that support our program in buying offices around the world participate in shadow audits with auditors. Shadowing is practiced to gain a better understanding of the compliance audit process and challenges, and to better aid TJX in our review of both our audit results and, more broadly, our program\u2019s effectiveness.\n\n**Corrective Action and Remediation**\n\nAudit reports are reviewed by TJX and assigned a rating of satisfactory, needs improvement, or unsatisfactory. For factories assessed as satisfactory, our goal is to conduct biennial audits. When a factory receives a needs improvement or unsatisfactory rating, a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) is created and concerns are discussed by the auditors with factory management. A copy of the CAP is provided to factory management to assist them in resolving any violations or deficiencies detected during the audit. To encourage collaboration between our buying agents and vendors, a copy of the CAP is also forwarded to both parties\u2019 attention shortly following the audit. TJX receives a copy as well. Factory management is requested to sign the CAP to verify their understanding of the findings.\n\nFor factories with a needs improvement rating, our buying agents or direct vendors are expected to provide evidence to us that remedial action has been carried out within six months of the audit. However, where moderate to more serious violations of the Vendor Code of Conduct or the local laws are detected, meaning the factory has received an unsatisfactory rating, we require that our third-party representatives re-audit the factory or require a follow-up audit from an accredited, third-party source and aim to complete\nthe re-audit within 6 months. At the conclusion of each audit, factories are notified of the issues found and of the expectation of remedial action.\n\nWe expect that continuous improvement is verified during the re-audit. Our general goal is that each re-audit demonstrates measurable improvement from the prior audit. We recognize that if a factory receives several consecutive noncompliant grades, this pattern may suggest that required remedial action is not being undertaken.\n\nThough we strive to work with vendors to address and resolve shortcomings in their operations, under extreme circumstances, we may conclude that our merchandise can no longer be produced in certain factories, or that they will be precluded from producing goods for us until they demonstrate that they have addressed the situation and have put management systems in place to prevent a recurrence. Our preferred approach, however, is to work with vendors whenever possible to address and resolve issues identified during audits because improving working conditions in factories is an ongoing effort and TJX, like other retailers, continues to face this challenge. We believe this is preferable to ceasing use of these factories as it gives us the ability to influence positive change. We believe that this \u201ccontinuous improvement\u201d model is in the interest of the workers in the facilities from which we source goods.\n\nThere are several issues that we consider to be \u201czero tolerance\u201d issues: for example, bribery/corruption; child labor and forced or slave labor; human trafficking; maintaining a facility with all doors and/or exits locked; use of chemicals banned in the region; and failure to pay wages. If a factory is found to be in violation of our requirements on these topics, we inform our vendor that it can no longer provide us with goods made by that factory.\n\n**Encouraging Environmental Responsibility**\n\nIn keeping with our commitment to protect the environment, audits conducted on behalf of TJX include a review of factory policies, practices, and procedures concerning the handling of chemicals and other hazardous waste, and a review of whether the factory is in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Our Vendor Code of Conduct strongly encourages our vendors to share our commitment to protecting the environment by operating in a sustainable manner where possible, for example by conserving and protecting resources, such as water and energy, and taking into consideration environmental issues that may impact local communities. Our social compliance training program has been expanded to include coverage of the protection and conservation of water, as well as an overview of the legal requirements on the use of chemicals and hazardous materials in the regions where products are both manufactured and sold. Training includes case studies to assist vendors and factory management in better understanding our expectations and our Vendor Code of Conduct requirements in this area.\nSOCIAL COMPLIANCE TRAINING\n\nWe recognize that it is important to routinely train buying agents, vendors, and factory management, and we strongly encourage all new factories in our factory monitoring program to participate in such training. Typically, we hold an average of 10-12 training sessions a year, focusing on various locations around the world that are regionally close to factories included in our factory monitoring program. In fiscal 2022, training sessions were held remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThese training sessions are conducted by UL representatives in partnership with our Assistant Vice President (AVP), Global Social Compliance. We believe the presence of our management at these sessions demonstrates to factory management, buying agent management, and vendors that TJX is committed to our Global Social Compliance Program. Over time, our training sessions have been held in various locations (see map for examples) and have included the following topics:\n\n- Together with our representatives, UL LLC, Intertek Group PLC, and Omega Compliance Limited, we work TJX\u2019s Vendor Code of Conduct and the expectations contained in this Code\n- Local labor laws\n- Anti-bribery laws (including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act)\n- Regulations on chemicals and hazardous materials, Material Data Safety Sheets, hazardous waste management, and required environmental permits\n- Business ethics\n- TJX\u2019s policy against forced and involuntary labor, including slavery and human trafficking\n- Fire safety\n- Water conservation recommendations\n- TJX\u2019s fur practices\n- Factory compliance best practices and preventative actions\n- Case studies to help demonstrate how to embed management remediation systems\n- Open discussions with vendors and factory management on compliance challenges\n\nIn addition to the above, we often include targeted training based on geographic or other regional differences to ensure that we are covering the most pertinent topics for each training session, and we may break into focus groups to enhance training through shared learning.\nDesignated representatives at various buying offices around the globe also provide instruction to vendors and factory management on our ethical sourcing expectations. We plan to continue to devote resources to these important training initiatives and to review and update these initiatives as appropriate.\n\nASSOCIATE TRAINING\n\nTJX Associates involved in the development and buying of merchandise are expected to undergo formal social compliance training biennially. In addition, through informal meetings and discussions, our AVP, Global Social Compliance continues to share our learnings, updating our product development and buying Associates on the requirements of TJX\u2019s Global Social Compliance Program.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we began expanding our training efforts through new partnerships with external stakeholders. Through our sponsorship of the Responsible Sourcing Network\u2019s Yarn Ethically and Sustainably Sourced (YESS) initiative, we were able to offer Associates that support our Global Social Compliance Program access to information sessions about YESS\u2019 work assisting mills and spinners in identifying forced labor in their supply chains. Additionally, through our participation in the Responsible Business Alliance\u2019s Responsible Labor Initiative, Associates that support our Global Social Compliance Program will have access to forced labor training modules.\nVENDOR CODE OF CONDUCT\n\nWe expect high ethical standards from anyone with whom we do business. Our Vendor Code of Conduct reflects those high standards, which embrace internationally recognized principles designed to protect the interests of the workers who manufacture products for sale in our businesses. These principles have been informed by, and in many instances incorporate, human rights, labor rights, and anti-corruption standards enunciated by the United Nations and other respected international bodies, such as the International Labour Organization and its core standards. We are committed to respecting the rights of all workers, including the rights of women and children, who can be especially vulnerable in the retail manufacturing supply chain.\n\nAcceptance of our Vendor Code of Conduct is part of our purchase order terms and conditions for merchandise vendors. While the specific requirements contained in the Code were developed with merchandise vendors in mind, we expect all of the companies and individuals with whom we do business to act with integrity and adhere to the basic principles that underlie each Code requirement. Those basic principles include a commitment to act in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations; respect for the human rights and well-being of all people; and consideration of one\u2019s impact on the environment.\n\nAs with all of our corporate responsibility programs, we are committed to continuous improvement. With that in mind, we periodically benchmark our Vendor Code of Conduct against the codes of many industry peers to better understand the common practices in the industry and identify where our programs are aligned. These efforts help us prioritize additional areas of focus, and support enhancements made to our Vendor Code of Conduct, as recently as 2022. We plan to continue to evaluate further potential amendments we may want to make in the future.\n\nWe encourage anyone with questions or concerns relating to our Vendor Code of Conduct to contact us at complianceofficer@tjx.com.\n\nTHE TJX COMPANIES, INC. VENDOR CODE OF CONDUCT\n\nTJX requires that all products offered for sale in our stores be produced in facilities that meet specific criteria, as set forth below:\n\nCOMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS\n\nOur vendors and the factories in which the merchandise they sell us is manufactured must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, animal protection laws.\n\nETHICAL BUSINESS STANDARDS\n\nOur vendors must not engage in or attempt to engage in bribery, corruption, or similar unethical business\npractices in dealing with government officials or private individuals or entities. This includes, but is not limited to, avoiding all situations where they may have or appear to have a conflict of interest and prohibits offering gifts, entertainment, or anything else of value with the intent to gain a favorable business advantage.\n\nHEALTH AND SAFETY\nOur vendors must provide their workers with safe and healthy conditions, including in any living facilities that may be provided.\n\nFIRE SAFETY\nOur vendors must abide by all applicable laws and regulations related to fire safety. All appropriate measures must be in place to safeguard the health and safety of workers in the event of a fire.\n\nCHILD LABOR\nOur vendors must not use child labor. The term \u201cchild\u201d is defined as anyone younger than 15 years of age (or younger than 14 years of age where the law of the country of manufacture allows 14-year-olds to work). At all times our vendors must respect compulsory education laws. Workers under the age of 18 must not perform hazardous work.\n\nFORCED LABOR\nOur vendors must not use voluntary or involuntary prison labor, indentured labor, bonded labor, labor acquired through slavery or human trafficking, or any forms of involuntary or forced labor. Our vendors must not require workers to surrender any identity papers as a condition of employment; such documents may only be temporarily held to verify a worker\u2019s employment eligibility. Our vendors must reimburse their workers for any recruitment or hiring fees that are paid.\n\nWAGES AND BENEFITS\nOur vendors must abide by all applicable laws relating to wages and benefits, and must pay the legally prescribed minimum wage or higher. Workers must be provided with a written contract which clearly describes their employment and wage terms prior to acceptance of employment. Our vendors must not make any deductions from wages as a disciplinary measure.\n\nWORKING HOURS\nOur vendors must not require their employees, on a regularly-scheduled basis, to work in excess of 60 hours per week (or fewer hours if prescribed by applicable laws and regulations). All overtime must be voluntary and must be fully compensated in accordance with the requirements of local law, and except in extraordinary circumstances, employees must be entitled to at least one day of rest in every seven-day period.\n\nHARASSMENT OR ABUSE\nOur vendors must respect the rights and dignity of their employees. We will not tolerate human rights abuses, including physical, sexual, psychological or verbal harassment or abuse of workers.\n\nDISCRIMINATION\nWorkers must be employed, retained, and compensated based on their ability to perform their jobs, and must not be discriminated against on the basis of gender, race, color, national origin, religious, ethnic or cultural\nbeliefs, age, sexual orientation, or any other prohibited basis.\n\n**FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION**\n\nOur vendors must respect the rights of their workers to choose (or choose not) to freely associate and to bargain collectively where such rights are recognized by law. We prohibit harassment, retaliation, and violence against trade union members and representatives.\n\n**ENVIRONMENT**\n\nOur vendors must be in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations, including maintaining current environmental permits. Our vendors must be in compliance with all laws related to the handling, storage, and disposal of chemicals and other hazardous materials. Our vendors must adopt reasonable practices, where possible, to conserve and protect resources, such as water and energy; and mitigate negative environmental impacts to local communities.\n\n**SUBCONTRACTORS**\n\nOur vendors must ensure that all subcontractors and any other third parties they use in the production or distribution of goods offered for sale in our stores comply with the principles described in this Code of Conduct. Additionally, our private label vendors must disclose to TJX\u2019s third-party auditors the names of all such subcontractors, and third parties before social compliance audits are scheduled.\n\n**MONITORING AND COMPLIANCE**\n\nTJX or its designated third party auditor or agent shall have the right to monitor and assess compliance with these principles. Our vendors must be transparent and honest in all communications with TJX, our auditors and agents. A violation of this Code of Conduct may result in required corrective action, cancellation of purchase order(s), and/or termination of the business relationship.\n\n**REPORTING**\n\nViolations of this Code of Conduct can be reported through the TJX Helpline at TJXethicsline.ethicspoint.com or by calling (US #) 800-TJX-6488 (800-859-6488).\nWe strongly believe that for our policies and practices to be effective, they must evolve and be informed by the perspectives of our many stakeholders, including our Associates, customers, investors, and others. Therefore, we strive to maintain an open dialogue with these important groups to achieve our goals.\n\nEngaging With Our Associates\n\nWe believe Associate engagement, relationship building, and our open-door philosophy are key to maintaining our culture, whether in our stores, distribution centers, or offices around the world. We want our Associates to be informed about our businesses and encouraged to learn and grow through both formal and informational interactions. We believe these efforts help strengthen our inclusive culture so Associates feel welcome, valued, and engaged. As such, we have many different ways to communicate with and hear from our Associates, which became even more vital as the COVID-19 pandemic impacted how we interact in the workplace.\n\nAs our office Associates largely continued to work remotely in fiscal 2022, our in-person communications events remained virtual. We were pleased to be able to continue engaging our remote Associates through Town Hall meetings, State of the Company meetings, and CEO updates. Additionally, we continued to publish The Thread, our global intranet, and The Loop, a weekly e-newsletter, which disseminate announcements and facilitate information and policy sharing; TJX geographic-specific publications, such as TJXtra in Europe; and weekly bulletins in various regions around the globe. Yammer, a social media tool we launched in fiscal 2021 for office Associates to share information and engage in virtual discussions, became more active and helped foster relationship building amidst the pandemic.\n\nIn our stores, we share important company information with and receive feedback from our Associates through socially distanced team huddles and in-store bulletin boards. These bulletin boards also feature store news, like volunteer events, fundraising successes, new processes, and more. We also have programs for Associates to share ideas, including thoughts on how to further improve the customer experience, as well as several in-store programs designed to motivate and reward our Associates, stores, and districts.\nEngaging With Our Customers\n\nOur customers are very important to us, and engaging with them allows us to address their changing preferences, tastes, interests, and concerns. One way we measure our success is by asking customers to rate their experience using online customer satisfaction surveys. Based on what we hear from our customers, we regularly provide Store Operations management with feedback regarding store performance so they may identify opportunities and address issues quickly \u2013 and ultimately improve the in-store experience. This input also allows us to develop clear customer experience training for store managers, team leaders, and Associates. The data has also helped drive broad improvements across many of our retail chains, including redesigning floor plans, creating small \u201cshops,\u201d and changing lighting to better highlight products. We have carefully tested each initiative for how it can drive excitement about our retail chains and products and continue to help deliver the experience we know our customers love and have come to expect.\n\nAdditionally, each retail chain has a website that highlights important information (including our COVID-19 health and wellness protocols), seasonal offerings, store locations, and contact information for Customer Service groups, and for some of our retail chains, the ability to shop online. Our chains also leverage a variety of social media channels for customer engagement and real-time feedback on shopping experiences.\n\nOur engagement efforts are all in place so that we can continue to provide excellent service to our customers.\n\nEngaging With Our Investors\n\nIn addition to our public disclosures and corporate responsibility reporting, we speak regularly with shareholders throughout each year via investor meetings, conferences, phone calls, and written correspondence. Held mostly in virtual formats in fiscal 2022, these interactions allow us to engage with the investor community regarding our Company\u2019s financial performance and on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters. We listen to our shareholders\u2019 insights and perspectives thoughtfully, considering what is best for our many stakeholders and our Company overall.\n\nInformation Security and Privacy\n\nInformation security and privacy are very important to TJX. We have many protocols in place that are designed to help protect the security of our customers\u2019 personal information. The Privacy pages on our retail brand websites describe our privacy policies pertaining to the personal information we collect about our customers.\n\nFor many years, we have maintained an Information Management Program, led by our Chief Risk and Compliance Officer (CCO) and Information Risk Management Director. This program is overseen by TJX\u2019s Information Management Steering Committee, which meets regularly and includes a number of senior\nleaders, including the Data Protection Officer, Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), and Director of Internal Audit. This Committee is responsible for developing and overseeing strategies to help TJX's Information Management Program enhance the overall privacy, information security, and records management posture of TJX. Our CCO and CISO regularly report to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\n\nOur Information Management Program incorporates several components, including:\n\n**Privacy:** Our privacy policies address the types of personal information we collect from customers, how we may use that information, with whom we share that information, how we protect that information, and how individuals can exercise their rights in regards to their personal information. We don't generate revenue by selling personal information.\n\n**Information Security:** While cyber threats are constantly evolving and no retailer can guarantee perfect security, we have a multi-faceted approach designed to reduce the risk of unauthorized access to the personal information that we collect from customers. This approach includes measures like encryption for certain types of personal information, controls over access to TJX facilities and systems, along with other threat and risk-based safeguards.\n\n**Records Management:** Our records management program consists of policies, guidelines, and practices designed to promote both the retention of company records to meet legal and business requirements and the timely deletion of records and other documents, with particular emphasis on minimizing the retention of personal information where appropriate.\n\nIn addition to these components, we perform selected audits and make training available to appropriate TJX Associates.\n\n**Audits:** Our Internal Audit team performs audits that address compliance with TJX information security policies and, along with other teams, reviews certain third-party service providers with respect to their security practices concerning personal information.\n\n**Associate Training:** Privacy and Information Security training is made available to appropriate TJX Associates and is tailored to their job functions. This training is often supplemented with other education, communications, and an internal Information Management website, all designed to help our Associates understand our expectations in this important area.\n\n---\n\n**ENGAGING WITH OUR CANADIAN ASSOCIATES**\n\nOne of the ways we engage with our Canadian store Associates is through The JOY Project, which has inspired, motivated, and built Associates\u2019 morale. This in-store program is focused on supporting the integral parts of our culture at TJX Canada as we strive to create an overall positive environment by recognizing store Associates for \u201cspreading joy\u201d through random acts of kindness, such as encouraging a co-worker for a job well done or assisting a customer. Further, in our Canadian Distribution Centers, our DRIVE program (Delivering Results, Innovation, and Value through Engagement) seeks to identify best practices and efficiencies through in-the-moment and planned conversations between managers and Associates. Our goal in both of these programs is to drive the importance of building strong connections between managers, Associates, and customers.\nInclusion and diversity have long been a priority at TJX. The value we place on diversity extends into all aspects of our organization, including our supplier relationships.\n\nOur Supplier Diversity Program is dedicated to broadening supplier options for not-for-resale goods and services. Since its inception in 1992, our program has expanded to help provide additional opportunities to businesses owned by minorities, women, veterans, LGBTQ+ individuals, and persons with disabilities. This, in turn, has helped us identify suppliers for mutually beneficial relationships and has helped to promote economic development in our suppliers\u2019 local communities.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we expanded our Supplier Diversity Program into Canada and the U.K. and added partnerships with several regional councils to help us identify certified diverse suppliers in those regions.\n\n**SUPPORTING WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESSES**\n\nFor several years, TJX has participated in the Corporate Mentorship Program with the Center for Women & Enterprise (CWE), a Massachusetts-based organization that pairs qualified companies with certified women-owned businesses. This is a natural fit as CWE\u2019s mission of providing opportunities for women in business closely mirrors our efforts to support women in our own workplace. In fiscal 2022, CWE identified a mentoring need at Iterators LLC, an inclusive, women-owned small business that ensures websites and mobile apps are accessible to individuals with disabilities, and matched Iterators LLC with TJX. The mentoring relationship focused on growing Iterators LLC\u2019s business and profitability, including how to articulate business value to clients and enhance marketing strategies.\n\u201cMy TJX mentor\u2019s guidance allowed us to make changes and secure work we might not have sought before, making our business more sustainable. Perhaps the most valuable part for me was hearing my mentor\u2019s personal stories about business, which showed me how similar we are as humans and made me more confident in speaking about my business.\u201d\n\nJill Wilcox, Iterators LLC\n\nSupplier Requirements\n\nTo support TJX\u2019s goal of providing great value to our customers every day, our suppliers must demonstrate:\n\n- Financial stability\n- Proven history of successful projects\n- Understanding of TJX\u2019s business and practices\n- Ability to provide high-quality, cost-competitive products and services\n- Ability to scale their business and services to adapt to TJX\u2019s evolving needs\n- Record of and commitment to acting in accordance with our Vendor Code of Conduct, in addition to maintaining the highest standards of business ethics\n\nCertification and Registration\n\nU.S. DIVERSE-OWNED BUSINESSES: We require certification with at least one of the following:\n\n- Disability:IN\n- National LGBT Chamber of Commerce\n- National Minority Supplier Development Council\n- National Veteran-Owned Business Association\n- Women\u2019s Business Enterprise National Council\n- Other state, local, and federal certifying agencies\n\nCANADA AND U.K. DIVERSE-OWNED BUSINESSES: We encourage certification with at least one of the following:\n\n- Canada\u2019s LGBT+ Chamber of Commerce\n- Canadian Aboriginal and Minority Supplier Council\n- Minority Supplier Development UK\n- OutBritain\n- WeConnect International\nWhile we also work with suppliers that self-identify as diverse-owned businesses, we encourage certification.\n\nAll diverse-owned businesses are encouraged to register on our supplier diversity portal. While certification and/or registering with TJX does not guarantee a business opportunity, it helps us better understand suppliers\u2019 capabilities and experience. We contact suppliers that meet our criteria if we have an appropriate, matching need.\n\nCORPORATE MEMBERSHIPS:\n\nCONTACTS\n\nNot-for-resale goods or services: Please contact our Office of Supplier Diversity at Supplier_Diversity@tjx.com.\n\nResale merchandise: Please contact the appropriate merchandise department at 508-390-1000.\nGOVERNANCE\n\nAs we continue to grow TJX as a global, off-price, value retailer, we recognize that we must remain grounded in the same principles on which our Company was founded \u2013 operating with high levels of honesty and integrity, and treating others with dignity and respect. We rely on the talent and efforts of our Associates, as well as the example set by our leaders, to help us live these principles every day and foster the continued success of our Company. Engagement with key stakeholders has informed enhancements to our policies, practices, and disclosures.\n\nOur Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the business and management of the Company. We believe our Board should be composed of highly engaged directors and that the Board\u2019s skills and experience be aligned with the changing needs of the Company for current and future business environments. As a global company with hundreds of thousands of Associates and operations on four continents, we consider inclusion and diversity to be part of who we are and core to our culture. We look for a Board that represents a diversity of backgrounds and experience, including as to gender and race/ethnicity, and that reflects a range of talents, ages, skills, viewpoints, professional experiences, geographies, and educational backgrounds.\n\nDIRECTOR QUALIFICATIONS AND NOMINATIONS\n\nThe Corporate Governance Committee recommends to the Board individuals to be director nominees who, in the opinion of the Committee, will be committed to the long-term success of our business and the best interests of our shareholders. The Committee considers a range of factors when considering individual candidates, including personal and professional ethics, integrity, and values; independence; and diversity, including gender, ethnic, racial, age, and geographic.\n\nThe Committee seeks nominees who have established strong professional reputations with experience in substantive areas that are important to the long-term success of our complex, global business, such as:\n\n- Leadership and organizational management\n- Retail industry\n- Strategic planning and growth\n- Finance and accounting\nBOARD DIVERSITY\n\n- 82% are independent\n- 36% self-identify as a member of an underrepresented group (race, ethnicity, LGBTQ+)\n- 45% are women\n- 64% are women and/or self-identify as a member of an underrepresented group\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\nMEET OUR BOARD\n\nCAROL MEYROWITZ\n/ Director since 2006\n/ Executive Chairman of the Board\n/ Chairman of the Executive Committee\n\nERNIE HERRMAN\n/ Director since 2015\n/ Chief Executive Officer and President\n\nJOS\u00c9 B.

As part of our governance practices, we are committed to high standards of ethics, which are reflected in the TJX Global Code of Conduct, Code of Ethics for TJX Executives, Director Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and Corporate Governance Principles. Specifically, our Global Code of Conduct, which applies to all Associates worldwide as well as our Board of Directors, details our basic principles of honesty, integrity, and treating others with dignity and respect and serves as a guide for ethical business conduct. The Code is translated into over 20 languages, and we provide periodic training, both formal and informal, to reinforce our expectations. Our Code of Ethics for TJX Executives governs our Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, Chief Financial Officer, and other senior operating, financial, and legal executives who are also subject to our Global Code of Conduct. It is designed to ensure integrity in our financial reports and public disclosures. Our Director Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is designed to promote honest and ethical conduct; compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations; and the avoidance of conflicts of interest for our directors.\n\nOur Corporate Governance Principles provide expectations and guidelines for our Board, such as duties and expectations of service, including commitment of time, qualifications for independence, evaluation of performance, framework for meetings, Committee structure, stock ownership guidelines, and other elements of our Board governance. Each of the committees of our Board of Directors has a charter that sets forth, among other things, the purpose and duties and responsibilities of the respective committee. Many of the policies outlined in our Corporate Governance Principles, codes of conduct and ethics, and other governance documents create an important framework for our core values.\n\nORGANIZATIONAL
