We believe technology can transform industries, businesses, communities and individual lives, and I am proud of our contributions and progress towards this effort this year.\n\nWith this report, I would like to introduce our new Purposeful Innovation Framework \u2013 guiding our decisions and 2025 Corporate Responsibility goals as we use technology to positively impact how we live, work and thrive. It lays out three strategic areas of focus: Empowering Digital Transformation, Acting Responsibly and Operating Sustainably. I provide highlights of each below, and I encourage you to read the full report to learn more about our commitment to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) efforts.\n\nEmpowering Digital Transformation\n\nThe past year marked an important evolution in our long-term vision of enabling a world where everyone and everything is intelligently connected. We remain focused on transitioning Qualcomm from a wireless communications company for the mobile industry to a connected processor company for the intelligent edge. Our one technology roadmap is allowing us to efficiently scale and diversify our leading technologies across new industries, applications and experiences \u2013 accelerating digital transformation and changing the world for the greater good. Our breakthrough innovations \u2013 including advanced connectivity, high-performance low-power processing, AI-accelerated solutions and more \u2013 can help tackle the world\u2019s biggest challenges and enable society to leap forward into the digital era.\n\nThe broad digital transformation at the edge will have a profound impact and we believe everyone deserves the opportunity to participate in this intelligently connected future. We are addressing this imperative to bridge the digital divide by working with a broad ecosystem to deploy advanced technology and solutions at scale and bring programs that strengthen economic and social development to underserved communities globally. Providing everyone with reliable fixed or mobile internet connectivity is a major first step in creating greater access to quality education, entrepreneurial and employment opportunities, health care and other services.\nActing Responsibly\n\nAt Qualcomm, we believe that breakthrough innovation depends on the collective effort of the best and brightest minds. Teams that bring a wealth of backgrounds, experiences, perspectives and skillsets are the driving force behind our innovation, strategy and success. An inclusive and inspiring workplace \u2013 where everyone is welcome and has the opportunity to succeed \u2013 provides the foundation to further expand diverse talent and develop our future leaders. This year, I signed Disability:IN\u2019s CEO Letter on Disability Inclusion, to continue advancing equality and inclusion and to serve as a positive example for CEOs and organizations globally.\n\nAs part of our commitment to championing and empowering our people, we continue to make progress on our 2025 goals. We increased our representation of women in leadership1 by more than 7 percent, our representation of underrepresented minorities (URM2) leadership by more than 5 percent and our overall representation of URMs by more than 12 percent, since 2020. Further, we understand the importance of developing a pipeline of highly skilled science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) innovators. In 2022, we achieved our 2025 goal to engage 1.5 million students and teachers across the globe. But our work and our efforts don\u2019t stop there. As technology and innovation continue to drive a more connected world, it is imperative that we remain steadfast in our commitment to inspiring the next generation of inventors.\n\nOperating Sustainably\n\nWe also see our advanced technologies playing an essential role in enabling efficiencies through digital transformation. Connected vehicles will help reduce congestion and pollution. Smart factories will be able to deploy flexible manufacturing lines to improve productivity and energy use. And precision agriculture will enable farmers to optimize the use of water and fertilizer to mitigate waste and reduce environmental impact. In our own operations, we are doing our part as well.\n\nLast year, to reflect our belief that environmental sustainability is imperative for our collective future, we announced our plans to achieve net-zero global emissions for Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2040 and committed to the Science Based Targets initiative\u2019s (SBTi) Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C. During our first full year of implementing this strategy, we\u2019ve already made progress by reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 4 percent, with a total reduction of 28 percent since 2014. We also joined The Climate Pledge, a cross-sector community of companies committed to be net-zero by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement\u2019s goals. Further, we engaged with our suppliers to tackle value chain emission reductions in a collaborative and open manner.\n\nIn recognition of the positive impact our technology can have on society, we are proud to be included in the Fortune Change the World list for the third time since 2019. The list recognizes companies that are making important social or environmental impacts through innovative business strategies. We are also pleased to be acknowledged, once again, for our leading ESG performance and disclosures in the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index and Newsweek\u2019s list of America\u2019s Most Responsible Companies. Additional awards and recognitions can be found in the Our Awards and Recognitions section of this report.\n\nWe believe in making the world smarter, more connected and more sustainable. We will continue to build on our progress and remain centered around purposeful innovation to create a better future for everyone.\n\nCristiano Amon\nChief Executive Officer\n\n---\n\n1 Global.

Therefore, we primarily rely on third parties to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the testing, of our integrated circuits based primarily on our proprietary designs and test programs. Our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. The majority of our foundry and semiconductor assembly and test suppliers are located in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nQCT primarily uses internal fabrication facilities to manufacture certain RFFE modules and RF filter products, and its manufacturing operations consist of front-end and back-end processes. The front-end processes primarily take place at manufacturing facilities located in Germany and Singapore and involve the imprinting of substrate wafers with the structure and circuitry required for the products to function (also known as wafer fabrication). The back-end processes include the assembly, packaging and test of RFFE modules and RF filter products and their preparation for distribution. Our back-end manufacturing facilities are located in China and Singapore.\n\nRevenues in Fiscal 2022 (FY22)\n\n| Segment          | Revenues (in billions) |\n|------------------|------------------------|\n| QCT              | $37.7b                 |\n| QTL              | $6.4b                  |\n| QSI              | $31m                   |\n| Other            | $134m                  |\n\nQCT is a leading developer and supplier of integrated circuits and system software based on 3G/4G/5G and other technologies for use in wireless voice and data communications, networking, computing, multimedia and global positioning systems products.\n\nQSI makes strategic investments primarily through our Qualcomm Ventures arm that are focused on expanding or opening new opportunities for our technologies as well as supporting the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhancing existing products or services).\n\nOther revenues included revenues from non-reportable segments.\n\nSnapdragon is a product of Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. and/or its subsidiaries.\nAt Qualcomm, purposeful innovation is at the heart of everything we do. It guides our goals and decisions as we take on some of the world\u2019s biggest challenges, using technology to positively impact society. We pursue this through three strategic focus areas:\n\n**Empowering Digital Transformation:**\nWe believe technology can transform industries, businesses, communities and individual lives. We invent solutions that are foundational to the advancement of the global wireless ecosystem, improving how we work, live and, ultimately, thrive.\n\n**Acting Responsibly:**\nWe invest in our people, strive to always behave with integrity and implement governance standards that uphold our Company values. We are committed to responsible business practices, from prioritizing diversity, equity and inclusion, to protecting privacy, to providing leading development programs and fostering an ethical culture.\n\n**Operating Sustainably:**\nWe aim to maintain safe, healthy and productive working conditions and conserve natural resources. Our environmental efforts center on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, optimizing energy consumption, managing water use and minimizing waste throughout our operations and the communities in which we work.\n\nPaired with the ingenuity and dedication of our people, these focus areas guide Qualcomm\u2019s approach to address future challenges, making the impossible inevitable.\nOur Corporate Responsibility Governance\n\nWe\u2019ve integrated corporate responsibility throughout our business, from our daily operations to our executive leadership and our Board of Directors (the Board). Our governance structure is designed to facilitate accountability, transparency and the ongoing improvement of our programs.\n\nThe Governance Committee of the Board provides oversight on corporate responsibility matters, including ESG policies, programs and initiatives. The HR and Compensation Committee of the Board provides oversight on policies, programs and initiatives focusing on workforce and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). The Audit Committee of the Board provides oversight on the Company\u2019s information technology security/cybersecurity policies, risk mitigation and recovery plans and other programs and activities.\n\nOur ESG Leadership Committee reports at least annually on the Company\u2019s corporate responsibility and ESG policies, programs, initiatives and reporting to the Governance Committee of the Board. Our ESG Leadership Committee provides guidance on global ESG issues that are most important to Qualcomm and our key stakeholders so that it remains a central and visible component of our business strategy. This Committee is composed of executives and senior management from functions across the Company, including Human Resources (HR), DEI, Legal, Government Affairs, Supply Chain, Procurement, Licensing, Privacy, Cybersecurity, Risk and Compliance, Investor Relations, Operations and Finance, among others. In 2022, we added new representatives to the ESG Leadership Committee to ensure that the cross-functional approach is maintained as ESG expands into new areas of the Company.\n\nOur ESG Governance Committee implements directives from the ESG Leadership Committee into company-wide programs, measures progress on achieving our goals and reports accomplishments and challenges. This Committee includes managers and other subject matter experts from functions across the Company, including Investor Relations, Supply Chain Management, DEI, STEM Education, Operations, Human Rights, Privacy, Cybersecurity, Health and Safety and Legal, among others.\n\nThe ESG issues overseen by these committees include climate change mitigation and adaptation, STEM education, DEI, supply chain sustainability including forced labor risks, social impact programs, human rights, health and safety, sustainability reporting, policy and regulation and resource management, among others.\n\nDiversity of our Board of Directors\n\nOur Board values insights brought through a broad range of perspectives, including diversity in professional experience and competencies; gender; and racial, ethnic and national backgrounds.\n\nThe Governance Committee of the Board is responsible for reviewing the appropriate skills and characteristics required of Board members within the context of prevailing business conditions and the composition of the Board. Diversity with respect to gender, race and ethnicity \u2014 including individuals from underrepresented communities \u2014 is one of many criteria considered in the selection of director nominees. As part of its efforts to create a diverse Board, the Governance Committee includes, and instructs any search firm it engages to include, women and individuals from underrepresented communities in the pool of candidates from which the Governance Committee selects director nominees.\n\n\u201cThe Board aspires to maintain a diverse composition in which, generally, at least three of its members are women and at least three of its members are from underrepresented communities.\u201d\nOur Approach to Stakeholder Engagement\n\nConversations with our key stakeholders are essential to assuring that our corporate responsibility strategy, priorities and efforts align with the current needs of our business and meet the expectations of the people, organizations and communities that have an interest in our Company. Our primary stakeholder groups are our employees, investors, customers, suppliers, governments and communities where we operate, including civil society and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).\n\nWe are committed to transparency in our engagements with stakeholders to develop trusted and constructive relationships.

We have research and development centers in various locations throughout the world, but primarily in Europe, China, India and the United States.\n\nJust as we make long strides in our R&D efforts to drive leading contributions to technologies powering the connected intelligent edge, we make long-term investments to drive growth in countries and markets by investing in STEM talent, universities, startups and operators and by collaborating on government initiatives and with our licensees. From being a trusted knowledge advisor in spectrum selection and 5G development, deployment and commercialization, to supporting startups around the world at multiple stages of their lifecycles, to developing research collaborations designed to cultivate critical new technologies, to offering tens of thousands of hours of technical and intellectual property (IP) rights training programs, we help broader technology ecosystems flourish.\n\nSince our founding, we have prioritized supporting innovative academic research with a range of university programs helping the academic community to develop new ideas and solutions in a broad range of technological research areas at leading universities around the world. Annually, we engage with more than 100 research faculty, award more than 50 student research fellowships and sponsor more than 70 academic conferences and academia initiatives. In our engagements with academia, we share our expertise and tools across a range of technologies to facilitate research and encourage talent development.\n\nWe also support regional innovation through incubation and mentorship programs that cultivate promising startups in vital technology areas. We offer engineering guidance, business coaching and IP programs and trainings to help startups grow and prosper into successful technology businesses. Our programs \u2014 which take zero equity in the incubated startups \u2014 have a proven record of helping startups receive venture funding, file patent applications and expand their business beyond their home countries. Our incubation challenges are complemented by other Company programs that support startups at different levels of their lifecycles \u2014 including late-stage venture capital investment.\n\nThese Company-supported programs have incubated or mentored more than 162 startups since 2016 in emerging markets, particularly those with an intensifying design talent pool and growing supply chain and local manufacturing expertise, such as India, Taiwan and Vietnam. The startup incubation programs in these countries were launched in 2016, 2019 and 2020, respectively.\n\nIn many markets, we have a special emphasis on helping startups founded or led by women entrepreneurs. For instance, the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 Qualcomm Women Entrepreneurs India Network (QWEIN) programs mentored 14 and 11 early-stage women-led startups, respectively \u2014 representing diverse sectors, including healthcare, IoT, robotics, clean technology, agricultural technology, extended reality (XR) and logistics. The 2022-2023 program will mentor an additional 11 women-led startups.\nHarnessing advanced cellular communication (4G and 5G) and advanced computing technologies (including AI at the network edge), these startups have developed end-to-end IoT applications for regionally relevant products and services in the areas of healthcare, smart cities, agricultural technology, smart homes, automotive, advanced computing, semiconductor design, XR, wearables, semiconductor design, robotics and drones. In many countries, we run the annual startup incubation programs in a competition style format, during which a set of top startups are initially identified through a rigorous selection process, subsequently incubated through a period of several months and finally invited to compete in a pitch and demo stage in front of a jury comprising of industry and government members, where three winners are selected. For example:\n\n- In the 2021 India startup cohort, the top winners announced in March 2022 were Dhruv Space Pvt. Ltd. (a space-tech startup with its low Earth orbit satellite to enable 5G Radio Access Network), Ossus Biorenewables Pvt. Ltd. (with their innovative smart autonomous bioreactor generating green hydrogen from industrial effluents) and Nimble Vision Pvt. Ltd. (with their Ni-Smart manhole product to monitor sewage flow). Twelve additional startups are being incubated in the 2022 India program and are expected to participate in the final stage in March 2023. Separately, responding to the country\u2019s renewed focus on semiconductors, a new program for semiconductor design startups is expected to mentor up to 10 startups in 2022-2023.\n\n- In the 2022 Taiwan startup cohort, the top winners announced in November 2022 were APrevent (solutions for accurately recognizing the speech disorders such as dysarthria), Vossic (with edge AI-based fish-gender recognition technology that can be used for sustainable tilapia farming) and Moldintel (with a focus on advanced manufacturing technologies for injection molding, using edge-AI technology to help factories improve yield). Ten additional startups are being incubated in the 2023 Taiwan program, commencing in calendar Q1 2023, and are expected to participate in the final stage in Q4 2023.\n\n- In the 2022 Vietnam startup cohort, the top winners announced in September 2022 were MiSmart (agriculture drone solutions), VPTech (high-end \u201cMake in Vietnam\u201d portable DAC/AMPLIFIER) and GraphnicsMiner (cardboard legged robot toy kits accompanied with an AR platform). Ten additional startups are being incubated in the 2023 Vietnam program and are expected to participate in the final stage in September 2023.\n\nIn addition to providing the startups with mentorship in advanced technology through state-of-the-art laboratories with expertise and equipment for 4G/5G, robotics and AI/machine learning, Qualcomm provides them mentorship in business areas and training on the importance of securing IP rights. These startups have cumulatively filed more than 300 patent applications in regional and international patent offices to protect their own inventions. Qualcomm is an expert in training partners across the ecosystem on different aspects of mobile technology \u2014 from teaching world-leading handset original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) core concepts that underpin 5G, to explaining the technical benefits of millimeter wave technology to multinational carriers, to training startups on IP protection and filing patent applications. Qualcomm Wireless Academy, supported in part by QTL, is an industry-leading virtual education platform that shares the world-class knowledge and expertise of Qualcomm Technologies\u2019 engineers with the greater mobile ecosystem.\n\nAs a champion of IP protection and holder of a world-class patent portfolio, QTL also supports IP Rights (IPR) training programs in multiple countries.\n\n- In Europe and India, Qualcomm has collaborated with regional governments and other entities to offer IP programs called \u201cLearn to Protect\u201d (L2Pro). These programs have helped more than 5,000 professionals understand the importance of IPR types such as patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets.\n\n- In the U.S., Qualcomm and the Invent Together alliance collaborated on the creation of an online learning platform called The Inventor\u2019s Patent Academy (TIPA), which is aimed at guiding American inventors from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds through the benefits of the patent system and the process of turning their breakthroughs into patented inventions. TIPA is part of a broader effort to foster a more inclusive patenting environment. Since its launch in July 2022, this platform has registered more than 500 U.S.-based students.\n\nIn 2022, we launched the Snapdragon Metaverse Fund to invest up to $100 million in innovative developers and companies building immersive experiences with AR, mixed reality and VR. It is anticipated that the fund will deploy capital through a combination of venture investments in leading XR companies by Qualcomm Ventures and a grant program by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. for developer ecosystem funding in XR experiences, such as gaming, health and wellness, media, entertainment, education and enterprise.\nWe strive to enable a world where everyone and everything can be intelligently connected. As one of the world\u2019s leading wireless technology innovators, we continue to push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible across devices and networks to enable next-generation experiences and drive digital transformation.\n\nWe design platforms, chipsets, software, tools and services that help OEMs and developers bring those technologies into products and create experiences that change how we live and work. And we do this at scale, building technologically advanced, in-demand end products that support everything from low- to high-complexity devices \u2014 helping us serve virtually every industry at the connected intelligent edge.\n\n5G Leadership\n\nOur innovations are driving the 5G standards and the benefits that define 5G, including speed, responsiveness, reliability and capacity. Our products are accelerating the expansion of 5G, and our work behind the scenes is enabling the growth of the broader 5G ecosystem. In addition to consumer applications, such as smartphones, 5G is also bringing increased efficiency across industries, enterprises and educational institutions.\n\nAnd now, with 5G Advanced, we are entering the second phase of the 5G decade, bringing a new wave of wireless technology innovations. 5G Advanced will incorporate machine learning to customize performance to varied deployment and application scenarios, including scalable deployments of XR to power remote work, remote education and other economically transformative applications. We\u2019re continuing to lead the industry in 5G Advanced with our unique expertise that spans connectivity, multimedia, AI and computing technologies.\n\nLooking into the longer-term future, we\u2019re also leading research into foundational technologies for 6G to realize the full benefit of emerging trends in cloud computing, spectrum sharing and machine learning. We believe that the convergence of the physical, digital and virtual worlds in 6G will enable new and transformative use cases across numerous industries, deliver next-generation experiences and continue to address societal, sustainability and economic challenges into the next decade.\n\nSome examples of the societal benefits of 5G are provided below.\n\nDigital Transformations for a Sustainable World\n\nLike the Internet and electricity, 5G serves as a foundation to connect everything, helping to develop a more resilient, equitable and sustainable society. Building on our broad technology portfolio, we\u2019re at the intersection of transformative trends that are creating new and diverse opportunities for promoting sustainability across industries. Our help solutions improve efficiency, enable enhanced capabilities, improve safety and equity, create jobs and much more.\n\nEnabling a more reliable, resilient and sustainable grid\n\nQualcomm is helping to enable the digital transformation of the energy industry to create a more modern, resilient and sustainable grid. Our smart sensors, smart meters and edge gateways offer electric utilities cost- and power-efficient solutions for the monitoring of grid assets and management of decentralized resources, enabling faster decision-making for improved reliability and energy efficiency. Using the power of the connected intelligent edge, network infrastructure is deployed without costly infrastructure upgrades, while security, reliability and resiliency are enhanced. We help utilities and their customers increase the efficiency of power distribution and consumption and integrate renewable energy resources. While preparing for the electrification of everything, 5G, which offers faster data transfer, higher reliability and lower latency, can help utilities accelerate their transition to a more sustainable grid with cleaner energy to better serve their communities.\nCreating safer and more efficient transportation\n\nQualcomm\u00ae Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) solutions, which include vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) and vehicle-to-network (V2N) communication, can complement use of 5G networks and provide direct communications connectivity for low-latency, safety-critical and mobility-benefiting applications. Together, these technologies can increase safety and equity for vehicle passengers and vulnerable road users and advance sustainability.\n\nConnected transportation systems are designed to support new roadside and driver services that mitigate roadway incidents and improve trip planning, transportation mode choice and traffic efficiency \u2014 enhancements that also lower emissions and reduce fuel consumption. Examples include real-time route guidance to bypass congestion, adjusting vehicle dynamics for optimal speed with less braking and idling for lower emissions and fuel use and personal mobility services for additional travel options.\n\nC-V2X applications can improve safety and travel mode options for vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians and pedal cyclists in underserved communities who are disproportionately impacted by fatalities in both urban and rural areas. Cyclist fatality rates are 23 percent higher for Latinos and 30 percent higher for African Americans. Low-income, Black and Latino communities also have higher vehicular traffic volumes, trucking routes, major arterial roads, intersections that are unsafe or impassable by foot or bike and an overall lower level and quality of walking and cycling infrastructure. In addition to preventing collisions for enhanced safety, information exchanged between road users and infrastructure can also inform mobility-on-demand to increase transportation equity in these communities. In rural areas, the fatality rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled is 2 times higher than in urban areas; and the lack of connectivity to support emergency response could be a major cause of rural deaths. Complementary network coverage on rural roads is key to addressing these challenges.\n\nVehicles equipped with connectivity can communicate with their surroundings to enhance safety for road users. Connected vehicles communicate safety information to reduce road incidents and potentially save lives \u2014 a notable example involves providing emergency vehicles the ability to pre-empt traffic signals as they approach, turning them green while also alerting surrounding vehicles of their approach, providing them with advanced notice to safely move out of the way. Connectivity also benefits automated vehicles, such as allowing a robotaxi to communicate with passengers and emergency responders in the event of a malfunctioning vehicle. In circumstances where automated vehicles are unable to understand their environment and make decisions, connectivity also allows for remote driving to support continued operation. Vehicles used for last mile deliveries also benefit from connectivity when operating in restricted areas with low mobility. In addition to cellular networks, satellite connectivity can provide communication in a multitude of scenarios to support safer roads everywhere.\n\nAddressing the digital divide\n\nWith 37 percent of the world population still offline, people without broadband Internet connectivity are cut off from information and opportunities, including access to work, education and healthcare. 5G Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) and mobile broadband can provide improved connectivity and affordability and help to narrow the digital divide. Our pioneering work in millimeter wave and devices with large antenna counts allows FWA technology to meet today\u2019s challenging customer needs.\n\n5G FWA can be up to 80 percent less expensive than fiber to deploy, improving its affordability, especially in developing and emerging countries. It has already been launched in 45 countries or territories by 83 operators. If deployed fully, FWA could provide home Internet access for the first time to 850 million people around the world within the next decade. This would almost close the home Internet divide in high-income countries and connect the homes of 750 million people in emerging and developing countries. As connectivity facilitates access to work, income, information, markets and services, this holds the potential to facilitate global economic growth in 2023.\n\nPower Efficiency\n\nAs each generation of device gets \u201csmarter\u201d more power is typically required. The additional power must be drawn from a device\u2019s relatively small battery. Mitigating this energy challenge has always been a chief focus at our Company, and commitment to power efficiency runs deep in our Snapdragon Platforms.\n\nWe expect on average of 10 percent days-of-use power reduction year over year in our Snapdragon premium-tier chipset from 2021 to 2025. In particular, we improved the 5G modern power by 20 percent from Snapdragon 8 Gen1 in 2021 to Snapdragon 8 Gen2 in 2022. The efficiency and power-savings advances in each processor functional block add up to considerable potential battery run time savings.\n\nWe are leveraging our strong foundation in building power-efficient smartphone devices into all our product categories. Our solutions for AI, vehicular autonomy and network infrastructure each have leading performance for power consumption.\n\nIn addition to fostering power efficiency for mobile devices, we are collaborating with wireless network and service providers in creating technologies targeting improved power efficiency in communication networks.\nExpanding Connectivity\n\nWireless Reach, our technology for good initiative, brings advanced wireless technologies to people and communities who need it most. The initiative focuses on pioneering uses of mobile innovations to demonstrate how leading-edge technologies, coupled with flexible connectivity solutions, including 4G LTE and 5G, can accelerate sustainable and inclusive development.\n\nThrough Wireless Reach, we provide grant funding to support programs that use Qualcomm-enabled technologies to improve people\u2019s lives. To be eligible, programs must address a widespread community need in a strategic market for our Company; be aligned with government information and communication technology (ICT) goals in education, healthcare, environmental and/or other relevant policy objective(s); include strategic stakeholders; and have measurable outcomes and a viable plan to reach scalability and sustainability.

The fishery industry employs 17 percent of Senegal\u2019s workforce (more than 600,000 people), and approximately 90 percent of the country\u2019s fish are caught by small-scale fishers who are reliant on traditional methods. Their catch is typically...\nsold to wholesale fish markets and small-scale fish processors, who are predominantly women.\n\nThe Wireless Solutions for Fisheries in Senegal (WISE) program was launched, in collaboration with FHI 360, to use advanced wireless technology to improve fish catch and processing practices in the country\u2019s artisanal fish industry. The program is designed to make the practices of fishermen and fish processors safer and more efficient and can positively impact the income and lives of those in the sector. WISE developed a mobile application that offers daily information on fish market prices, weather forecasts, navigation resources, microfinance and health insurance calculators and information on fishing and fish processing best practices, among other features.\n\nIn 2022, the Senegalese government announced it will be officially adopting and expanding the program nationwide. Senegal\u2019s ministries of fisheries and maritime economy and digital economy and telecommunications plan to institutionalize the WISE platform and support it in fishing regions across the country. At scale, WISE can provide services and resources to 52,000 artisanal fishers and 20,000 women fish processors throughout the country and be a valuable tool in advancing Digital Senegal 2025, the government\u2019s strategy to increase GDP and create jobs by leveraging digital technology.\n\nAccording to a February 2022 report by fhi360, our collaboration has supported more than 200 low-income economic interest groups (EIGs), serving more than 6,486 fishermen and fish processors by providing smartphones and Internet access to enable them to use WISE services. A third-party final assessment demonstrated that fishers and fish processors increased their annual income by an average of West African CFA franc (XOF) 176,923-235,400 (US$300-$400), respectively, as a result of using WISE.\n\nImproving Economic Outlooks for Women Entrepreneurs\n\nWomen\u2019s economic empowerment is fundamental to gender equality, poverty eradication and inclusive economic growth. Women face barriers to start and grow businesses, including lack of confidence and access to training, networks and knowledge. We have been collaborating with the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women (CBFW) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to implement the Women Entrepreneurs Amplifying Ventures and Economies (WEAVE) program in Vietnam and Indonesia.\n\nWEAVE aims to increase the availability of flexible training and services and develop the business skills and confidence needed for women to grow successful MSMEs through digital technology.\n\nWe supported the development of HerVenture, a free award-winning mobile learning app, engaging more than 12,000 women entrepreneurs. The app is designed to provide women entrepreneurs of small and growing businesses with the knowledge, skills and confidence needed to successfully start and grow their enterprises by offering essential business training and support \u201con the go.\u201d\n\nMany HerVenture users then progressed to the Road to Growth program, a fully online learning program to develop business management and investment readiness skills. Following Road to Growth, women entrepreneurs participated in the CBFW\u2019s global Mentoring Women in Business program, which pairs them with dedicated mentors who provide one-to-one support for six months.\n\nThe HerVenture app was first piloted in 2018 in Vietnam and has since been rolled out throughout the world. HerVenture is highly scalable, can be adapted to any geography or language and has reached more than 65,000 women globally. It is currently available for free on iOS and Android in Vietnam, Indonesia, Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria and Guyana, with plans to expand further.\nClosing the Digital Divide through Education\n\nDuring 2022, Wireless Reach actively managed education programs designed to close the digital divide in Brazil, China, Italy, Japan, Philippines, Portugal, Spain, Taiwan, Turkey, the United States and Vietnam.\n\nThe 21st Century Classroom program is a collaboration with the China Children and Teenagers\u2019 Fund (CCTF), a mobile broadband-based learning program supports the Chinese government\u2019s use of mobile technology to modernize education and reduce poverty, paving the way for expanded access to educational materials, and enabling greater opportunities for enriched teaching and learning.\n\nAs a result of COVID-19, demand for remote learning and online teaching increased, particularly in China. In collaboration with CCTF, Wireless Reach expanded the program by providing 125 always-connected personal computers (PCs) in 2022. More than 200 teachers and 9,000 students benefitted from the use of these PCs in the Quannan County of Jiangxi province this year.\n\nSince 2015, more than 1,500 teachers and 34,000 students have accessed the program\u2019s wireless technologies and teachers\u2019 training.\n\nOur 5G breakthroughs are accelerating digital inclusion by enabling ultra-reliable connections, seamless interactivity and expanding opportunities for collaboration among students and teachers.\n\nOur 5G breakthroughs are accelerating digital inclusion by enabling ultra-reliable connections, seamless interactivity and expanding opportunities for collaboration among students and teachers.\n\nSTEM Education\n\nSTEM drives the breakthrough technologies and inventions we bring to life.

All our employees must strive to follow the letter and spirit of the Qualcomm Way: Our Code of Business Conduct (CoBC).\n\nWe support public policies that encourage innovation, foster the proliferation of mobile technology and enable business-friendly environments.\n\nGoals:\n\n- Increase representation of women in leadership by 15% by 2025, from a 2020 base year.\n- Increase representation of underrepresented minorities (URMs) in leadership by 15% by 2025, from a 2020 base year.\n- Increase overall representation of URMs by 20% by 2025, from a 2020 base year.\n- Ensure 100% of our primary semiconductor manufacturing suppliers are audited every 2 years for conformance to the Supplier Code of Conduct, from a 2020 base year.\n\nPolicies:\n\n- The Qualcomm Way: Code of Business Conduct\n- Global Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and Anti-Corruption Policy\n- Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Policy\n- Environment, Health and Safety Policy\n- Privacy Policy\n- Tax Strategy\n- Human Rights Statement\n- Supplier Code of Conduct\n- Conflict Minerals Policy\n\n18 Global. Regular employees. Leadership is defined as individuals at the Principal and above level in technical roles, and Director and above in non-technical roles.\n\n19 U.S. only. Regular employees. For technical positions, underrepresented minorities include Black, Hispanic/Latinx, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and American Indian or Native American. For non-technical positions, underrepresented minorities include Black, Hispanic/Latinx, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, American Indian or Native American and Asian.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nOur Company\u2019s success is rooted in the hard work and dedication of our workforce. We\u2019re a diverse group of employees from varied backgrounds, experiences, perspectives and ideas. We strive to be a workplace that reflects the world in which we do business. Our diversity helps us increase our global awareness, create an authentic sense of belonging and accelerates our ability to innovate. We will continue building an inclusive and equitable environment where everyone feels inventive, welcome, respected, valued and part of the team.\n\nTo that end, we have created interim goals that we aim to achieve on our way to creating a more diverse workforce. By 2025, we are committed to:\n\n- Increase representation of women in leadership by 15 percent, from a 2020 base year.\n- Increase representation of URM in leadership by 15 percent, from a 2020 base year.\n- Increase overall representation of URM by 20 percent, from a 2020 base year.\n\nIn 2022, we remained on track to meet our interim goals, making important strides by diversifying our talent pipeline and increasing development opportunities for our employees from diverse and historically underrepresented communities. Our efforts also include expanding our global hiring and recruiting practices as well as readying our current employees for advancement through education, training, encouraging stretch assignments and mentorship. We will also continue to engage across Qualcomm \u2014 particularly with leaders, managers and our eight employee networks \u2014 to achieve our goals.\n\nOur DEI Policy highlights our promise to sustain a work environment that is inclusive, respectful and free of harassment, discrimination and retaliation. The policy also highlights our efforts to cultivate innovators who have varying backgrounds, ideas and points of view.\n\nWe\u2019re proud to be recognized as a leader in inclusion and diversity. Our commitment to DEI includes providing equitable pay to our employees, promoting employee development, celebrating various heritage months and special days with our employees and building and sustaining collaborations with external organizations to provide resources and best practices to support our employees.\n\nTo build global momentum in DEI, we expanded our presence in Asia-Pacific and India. This increased representation of our DEI team translated into several successes. In June 2022, we joined The Diversity Charter in Germany, a corporate initiative to promote employee diversity in companies and institutions. The program aims to promote the recognition, appreciation and integration of diversity into Germany\u2019s business culture.\n\nIn October 2022, our Company proudly sponsored \u2014 and our employees and their family members marched in \u2014 the Taiwan Pride Parade hosted by the Taiwan Rainbow Civil Action Association in Taipei. This is the largest Pride event in the APAC region and is an extension of our Company\u2019s decades-long support for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning/queer and others (LGBTQ+) community across the globe.\n\nDEI is also a key part of our internal processes, including the annual employee review process. We train our managers on job-related performance assessment and bias avoidance, broadly gather feedback from managers and co-workers for annual performance evaluations, calibrate ratings across managers and provide performance feedback to our employees. Our open-door policy encourages employees to ask questions or voice any concerns they may have regarding their performance assessment or their compensation. In line with our transparency and open philosophy, we also organize interactive panel discussions around the annual review process to offer\n\n\u201cOur employees and their values in the workplace are important to Qualcomm. We see diversity as an opportunity to showcase the talent and individualism of our employees. Being part of this association is extremely important for us and a step in the right direction to promote diversity, equity and inclusion throughout the Company and the world.\u201d\n\nChristian Block, Senior Vice President and General Manager RF Front-End, Qualcomm RFFE Germany GmbH\nDEI Training Initiatives\n\nEvery employee at our Company is responsible for supporting an inclusive, respectful and harassment-free, discrimination-free and retaliation-free work environment. We have a variety of initiatives and trainings to uphold these values as well as workplace DEI:\n\n- All U.S.-based employees are required to complete harassment prevention training at their time of hire and every two years thereafter. While harassment prevention training is a legal obligation, we have elected to create a live training session that goes above and beyond the minimum legal requirements and includes sections on the importance of civility and empathy in the workplace, subtle acts of exclusion and the impacts that they can have on minority groups.\n\n- We also conduct mandatory training for new hires on DEI as part of the employee onboarding process and provide company-wide access to a library of online and in-person trainings on interpersonal topics, such as soliciting feedback, articulating your value, reducing team burnout, becoming an ally at work, building a diverse professional network and more.\n\n- We continue to empower managers by providing training on topics such as unconscious bias and creating inclusive teams to help positively influence decision-making and people management. These concepts, which are woven into the foundation of our processes \u2014 including those related to promotion and annual reviews \u2014 support inclusive and equitable treatment amongst employees at all levels.\n\n- We offer dynamic leadership development programs such as the Leadership1\u00ae Program, BetterUp Coaching, Women Unlimited, Inc., Qualcomm\u2019s SMART Mentorship and Qualcomm\u2019s Mentoring Matters. These programs provide effective coaching and mentoring and, for optimal personal development, are often tailored specifically for the employee\u2019s job level and reporting organization. They are highly sought after by employees who wish to participate in regular sessions, cohort group meetings and/or networking opportunities. Through participation in these programs, our employees can increase self-awareness and career ownership, and access tools to achieve their personal goals.\n\nCollaborations with External Organizations\n\nOur collaboration with organizations that champion diversity, equity and inclusion are vital to our success in providing additional resources, support and capacity-building to our employees. Highlights in 2022 include:\n\n- We continued to work with the National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT) as an investment-level collaborator to promote opportunities for gender diversity in technology and computing. As part of this, we continued to participate in Technolochicas, a national initiative of NCWIT, and we announced our very own Technolochica. Technolochicas uses the powerful stories of Latinas from diverse backgrounds in technology fields to raise awareness among young Latinas and their families about opportunities and careers in technology. Our Technolochica will contribute to the initiative by helping to promote our Company\u2019s commitment to hiring diverse candidates and will also serve as a role model for future generations of Latina technologists.\n\n- We celebrated our fourth year of membership with Reboot Representation Tech Coalition, including our continued support for Reboot\u2019s mission to close the gender gap for underrepresented women of color in tech. Reboot and its coalition company members seek to design solutions to include the most underrepresented communities to increase Black, LatinX and Native American women\u2019s participation in technology and STEM. These solutions involve developing a pipeline from K-12 schools to colleges and graduate institutions, and to develop skills to prepare these young women for professions in tech. We also participated in Reboot\u2019s inaugural mentorship program, which aimed to introduce Black, Latina and Native American women undergraduates in computing to role models who look like them.\n\n- We continued to be an Inclusion Works Partner with Disability:IN, the leading nonprofit resource for business disability inclusion worldwide. Our collaboration includes participating in speaking engagements for global audiences and implementing recommended best practices across our workplace. In 2022, our CEO signed Disability:IN\u2019s CEO Letter on Disability Inclusion, to continue advancing equality and inclusion and to serve as a positive example for disability inclusion for CEOs and organizations globally. We were also recognized as a Disability Equality Index\u00ae Top Scorer and Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion for the eighth consecutive year.\n\n- We held the Racial Justice Giving Initiative (RJGI) as part of our ongoing effort to collaborate with our employees to support racial justice in the United States. Through the RJGI, employees nominate nonprofit organizations that are working to drive\nsystemic change in racial justice and equity. The RJGI Committee then evaluates the nominations based on pre-determined criteria and selects organizations to participate. Beyond awarding funding from the Qualcomm Foundation and the DEI team, the initiative culminates in a TED Talk-style event for all employees during which the selected organizations share presentations about their work. In 2022, the recipients of the RJGI were ACLU Foundation of San Diego & Imperial Counties; Center for Effective Public Policy; Creating Coding Careers; Friends in Need Children\u2019s Center, Inc.; Front Porch Arts Collective of Boston; Girls Inc. of San Diego County; Greater Than Tech; La Maestra Family Clinic, Inc.; Motus Theatre; and RISE San Diego.\n\nExpanding DEI Awareness\n\nIn 2022, we increased awareness and understanding of our Company\u2019s inclusive and diverse culture by hosting events across the globe and by expanding our DEI programming and activities. After moving to a virtual format in the past two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2022, we were able to again celebrate with several large, in-person events. In July, we celebrated San Diego\u2019s LGBTQ+ Pride Parade in-person with a custom-designed float and 300 participants including employees, members of the Qualcomm Equality Employee Network, family and friends who walked in unity with the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nWe also provided hybrid programming and engagement opportunities for heritage months and days of remembrance, such as Black History Month, Hispanic Heritage Month, Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, Native American Heritage Month, International Women\u2019s Day, Memorial Day and Disability Employment Awareness Month.\n\nAttracting and Recruiting Diverse Talent\n\nInnovation is at the core of our business and critical to our continued success. Our diversity of thought, people and practices is crucial to our ability to innovate. We actively seek and recruit candidates with varied backgrounds and perspectives for positions at the Company. Diverse teams built around different perspectives, experiences and skill sets fuel creativity and innovation. We\u2019re developing leaders and shaping future talent pools to help us meet the needs of our customers worldwide. This means we are taking a broad yet focused approach to finding a diverse group of candidates.\n\nOur approach to finding top talent and our use of training and development as key recruitment tools have helped us increase our hiring rate for women and underrepresented minorities. Highlights of our efforts in 2022 to diversify our talent pipeline include:\n\n- We continued to collaborate with AnitaB.org, which provides women in technology with year-round opportunities to connect with and inspire one another, develop their professional skills, find mentors and gain recognition. This includes participating in their annual Grace Hopper Celebration, which is the largest technical conference of its kind and results in collaborative proposals, networking, mentoring and increased visibility for the contributions of women in technology and computing each year. During 2022, we hosted an exhibitor booth where talent acquisition employees, engineers and hiring managers held 1:1 conversations with candidates interested in learning about our Company. We also hosted a student networking session for candidates, as well as conducted interviews for intern and full-time positions. We welcomed hundreds of check-\n\nPromoting and Supporting Women in Technology\n\nOur Qualcomm Women Employee Network (Qualcomm Women) has grown to nearly 10,000 members in 25 chapters around the world \u2014 representing approximately 20 percent of our global workforce.\n\nQualcomm Women focuses on promoting inclusion of our Company\u2019s women across the globe, increasing their representation, voice and perspectives; encouraging mentorship, leadership opportunities and career development for them; collaborating with other internal groups to further promote their perspectives; and engaging in community outreach initiatives to foster the interests of women and girls in STEM careers.\n\nQualcomm Women is governed by a Board of employee volunteers and is championed by executive sponsors. Qualcomm Women offerings include mentorship programs at all levels, peer groups, executive talks, Lean-In Circles and outreach initiatives. Qualcomm Women also piloted the Male Allyship program to engage men as advocates and champions of gender inclusion.\n\nOne of the signature programs of Qualcomm Women is peer groups, a collective of action-oriented employees within the same department or same function, who work together towards the common goal of promoting gender diversity and inclusion opportunities within their specific organizations. The collective is designed to serve a multi-fold purpose, such as providing speakership opportunities for women within an organization and give women an opportunity to network, build their skill sets and connect in areas that are unique to their immediate roles. As of 2022, Qualcomm Women\u2019s 15 Peer Groups comprised more than 1,000 employees and had organized more than 600 events.\n\nQualcomm Women is a strong network where employees feel a sense of community and can get peer support on facing unique challenges and developing themselves and their careers.\nins at our booth and reviewed AnitaB.org\u2019s resume databases to fill open positions at the Company.\n\n\u2022 We joined the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) 48, the largest conference gathering for Black engineers, in March 2022. This annual convention resumed virtually and in-person and welcomed approximately 7,500 STEM students, professionals and employees of corporate sponsors. As an active member of NSBE\u2019s Board of Corporate Affiliates, our Company had representation through a career fair booth, interviews with candidates, a speakership and more. Specifically, we sent 29 employees to the conference, had more than 500 booth check-ins from candidates interested in learning more about roles at our Company and hosted a candidate VIP session for 75 individuals. We also participated in NSBE 48\u2019s corresponding career fairs to share more information about our Company\u2019s culture, objectives, values and open positions.\n\n\u2022 We welcomed participants in the Secretary of Navy\u2019s Tours with Industry Fellowship Program and the United States Air Force Education with Industry (EWI) Program. These programs offer service members opportunities to learn from leading industry organizations to improve their leadership, management and communication skills, while also providing valuable perspectives to the civilian business world. We champion these fellows and welcome their varied perspectives as well as the insights they provide regarding our efforts to recruit military veterans and their spouses. These valuable service members further support our outreach and collaborative efforts with organizations such as The Honor Foundation and programs such as Fleet Week San Diego and Los Angeles Fleet Week.\n\n\u2022 Through our recruiting teams, we developed focused efforts with Mathematics, Engineering, Science, Achievement (MESA), a college and career prep engine that propels student diversity and achievement in STEM. In 2022, we organized a Shadow Day and welcomed college students from San Diego State University, San Diego City College and Southwestern College, as well as college prep students from San Diego and Imperial Valley counties. We also held a panel session featuring six of our employees and members of the Qualcomm LatinQ Inclusion Group and Qualcomm Black Inclusion Group discussing their experiences and roles at our Company to encourage students to pursue similar paths.\n\n\u2022 We are dedicated to building an environment where people re-entering the workforce feel welcome and excited to return to work. We understand that there are many reasons to take a career break. Through the global Qualcomm Returnship Program, we work with qualified individuals who are looking to re-enter the workforce and help them gain professional experience and build their skill set for a successful career. Previously, Returnship candidates were hired within our engineering teams, but in 2022, we continued to evolve the program and opened it to other areas of the Company.\nEmployee Engagement and Development\n\nBy providing employees with a healthy, safe work environment and personal and professional development opportunities, we strive to cultivate a company culture that celebrates continued growth and creativity. In doing so, we believe that we foster an environment in which innovative problem solving and ideas propel today\u2019s most important technological advancements.\n\nCompensation and Benefits\n\nQualcomm\u2019s success would not be possible without our dedicated employees, and our compensation and benefits programs are an important part of how we recognize and reward them for their contributions. These programs are designed to attract and retain talent and to deliver on our commitment to equitable pay.\n\nOur compensation program includes the following three core elements:\n\n\u2022 Base pay provides non-variable pay based on role and individual performance.\n\u2022 Bonus provides an additional cash compensation opportunity based on Company performance and individual contributions.\n\u2022 Stock awards allow for participation in the long-term success of the Company. Grants are awarded to new hires and to employees in many roles each year based on future potential.\n\nIn 2022, we held regional Compensation and Benefits Town Halls to increase communication and ensure transparency around our programs. More than 22,000 employees, almost half of our global employee base, attended one of the 15 town hall sessions. These sessions covered a range of topics including our compensation and benefits philosophy and foundational components, how base pay and increases are determined during our Annual Review cycle, annual bonus, share-based compensation and overviews of our benefits programs and benchmarking.\n\nLive+Well, Work+Well\n\nIn 2022, we consolidated our signature well-being and benefit programs under the Live+Well, Work+Well program. It is our goal for our employees to be equipped to unlock their full potential at home, work and everywhere in between.\n\nLive+Well, Work+Well has five core pillars: Health, Wealth, Self, Connections and Productivity.\n\nHealth: Our health programs, resources and tips offer ways to help our employees and their families maintain and improve their physical health. We provide onsite health centers, fitness centers and classes, as well as lifestyle and chronic condition coaching in some countries.\n\nWhere applicable, we provide our employees around the globe with comprehensive healthcare coverage, with no employee premiums for employee medical coverage and low or no premiums for family members. We are continuously reviewing and benchmarking our benefits programs to ensure that we are listening to what our employees want and that our programs are positioned competitively.\n\nIn 2022, we:\n\n\u2022 expanded our existing Health Club Reimbursement to provide more employees with funds for fitness memberships, club fees, ski lift tickets, registration fees and other fitness-related expenses;\n\u2022 enhanced our global minimum maternity, paternity and parental leave benefits;\n\u2022 expanded our gender dysphoria medical benefits in the United States; and\n\u2022 expanded our coverage in the United States for travel expenses related to obtaining covered medical services that are not available locally to our employees and their families.\n\nWealth: We believe that good financial health is important for our employees, both in the present and as they look forward to retirement. Our wealth resources provide financial education and strategy so our employees can feel confident about where they are \u2014 and where they are going.\n\nWe offer our employees participation in an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, savings and retirement tax advantaged-accounts, life and disability insurance, tuition assistance, employee discounts, commuter benefits and a wireless device subsidy program, where applicable. We also host financial seminars and provide access to financial counselling for interested employees.\nSelf: We understand that in order for our employees to enjoy both work and life, they need to prioritize taking care of themselves. In support of employee self-care, we provide an Employee Assistance Program, vacation and/or flexible time off, a resiliency resource program, family care resources, accommodations for mothers returning to work and a mental health allies network, where applicable.\n\nIn 2022, we continued to designate four additional global holidays each year to enable the majority of our people to take the same day off, which greatly contributes to the ability to fully unplug, relax and recharge. Since their inception in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, global holidays have been exceptionally well received by our employees as a mental health boost.\n\nConnections: We believe that the connections made with colleagues, family, friends and community influence overall well-being. Our Company\u2019s culture of inclusion and passion for our people and their careers have inspired programs that promote building and sustaining our personal networks.\n\nWe support employee-driven networks, employee-led interest and hobby groups (known as Qclubs), mentoring programs, community volunteering by employees, service awards, an employee matching grant program and the Qualcomm Ambassador program, through which employees represent our Company in their local community and at internal events.\n\nOur culture empowers employees at all levels to recognize each other\u2019s great work and celebrate milestones. Our online social recognition platform, ThankQ, enables all employees to create public recognitions for their colleagues.\n\nProductivity: We believe that productivity means more than simply getting a lot of work done or done fast. It means continuing to deliver world-changing innovations and technology breakthroughs while operating with behaviors that promote balance and wellbeing.\n\nWe provide productivity resources for our employees related to flexible and hybrid work, effective meetings, time management, promoting ethical conduct, managing their email inboxes and supporting inclusivity.\n\nEmployee Growth and Development\n\nOur workforce is our most valuable asset, and our continued success depends on our employees. We prioritize opportunities for employees\u2019 continuous learning with career development programs, tuition reimbursement and mentorship.\n\nOur Accelerate program is designed to empower first-time managers and new leaders to develop skills and knowledge that accelerate their readiness to manage and lead. Accelerate is a global program that is customized regionally to ensure that local nuances are incorporated in the program design.\n\nWe believe mentorship accelerates career growth. We developed the Mentoring Matters program to support career development and engagement among our employees. The program matches mentors and mentees to create powerful mentoring experiences as part of our employees\u2019 career journey. Mentoring Matters includes an interactive eLearning course, relevant resources and practice forums to build mentor and mentee capabilities.\n\nEmployee Feedback and Engagement\n\nWe provide employees with frequent opportunities to share their feedback on what it\u2019s like for them to work at our Company. We hold company-wide and business unit \u201cAll Hands\u201d meetings on a quarterly basis to give employees opportunities to ask questions of our executive leadership team.\n\nWe conduct full census engagement surveys, as well as pulse surveys. These surveys provide employees the opportunity to give feedback and enable management to assess employee engagement. We ensure that every employee gets the opportunity to participate in these surveys at least annually. We use the results to drive change and engage, retain and develop our people. Leaders receive a detailed report of the results for their organization within a few weeks after a survey closes to help them understand the strengths of their organization and to quickly begin acting on opportunities for improvement.\n\nEach survey also includes a relevant focus area, such as inclusion, skill development or recognition. Based on 2022 survey results, programs are developed to address opportunities for improvement. Employee sentiment is continually tracked, and we are pleased to see high engagement scores as demonstrated by the high satisfaction in the following areas (average scores for fiscal 2022):\n\n- \u201cI have confidence in the future of Qualcomm\u201d \u2014 91 percent favorable\n- \u201cMy team has a climate in which diverse perspectives are valued\u201d \u2014 83 percent favorable\n- \u201cI would recommend Qualcomm as a great place to work\u201d \u2014 82 percent favorable\n\nQualcomm Wireless Academy\n\nOur Qualcomm Wireless Academy (QWA) is a robust program that offers training worldwide on the latest wireless technologies. The extensive 5G training course catalog includes courses for every level of learner, from non-engineers and business support employees to seasoned wireless engineers. The training is based on 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards and is developed and delivered by our internal technology experts. Recent expansion of QWA course offerings include training in AI and machine learning and cellular and IoT device design fundamentals. QWA courses are provided in a variety of formats, including instructor-led, asynchronous eLearning and course books.\nHealth and Safety\n\nSuccess in our workplace health and safety programs are critical for our employees, contractors and those with whom we do business. For our employees and contractors, ensuring a safe and healthful workplace is vital to attracting and retaining top talent for the growth of our Company. For our external stakeholders, we understand our obligations to maintain compliance with applicable legal and other requirements by incorporating industry best practices to meet expected health and safety criteria and to minimize adverse health and safety impacts that could be present in our operations and activities.\n\nOur environment, health and safety management system, or EHS Code of Practice, builds on the foundation of The Qualcomm Way: Our Code of Business Conduct and our Environment, Health and Safety Policy.\n\nOur EHS Code of Practice comprises a series of globally applicable business practices and assurance processes associated with our operations and activities. It provides the framework for consistent methods of managing occupational health and safety, protecting the environment, supporting community health and safety, ensuring compliance with internal and external requirements and driving continuous improvements.\n\nThe EHS management system is structured using the ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 frameworks. Our three manufacturing facilities are formally certified by the internationally recognized ISO 45001 standard for occupational health and safety management, Compliance with these international standards is regularly audited and verified by external auditors annually.\n\nUsing our EHS Code of Practice and continuous improvement principles, we look for ways to learn from our experiences as well as industry best practices and share those lessons among our stakeholders to improve safety performance and safety practices.\n\nOne way we share lessons learned is through our incident management reporting system, a centralized global tool that is accessible to all employees. We strongly encourage reporting incidents and near-misses, no matter how minor they may seem.\n\nWe currently have an annual global target for Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR) of less than 0.50 and a Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) target of less than 0.60. We target zero fatalities. We publish our performance on these indicators annually in the ESG Performance Summary.\n\nAs part of our annual compliance assurance process, we require health and safety self-assessments of our laboratory sites using an internal scorecard. Engineering lab management and local EHS engineers conduct periodic spot checks and inspections to assess compliance within the lab environment. In addition, we require regular internal EHS gap assessments to assess the effective implementation of our programs and training, as well as periodic external audits to verify compliance with country-specific regulatory requirements.\nWe have several governance channels that reinforce the importance of safety for our workforce. These channels include:\n\n- Monthly regional safety and compliance reviews of relevant topics, with targeted calls to action to prevent incidents or negative trends.\n- Periodic management reviews of our certified EHS management systems to manufacturing facility senior leadership. These reviews reflect current safety performance trends, review lessons learned from recent incidents, perform compliance evaluation and celebrate improvements.\n- Workplace health and safety committees implement local safety management, safety culture programs and performance initiatives. Committee membership consists of site leader(s) and employee representatives from various areas and levels of the organization, covering administration, operations and engineering.\n\nHybrid Work\nWe believe in giving our employees the autonomy and flexibility to manage their schedules. We welcomed employees back to the office in 2022 and have since maintained a post-pandemic hybrid work model, allowing employees to work from home as well as from the office depending on the nature of their job responsibilities. We have continuously heard from our employees that work flexibility is the way of the future for our Company. We intend to honor that sentiment while also ensuring that, as a Company built on innovation, we preserve our unique culture of collaboration and innovation.\n\nWe are embracing the experimental aspects of our hybrid model. We ensure that we are listening to our employees by asking specific questions related to the hybrid work model in our company-wide pulse surveys, as well as through employee focus groups and town halls, while also assessing overall productivity. We will continue to consider our business needs and listen to employees in order to evolve and adjust the model when and if needed.\n\nContractor Safety\nThe importance of workplace safety and protecting the environment applies equally to our contractors. Our contractors are expected to stop work when they see an unsafe condition and adhere to all applicable safety requirements.\n\nThe key safety standard that drives contractor performance is the Contractor Safety Management standard, which sets expectations for contractor prequalification and contract administration and management, as well as contractor monitoring. Contractors who perform potentially hazardous work must have established contractor safety protocols and procedures that verify qualifications and outline required training for all contractors before beginning work. This includes site- and task-specific safety training that must be completed prior to commencement of the contract.\nIntegrity is one of our core values. As such, we strive to conduct business responsibly and expect the same of those with whom we do business.\n\nAs we continue to expand our technologies into more types of devices and applications, such as Automotive and IoT, the Company\u2019s services and support structures have correspondingly grown. In line with the Company\u2019s growth, and under the office of the General Counsel, we have reorganized our compliance-related functions to address the emerging issues posed by, among other things, new data services by appointing a Chief Risk and Compliance Officer. Our Chief Risk and Compliance Officer is uniquely positioned to coordinate compliance- and risk-mitigation strategies that span various disciplines, including privacy, data protection, cybersecurity and incident response. The compliance function is supported by a dedicated team of legal, technical, information-security and other specialists.\n\nPrivacy and Data Protection\n\nWe consider data protection and privacy to be critical for upholding the trust that our customers and our employees place in us. We believe that the collection of personal information should promote trust, respect individuals\u2019 privacy and be based upon a foundation of responsible security and privacy practices.\n\nOur Qualcomm Privacy Policy provides information about how we collect, use, process and transfer personal data.\n\nWe maintain a privacy and data protection awareness and training program. The awareness and training sessions cover our relevant internal policies and procedures, as well as topics as lawful basis for processing data, transparency, privacy-by-design, data-subject rights, data management, information security and data transfer.\n\nWe provide all new employees with privacy and data-protection awareness training as part of the new employee onboarding experience, as well as targeted role-based training. We hosted a series of awareness-raising events on privacy and security for our employees including our annual Data Privacy Day in late January. In 2022, over 14,000 employees participated in at least one of our awareness or training sessions.\n\nOur Privacy team meets monthly with two internal committees to educate internal stakeholders on changes in privacy and data-protection law and to coordinate the Company\u2019s compliance program and training activities:\n\nOur Privacy Steering Committee is focused on customer and consumer-privacy and data-protection issues. The Committee is composed of relevant stakeholders from such departments as Engineering, Product Management, IT, Marketing, Government Affairs, Public Relations and Legal.\n\nOur Internal Privacy Committee is focused on employee privacy and data protection and includes representatives from HR, IT, Payroll, Physical Security and Stock Administration, among others.\n\nWe prioritize working with business partners and suppliers who view data protection and privacy as critical to their business. In 2022, we performed cybersecurity and privacy assessments for hundreds of our vendors and key suppliers to help ensure they meet our security standards which are informed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework, among other inputs. The assessment evaluates, among other items, whether vendors and key suppliers maintain appropriate security controls in line with the type of information being processed.\n\nOur Internal Privacy Committee is focused on employee privacy and data protection and includes representatives from HR, IT, Payroll, Physical Security and Stock Administration, among others.\n\nWe see value in ongoing external engagement on developing privacy issues. Qualcomm is a member or sponsor of many organizations that work to advance responsible privacy and security practices. These include the International Association of Privacy Professionals, Cyber Information Sharing and Analysis Centers and Future of Privacy Forum. We also engage with subgroups of industry associations focused on privacy and security issues, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Information Technology Industry Council, Digital Europe and 5GAA.\n\nOur participation and, in some cases, leadership, in these groups allows us to listen and advocate for privacy- and data-protection standards that pertain to our business and the semiconductor industry.\nCybersecurity\n\nWe place a high priority on cybersecurity, not only to protect our employees, customers and business partners, but also to protect our intellectual property, operations and products.\n\nQualcomm maintains a cybersecurity program based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework with deliberate customizations to address Qualcomm\u2019s environment (the Cybersecurity Program). Specifically, we use such framework and customizations to assist us in prioritizing actions for reducing cybersecurity risk and aligning policy, business and technological approaches to managing such risk.\n\nWe evaluate our cybersecurity risk profile through continuous assessment of the cybersecurity threat landscape and the operation of our vulnerability-management program. We use the evaluation of our cybersecurity risk profile to determine our Cybersecurity Program priorities. We track and measure these priorities using an associated cybersecurity risk register, which is updated as new risk information becomes available.\n\nAs a part of our Cybersecurity Program, we implement a set of policies, procedures and administrative, physical and technical controls that seek to protect, defend and mitigate effects to Qualcomm from cybersecurity attacks. Our Cybersecurity Program is periodically reviewed for maturity and effectiveness by independent third-party firms and is subject to internal audits. We regularly conduct penetration tests to simulate attacks against our network to validate the efficacy of our security controls.\n\nWe conduct mandatory cybersecurity training regularly for all employees worldwide to help them better understand cybersecurity threats, our Company\u2019s policies, actions and approach to managing this type of risk and how they can help increase Qualcomm\u2019s security posture.\n\nWe maintain a comprehensive cybersecurity incident response process supported by an internal team of cybersecurity experts and integrated with business and senior management. The internal team also engages with third party cybersecurity experts to assist as needed in the event of a cybersecurity incident. We test our processes through table-top exercises and penetration testing. The results of those activities typically include a discussion of continuous improvement opportunities and action items that are utilized to update policies and processes.\n\nOur supplier community is critical to Qualcomm\u2019s success, and we believe in working with our suppliers to help them protect against cybersecurity threats. We operate a supplier cybersecurity assurance program, which is integrated with our procurement processes, to assess and attempt to remediate cybersecurity risks across our supplier community.\n\nWe follow a third-party risk management process that includes the evaluation of cybersecurity-related risks resulting from any integrations with suppliers. Finally, we partner with our suppliers to help them improve their security posture, providing benefits to them and to Qualcomm.\n\nWe have a global team of internal experts dedicated to protecting the Company from cybersecurity threats. Key elements of our Cybersecurity Program \u2014 including key cybersecurity threats and risks \u2014 are overseen by our Vice President of Cybersecurity, the Chief Risk and Compliance Officer and the supporting compliance and risk organization, which includes subject matter experts focused on identifying and managing cybersecurity threats and consequences of same. The Cybersecurity Program is also supported by additional members of senior management and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors through regular reporting and review.\n\nQualcomm did not experience any material cybersecurity incidents in 2022. We annually report the number of such incidents in the ESG Performance Summary of this report.\n\nProduct Security\n\nWe believe in developing our chipsets to support robust, extensible security as a complement to user experience. Our security-platform solutions secure data on devices in both hardware and software for OEMs, carriers and end-users.\n\nWe work to provide robust security features to our customers, and our Secure Processor capability is certified to the Common Criteria (CC) Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) 4+. We support secured development and deployment of emerging technologies. The evolution toward connected edge provides opportunity for more security differentiations on a device. Our portfolio includes products for processors, modems, platforms, RF systems and connectivity, as well as products based on the end-use application. We offer a full range of purpose-built, pre-packaged software, hardware and tools that help our partners streamline their development processes while still integrating security by design.\n\nWe understand and endeavor to support our partners\u2019 efforts to deploy a diverse set of devices. There is no \u201cone size fits all\u201d solution for security, and we are implementing multiple solutions. For example, our Secure Processing Unit (SPU) is a security platform solution on our chipset, which passed Germany\u2019s Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) certification to provide a security \u201cforce-multiplier\u201d and set that security bar.\n\nWe believe in developing our chipsets to support robust, extensible security as a complement to user experience.

Our participation in these efforts allows us to advocate for security standards that pertain to our business and industry.\nQualcomm takes security vulnerabilities in our products very seriously, and we strive to address any security-related issues quickly and appropriately. We educate our developers on secure software design and development lifecycle practices and have implemented a range of security controls to detect and address security vulnerabilities across our products. We operate a responsible disclosure program for invited security researchers designed to improve the security of the Snapdragon family of processors, 5G modems and related technologies and software.\n\nSupply Chain Management\n\nWe place a strong emphasis on sustainable supply chain management to maintain product quality, improve sustainability and minimize risk. Making appropriate supplier selections, conducting comprehensive onboarding, assessing for risks and monitoring adherence to our Supplier Code of Conduct are integral to how we achieve a sustainable and responsible supply chain.\n\nWe want our products to be distinguished not only by their capabilities but also by the responsible way in which we design and produce them. Because we primarily utilize a fabless production model, we rely on suppliers to perform the manufacturing of our integrated circuits.\n\nWe work closely with the primary semiconductor foundries and assembly suppliers that manufacture our products to regularly assess risks and monitor for supplier code of conduct conformance. We expect our suppliers to uphold the same corporate responsibility standards as ours, including respect for human rights, responsible sourcing of minerals, reducing emissions and minimizing use of resources such as water and energy.\n\nAs a Full Member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), we require suppliers to adopt either the RBA Code of Conduct or a similar code. By leveraging RBA tools and resources in our supply chain management program, we can focus on driving our suppliers to conform to high standards in relation to labor issues, health and safety, the environment, ethics and management systems.\n\nThe RBA Code of Conduct, which serves as our Supplier Code of Conduct, and The Qualcomm Way: Our Code of Business Conduct are integral to how we achieve a sustainable and responsible supply chain management for many years.\n\nUnderstanding risks and ensuring supply chain sustainability is a key part of acting responsibly. As part of our risk-based approach, we require our primary semiconductor manufacturing suppliers to complete the RBA Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) annually. The SAQ is a risk-assessment tool that enables companies to evaluate specific supply chain risk in areas such as labor, health and safety, environment and ethics. The SAQ results from our suppliers have indicated that 100 percent of our primary semiconductor manufacturing suppliers have all low-risk manufacturing facilities.\n\nRegularly assessing and monitoring suppliers for compliance with the Supplier Code of Conduct allows us to minimize potential harm to individuals, communities and the environment, as well as create more resilient supply chains. In addition to completing the SAQ, our suppliers are subject to RBA Validated Assessment Program (VAP) audits and/or customer managed audits. Our supply chain management team maintains RBA Lead Auditor trained personnel who conduct on-site audits of selected suppliers for their adherence to our Supplier Code of Conduct and other corporate responsibility requirements, including product environmental governance and conflict minerals. For more on our audit program, see Human Rights.\n\nWe have a 2025 goal of ensuring 100 percent of our primary semiconductor manufacturing suppliers are audited at least every two years. As of 2022, 88 percent of them are receiving biennial audits.\n\nEnvironmental Management in the Supply Chain\n\nEach of our primary semiconductor manufacturing suppliers is required to have an ISO14001-certified environmental management system, and all report meeting this requirement as of 2022. We work with these suppliers at multiple stages of design and manufacturing to help enable their conformance to applicable environmental laws and various environmental initiatives.\n\nOn an annual basis, we assess current and future water risks at the global and local levels using the World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct\u2122 tool. The combination of the use of this tool with internal company knowledge and guidance from external consultants has helped us to better understand physical water risks in our operations, including our supply chain.\n\nMany of our direct semiconductor suppliers provide us with information about their GHG emissions and water use. We use this information to help us set benchmarks for potential future corporate responsibility strategies. Many of these suppliers also have clear goals for reducing their water consumption and GHG emissions, and we work with them to help achieve their goals.\nOur semiconductor manufacturing suppliers have shown effectiveness in many areas of corporate responsibility, especially in product environmental governance. To ensure their continued effectiveness, we\u2019ve designed corrective action processes, including the potential removal of deficient suppliers from our supply chain.\n\nWe believe helping our suppliers build greater knowledge of corporate responsibility issues, such as human rights, responsible minerals sourcing and selecting less harmful substances for manufacturing, can create and improve corporate responsibility throughout our supply chains. We share our knowledge through on-site visits, business meetings, written communication and other efforts.\n\nRespect for Human Rights\n\nWe are committed to promoting and respecting all internationally recognized human rights and avoiding complicity in any human rights abuse throughout our Company, our operations and our business relationships, including our subsidiaries, partners, customers and supply chain.\n\nOur efforts are informed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the eight Core Labor Standards of the International Labour Organization (ILO), the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) Principles and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n\nOur Company\u2019s respect for human rights is enshrined in The Qualcomm Way: Our Code of Business Conduct and our Supplier Code of Conduct. Our approach is explained in further detail in our Human Rights Statement.\n\nWe require all employees to complete training and certification on The Qualcomm Way: Our Code of Business Conduct, including the subsection on human rights.\n\nAs part of our human rights due diligence efforts, we regularly conduct formal, third-party human rights impact assessments (HRIAs) of our operations as a whole or at the market level. These assess potential risks across our operations and/or value chain, including risks related to employees, manufacturing facilities, supply chain and communities. HRIAs help us identify our salient human rights issues \u2014 those human rights at potential risk of negative impact due to our Company activities or business relationships.\n\nBecause we primarily rely on third parties to perform the manufacturing, assembly and most of the testing of our semiconductor products, we do not generally encounter issues with child labor, forced labor or human trafficking in our direct operations. Indirect salient human rights risks exist primarily in our supply chains and with local community members. Although we may not have direct control over or causal relationships with these risks, we are committed to raising awareness of our expectations and working toward mitigating any potential link or contribution to these risks.\n\nDue to our reliance on suppliers, our Company has taken specific steps to prevent human rights abuses in our supply chain through our engagement with the RBA. Our efforts to prevent, mitigate and remediate our human rights risks and impacts in our supply chain include annual assessments of suppliers\u2019 operations in accordance with the RBA SAQ, engagement with suppliers to ensure conformance to our expectations, risk-based onsite audits and participation in multi-stakeholder initiatives.\n\nAs previously discussed, we require our primary semiconductor manufacturing suppliers to complete the RBA SAQ, which includes human rights risks, such as working hours, child labor, freedom of association and more. All our primary semiconductor manufacturing suppliers comply with this requirement, and all have low-risk manufacturing facilities according to the SAQ ratings. In addition, we encourage our primary semiconductor manufacturing suppliers to complete an RBA Validated Assessment Process (VAP) audit.\n\nDuring VAP audits, certified third-party auditors conduct record reviews, manager interviews and worker interviews for conformance to all standards of the RBA Code of Conduct covering labor, health and safety, environment, ethics and management systems. For more information on the VAP, please see the RBA VAP guidance documents.\n\nOur internal Human Rights Working Group focuses on strengthening our management of human rights risks. This cross-functional team includes representatives from departments including Legal, Procurement, Corporate Responsibility, Government Affairs, Environment, Health and Safety, Security, DEI, Supply Chain, Risk and Compliance, Privacy and Cybersecurity. The working group is responsible for implementing, improving and supporting adherence to our human rights practices and for engaging external stakeholders on our human rights approach.\n\nWe are committed to providing remedies for individuals or communities where we have identified that our Company or third parties acting on our behalf caused or contributed to adverse human rights impacts. As such, we have a formal, third-party operated grievance and remedy mechanism, Business Conduct Hotline. The hotline is a comprehensive and confidential reporting tool available to anyone \u2014 external or internal \u2014 to raise concerns, ask questions or seek guidance anonymously.\nEthical Governance\n\nDoing business, The Qualcomm Way.\n\nWe believe that ethical conduct is a cultural imperative, and all employees are responsible for following the letter and the spirit of the CoBC. We bring The Qualcomm Way to life through our culture of innovation, our ability to meet challenges and persevere and the passion and dedication of our employees. The CoBC serves as a guide, helping us build integrity in everything we do as a Company.\n\nCompliance with global anti-corruption laws also continues to be a top priority for the Company. To this end, our Global Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and Anti-Corruption Policy applies to the entire Company, including all employees, agents, consultants and representatives, wherever they are located. It is our policy to obey all laws, including those laws that regulate the Company\u2019s conduct in the marketing and selling of Company products, services and technologies in the international marketplace. We strictly prohibit all bribes, corrupt payments, kickbacks and other forms of commercial bribery involving private individuals or government officials. We obtain the commitment of our third-party contractors and service providers that may act as Qualcomm agents or intermediaries by contractual obligations relating to compliance with applicable anti-corruption laws and regulations. We also conduct risk-based due diligence for contractors and service providers that will act as Qualcomm\u2019s agents or intermediaries with external parties.\n\nOur corporate compliance program (Program) \u2014 including policies, procedures, controls, risk assessments and training \u2014 is evaluated for efficacy by our Internal Audit function regularly. We also commission a third-party expert program assessment every three years to ensure the program is maturing in line with the risks of our business. We use the findings and recommendations from these program assessments to stay apprised of best practices and pursue continuous program improvement. In 2022, our Program was audited by Internal Audit and was also assessed by Ernst and Young as to the maturity of the Program and alignment with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and Securities and Exchange Commission guidance released in November 2020. These reviews confirmed the Program and compliance controls are operating effectively and in alignment with regulator guidance.\n\nEthical conduct and decision-making are expectations of all employees and core elements of our performance assessment framework for leaders. Team managers and senior leaders are encouraged to create an environment where employees can feel free to raise ethical questions or concerns. They are also reminded to have purposeful conversations with their organizations around the importance of ethical conduct and decision-making, as we believe this is the key to trustful relationships with our key stakeholders, as well as the long-term success of the Company.\n\nTraining, education and employee outreach are essential to reinforce an ethical culture. In addition to mandatory Program and ethics training during the onboarding process for employees and temporary workers, we require the completion of a policy training and certification process every 12-24 months covering our CoBC, FCPA and Anti-Corruption policies and Program. These training requirements are mandatory for all our regular and temporary employees. In 2022, we issued company-wide mandatory training on our revised and streamlined Global FCPA and Anti-Corruption Policy to help employees recognize and understand potential FCPA and anti-corruption compliance risks and the policies and procedures that are in place to ensure compliance and protect both the Company and our employees. Ensuring that we adhere to these policies is critical to maintaining our long-standing reputation for conducting business with the utmost integrity.\n\nBeyond mandatory company-wide training, employees who have externally facing roles are required to complete instructor-led Anti-Corruption and Compliance training on an annual basis. In 2022, a total of 60 instructor-led sessions on our Global FCPA and Anti-Corruption Compliance Program were offered and attended by more than 2,700 employees in externally facing business functions (Sales, Business Development, Marketing, Government Affairs and Ventures) and assurance partners (Procurement, Legal, Finance & Accounting and HR Talent Acquisition).\n\nTo gauge ethical culture and comfort in raising legal or ethical concerns, we include ethics-related questions in employee engagement surveys. We target an average response favorability rating of more than 77 percent for the ethics elements of the survey. This target is based on benchmark information that we received from multiple ethics and compliance working groups in which we participate. In 2022, we achieved the desired favorability response rate for employee sentiment relating to ethical company culture and organizational justice. The survey results are analyzed...\nto identify opportunities for additional education and outreach to better understand employee perceptions of Company culture and to raise awareness of the Company\u2019s values and the systems that we have in place to investigate concerns and remediate risks.\n\nWith most employees coming back to the office in a hybrid model in 2022, our Risk and Compliance team saw an opportunity to reiterate the importance of compliance and ethical behavior across our workforce. With the launch of the \u201cWe all \u2665 Compliance!\u201d initiative as part of the \u201cNew to Campus\u201d Open House events organized at our headquarters in San Diego in April 2022, the team welcomed employees back to campus with engaging activities that showcased the importance of exemplifying Company values, connecting with the Compliance team and being familiar with the Company\u2019s compliance program. We also launched the Ethics Liaison program to extend the reach of our risk and compliance program and reinforce and promote a positive ethical culture in our workforce.\n\nIn April 2022, the team welcomed employees back to the office in a hybrid model in 2022, our Risk and Compliance team saw an opportunity to reiterate the importance of exemplifying Company values, connecting with the Compliance team and being familiar with the Company\u2019s compliance program. We also launched the Ethics Liaison program to extend the reach of our risk and compliance program and reinforce and promote a positive ethical culture in our workforce.\n\nOur open door culture is designed to empower employees and other stakeholders to voice any concerns they may have about our Company, without fear of retaliation. Concerns may be submitted anonymously (where permitted by law) through our Business Conduct Hotline, via phone or via email to other reporting groups, such as Management, HR, Legal and Compliance, and we strive to respond promptly and as appropriate.\n\nEthics concerns are reviewed and investigated by a centralized cross-functional team composed of seasoned Internal Audit, Employee Relations, Risk and Compliance, Information Technology, Global Security and Legal personnel. Case outcomes and remedial action plans for incidents that are substantiated are reviewed and approved by our Corporate Ethics Committee.\n\nBusiness Conduct Hotline data, including the number of cases and issue types, can be found in our ESG Performance Summary.\n\nPublic Policy and Regulation\n\nWe have been a committed partner to countries around the world for more than 30 years, supporting policies that encourage innovation, foster the advancement of mobile technology and enable business-friendly environments globally. With each new generation of wireless connectivity, we strive to create shared success in collaboration with lawmakers and regulators, and to create new opportunities for local industries and communities.\n\nWe implement our public policy approach around four key principles:\n\n- **Participation:** We engage in policy discussions with governments, organizations and industries around the world to advocate for policies that promote innovation and protect and foster new ideas in wireless connectivity. We are committed to helping policymakers at all levels understand our business model and role as an ecosystem enabler.\n- **Responsible Governance:** We abide by all applicable laws and regulations regarding political contributions and expenditures, and our contributions are subject to the approval of our senior management with oversight by the Governance Committee of our Board of Directors.\n- **Transparency:** We publicly disclose to the Federal Elections Commission all political contributions made by our Company and our Political Action Committee, and we abide by all legal obligations of the FCPA and similar legislation around the world.\n- **Policy Guides:** We carefully monitor and evaluate developments that affect the world of wireless connectivity.\n\nOur key public policy topics are 5G, invention and IP, spectrum, privacy, immigration and taxation. Our general positions are outlined below and published on our public policy website.\n\n### Key public policy topics\n\n#### 5G\n\n5G is a unified connectivity fabric that we believe will transform industries, create jobs and usher in an estimated $13.1 trillion in global sales activity in 2035. To achieve these benefits, we believe governments must adopt policies that support a comprehensive 5G rollout plan.\n\n#### Invention and IP\n\nInvention, innovation and protection of IP are core drivers of economic growth and competitiveness. Without robust patent systems and strong global protection of IP, innovation would be significantly weakened.\n\n#### Spectrum\n\nThe benefits of wireless connectivity depend on the availability of adequate and appropriate radio spectrum. We believe in freeing new spectrum in a responsible way to meet the demands of consumers and businesses.\n\n#### Privacy\n\nWe believe that cultivating consumer trust through a foundation of security and privacy practices helps drive broader adoption and more personalized wireless technology offerings.\n\n#### Immigration\n\nHighly skilled talent, especially in the areas of math, engineering and the sciences, is vital to the success of our Company and to the future of technological innovation around the world.\n\n#### Taxation\n\nWe support policies that incentivize innovation and enable American technology companies to compete in today\u2019s global marketplace.\n\n---\n\n*The 5G Economy in a Post-COVID-19 Era*\nWe published our global tax strategy to highlight our commitment to being a responsible and transparent corporate citizen. Our approach to tax is consistent with our CoBC and Code of Ethics and is premised on complying with applicable tax laws, maximizing stockholder value and delivering transparent tax reporting and disclosures. We also seek to pay the requisite taxes on profits generated from the activities performed in each jurisdiction.\n\nImplementing our business strategy requires specialized engineering and other talent, as our revenues are highly dependent on technological and product innovations. To ensure that we can attract top talent, we must be able to hire the best engineers, regardless of their country of origin. Beyond fierce competition for talent across our industry and with our competitors, existing immigration laws make it more difficult for us to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign nationals, making the pool of available talent even smaller.\n\nWe engage in public policy efforts to support regulations that are aligned to today\u2019s economic reality. Our Government Affairs team participates in diverse advocacy efforts that contribute to helping us ensure that immigration laws support our Company\u2019s ability to develop leading-edge technologies specifically and our innovation-based global economy in general. Our advocacy efforts, as they relate to immigration laws and recruiting a global workforce, are generally implemented through collaborations with trade associations and diverse coalitions of employers. For more information on our approach to managing a diverse highly skilled workforce, please see our Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Index.\n\nFostering a more inclusive patent ecosystem for all inventors\n\nWe believe that the United States patent system should reflect the diversity of this country, and if we can diversify who is inventing and patenting, we can create more jobs, boost the U.S. economy, close wage and wealth gaps and ensure the U.S. remains a global leader in innovation. We are actively working within our Company and externally to create more equitable opportunities for women and people of color in innovation.\n\nWe are a founding partner of Invent Together, a campaign supported by organizations, universities, companies and other stakeholders that are dedicated to understanding the gender, race, income and other diversity gaps in invention and patenting and supporting public policy and private efforts to close them. With Invent Together, we are advocating for greater study of historical exclusion from patenting and for policies and programs aimed at making patent-heavy STEM fields more inclusive. For example, we advocated for passage of the Inventor Diversity for Economic Advancement (IDEA) Act, which would direct the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to collect inventors\u2019 demographic data on a voluntary basis and make this information available in the aggregate for research.\n\nThe story of engineering breakthroughs by our Company is a case study for how the U.S. patent system helps inventors get their ideas into the marketplace, while funding future risk-taking and innovation. This story helps explain why we have long championed support for strong IP rights as a foundation for future inventors of all backgrounds and why, in 2022, we partnered with Invent Together on the launch of TIPA.\n\nTIPA, which formally launched during the summer, is an online learning platform aimed at guiding inventors through the benefits of patenting and the process of obtaining a patent \u2014 particularly potential inventors with backgrounds that provide them little or no exposure to the world of IP. The educational modules of TIPA are designed to show potential patentees what they can gain from patenting their invention and what the process looks like from the inventor\u2019s point of view.\n\nMost importantly, the free course aims to make patenting more accessible for groups historically underrepresented in the patent-heavy science and engineering fields, including women, people of color, people who identify as LGBTQ+, people from lower-income communities and people with disabilities.\n\nWe have long championed strong patent rights because we know the personal, national and global transformative power they bring. In developing TIPA, we were motivated by the belief that everyone can invent, that every inventor can learn to patent and that strong patent rights empower individual inventors to transform the world in ways that benefit us all.\nOperating Sustainably\n\nIn This Section:\n\nSustainability Goals\n  Addressing the Climate Challenge\n\nResource Management\n  Water\n  Waste\n  Energy\n\nOperational Resilience\n  Maintaining and Safeguarding Our Operations\nOperating Sustainably\n\nOur Approach\n\nGrowing a global company on a planet with finite resources demands fresh thinking. We\u2019re working to be a positive and creative force in protecting the environment by continually looking for ways to conserve water, minimize energy consumption, lower emissions and reduce waste.\n\nWe conduct our operations and activities in a manner designed to provide and maintain safe, healthful and productive working conditions, protect the environment and the communities in which we work and conserve natural resources.\n\nWe work together to fulfill relevant and applicable legal and other requirements and strive to continually improve our resilience and environmental, health and safety performance.\n\nWe believe that environmental sustainability is extremely important, with significant social and economic benefits that require collective action and leadership from our Company and other corporate citizens.\n\nThe Governance Committee of our Company\u2019s Board of Directors provides oversight on corporate responsibility matters, including sustainability and climate-related issues. The Company\u2019s ESG Leadership Committee is composed of executives and senior management from across the Company, including HR, Legal, Government Affairs, Supply Chain, Risk and Compliance, Investor Relations, Operations and Finance. Our ESG Leadership Committee provides guidance on global corporate responsibility issues that are most important to our Company and our key stakeholders so that corporate responsibility remains a central and visible component of our business strategy. This Committee reports at least annually on our corporate responsibility policies, programs and performance, including climate change and water-related issues, to the Governance Committee of our Board of Directors.\n\nPolicies:\n- Qualcomm Corporate Responsibility Policy\n- Qualcomm Environment, Health and Safety Policy\n\nGoals:\n- Reduce absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 30% by 2025, from a 2014 base year.\n- Reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50% by 2030 from a 2020 base year.\n- Reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions by 25% by 2030, from a 2020 base year.\n- Reach net-zero global GHG emissions for Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2040.\nAddressing the Climate Challenge\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we announced our plans to achieve net-zero global emissions for Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2040 and committed to the Science Based Targets initiative\u2019s (SBTi) Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C. These goals reflect our belief that environmental sustainability is extremely important, with significant social and economic benefits that require collective action and leadership from our Company and other corporate citizens.\n\nIn line with our commitments, our strategy to achieve net-zero includes transitioning to renewable energy in our top operational footprint regions via long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), decarbonizing our operations through the replacement of high global warming potential gases in our manufacturing processes and reducing natural gas usage at our San Diego, California, headquarters. We also joined the Climate Pledge, a cross-sector community of companies committed to be net-zero by 2040 \u2014 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement\u2019s goals.\n\nDuring our first full year of implementing this strategy, we\u2019ve already made progress. Our 10-year renewable energy agreement with Shell Energy North America (US), L.P. (Shell Energy) has reduced our emissions by 25,785 tCO2e, or 10 percent, of our total Scope 1 and 2 emissions since last year. Our solar PPA in Bangalore, India, (which began in 2018) continues to make a substantial contribution to our Scope 2 emission reductions in the amount of 15,284 tCO2e (17,855 MWhrs) annually. We are also seeking to enter into long-term renewable energy agreements in our other top operational footprint regions of Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), India and Singapore.\n\nFurthermore, in 2022, we reduced our consumption of natural gas at our German manufacturing facility by 50 percent by shutting down our combined heat and power plant. The remaining 50 percent of natural gas is used in waste air treatment to reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and GHG emissions from manufacturing processes exhaust. To mitigate the climate impact from the remaining natural gas, we offset our consumption through green biogas certificates, which are produced in Europe from renewable plant material.\n\nFollowing the successful test phase of our Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) chamber clean project in 2021 at our German manufacturing facility, we continued to implement gas replacement in all PECVD chamber clean processes. The project replaces high global warming potential gases such as sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) with a fluorine-based gas mixture that has a global warming potential of zero, thereby reducing our Scope 1 GHG emissions.\n\nFinally, we also implemented an internal carbon price across our three manufacturing facilities, as appropriate. This carbon price creates an assumed cost per ton of carbon emissions with an annual rate increase per year, with the objective of changing our internal behavior toward low carbon innovation.\nResource Management\n\nMinimizing water, waste and energy use.\n\nWater\n\nAs water sources around the world become increasingly stressed, we are acutely aware of the need to treat water as the precious resource it is. We prioritize assessing our water footprint and conserving water, particularly in California, the location of our headquarters and a state perennially challenged by water scarcity.\n\nIn our facilities, we make our greatest gains in water conservation by using reclaimed water instead of potable water for irrigation and our cooling plant systems, whenever possible. In fact, we decreased our freshwater dependency at our San Diego headquarters by 51 percent from 2016 to 2022 by expanding our recycled water system. These improvements help reduce our dependency on potable water and increase resiliency in our operations.\n\nAt our manufacturing facilities, we conduct water audits to assess usage and share best practices between our locations. Additionally, we also have an internal price for water that makes the real cost of water usage and water treatment transparent and evident. This facilitates a strong motivation to develop cost-effective and water-efficient processes.\n\nAt our Singapore manufacturing facility, we implemented numerous water savings projects in 2022, resulting in more than 200,000 cumulative cubic meters (m\u00b3) of annual water savings. For example, we conducted a utilization study to determine opportunities for system integration and enhancement, resulting in an improvement of our deionized (DI) water supply systems, which has increased the amount of reclaimed water by approximately 80,000 m\u00b3 per year. We also replaced our water plant electrodeionization (EDI) system with a continuous electrodeionization (CEDI) system, allowing for water to be recycled into raw water tanks, saving approximately 30,000 m\u00b3 per year.\n\nWaste\n\nThrough our Environmental Program Management Standard, we focus on identifying activities, services and processes that generate waste and strive to reduce the impact of our waste disposal practices on the environment. We assess and classify waste generation sources to prioritize our waste mitigation efforts, such as implementing initiatives to eliminate waste at the source and maximize recycling, as well as promoting opportunities to utilize less toxic, more durable, reusable and recycled materials in our operations. In addition, waste reduction and recycling help us decrease the waste we send to landfills.\n\nWe have active recycling and food composting programs, which help reduce waste to landfills at our major sites.\n\nOur Company depends on a robust information technology (IT) infrastructure for all aspects of our daily operations. We take steps to minimize energy consumption and waste in our IT system, keeping costs and environmental considerations in mind. Measures like powering down printers, connecting through wireless backhaul and deploying modular and performance-optimized data centers have made a significant difference.\n\nFurthermore, our waste management service vendors are viewed as partners in sustainability to help minimize waste through a shared goal and vision of waste reduction and recycling. Waste disposal service partners and disposal sites are assessed through a preliminary evaluation and periodic audits to determine sufficient assurance of acceptable performance and compliance with our disposal standards, especially when it comes to hazardous and other regulated wastes.\nEnergy\n\nIn 2022, we expanded our ISO 50001 certification to our Singapore and Wuxi manufacturing facilities. ISO 50001 is the global standard for energy management systems, which demonstrates the commitment of our leadership to efficiently use energy in our manufacturing facilities. ISO 50001 helps to evaluate and prioritize the adoption of new energy efficient technologies and improve energy efficiency, promote best practices and behaviors in energy management, provide a framework for promoting energy efficiency throughout the supply chain, and facilitate improvements in energy management for projects to reduce GHGs.\n\nAn essential element of ISO 50001 is continuous improvement. This applies for the improvement of management processes as well as technical processes. To stay informed, our German manufacturing facility joined an industry network organized by FfE. A research institute for energy economics and industry, FfE has experience in supporting companies in energy efficiency projects and enabling the design of sustainable energy systems. FfE organizes regular meetings between cross-industry companies, enabling us to connect with peers and exchange best practices.\n\nWe have also implemented more than 50 energy savings projects across our manufacturing facilities. The projects range from building infrastructure improvements, such as upgrading to state-of-the-art windows, to technical infrastructure improvements, such as rectifying compressed air leaks and upgrading vacuum pumps, resulting in more than 10,000 MWh of energy savings.\n\nOperational Resilience\n\nMaintaining and safeguarding our operations.\n\nOur Operational Resilience function orchestrates the Company\u2019s Emergency Management (EM), Business Resilience (BR), IT Incident Response (IR) and IT Service Resilience (ITSR) disciplines. The proper adoption of these resilience disciplines enhances our capability to mitigate, prepare for, respond to and recover from operational disruptions.\n\nWe have established a forward-looking vision and holistic approach to operational resilience based on leading industry standards. Our program is designed to provide for agile decision-making in the face of potential threats and during an event. Our approach is driven by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) assessments, Company strategy, and regulatory and stakeholder requirements.\n\nWe utilize a threat risk assessment process to identify and evaluate risks on a regional basis that may affect the Company\u2019s resilience. The threat risk assessment process ranks more than 30 environmental, operational and man-made risks (including climate-related risks) based on the likelihood and impact of an occurrence. We consult with resilience leads based on the potential size and scope of specific impacts. This process is completed annually, with the results presented to executive sponsors and the Governance Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Operational Resilience planning team leverages this data when determining the potential impacts from operational disruptions, documents recovery requirements and devises strategies to allow the Company to continue critical business operations in the event of disaster. Disasters include local incidents such as building fires, regional physical incidents such as earthquakes, or technology disruptions and national incidents such as pandemic illnesses, and events that occur due to climate change.\n\nOperational resilience leads evaluate the effectiveness of plans, assessments and risks identified with training and simulations. The overall program is aligned with ISO 22301, an international standard for business continuity management systems.\n## ESG Performance Summary\n\n### Our Company\n\n| Revenues by Reportable Segment (in millions) | Total | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------|------|------|------|\n| Total Dollars (in millions)                 | 44,200| 33,566| 23,531|\n| QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) Dollars (in millions) | 37,677| 27,019| 16,493|\n| QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) Dollars (in millions) | 6,358| 6,320| 5,028|\n| QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) Dollars (in millions) | 31| 45| 36|\n| Other1 Dollars (in millions)                 | 134| 182| 1,974|\n\n### Total Consolidated Revenues by Country2 (in millions)\n\n| Total2 | Dollars (in millions) | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|--------|-----------------------|------|------|------|\n| China (including Hong Kong) Dollars (in millions) | 28,119| 22,512| 14,001|\n| Vietnam Dollars (in millions) | 6,063| 3,114| 2,212|\n| South Korea Dollars (in millions) | 3,164| 2,368| 2,964|\n| United States Dollars (in millions) | 1,482| 1,606| 1,129|\n| Other Foreign Dollars (in millions) | 5,372| 4,166| 3,225|\n\n### Total Capitalization\n\n| Stockholders\u2019 equity Dollars (in millions) | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|-------------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Stockholders\u2019 equity Dollars (in millions) | 18,013| 9,950| 6,077|\n\n### Our Products and Suppliers\n\n| Privacy and Cybersecurity | Certified Information Privacy Professionals | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| # of                      | 11                                          | 10   | 8    |\n\n| Privacy training hours | # of | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|------------------------|------|------|------|------|\n| # of                   | 2,377| 1,463| 1,309|\n\n| Targeted employees trained in privacy3 | # of | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|---------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|\n| # of                                  | 14,011| 3,180| NR   |\n\n| Employees trained in cybersecurity | # of | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|\n| # of                               | 43,509| 41,329| 38,320|\n\n---\n\n1. Certain revenues (and reduction to revenues) were not allocated to our segments in our management reports because they were not considered in evaluating segment results. Unallocated revenues in fiscal 2020 were comprised of licensing revenues from Huawei resulting from the settlement agreement and royalties for sales made in the March 2020 and June 2020 quarters under the new global patent license agreement.\n\n2. We report revenues from external customers by country based on the location to which our products or services are delivered, which for QCT is generally the country in which our customers manufacture their products, and for licensing revenues, the invoiced addresses of our licensees. As a result, the revenues by country presented herein are not necessarily indicative of either the country in which the devices containing our products and/or intellectual property are ultimately sold to consumers or the country in which the companies that sell the devices are headquartered. For example, China revenues could include revenues related to shipments of integrated circuits for a company that is headquartered in South Korea but that manufactures devices in China, which devices are then sold to consumers in Europe and/or the United States.\n\n3.

(2) emission reduction targets, and (3) an analysis of performance against those targets Discussion & analysis | (1) Discussion of long-term and short-term strategy or plan to manage Scope 1 emissions. Other than for our RF front-end modules and RF filter products, our QCT semiconductor business utilizes a fabless production model, which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made. Because we are primarily fabless, our Scope 2 emissions are more significant than our Scope 1 emissions. Thus, our GHG goals represent a company-wide absolute target related to both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. We believe that climate change is a serious environmental, social and economic threat that calls for immediate and concerted action among all sectors of society. That\u2019s why we expanded our commitment to reducing our operational GHG emissions to our value chain and ensured our new targets were aligned to the latest climate science by committing to and joining the Science-Based Targets Initiative: \u2022 To reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50% by 2030 from 2020 base year \u2022 To reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions by 25% by 2030 from 2020 base year \u2022 To reach net-zero global operational GHG emissions for Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2040 We also maintain our 2025 GHG reduction goal, consistent with science-based reductions required to keep global warming well below 2\u00b0C, to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 30% compared to a 2014 base year. Balancing these ambitions while also growing a global Company demands forward thinking. Our three-part emissions mitigation strategy to meet these targets includes transitioning to renewable energy in top operational footprint regions via long term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), decarbonizing our operations through the replacement of high global warming potential gases in our manufacturing processes and transitioning our cogeneration plants at our San Diego, California headquarters to back-up power, and a minimal amount of Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) and carbon offsets for residual emissions. |\n| Topic | SASB Code | Metric | Response |\n|-------|-----------|--------|----------|\n| Greenhouse Gas Emissions (continued) | TC-SC-110a.2 | (1) Discussion of long-term and short-term strategy or plan to manage Scope 1 emissions, (2) emission reduction targets, and (3) an analysis of performance against those targets | (2) emissions reduction targets  \nType: Absolute Target  \nTarget coverage: Company-wide Scope(s): 1+2 (market-based)  \nTargeted reduction from base year (%): 30 percent  \nTimelines: Base year: 2014; Start year: 2015; Target year: 2025  \n% of target achieved: 28 percent  \nBase year emissions covered by target (metric tons CO\u2082e): 368,547 tCO\u2082e Scope 1: 121,977 tCO\u2082e Scope 2 market-based: 246,550 tCO\u2082e  \nTarget status: Underway  \n(3) an analysis of performance against those targets  \nWe are on track to meet our 2025 GHG goal and achieved a reduction of approximately 28 percent. One of the ways we are achieving our GHG reduction is by designing energy efficiencies into our facilities infrastructure. As part of these efforts, we have successfully completed the test phase of a Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) chamber cleans project. The project, conducted at our German manufacturing facility, replaces high global warming potential gases used in our processes, such as SF\u2086 and NF\u2083, with a Fluorine-based gas mixture that has a global warming potential of zero, thereby greatly reducing our direct Scope 1 emissions.  \nIn 2021, we signed a 10-year structured renewable energy agreement with Shell Energy North America (US), L.P. (Shell Energy). The deal enables us to secure approximately 115,000 megawatt-hours of 100% renewable energy annually to power our headquarters campus in San Diego, reducing our Scope 2 emissions. The agreement includes an annually increasing portion of renewable power and RECs generated from resources located in California. It also supports the further development of the Shell Maverick 4 and Maverick 7 solar installations, which will improve the mix of green energy sources flowing into the California Independent System Operator (ISO) grid.  \nAdditionally, our manufacturing facilities in China, Germany and Singapore have been International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 (Environmental Management System Standard) certified since 1999 and ISO 45001 (Occupational Health and Safety standard) certified since January 2021. Our facility in Germany has obtained ISO 50001 (Energy Management System standard) certification since 2014, and we plan to expand this certification to our Singapore and China facilities by 2023.  \nQualcomm\u2019s strategy for complying with regulatory carbon trading systems in both California and the EU is to follow all applicable guidance and directives issued by the California and EU systems.

We integrate environment, health and safety (EHS) principles and practices into our everyday operations, ensuring a safe and healthy workplace for our employees, contractors, visitors and communities.  \nOur EHS Policy highlights our commitment to proactively manage workplace health and safety risks while continually improving our established management system. We maintain compliance with applicable legal and other requirements, regularly monitor and improve EHS performance, mitigate hazards and risks and incorporate industry best practices. The EHS Policy also provides a framework for setting and reviewing EHS objectives.  \nOur EHS governance framework and global EHS management system, which are overseen at the highest levels of the Company, enable us to effectively manage risk, ensure regulatory compliance and address the health and safety needs of our employees and contractors. Starting with our EHS Policy as the foundation, our EHS management system (code of practice) comprises of a series of globally applicable Core Principles, Standards and assurance processes that are structured using the ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 frameworks as a foundation.  \nThe EHS Code of Practice serves as a guide for developing a broad range of programs for the protection of workers and the environment into our day-to-day business management systems. It provides the framework to establish an overall strategy and an organizational structure for managing Qualcomm EHS program.  \nQualcomm requires all its worldwide offices, labs and manufacturing facilities to apply the EHS Code of Practice to avoid, mitigate and manage health and safety risks. The EHS Code of Practice is periodically reviewed and updated to maintain alignment with industry best practice and applicable federal and state laws and regulations, and ensure continuous improvement.  \nQualcomm sites are required to conduct self-assessments as part of our annual compliance assurance process. Lab management and local EHS engineers conduct more frequent spot checks and inspections to assess compliance. In addition, we require regular internal EHS audits to verify the effective implementation of our EHS programs, as well as periodic external audits to verify the compliance status of country-specific regulatory requirements.  \nParticularly for our manufacturing facilities, which demand the usage of hazardous substances to produce wafers, we conduct risk assessments for all workplaces and production sites to attempt to mitigate risks from these substances and to control other risks from our manufacturing activities. Any applicable threshold of dangerous substances is regularly monitored. This applies to workstations of our employees as well as emissions to our environment. In addition, we are continuously checking possibilities and options for substitution of hazardous substances with materials of lower risk characteristics. Regardless, any new substances undergo extensive review and approval processes before application can begin.  \nFor more information on Qualcomm\u2019s Environment, Health and Safety Code of Practice: [https://www.qualcomm.com/company/corporate-responsibility/responsible-business/sustainable-product-design/environment/health-and-safety](https://www.qualcomm.com/company/corporate-responsibility/responsible-business/sustainable-product-design/environment/health-and-safety)  \nFor more information on Qualcomm\u2019s Environment, Health and Safety Policy: [https://www.qualcomm.com/media/documents/files/environment-health-and-safety-policy.pdf](https://www.qualcomm.com/media/documents/files/environment-health-and-safety-policy.pdf) |\n| Topic | SASB Code | Metric | Response |\n|-------|-----------|--------|----------|\n| Employee Health & Safety (continued) | TC-SC-320a.1 | Description of efforts to assess, monitor and reduce exposure of employees to human health hazards | Product Responsibility  \nAt Qualcomm, we address the sustainability of our products through the Company\u2019s Environmental Management System and various hazardous substance elimination programs.

For example, the Snapdragon 5G Mobile Platforms feature a comprehensive modem-to-antenna system solution for 5G multimode devices, designed to intelligently work together to consistently deliver high cellular speeds, superior coverage and outstanding power efficiency across numerous applications. Similarly, Qualcomm C-V2X technology is designed to enable vehicles to communicate with each other and with their surroundings and promote improved safety, traffic efficiency and support for automated vehicles. This technology allows vehicles to work closely with traffic signal controllers, which can help reduce carbon emissions and improve traffic efficiency.\n\nOpportunity type and driver: Resources efficiency through the use of more efficient production and distribution processes.\nPrimary potential impact: Reduced indirect (operating) costs.\nDescription: Recognizing the growing importance of efficient, low-emission operations, Qualcomm has implemented a number of more efficient building systems across its facilities portfolio.\n\nIn 2020, we conducted our first company-wide climate scenario analysis (CSA). Our qualitative evaluation included 1.5\u00b0C, 2\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C warming scenarios. Under the 4\u00b0C scenario, global warming reaches 4\u00b0C by 2100, relative to pre-industrial temperatures, and climate policy is less ambitious. In the 2\u00b0C scenario, global warming reaches 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, and climate policy is more aggressive compared to the 4\u00b0C policy. In the 1.5\u00b0C scenario, global warming will be limited to rising well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century, and it is generally assumed that society will act rapidly to limit GHG emissions. We assessed a limited set of risks: price of carbon (transition risk), coastal flooding, high heat days, water stress, extreme cold days, average temperature and air pollution (physical risks).\n\nAs we evaluated the possible impacts to our Company under these three scenarios, we focused on the potential for increased operating costs and increased business interruption across our operations. We leveraged standardized, third-party climate modeling data, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), and applied internal data sources such as our global GHG emissions, water use and facilities data.\n\nPotential Impacts:\n\n- Water stress in India, China, Germany, Singapore and the United States, where high-value operations are located, may pose an escalating risk of business interruption and increased operating costs, regardless of the future climate warming scenario.\n- An increased number of high heat days in the United States, Singapore and India may pose an escalating risk of business interruption and increased operating costs in both 4\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C CSAs but is expected to occur earlier and be greater in magnitude in the 4\u00b0C CSA.\n- An increase in average temperatures in the United States and Germany may pose an escalating risk of business interruption and increased operating costs in both 4\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C CSAs but is expected to occur earlier and be greater in magnitude in the 4\u00b0C CSA.\n- Coastal flooding and sea level rise threaten cities in Taiwan, China, India, the United States and the United Kingdom with an escalating risk of business interruption and increased operating costs, regardless of the future climate warming scenario.\n| TCFD Recommendation | Qualcomm Disclosure | Disclosure Source |\n|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| c) Describe the potential impact of different scenarios, including a 2\u00b0C scenario, on the organization\u2019s businesses, strategy and financial planning. (continued) | Potential Impacts:  \n\u2022 Workforce exposure to air pollution in the United States, China and India may continue to pose a moderate risk of business interruption and increased operating costs, regardless of the future climate warming scenario.  \n\u2022 The risk of increased operating costs due to the price of carbon primarily occurs for facilities in Germany and China in the 4\u00b0C CSA and the 2\u00b0C CSA. This risk is greater in magnitude in the 1.5\u00b0C CSA for high-emissions facilities in India, China and the United States. Based on the results of this analysis, we don\u2019t recognize any current material risks and, therefore, have not initiated any immediate mitigation pathways. We plan to continue to monitor these assessments on a regular basis to stay ahead of any emerging risks. | Information on our climate scenario analysis can be found on our Corporate Responsibility Website and in our 2020 Corporate Responsibility Report. |\n\n| Risk Management: Disclose how the organization identifies, assesses and manages climate-related risks | To determine which risks and/or opportunities could have a substantive financial or strategic impact, potential risks are classified either as company-level, when evaluated during the materiality assessment process (see below), or asset-level, when evaluated through Qualcomm\u2019s Business Continuity Program.  \nCompany-level risks: Qualcomm regularly conducts materiality assessments to determine which corporate responsibility impacts we consider to be substantive at the corporate level. During the materiality assessment process, risks are evaluated based on a combined score from two indices of importance: importance to business success and importance to stakeholders. Importance to business success includes considerations such as impact on manufacturing and operations, technology and innovation, revenues and cost. Importance to stakeholders includes considerations such as governmental regulations, environmental agreements and corporate responsibility-related investment decisions. Materiality is determined by combining a risk\u2019s scores on a variety of business and environmental indices according to a proprietary weighting formula. A risk is considered to be material, in part, if it has a significant impact in any of these categories, and the magnitude of corporate responsibility risks (including climate-related risks) are considered with equal weight as the risk\u2019s importance to business success.  \nAsset-level risks: Qualcomm\u2019s Operational Resilience Program utilizes a risk/hazard assessment process to identify and evaluate asset-level risks on a regional basis. The risk/hazard assessment process ranks man-made and environmental risks (including climate-related risks) using quantifiable resources to determine the likelihood of occurrence. Consultation with site leads is conducted to rate the potential size and scope of specific impacts. This process is completed on a recurring basis, and the outputs are presented to the regional business continuity management teams. Qualcomm manages risks based on the outcome of the risk analysis conducted. The Operational Resilience Program helps document recovery guidelines and procedures to allow Qualcomm to continue critical business functions in the event of disaster. Disasters include local incidents, such as building fires, regional physical incidents, such as earthquakes, and national incidents, such as pandemic illnesses and impacts based on climate change. The output is presented to the regional operational resilience management teams. Those management teams utilize the risk assessment process to mitigate, insure or accept asset risks. In addition to risk management through the Operational Resilience Program process, Qualcomm also uses the results of annual sensitivity analyses around each identified risk to inform its strategic planning. | 2022 CDP Climate Change Survey C2.2, C2.2a |\nTCFD Recommendation\n\nQualcomm Disclosure\n\nMetrics and Targets: Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant climate-related risks and opportunities\n\na) Disclose the metrics used by the organization to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk-management process.\nb) Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2 and, if appropriate, Scope 3 GHG emissions and the related risks.\nc) Describe the targets used by the organization to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets.\n\n|                      | CO\u2082e Metric Tons 2022 | CO\u2082e Metric Tons 2021** | CO\u2082e Metric Tons 2020* |\n|----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|\n| Total Scope 1 \u2014 Direct GHG Emissions by Weight (includes purchased carbon offsets). | 104,850 | 106,659 | 112,479 |\n| Total Scope 2 \u2014 Indirect GHG Emissions by Weight (market-based: emission factors where available and purchased International renewable Energy Certificates and Emission Reduction Credits) | 160,417 | 171,932 | 203,047 |\n| Total Scope 3 \u2014 Other Indirect GHG Emissions by Weight | 6,394,094 | 3,745,914 | 2,752,259 |\n\n*In 2020 we expanded our reporting of Scope 3 emissions to include upstream and downstream transportation and distribution, waste generated in operations, business travel and employee commuting.\n\n**In 2021, we expanded our reporting of Scope 3 emissions to include all relevant sources: purchased goods and services, capital goods, fuel and energy related activities, upstream and downstream transportation and distribution, waste generated in operations, business travel, employee commuting, use of sold products and end-of-life treatment of sold products.\n\nWe continually look for ways to reduce our GHG emissions.
