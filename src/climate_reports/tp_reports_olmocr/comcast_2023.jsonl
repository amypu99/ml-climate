Over our nearly 60 years, that commitment has not only grown but evolved to support society\u2019s most pressing needs. In 2022, our wonderful teammates around the world \u2014 together with many incredible partners \u2014 worked purposefully and tirelessly to advance digital equity, champion diversity and inclusion, and foster a cleaner environment.\n\nWe entered 2023 with great momentum, energized to continue our mission. We have now fully allocated our multi-year $100 million pledge to social justice and equality, and will continue this important initiative through Project UP, our $1 billion plan to connect people to the Internet, invest in access to digital skills, and strengthen pathways to economic mobility.\n\nLast year, we surpassed our goal of opening over 1,250 Lift Zones, which provide free WiFi in neighborhood centers, scaled a nationwide Digital Navigator network to get more Americans online, and fulfilled our promise to support 13,000 underrepresented small businesses hard hit by the pandemic. And with the founding of Sky Up in the UK, our connectivity and skills programs are now helping more people secure jobs and climb the economic ladder globally.\n\nWe once again saw improvement in diversity within our workforce. Through inclusive recruitment and partnerships, we are attracting diverse talent and providing opportunities for development and growth. To build a pipeline from classrooms to newsrooms and the media industry, NBCU Academy, which trains the next generation of diverse content creators, has reached 45 academic partners around the country.\n\nWe also made measurable progress toward our carbon neutral goal \u2014 reducing our emissions 38% since 2019 \u2014 and took a critical step by joining the Science Based Targets initiative on climate action. Our ongoing investment in clean energy and energy efficiency will remain a primary focus of our decarbonization strategy in the years ahead.\n\nFinally, we introduced Team UP, our expanded employee volunteer program \u2014 built upon a successful 20 years of service through Comcast Cares \u2014 that reminds us we are more effective when we join forces.\n\nIt is with great pride that we reflect on our shared accomplishments while remaining mindful that there is still work to do. Our collective impact would not be possible without our extraordinary employees and partners. They inspire us with their dedication to creating a future of unlimited possibilities.\nWe work passionately to drive economic mobility for underrepresented and low-income communities. Backed by a $1 billion commitment, Project UP deepens the impact of our efforts to connect people to the Internet, deliver digital skills, and create new career pathways in media and technology to help build a world of unlimited possibilities.\nFulfilling Our $100 Million Commitment\n\nIn June 2020, we accelerated our longstanding work toward advancing Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I) by pledging an additional $100 million, on top of our existing commitments, to help champion a more connected, equitable, and just world. We\u2019re proud to say that we fulfilled this commitment in 2022, which was foundational in laying the groundwork for many of our Project UP initiatives to grow and thrive.\n\nFocus Areas*\n\n- **Digital Equity**: $41M\n- **Media & Awareness**: $17M\n- **Social Justice**: $5M\n- **Small Business**: $12M\n- **In-Kind**: $25M\n- **Employees**:\n\n*Amounts apply to external partners and programs. These are examples for each focus area, and do not represent a complete list.\nConnectivity and Adoption\n\nWith the goals of breaking down barriers to digital literacy and opening doors to economic mobility, Comcast has been an innovative leader in increasing access to, and adoption of, the Internet. In 2022, we helped grow a nationwide network of Digital Navigators \u2014 individuals who are affiliated with trusted, local, community-based organizations who help people get online, secure a device, and build digital skills.\n\n$11.4M+\n\nAwarded in 2022 to 225+ organizations that raise awareness of the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) and train Digital Navigators\n\nIncreasing Awareness of Low-Cost or Free Internet\n\nWhile Digital Navigators provide a bridge to Internet adoption, the federal government\u2019s Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) ensures that the Internet is readily accessible through a $30 monthly credit ($75 a month in tribal areas). We are proud to participate in the ACP, with two products fully covered by the monthly credit: Internet Essentials and Internet Essentials Plus. We also support public-private partnerships and nonprofit organizations that are spreading the message about the ACP. For example:\n\nBondadosa, a social enterprise that offers a healthy food delivery service in Denver, Colorado, is delivering information on the ACP to food-insecure individuals.\n\n\u201cTo be fully connected as a society, we first have to get connected. Comcast has been at the forefront of addressing digital equity within Colorado for years, and its partnership is instrumental to our efforts to expand connectivity in our communities.\u201d \u2014 James Coleman, Colorado State Senator\n\nBoys & Girls Club of Puget Sound provides young people with safe spaces, caring mentors, and technology access.\n\n\u201cStrong ties between our public, private, and nonprofit sectors will continue to be critical, as we all work collaboratively toward our shared goals. I thank Comcast for their partnership and continued efforts to support digital access and adoption for those in need, particularly across the South Puget Sound region.\u201d \u2014 Victoria Woodards, Mayor of Tacoma, Washington\n\nBridging the Generational Divide: In Detroit, teens from the Boys & Girls Club of Southeastern Michigan helped St. Patrick Senior Center residents learn to use the Internet more comfortably and confidently by teaching them basic digital skills, from getting online to using video for connecting with family members.\nDigital Navigators Create a Nationwide Impact\n\nTrained and trusted Digital Navigators are spreading out across the country to help close the digital divide. From coast to coast, these community-based individuals help people navigate the digital world, creating more opportunities for economic mobility.\n\nA Comcast-supported Boston Consulting Group study found that, thanks to assistance from a Digital Navigator, more than 65% of participants gained access to home Internet or a device and 33% found a new job or earned a higher income.\nComcast has been working on digital equity issues for over a decade, and I believe that the ACP offers even more support to achieve our goals.\n\nDave Watson\nPresident & CEO, Comcast Cable\n\nA Connectivity Game Changer: Alisha Jones is a single mother from Maryland working toward an associate\u2019s degree. As a participant in the Comcast-supported Goodwill workforce development program, she used her Internet Essentials Plus connection to take classes at her local community college. Her two sons use the Internet at home for their schoolwork and college applications.\n\n\u201cThis is what we consider our game changer,\u201d Alisha said while introducing President Biden at a May 2022 White House event highlighting the ACP\u2019s success. \u201cThrough our high-speed broadband provider, Comcast, we were able to stay connected with family, receive telehealth care, go to classes, and access other necessary resources.\u201d\nAdvancing Internet Essentials\n\nOur Internet Essentials program \u2014 the industry\u2019s largest and most comprehensive private-sector broadband adoption initiative \u2014 has helped bridge the digital divide by bringing affordable, high-speed Internet, access to low-cost devices, and free digital skills training to more than 10 million low-income Americans since 2011.\n\n220,000\nLaptops donated or subsidized to individuals and communities since 2011\n\n600+\nInternet Essentials Partnership Program partners fully covering the cost of Internet service for lower-income families\n\n200+\nLessons offered via the Internet Essentials Learning Center, our online learning resource for all ages\n\n10M\nIn over 10 years, Internet Essentials has connected 10 million Americans to affordable, high-speed Internet\nIntroducing Sky Up\n\nIn 2022, Sky launched its ambition to tackle digital inequality with a three-part initiative providing support to a quarter of a million digitally excluded people through a dedicated fund. The initiative, Sky Up, supports people to succeed in a digital age. This includes a goal to set up 100 Sky Up Digital Hubs to join the Lift Zone family. Over the next three years, Sky Up Tech Grants will provide 1,000 18- to 25-year-olds leaving the UK\u2019s care system with software-loaded tech devices, Internet connections, and skills training to support them in the transition to living independently.\n\nPartnering with Indigenous Populations\n\nWe partner with nonprofits focused on advancing digital equity:\n\nNational Urban Indian Family Coalition (NUIFC) is an advocate for American Indian and Alaska Native families living in urban communities and helps drive Internet adoption.\n\nAmerican Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES) creates a culturally relevant computer science curriculum for Indigenous high school students.\n\nSky is focused on unlocking opportunities with the tools, skills and programs that we provide through Sky Up. Tackling digital inequality is at the heart of our work to empower young people to fulfill their potential.\n\nDana Strong\nCEO, Sky\nA Lift Zones Milestone\n\nWe were thrilled to exceed our goal of launching 1,250 Lift Zones by the end of 2022. These community centers provide free WiFi access and a suite of digital literacy programs and workforce development training resources. Lift Zones are now operational inside many military veteran-serving organizations, including Alpha Omega Veterans Services Inc. in Memphis, Tennessee.\nClosing the digital divide is a complex challenge. Why is public-private partnership so important?\n\nNo one entity can deliver digital equity and opportunity alone; it requires a holistic approach. At Comcast, we realize that to make an impact in a given community, you have to know the people who live there. By partnering with thousands of community-based organizations to create connections with policymakers, businesses, and nonprofits, we\u2019re addressing these multipronged problems. And with an unprecedented federal investment in broadband, there\u2019s no better time to do this vital work together.\n\nWhat role do Digital Navigators play, and why is a personal approach to building digital skills so important?\n\nDigital Navigators are on the front lines of their communities, equipped with patience and kindness, and trained to help people access the Internet, use devices, and build digital skills. They\u2019re trusted voices who help people get online, safely and confidently, and for the long term. Having someone from their community who understands their situation, family, environment, and language creates a sense of safety and trust for underserved populations.\n\nWe hear a lot about barriers to Internet access and digital adoption. Is tackling the digital skills gap an overlooked challenge?\n\nIndeed. We have a special opportunity to bring digital skills resources to communities that need them the most. This includes employees from underrepresented communities as well as small businesses and education providers, many of whom rely on publicly funded programs to upskill employees. Currently, more than 90% of all jobs require digital skills, but nearly one-third of U.S. workers lack basic digital skills, according to a National Skills Coalition report. Our roadmap includes increased public investments in digital skill-building and continued nurturing of public and private partnerships to give everyone the opportunity to succeed in today\u2019s digital world.\nAcross our enterprise, we are driving initiatives and programming to create a more equitable workforce and build pathways to economic mobility.\n\nAt the SCTE Cable-Tec Expo in Philadelphia, more than 50 students from our Project UP partners CodePath and Per Scholas heard from Comcast engineers and technologists about careers in tech and future opportunities at Comcast. \u201cBeing at Comcast was a life-changing experience,\u201d says Per Scholas student Devin Blair. \u201cNetworking and talking to different people about technology \u2014 you don\u2019t get these types of experiences where I\u2019m from, and I have Per Scholas and Comcast to thank for that.\u201d\n\nAs a company, we remain deeply committed to helping create transformational change so that everyone \u2013 in every community \u2013 has a chance to realize their dreams.\n\nDalila Wilson-Scott\nEVP & Chief Diversity Officer,\nComcast Corporation\nA group of 350 excited students attended the \u201cJurassic World Rule Your Future STEAM Initiative Symposium\u201d at Universal Studios Hollywood, which included a college/career fair and a panel discussion with the filmmakers and stars of the movie. As part of the event, Comcast surprised the students with free laptops. The event was part of a partnership with the Council for Opportunity in Education (COE) to launch a $1.5 million program that aims to inspire low-income and first-generation-to-college students to pursue careers in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math). In collaboration with Universal Pictures and the Jurassic franchise, a three-part curriculum in STEAM was developed for use by educators and administrators of programs across the country.\n\n\u201cJurassic World Rule Your Future STEAM Symposium is an example of Comcast at its finest \u2014 bringing together our best assets and partners to create a life-changing moment for first-generation students to see themselves in the careers of the future.\u201d \u2014 Marge Jackson, SVP, Sales, Comcast Cable\nThe Power of Partnership\n\nTo create the equitable workforce of the future, Comcast partners with dozens of incredible nonprofits that strengthen the pipeline for media and technology jobs in underrepresented communities.\n\nHispanic Federation\nComcast and Telemundo partnered with the Hispanic Federation to provide grants to 20 Latino-led nonprofits, to offer digital skills training and employment resources through community-based Latino Digital Equity Centers.\n\nEastseals\nAffiliates in Massachusetts, Indiana, and Washington received a grant to support their youth transition programs, which provide STEM-focused employment and digital skills training.\n\nRoybal Film and Television Production Magnet Fund\nNBCUniversal is a founding partner of this fund, which supports the Los Angeles public schools\u2019 mission to build a more inclusive pipeline of underrepresented college- and career-ready students interested in careers in film and TV.\n\nBridging the digital divide that disproportionately impacts Latinos is key to creating economic opportunity in the Latino community and a more equitable society. We\u2019re excited to partner with Comcast NBCUniversal to equip Latinos with the skills they need to thrive in the workforce of tomorrow.\n\nFrankie Miranda\nPresident & CEO, Hispanic Federation\nCREATIVITY:\nEmpowering Diverse Creatives to Shine\n\nIn 2022, we leaned into what we do best \u2014 storytelling. NBCUniversal\u2019s Creative Impact Lab launched with the dual mission to broaden access and promote equity in the creative sector, as well as to help shine a light on the important work of our nonprofit partners across a wide range of industries.\n\nNBCUniversal has forged partnerships with many creative nonprofits around the country, who employ apprentices from underrepresented communities. We pair these organizations with our existing nonprofit partners who need help telling their stories of positive impact. \u201cBy giving students assignments under the mentorship of NBCUniversal employees, they are learning critical skills, broadening their networks and building portfolios,\u201d says Hilary Smith, EVP, Corporate Social Responsibility, NBCUniversal.\n\nDigital equity partner Per Scholas partnered with the creative agency Youth FX to help tell the story of how they are providing skills training to individuals who are often excluded from tech careers. The filmmaking organization for youth, Reel Works, created a sizzle reel to highlight our partner America On Tech\u2019s work to broaden access to technology careers. The newly formed NBCU Creative Council includes employees from across the company in creative roles who become mentors for young apprentices on Creative Impact Lab projects.\n\nThe Creative Impact Lab has given us the gift of storytelling, with high-quality content and promotion that will help us foster more access and equity in the tech sector.\n\nJessica Santana\nCo-Founder & CEO, America On Tech\n\nThe opportunity to apprentice in this program made an industry accessible that I previously felt was inaccessible to people like me.\n\nJenni Loo\nCreative Impact Lab participant, apprentice at Reel Works\nInspiring Creativity in Youth\n\nWe are deeply committed to building partnerships with nonprofits that offer education and training in media and technology for young people who might not otherwise have the opportunity.\n\nUrban Arts Partnership\nUrban Arts Partnership designs and implements educational programs rooted in the arts and technology for underrepresented students.\n\nStory Pirates\nThis New York based organization brings together teachers, authors, writers, and performers to educate students, fostering their creativity and curiosity.\n\nSky\u2019s The Edit\nWith over 100,000 students registered to participate since launching in 2020, students from low-income schools across the UK and Europe build their creative skills through Sky\u2019s unique digital storytelling challenge, and create a 90-second news report on topics that matter.\n\nCreating New Opportunities\n\nOur employees play a hands-on role in creating opportunities for the next generation of diverse storytellers.\n\nAs part of NBCUniversal\u2019s Talent Lab pro bono experience, employees are paired with organizations including Techqueria, which serves Latinx professions in tech, to provide them with a multi-week consultation that solves a specific business challenge. Through participation in labs like Narrative 4\u2019s Story Exchange, employee volunteers develop inclusive leadership skills with themes such as social awareness, empathy, cultural competency, and listening.\n\nOthers mentored trainees from Universal Filmed Entertainment Group\u2019s Below-the-Line Traineeship on more than a dozen film productions around the world. The program includes collaboration with several local partners including Film London, Cleveland Film Commission, and Hollywood CPR, among others.\nCreating Opportunities through Entrepreneurialism\n\nMany business leaders and young innovators \u2014 especially those of color \u2014 lack the funding or resources to bring their ideas to life. Through our programs and partners, we prepare underrepresented entrepreneurs to build a foundation for success.\n\n$125M\n\nThe Comcast NBCUniversal LIFT Labs Accelerator connects founders with leaders across our company to build products and technologies in the industries where Comcast operates. Since 2018, 54 companies have completed the program and have gone on to raise more than $125 million combined.\n\nOur Open Doors initiative is the perfect example of how we use our platform to build diversity and representation internally with our employees and externally with our clients and viewers.\n\nPeter Blacker\nEVP, Streaming & Data Products and Head of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion, Global Advertising and Partnerships, NBCUniversal\n\nNBCUniversal\u2019s Open Doors: Where Small Businesses Thrive (Abriendo Caminos) supports diverse small businesses while providing tools and resources through a bilingual, downloadable playbook in collaboration with the celebrated multicultural creative agency Walton Isaacson.\n\nBUILD.org is committed to helping young people develop an entrepreneurial mindset through free and engaging content.

The exposure I received from our commercial spot helped hone the professionalism of my business, expanded our reach, and inspired the use of data science in addressing our collective climate and food crises. I couldn\u2019t be happier with the support and encouragement we received from the Comcast RISE program.\u201d\n\nJennifer Davis: Founder\nRefresh Mobile Teeth Whitening, Tinley Park, Illinois\n\n\u201cWhether they need a quick touch-up or a more comprehensive whitening treatment plan, Refresh Mobile Teeth Whitening is committed to providing exceptional service and personalized care to each and every client. With the Comcast RISE grant, I was able to educate myself on the latest dental technologies and techniques, invest in my dental spa with new lighting and website updates, and expand my services to include a broader range of cosmetic dental treatments to enhance my clients\u2019 smiles.\u201d\n\nElla Mae Gray, M.A., LCPC: Owner, Psychologist\nGuiding Principles, LLC Gaithersburg, Maryland\n\n\u201cGuiding Principles is a psychotherapy practice that was founded on the belief that people can change. It\u2019s a home away from home that is easily accessible to all, regardless of ability to pay, and provides individual, group, and family therapy services. Receiving a full technology makeover package has been a dream come true. Because we provide a lot of pro bono and low-cost services, there is no budget for new equipment. With new computers, we streamlined our administrative services and expanded our online services.\u201d\nIn 2022, we introduced a company-wide program called Team UP to provide year-round opportunities for Comcast employees to make a difference in local communities. This includes volunteering in person or virtually, serving as a nonprofit board member, making a charitable donation through our matching gift program, or supporting our network of partners. Team UP builds on our legacy of community service with flexible, always-on programming that also provides an outlet for our employees to take part in Project UP.\n\nSimilar efforts are happening around the world:\n\n**NBCUnites** encourages NBCUniversal teammates to get involved with local nonprofits focused on building stronger communities, empowering young storytellers, and promoting media and technology skills.\n\n**Sky Cares** engages thousands of Sky volunteers across Europe, working with more than 60 charity partners across three primary areas: protecting the environment, addressing digital inequality, and alleviating loneliness.\n\n**TEAM UP: Engaging Our Volunteer Community**\n\n| 5,800 | 8,600 | $5.6M | 365 |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Nonprofit organizations supported by Team UP | Employees participated in Team UP | Donated through the Matching Gift Program | Days a year that employees can Team UP |\nTo celebrate the launch of Team UP, hundreds of Philadelphia-area employees joined eight Team USA Olympians and Paralympians to participate in volunteer projects with community partners including LUCY Outreach, Girls Inc. of Greater Philadelphia & Southern New Jersey, and Philabundance.\n\nTeaming UP With Team USA\n\nServing Those Who Served: Members of the Veterans Network (VetNet), Black Employee Network (BEN), and other employee resource groups have volunteered for seven consecutive years to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans at 32 cemeteries as part of National Wreaths Across America Day, an annual tradition of honoring the memories and service of veterans and their families.\nA passion for advancing Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I) drives our work at every level. From onboarding to partnerships to programming, we continue to deepen our ongoing efforts to advance a positive culture within our company and throughout the industry.\nFocusing on Belonging\n\nBelonging means that all people can see themselves represented and feel comfortable expressing themselves and their perspectives. When we understand how our different backgrounds, viewpoints, and identities shape our daily experiences, we help every person feel valued and important \u2014 and, most importantly, that they belong \u2014 throughout their personal and professional journey.\n\nTo foster this culture of belonging, we have taken action at many levels, such as embedding DE&I leaders in each business unit to provide leadership, consistency, and accountability. Comcast\u2019s rotating DE&I Employee Advisory Council, which consists of 24 employees across Divisions, Regions, and Business Units, works alongside the National DE&I Cable Leadership Council and provides advice and recommendations on new products or policies that are the outcomes of our company\u2019s DE&I efforts. Universal Filmed Entertainment Group established its Inclusion Council in 2020, which was inspired by studio employees and works to ensure that Universal operates as a fully inclusive and equitable organization.\n\nWe also leverage the knowledge of independent experts through Comcast\u2019s Corporate DE&I Advisory Council and Sky\u2019s Diversity Advisory Council. These councils, comprised of external business, academic, political, and civil rights leaders, help us learn from others, find solutions to challenges, and collaborate to create a more equitable future.\n\nEngaging Our Team Members\n\nEmployee Resource Groups (ERGs) strengthen connections and engage employees through listening sessions, networking events, volunteerism, cultural celebrations, and educational opportunities. To foster these connections, in 2022 Comcast\u2019s ERG National Leadership Summit brought together ERG leaders and DE&I partners to provide professional development opportunities and share best practices. Additionally, we foster impact through our Elevate fund, which provides grants for ERGs to bring collaborative and innovative programming to all employees.\n\nIdentity Matters: Comcast\u2019s Self-ID campaign (pictured right) and Sky\u2019s Count Me In encouraged employees to share information on gender, race, ethnicity, military status, disability status, and pronouns to provide valuable insight that helps us develop policies and programs to ensure that our people are represented and supported.\n\n\u201cIdentity is what makes us special and defines us, and we are continuously finding new ways to honor and recognize this important fact.\u201d \u2014 Juan Otero, SVP, Diversity, Equity & Inclusion, Comcast Corporation\nSustaining Crucial Conversations\n\nDialogue and listening increase understanding and empathy.

These changes are based on our deeply rooted conviction that a diverse workforce creates a stronger company \u2014 and a better world.\n\nNBCU Academy sponsors the Original Voices Fellowship in partnership with NBC News Studios, to provide funding for documentary filmmakers who seek out stories that reflect diverse communities.

The Orlando, Florida-based agency focuses on experiential design for themed entertainment, museum, resorts, branded environments, and design spaces for all people.\n\nThe diverse-owned business is run by Dan and his wife, Janelle, both owners and creative directors. What started as a small graphic design and animation studio has been growing ever since, and now has 14 employees with backgrounds in project management, design, media, gaming, and animation, among other disciplines.\n\nIn 2022, Dan went through the rigorous, four-month NBCUniversal Edge Program, which focuses on developing diverse-owned businesses that specialize in media, marketing, and digital technology. He says that the experience was both invaluable and fun, giving him the opportunity to see how Universal does business and to learn ways to scale his company. This connection then led to several NBCUniversal projects, including media and experiential design for exciting new projects at Epic Universe, a groundbreaking new theme park planned to open in Orlando in 2025. Several more projects with Epic Universe, The Franklin Institute, and others are in the works.\n\nAs MDSX grows, Dan is deeply committed to keeping the company\u2019s vibrant culture intact. This includes bringing people from different disciplines together to make room for the unexpected, encouraging a wide diversity of thought and perspectives, and giving back through community engagement. \u201cWhen I talk to student groups, their eyes light up,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have no idea that there is someone that looks like them doing this kind of work. It is my biggest joy.\u201d\nAdvancing Representation on and behind the Screen\n\nWidening representation in our programming and on our screens \u2014 and increasing accessibility of our platforms and programs \u2014 is essential to creating a diverse and inclusive experience for our customers and more equitable opportunities for those working behind the scenes.\n\nTelemundo\u2019s exclusive Spanish-language coverage of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022\u2122 allowed more people than ever before to enjoy this thrilling game on every platform.

As a company, we have a goal to be carbon neutral by 2035 for Scope 1 and 2 emissions \u2014 the direct and indirect emissions we own and control \u2014 across our global operations.\n\nWe\u2019re proud of progress already made, reducing enterprise-wide greenhouse gas emissions by 38% since 2019. That means we\u2019ve eliminated 960,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 equivalent to removing 200,000 cars from the road for a year.\n\nFor more information, please visit our Carbon Footprint Data Report.\nIt was a crucial year for Comcast, as we made measurable progress toward our carbon neutral goal, estimated our Scope 3 emissions for the first time, and took the step to join the Science Based Targets initiative on climate action.\n\n*Sara Cronenwett*\nSVP, Corporate Strategy and Environmental Sustainability, Comcast Corporation\nEstimating Our Scope 3 Emissions\n\nIn 2022, we achieved another significant accomplishment by estimating the emissions of our full value chain, known as Scope 3 emissions. Comcast\u2019s Scope 3 emissions reflect estimates of both the upstream emissions associated with our suppliers and the downstream emissions associated with our customers\u2019 use of our products and services.\n\nEstimating the emissions of our full value chain was an important step for us in joining the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), one of the key organizations focused on aligning corporate climate action with the global climate goals set by the Paris Agreement. By joining SBTi, Comcast has committed to set additional near-term emissions reduction goals in line with pathways designed to limit climate change over the next 5-10 years.\n\n### Scope 3 Emissions Year Over Year\n\n| Year | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|------|------|------|------|\n| Million metric tons CO\u2082e | 11.5 | 10.9 | 10.9 |\n\n### 2021 Scope 3 Emission Sources\n\n- **52%** Use of sold and leased products (Categories 11 & 13)\n- **36%** Purchased goods, services, and capital goods (Categories 1 & 2)\n- **12%** Emissions related to transportation, energy, employees, and waste (Categories 3-8 & 12)\n\nFor more information, please visit our Carbon Footprint Data Report.\nComcast\u2019s Inaugural Green Bond: In early 2023, Comcast issued a $1 billion green bond, which allowed investors to support environmental efforts that are either underway or under consideration as part of Comcast\u2019s goal to be carbon neutral by 2035. Proceeds from the green bond will be allocated to specific categories outlined in Comcast\u2019s Green Financing Framework, such as renewable energy and green buildings. This inaugural green bond offering was led by Bank of America and co-led and underwritten by four nationally recognized minority-, women-, and service-disabled veteran-owned investment banking firms with which Comcast has a strong historical relationship.\n\nManaging the Challenges Ahead: Decarbonizing our business and value chain depends on many factors beyond our control, including political, economic, regulatory, and geopolitical conditions, supply chain and labor issues, supplier emissions reductions, the evolution of carbon offset markets, and investment and innovation to close gaps in available technology and infrastructure. Overcoming these challenges will require, among other things, increased collaboration with a range of business partners, industry peers, governments around the world, and other stakeholders.\nHarnessing Clean Energy and Technology\n\nWe are utilizing the latest clean technologies to green our operations and network. This means investing in clean and renewable energy, piloting electric and hybrid vehicles, and building for the future.\n\nReaching 1 Million Megawatt-Hours of Renewable Energy\n\nIn 2022, we signed new renewable energy agreements totaling more than 183,000 megawatt-hours (MWh) per year, bringing our contracted total to over 1 million MWh per year \u2013 roughly 25% of our projected 2026 energy load once the new projects come online. This is equivalent to avoiding the emissions from 137,000 homes\u2019 electricity use for a year. Additionally, Sky and Comcast Spectacor continue to source 100% renewable electricity, in line with their previously set goals.\n\nClean Energy Load\n\nOur progress securing contracts totaling a milestone one-million-megawatt-hours capacity of renewable energy serves as a significant step towards our 2035 carbon neutral goal.\n\nPeter Kiriacouloco\nEVP, Chief Procurement Officer, Comcast\n\n2022 Renewable Energy Contracts\n\nNew England: The Gravel Pit Solar project in East Windsor, Connecticut will power nearly half of Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal operations across New England. The contract represents an annual volume of approximately 111,000 MWh.\n\nMichigan: Comcast entered into agreements to purchase renewable wind and solar electricity for half of Comcast Cable\u2019s Michigan operations. The contracts represent a combined annual volume of approximately 52,000 MWh.\n\nIllinois: Comcast signed a long-term agreement to purchase approximately 20,000 MWh annually of solar electricity in Illinois.\n\nLondon: NBCUniversal is supporting the Grid Project, a pilot program led by Film London, to reduce the carbon footprint of the city\u2019s entertainment industry by installing electrical cabinets that productions can plug into rather than using diesel generators, and supplying 100% renewable energy to power the productions.\nA Leaner, Cleaner Fleet\n\nAcross the enterprise, we\u2019re continuing to work to reduce fleet emissions by piloting electric and hybrid vehicles in targeted locations, installing telematics and fuel efficiency technology, and offering more digital support tools that reduce truck visits. These efforts have allowed Comcast Cable to save nearly 9.5 million gallons of fuel since 2019, avoiding 81,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nNew Technologies On the Go\n\nComcast expanded its fleet of electric and hybrid vehicles, which now includes Chevy Bolts, Ford Lightnings, Ford E-Transits, and Ford Fusions. The pilot vehicles are helping the business gain insights into the challenges and benefits to broader EV deployment.\n\nSky News has eight Rapid News Gathering vehicles, nicknamed RaNOers, featuring the latest battery and solar technology. The new power system has reduced carbon emissions by 105 tons a year, almost a 100% reduction from previous vehicles.\n\nThe Studio Tour at Universal Studios Hollywood is going green with a total of eight electric trams in rotation on the world-famous Studio Tour. The theme park plans to convert its entire fleet of 21 trams to electric by 2025.\n\nSky unveiled a full suite of all-electric shuttle buses to transport employees to and from campus and connect them with local public transit. This transition reduces Sky\u2019s carbon emissions by 272 tons every year compared to its historic diesel fleet.\nBuilding for the Future\n\nOur company is taking steps to apply sustainable building standards to our operations and construction.
