These long-term investments are in service of a vision for the future where everyone can be present with each other, create new opportunities, and experience new things.\n\nWe view our sustainability work with this same eye to the future. After all, the possibilities that our technology will unlock for people only matter if we have a safe and thriving planet.\n\nWe think about our work here in three areas: limiting the environmental footprint of our operations and devices; driving climate action with our products; and forming partnerships to scale our impact.\n\nOn our operations, thanks to innovations in our data center and office designs, we\u2019ve driven up efficiency and driven down our environmental footprint. But we have more work to do. We\u2019ve achieved net zero emissions in our global operations and set a goal to reach net zero emissions across our value chain in 2030. We\u2019ve also set an ambitious goal for our global operations to be water positive by 2030, meaning we\u2019ll restore more water than we consume.\n\nOn driving climate action, we\u2019ve expanded our Climate Science Center to reach millions of people around the world with authoritative information about climate change. And we\u2019re working closely with experts to combat false or misleading information.\n\nOn partnerships to scale our impact, we\u2019ve recently announced a joint $925 million commitment alongside Stripe, Shopify, McKinsey, and Alphabet to accelerate the development of carbon removal technologies over the next 9 years. This is just one of many ways we\u2019re collaborating with others across industry, nonprofit, academia, and government to combine forces for greater impact.\n\nOur 2021 Sustainability Report dives deep on the progress we\u2019re making across these areas. As we work to provide people around the world with equitable access to opportunities, we\u2019ve also committed to upholding the UN Global Compact\u2019s Ten Principles and to advancing the Sustainable Development Goals. We\u2019re committed to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights too. Sustainability, human rights, economic opportunity\u2014these are all interconnected and we\u2019re taking a holistic approach to make sure we\u2019re driving positive change globally.\n\nThe defining quality of the metaverse will be a feeling of presence\u2014like you are right there with another person or in another place. That feeling of presence is an incredibly powerful tool to build empathy, understanding, and collaboration. Students will be able to take field trips to the melting ice caps or a wind farm, without leaving their classroom. Journalists will be able to tell immersive, first-person stories of climate refugees that help their audience feel the impact on people\u2019s lives. Experts from around the world can get together around a virtual table to discuss solutions and advance climate action.\n\nWe\u2019re optimistic about the role technology will play in helping us address the climate crisis. But the task ahead is massive. As both a company and a platform for social connection, we take our responsibility seriously. We\u2019ll continue our sustainability work across our business and products\u2014and will share our progress through reports like this one.\nOur mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. The surge in traffic we observed on our platforms when the COVID-19 pandemic began demonstrated the ever-growing role Meta plays in keeping people connected across the world. Meaningful connections are not possible without a safe and healthy world\u2014one in which diverse experiences are respected, accurate information is amplified over the noise, and bold climate action is truly making a difference.\n\nWe can all agree that changes to global temperature and climate present overwhelming challenges\u2014both environmental and social. We take our role, and the responsibility that comes with it, seriously.\n\nAt our core, we strive to protect both people and the planet through responsible operations. For the last decade, we have invested in ways to make our own operations more water- and energy-efficient with a focus on sustainable solutions for the resources we do use. Put simply, we aim to use less\u2014less water and less energy\u2014and to reduce unnecessary waste.\n\nAs of 2020, our global operations reached net zero emissions and are supported by 100% renewable energy. We are now reaching toward the goals of net zero emissions across our value chain and becoming water positive throughout our operations, aiming to achieve both of these milestones in 2030.\n\nAlthough this report looks back on 2021 and all the progress we have made, I cannot help looking forward and thinking about all the questions yet to be answered and the work yet to be done. One thing that became clear in 2021 as we mapped out our net zero strategy was the difficulty in driving pathways for consistent reductions across our operations for a rapidly growing business.\n\nWe know our Scope 3 emissions are increasing\u2014and will continue to increase in the near term\u2014as we grow to support the global demand for the services we provide. For example, to support the infrastructure necessary to connect people around the world, we are building more data centers and networks that will provide capacity and reliability on our platforms, and will enable our transition to the metaverse. We will work to address our Scope 3 emissions by optimizing for low carbon in our business decisions, collaborating with our suppliers to reduce emissions and exploring interventions that decarbonize our broader value chain, both upstream and downstream.\n\nIn addition to focusing on carbon reductions, we realize the need to be innovative and push for new ways to collaborate with others. After all, the challenge of reaching net zero is an industry-wide problem, and as an industry, we will need to collectively realize our goals for the climate by working together.\nOur recent investment in Frontier AMC is just one example of our belief that we can do far more for the climate through industry collaborations\u2014and the ways we are working with corporate partners to push for faster advancement of technological carbon removals. We continue to partner with leading thinkers to develop new ways to accelerate adoption of sustainable materials and fuels for construction, hardware and transportation. Industry leaders, governments and other stakeholders know that Scope 3 emissions are difficult to measure and reduce. We remain committed to leading internal and external discussions and partnerships to drive industry standards and reductions throughout our value chain.\n\nFinally, as we look forward, we believe that we must build on achieving our 100% renewable energy goals by optimizing our energy strategy to drive emissions reductions at a grid-scale. We will do this by maintaining our commitment to 100% renewable energy; creating innovative approaches to drive emissions out of the sector while improving reliability; and collaborating with peers, grid operators, utilities and other stakeholders to advance the zero emissions, reliable grid of the future.\n\nDespite the unknowns, from the planning and analysis we completed in 2021, we know our ambitious 2030 targets will require significant shifts in how we build infrastructure, increase operational discipline and invest in existing and emerging nature-based and technological solutions to reduce and remove emissions. We will work to do all of this while growing our business to meet the demands of tomorrow.\n\nWe are humbled by these challenges and grateful to be part of a community of climate leaders, sustainability-focused organizations, government leaders and committed corporations all coming together to allow us to scale our efforts and enable bold climate action.\n\nThis is hard and very important work. It is how we will bring the world closer together\u2014and together, how we will help the world move closer to better.\n\nSwitching to a clean economy could raise $2.8 trillion through carbon price revenues and the redirection of fossil fuel subsidies to public investments.\nWhat is your vision for the future of Meta\u2019s sustainability strategy?\n\nWe have made a lot of progress over the past decade\u2014driving up efficiency and driving down our environmental footprint, especially in how we design, build and operate our global offices and data centers. But, we have so much more important work to do.\n\nFor example, we have worked for years to drive sustainability into our value chain through our responsible supply chain program. Meta\u2019s sustainability strategy in the coming years will be to expand our value chain and partnership programs to include working with internal Meta teams and our global partners to fight climate change through emissions reductions and removals, water stewardship and biodiversity projects, and meaningful collaborations to invest in new solutions and scale our work.\n\nOur strategy comes to life through three pillars:\n\n1. How We Operate\u2014protecting the well-being of people and our planet through our processes, operations and global supply chain\n2. What We Create\u2014amplifying scientists and climate leaders through our products and platforms\n3. How We Collaborate\u2014engaging with experts and supporting established initiatives in the climate space\n\nHow is Meta approaching its journey to net zero value chain emissions?\n\nWe embrace our responsibility as a global company to address the climate challenge that impacts us all. On our journey to reach net zero emissions across our value chain, we will lead by example while following what science tells us must be done to align with the Paris Agreement.\n\nWe are focusing on reducing our Scope 3 emissions, which means radically changing the way we operate and helping our suppliers to set their own climate targets. This work to use less, choose better, embrace low-carbon technology and collaborate with our suppliers will be a very long and complex journey. For us, our net zero goal is more than an announcement; it is a program designed to drive real emissions reductions and lasting changes to our infrastructure and supply chain.\n\nHow will the metaverse impact sustainability?\n\nAt Meta, we are committed to building tools that make choosing to connect virtually easier than ever. And while we are at the beginning of what will be a long and constantly changing journey, we are excited about giving people the ability to choose options that have a smaller environmental impact.\n\nStill, the metaverse is new and the growth of our business to support the creation of these new tools presents challenges. The expansion of hardware, construction and operation of new data centers and other capital goods means that we must continue to drive toward more sustainable construction and operational business practices.\nWe are now beginning to investigate how we can support our business growth while integrating with low-carbon technology, renewable energy, hardware circularity, reduced water usage and other climate-conscious initiatives included in this report.\n\nDespite all the progress we are making and our plans for the future, the path to a sustainable metaverse will not always be easy. For example, at first, we expect to see an increase in our emissions. But, ultimately, the work we are doing during these foundational years will drive the innovation and collaboration across our business that enables us to grow sustainably.\n\nHow are the sustainability and human rights agendas connected at Meta?\n\nThe shared values and aspirations of the human rights and environmental movements are increasingly apparent. The primary victims of environmental harm are often marginalized communities where people cannot claim their rights to live in a healthy environment. Linking our sustainability and human rights agendas at Meta is an important step forward\u2014whether that means taking into consideration the populations most impacted by transitioning to a zero-carbon economy or investing in the well-being of workers across our supply chain. Not only is this the right thing to do but also it signals to our employees and stakeholders that we are committed to protecting the rights we all deserve.\n\nWhat gives you confidence that Meta can be a driving force for industry change?\n\nOur people and our commitment to real impact at scale give me confidence. With the technical and professional talent we have assembled, our team is poised to evolve the way Meta and the technology industry approach sustainability. Our employees truly care about this. Sustainability is not an add-on for us. It is a driving force in itself that motivates innovation in what we do and how we do it.\n\nOur scale also gives me confidence. We have the global reach, expertise and platforms to make a meaningful difference in markets. We are working to support lower-emissions solutions across our business, which we believe will translate to market availability for others as well. We are doing this through our own direct investments (like with our renewable energy projects) and through partnerships (like our investments in carbon removal and reduction solutions and technologies). In fact, one of the most wonderful things about working in the sustainability field is how collaborative it is. When we look at the Open Compute Project, for example, we have seen the power of collaboration. I know we can do even more to set an example for better technologies and capacity-building in our supply chain.\n\nAt Meta, we are building tools that make choosing to connect virtually easier than ever.\n\n1,200+ companies have set science-based targets in line with net zero emissions.\nGive people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.\nNote: On October 28, 2021, Facebook, Inc. changed its name to Meta. To maintain consistency, we will be referring to Meta throughout this report by its present name, even with regard to events that took place prior to the name change.\n\nOUR VALUES\n\nWe updated our company values to reflect who Meta is as a global community with a wide-reaching impact. These values capture how we must work to bring our vision to life.\n\n**Move Fast** helps us build and learn faster than anyone else. This means acting with urgency and not waiting until next week to do something you could do today. At our scale, this also means continuously working to increase the velocity of our highest priority initiatives by methodically removing barriers that get in the way. It is about moving fast together\u2014in one direction as a company, not just as individuals.\n\n**Focus on Long-Term Impact** emphasizes long-term thinking and encourages us to extend the timeline for the impact we have, rather than optimizing for near-term wins. We should take on the challenges that will be the most impactful, even if the full results will not be seen for years.\n\n**Build Awesome Things** pushes us to ship things that are not just good but also awe-inspiring. We have already built products that are useful to billions of people, but in our next chapter, we will focus more on inspiring people as well. This quality bar should apply to everything we do.\n\n**Live in the Future** guides us to build the future of distributed work that we want, where opportunity is not limited by geography. This means operating as a distributed-first company and being the early adopters of the future products we are building to help people feel present together, no matter where they are.\n\n**Be Direct and Respect Your Colleagues** is about creating a culture where we are straightforward and willing to have hard conversations with each other. At the same time, we are respectful, and when we share feedback, we recognize that many of the world\u2019s leading experts work here.\n\n**Meta, Metamates, Me** is about being good stewards of our company and mission. It is about the sense of responsibility we have for our collective success and to each other as teammates. It is about taking care of our company and each other.\n\nOur four-point company plan drives the way we approach business strategy and our sustainability strategy:\n\n1. Continue making progress on the major social issues facing the internet and our company\n2. Build new experiences that meaningfully improve people\u2019s lives\n3. Grow the business by supporting millions of small businesses\n4. Communicate more transparently what we stand for\nMETA AT A GLANCE*\n\nMeta builds technologies that help people connect, find communities and grow businesses. When Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world. Now, Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build the next evolution in social technology. Our products connect more than three billion people around the world.\n\nMap Key:\n- Workplaces\n- Data Centers\n\nHeadquarters: Menlo Park, CA\nEmployees: 71,970\nRevenue: $117 billion\n\nOffices in 80+ cities worldwide\n18 data centers globally powered by 100% renewable energy\n\n*As of December 31, 2021\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n2021 Environmental Sustainability Progress\n\nMeta first reported its Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2011 and began reporting Scope 3 emissions in 2019.\n\nMeta\u2019s Sustainability Report reflects our sustainability progress during the 2021 fiscal year (January 1\u2013December 31, 2021). Understanding our impacts on society and the environment is core to how Meta operates. We continue building transparency into the way we report on our strategy to minimize our impact.\n\nIn preparing this report, Meta referenced guidance from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI); Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), Internet and Media Services Industry Standards; Task Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD); and the United Nations Global Compact.\n\nIn 2021, external auditor, Apex Companies, LLC, audited our environmental data. You can access audit certifications here.\nStakeholder Identification and Engagement\n\nWhether we are building new products or processes, we have to involve affected communities, particularly those whose perspectives have been historically overlooked or who might be disproportionately impacted by the use or even the existence of a given technology.\n\nWe believe the best way to ensure our efforts are focused on the right priorities is through open dialogue and a combination of formal and informal meetings with stakeholders, including end users, colleagues, communities, suppliers, industry peers, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), policymakers and investors. These conversations help inform our sustainability programs and advance our work.\n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Priority Topics\n\nWe conduct regular assessments to understand the ESG topics that are most important to our stakeholders and our business over the short, medium and long term.\n\nThis helps ensure that Meta\u2019s ESG topics are identified, prioritized, addressed and reported in an inclusive, robust and effective manner.\n\nThe 100 least-emitting countries generate 3% of total emissions. The 10 largest emitters contribute 68%.\nMeta\u2019s Priority ESG Topics\n\nWhile Meta works to address all the topics outlined in our priority topics map, this report focuses on the key environmental topics, as well as the connected social and governance areas. Definitions for our priority topics covered in this report can be found in the data index. Please visit our Environmental, Social and Governance Resource hub for information on how we address other priority topics. We value and welcome feedback from all stakeholders.\n\nTo avert the worst impacts of climate change, global temperature increase must be limited to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Global temperatures are already 1.1\u00b0C warmer.\nThe United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call upon business, government and civil society to address social, environmental and economic challenges and to drive progress for humanity to build a more sustainable world for all in 2030.\n\nOur sustainability and broader corporate initiatives can be tied to each of the 17 SDGs, and we plan to continue mapping our progress against the goals to transparently communicate our efforts. At this time, we are reporting on the areas in which we see the biggest potential for impact.\nUNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS\n\n**UNSDG #3**\nGood Health & Well-Being\n\n- **2 Billion+** People connected to accurate COVID-19 and vaccine information through Facebook\u2019s COVID-19 Information Center.\n- **12 Million** Pieces of misleading COVID-19 information removed from Facebook.\n- **3,000** Pages and groups removed for repeatedly violating our rules against spreading COVID-19 misinformation.\n- **$175 Million+** Raised for COVID-19-related fundraisers globally on Facebook and Instagram.\n\n**UNSDG #5**\nGender Equality\n\n- **1 Million Women in 28 Countries** Equipped with training and mentorship to grow their business on the Facebook platform through our #SheMeansBusiness program.\n- **600,000** Facebook users reached through two global surveys on Gender Equality at Home in more than 200 countries.\n- **12** Nonprofit leaders, activists and academic experts in Meta\u2019s Global Women\u2019s Safety Expert Advisors group to help inform the new Women\u2019s Safety Hub.\n\nAcross the world, women are more likely than men to be affected by climate-related food insecurity.\n## UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS\n\n### UNSDG #8\nDecent Work and Economic Growth\n\n| $1 Billion | $40 Million | 50% of Our Workforce | 31 Countries | 234,000 Users |\n|------------|-------------|----------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Committed to diverse suppliers annually | In grant funding to Black businesses most impacted by COVID-19 | Will be from underrepresented communities by 2024 | Included in a survey of small businesses to understand views on climate change and priorities for investments in water infrastructure | Across Meta\u2019s educational programs |\n\n| 2.38 Million Unique Visitors | 368,000 | 1,870 Job Applications | 63% Career Success Rate |\n|-----------------------------|--------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| To the Facebook Social Media Marketing Professional Certificate landing page | Unique Visitors to the Facebook Marketing Analytics Professional Certificate landing page | Submitted for 280 jobs offered by 211 companies in the hiring consortium | Of those who completed one of the marketing professional certification programs, 18% got a new job, 25% got a salary increase, 15% got a promotion, 9% started a business, 32% grew a business, and 70% feel more confident in their marketing abilities after certification |\n\nAchieving 50%-70% renewable energy could generate up to 600,000 jobs in wind, solar and battery storage.\n## UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS\n\n### UNSDG #9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure\n\n- **300 Million People**\n  - Provided with fast, reliable internet access thanks to collaboration between our Connectivity team and partners\n\n### UNSDG #13 Climate Action\n\n- **$200 Billion**\n  - In economic growth for sub-Saharan Africa, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Latin America over the next five years through Meta partnerships and digital access infrastructure\n\n- **3.8 Million**\n  - Global subscribers to the Climate Science Center\n\n- **$130 Million**\n  - Donated by 3.5 million Facebook and Instagram users to combat climate change\n\n- **100%**\n  - Renewable energy for our global operations\n\n### UNSDG #13 Climate Action\n\n- **Net Zero**\n  - Greenhouse gas emissions for our global operations\n\n- **Net Zero**\n  - Across our value chain in 2030\n\n- **76,328**\n  - Facebook users reached with the Climate Change Opinion Survey to provide insights into public views on climate change across 31 countries\n\n- **7,500**\n  - Megawatts of new solar and wind projects enabled by Meta\u2019s renewable energy commitment\n\n- **40,000**\n  - Meta employees working on safety and security on our global content review teams\nUNSDG #17 Partnerships for the Goals\n\n4 Partnerships\n\nTo advance progress on the SDGs through Project 17\n\n580+\n\nData for Good partners equipped with insights needed to make decisions to advance humanitarian response and the SDGs\n\nNearly 50 Million\n\nPeople will be impacted by water and sanitation interventions over the next five years because international nonprofit World Vision recently leveraged Facebook\u2019s high-resolution population density maps to develop their strategic plan for water and sanitation.\n\nNet Positive Water Impact is a cornerstone concept for accelerating progress on UNSDG #6-Clean Water and Sanitation for all.\nWe envision a just and equitable transition to a zero-carbon economy.\nOUR VISION\n\nWe envision a just and equitable transition to a zero-carbon economy, and we are working with others to scale inclusive solutions that help create a healthier planet for all, ensuring that no one is left behind.\n\nWe will not realize this vision on our own. We see our role as protecting people and the planet through responsible operations\u2014minimizing our energy, emissions and water impact, while protecting workers and the environment in our supply chain.\n\nAt the same time, we collaborate with community members, climate action leaders and scientists to innovate beyond what is possible today. We are leveraging our core products and services to enable access to climate science information and to accelerate action-oriented resources for tomorrow.\n\nOur strategy is anchored by three components\u2014How We Operate, What We Create and How We Collaborate\u2014and supported by science-based targets to help drive change across the many communities in which we operate.\n\nWe are making rapid progress in many areas associated with each component. In other areas, we know we have further to go, and we intend to get there. We are committed to making a difference for our product users and workers throughout our supply chain.\n\nMore than 130 countries and 400 of the largest companies have net zero targets aimed for 2050 or earlier.\nOUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY\n\nFor a Better Reality\n\nHow We Operate\nWe are committed to protecting what is truly important: The well-being of people and our planet.\n\n- Take bold climate action by minimizing our footprint, championing renewable energy, restoring water resources, engaging our suppliers and supporting climate justice\n- Respect human, labor and civil rights in our operations and supply chain\n- Cultivate diversity and inclusion in our operations\n- Boost energy and water efficiency in our data centers\n\nWhat We Create\nWe push the boundaries of what is possible, creating solutions where none existed and building products that enable change.\n\n- Provide access to new ideas, accurate information and ways to take action via content on our platforms\n- Amplify content from scientists and climate action leaders\n- Design new products with diverse needs and values in mind\n- Elevate small businesses and spur economic growth\n- Integrate circular practices in our facilities and hardware\n\nHow We Collaborate\nWe tackle the important issues by creating partnerships and joining established initiatives.\n\n- Engage experts to guide our sustainability and social impact initiatives\n- Connect researchers with insights\n- Join forces with NGOs and community organizations to create and implement locally beneficial environmental initiatives\n- Work with local power utilities to enable our facilities and local businesses to procure renewable energy\n- Share our environmental learnings and practices throughout the tech industry and beyond\nOUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY\n\nPROGRESS AND GOALS\n\n2017\n- Committed to Reducing GHG Emissions by 75% and Powering Global Operations with 100% Renewable Energy by the End of 2020\n\n2018\n- Began Working with The Audubon Society to Address Shared Water Challenges in the Rio Grande Watershed\n\n2019\n- Began Reporting Scope 3 Emissions\n\n2020\n- Launched the Climate Science Center\n- Achieved Net Zero for Global Operations\n\n2021\n- Contracted 1 Billion Gallons of Water for Restoration\n- Purchased More Renewable Energy Than We Used Across All Facilities\n- Began Engaging Suppliers to Drive Toward Net Zero Value Chain Goal\n- Launched $1 Million Climate Misinformation Grant\n\n2022\n- Joined the Frontier Advance Market Commitment to Accelerate Development of Carbon Removal Technologies\n\n2023\n- Water Positive in 2030\n- Net Zero Value Chain Emissions in 2030\n\nVision\n- About\n- Leadership\n- Highlights\n- How We Operate\n- What We Create\n- How We Collaborate\n- Governance\n- Looking Ahead\n- Data Index\n\n2021 Meta Sustainability Report\nCelebrating today.\nWorking toward tomorrow.\nThrough operational improvements and product innovations, we made significant progress toward a better reality in 2021. We are proud of how far we have come\u2014and we are ready to go so much further.\n\n**2021 HIGHLIGHTS**\n\nMeta restored 2.3 million cubic meters of water in 2021. Throughout our operations, we consumed 2.6 million cubic meters.\n\nMeta offices opened in 2021 were 38% more water efficient than LEED baseline.\n\nAs of 2021, we had contracts in place for more than 7,500 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy.\n\nThe six new data center buildings we opened in 2021 were awarded LEED Gold certification, totaling 3 million square feet.\nProtecting People and Planet Through Responsible Operations\n\nThanks to our sustainability-focused real estate development teams, the 21 Meta offices that earned Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certifications in 2021:\n\n- Were 38% more water efficient than LEED baseline, avoiding 10.5 million gallons of water annually\n- Recycled 86% of construction waste, saving 32,000 tons of waste from going to landfill or incineration\n\nThrough our innovative server cooling process, data centers operating in 2021 were at least 80% more water efficient than the average data center. Our six data center buildings that received LEED Gold certification in 2021 recycled over 50,000 tons (82%) of construction waste.\n\n1 According to Berkeley National Laboratory\u2019s United States Data Center Energy Usage Report.\nWe launched the $1 million Climate Misinformation Grant in partnership with the International Fact-Checking Network.\n\nTackling Climate Misinformation\n\nClimate misinformation on our platforms tends to spike periodically when climate change conversations are elevated, such as during extreme weather events. That is why we work with a global network of over 80 independent fact-checking organizations to review and rate content in more than 60 languages.\n\nTo supplement that program, in 2021, we launched the $1 million Climate Misinformation Grant in partnership with the International Fact-Checking Network. Through this program, we will fund partnerships and proposals from fact-checkers, climate organizations and solution providers working to combat false and misleading information about climate change.\n\nAccelerating Access to Accurate Information via the Climate Science Center\n\nIn 2020, we started working with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to provide access to science-based and dynamic climate information via the Climate Science Center (CSC).\n\nIn 2021, Meta expanded the CSC to more than 150 countries, attracting more than 3.8 million followers. The CSC provided more than 100,000 daily visitors with data from the IPCC and other organizations active in climate science.\n\nIndonesia and the U.S. are the countries with the highest shares of climate change deniers.\nExpanding Net Zero from our Operations to our Value Chain\n\nOn our path to net zero value chain emissions in 2030, we are committed to an approach that prioritizes emissions reductions. Key strategies to reduce emissions include using fewer new materials by reusing server hardware components and choosing construction materials with a smaller emissions footprint, such as low-carbon concrete.\n\nWe began working with a select group of our suppliers in 2021 to calculate and report their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2022, we will provide capacity-building training to our top 100 suppliers on measuring their GHG impact, setting reduction goals and identifying ways to reduce their emissions.\n\nTo address any emissions we cannot reduce, we will remove an equivalent amount of GHG emissions through verified carbon removal projects that prioritize social and environmental benefits.\n\nOur emissions footprint includes our business operations and data centers, as well as the indirect emissions upstream and downstream.\n\nScope 1 covers direct emissions that come from sources that are owned or controlled by Meta.\n\nScope 2 covers indirect emissions from the purchased or acquired energy consumed by Meta.\n\nScope 3 includes all other indirect emissions that occur in Meta\u2019s value chain, including supply chain operations and end-product usage by customers.\nBecoming Water Positive\n\nWe follow a water stewardship strategy that focuses on sourcing water responsibly, driving water efficiency across our facilities and operations, and investing in critical water restoration projects in the same watersheds where our facilities are located.\n\nIn 2021, we added seven new water restoration projects in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, totaling approximately 377 million gallons of water per year.\n\nWe announced our goal to be water positive in 2030, and in 2021, we reached the milestone of contracting 1 billion gallons of water per year for restoration.\n\nThough they cover only around 6% of the earth\u2019s land surface, 40% of all plant and animal species live or breed in wetlands.\nTo create a better reality, we must start by improving our own practices, processes and culture.\nBecause climate-related issues are inherently uncertain, assessing risks and evaluating actions is an ongoing process.\n\nFor the last decade, we have invested in ways to minimize our footprint, champion renewable energy, restore water supplies and support climate justice. As of 2020, our global operations have reached net zero emissions and are supported by 100% renewable energy.\n\nTo maintain forward progress as our business grows and evolves, we regularly conduct climate-related risk and opportunity assessments to better understand and manage future transitional and physical risks associated with climate change. This helps us take the right measures that contribute to our company\u2019s and our world\u2019s resilience.\n\nTo guide our work, in 2021, we incorporated recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. This process helps provide a view into how we understand and manage the risks and opportunities associated with climate change, and it informs how we prepare to navigate the evolving disclosure landscape (including potential U.S. and EU regulations and requirements). We are committed to completing a full TCFD scenario planning in 2022.\n\nTransitional risks can occur as businesses recalibrate to a cleaner, green economy. To assess our transitional climate risks, we consider potential changes to climate policies as well as technological, market and reputational risks. We believe we are better positioned for the transition to a greener future through our efforts to support our operations with 100% renewable energy and our goal to reach net zero emissions across our value chain in 2030.\n\nEarly warning systems for disasters can deliver benefits up to 10 times the initial cost.\nOur climate resilience toolkit provides checklists and key questions for each type of physical risk to help develop resiliency plans.\n\nTo address our physical climate-related risks, we execute assessments using models and potential risk scenarios. We use the intermediate and business-as-usual scenarios based on IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5 to better understand how acute and chronic physical risks may impact our global facilities, data centers and supply chain.\n\nWe have assessed physical risks, such as wildfires, sea-level rise, water stress, floods, hurricanes and heat stress, completing climate risk assessments for over 500 priority sites. Insights from these assessments help inform our operational strategy and identify key opportunities to weave climate-related considerations into our long-term resiliency strategy.\n\nWe strengthen our climate resilience when we incorporate the results of these assessments into key business decisions. Our climate resilience toolkit provides checklists and key questions for each type of physical risk to help develop resiliency plans. Teams also conduct tabletop exercises to practice responses to disruptive extreme weather events.\n\n67% of Americans perceive a rise in extreme weather.\nRESPONSIBLE SUPPLY CHAIN\n\nSustainability across our value chain.\n\nMeta is part of a complex value chain that touches lives and communities around the globe. Our Responsible Supply Chain (RSC) program strives to empower workers and protect the environment\u2014through open and frequent communication with our suppliers, deep understanding of core sustainability issues and initiatives that support safe, healthy and fair working conditions.\n\nOur approach begins with establishing clear expectations with our suppliers through our standards and policies, including the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct.\n\nThe RBA Code of Conduct, Meta\u2019s Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking statement and Meta\u2019s Conflict Minerals Policy serve as some of the RSC program\u2019s core tenets and are a guidepost for the expectations we set with our suppliers.\n\nMeta is opposed to all forms of human trafficking, slavery, servitude, forced labor and all other trafficking-related activities as noted in our Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking statement. Our statement includes information on preventing forced labor risks in our supply chain, including risk assessment and due diligence processes. In support of these human rights commitments, our suppliers are also expected to follow Meta\u2019s policy requirements in creating and ensuring a respectful workplace. Additionally, we expect our suppliers to understand and conform with our Corporate Human Rights Policy.\n\nSupply chains generate around 60% of all carbon emissions globally.\nEvaluating and Addressing Risk\n\nWe extend our approach to risk assessment to our global supply chain, working closely with suppliers to help them understand, prevent and mitigate risks in and to their business. Assessments come in multifaceted forms that include independent audits, supplier questionnaires, on-site visits or conversations.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to identify meaningful areas of improvement by engaging with workers directly through mobile surveys that provided key worker sentiment. Surveys have led to improvements in worker satisfaction through focus group discussions, stronger new employee onboarding and improved grievance mechanisms and analysis. We have taken a more holistic approach to worker well-being thanks to survey feedback that includes physical and emotional health and ideas for managing stress.\n\nMeta experts address identified issues with direct supplier engagement and corrective action. When needed, we also look to external partners for support in the areas of labor, health and safety to help suppliers identify areas for improvement and create structured action plans with measurable outcomes.\n\nNet Zero Supplier Engagement\n\n\u201cFor a Better Reality\u201d is about building a better future. Business as usual must fundamentally change to move away from what is obviously an unsustainable path. This shift is an enormous undertaking affecting all levels of the supply chain, an undertaking even a company the size of Meta cannot tackle alone. What we can control right now is how we operate, what we create and how we collaborate to collectively solve this giant challenge.\n\nWe have developed a supplier engagement program to help us reach net zero emissions across our value chain in 2030. We focus on working together with vendors to determine their Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, training them to set reduction targets and to take the actions to achieve those targets.\nRESPONSIBLE SUPPLY CHAIN\n\nAssessing resilience to climate change is crucial to ensuring our supply chain is prepared for climate risks.\n\nWe engaged with 40 suppliers in 2021 to identify GHG reduction opportunities within their operations. For example, we conducted an energy-efficiency assessment for a data center hardware supplier in 2021. We identified nearly 9,000 megawatt hours (MWh) of potential annual energy savings within the supplier\u2019s mechanical and electrical facility-level equipment.\n\nPotential projects include installing higher efficiency equipment, replacing valves and damaged insulation, and implementing automatic variable operation controls for chilled water pumps and air handling units.\n\nThe facility will be able to save not only energy (and related indirect emissions) but also energy costs, with payback periods ranging from less than one year to up to four years.\n\nWe are also working with suppliers to ensure they understand the climate risks they may face, including floods, heat stress, typhoons, hurricanes, water stress and sea-level rise. Assessing resilience to climate change is crucial to guiding our efforts to ensure the people and communities within our supply chain are prepared for climate risks.\n\nSupply chain emissions are, on average, 11.4 times higher than operational emissions.\n\nHappiness Series\n\nMeta\u2019s value chain spans the globe, relying on technology, innovation and, most importantly, people from all cultures and walks of life.\n\nOur Happiness Series is an initiative launched in 2020 that strives to increase supply chain worker morale and sense of belonging. In 2021, our team worked to deepen their understanding of what workers want from their jobs and their lives and what they are passionate about.\n\nAfter spending time at a supplier factory in China, our team was inspired by the employees\u2019 vast interest in education for personal growth and investment in their families. To honor the workers\u2019 commitment to their families and to encourage them to focus on enriching their own lives, we installed a \u201csmart\u201d library at the factory. More than 11,000 workers can access nearly 2,000 books\u2014books that empower women to take control of their own destiny and books workers can share with their children.\n\n\u201cThe Happiness Series extends beyond code compliance,\u201d explained Leslie Collins, Head of Responsible Supply Chain Sustainability for Meta. \u201cIt\u2019s about wanting to do good and working to elevate joy in the lives of workers.\u201d\nHealthy, safe and sustainable workplaces.\n\nWith nearly 72,000 employees across 80 cities, providing workplaces that are healthy, safe and sustainable exemplifies our commitment to building a better reality\u2014and directly engages our employees in our vision.\n\nWe focus equally on what \u201cbetter\u201d means for the people inside our workplaces and the natural environment around them. Our approach is driven by climate action, supporting biodiversity, practicing circularity and promoting well-being.\n\nIn 2021, the majority of our workforce continued to work from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In alignment with our 100% renewable energy commitment, we purchased renewable energy to cover the electricity used by Meta employees working from home.\n\nAs we reopen our offices globally, we are following best practices to ensure our facilities remain not only energy and water efficient but also safe for re-entry. The majority of our global offices are WELL Health-Safety Rated. This third-party rating assesses our operational policies, maintenance protocols and emergency planning related to COVID-19 response. Through this effort, we enhanced our policies and procedures targeted at cleaning and sanitization, emergency preparedness, health service resources, air and water quality management and health-safety communication.\nHealthy and Sustainable Workplaces\n\nExpanding our Healthy and Sustainable Materials Program\u2014which focuses on reducing embodied carbon and avoiding chemicals of concern\u2014to address product Global Warming Potential is a critical step in reaching our goal to reduce the embodied carbon of facility building materials by 40% in 2030 from a 2019 baseline. Embodied carbon refers to the CO\u2082 emissions generated by the manufacturing and transporting of building materials as well as the construction process. The plan imposes limits on carbon-intensive construction materials, such as concrete, steel, drywall, carpet and furniture.\n\nMany of our offices are certified by LEED\u2014a globally recognized third-party verification standard for sustainable buildings developed by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC). All of our new offices over 100,000 square feet pursue LEED Gold Certification or higher. To date, we have 50 offices globally that are LEED certified.\n\nIn 2021:\n\n- 21 offices received LEED Gold certification (Dublin, Seattle, Denver, Chicago, Los Angeles, and multiple cities in the San Francisco Bay Area)\n- Sydney, Australia office received Green Star Certification (6-Star Level)\n- Fremont, California, campus earned Fitwel Certification (2-Star Level)\n- Hong Kong office achieved World Green Organisation\u2019s Green Office & Eco-Healthy Workplace Award\n- Dublin and London offices were re-certified under ISO 50001 Energy Management Certification\n\n85% of employees working in LEED-certified buildings say access to outdoor views and natural light boosts their productivity and happiness.\nOffice Spotlight\n\nOur new Dumbarton campus in Fremont, California, is LEED Gold and Fitwel Certified. The campus buildings are clustered around a central courtyard that extends to a variety of outdoor spaces, providing opportunities for communal and restorative activities. Within the buildings, office neighborhoods are located along the perimeter to maximize views to the landscaped areas. Ample sunlight penetrates deep into floor plates through the use of skylights and clerestories.\n\nThe buildings will use 25% less energy and 45% less water than the LEED baseline. We align construction material procurement with our Healthy and Sustainable Materials Program.\n\nCulinary Sustainability\n\nOur Culinary team nourishes the Meta community through responsibility, culture and hospitality.\n\nWe operate more than 60 cafes and 700 microkitchens globally, where we serve our employees and visitors healthy, delicious snacks and meals. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, 110,000 meals were served daily, and we expect this to continue. To help ensure this offering aligns with our climate commitments, in 2021, we launched our first Culinary Sustainability Program focused on embedding environmental and social responsibility into culinary operations.\n\nAs part of this program, we aim to:\n\n- **Reduce food waste** through innovative food preparation and serving practices, as well as waste tracking and sorting technology\n- **Reduce packaging waste** by integrating circular economic practices into our culinary offering and reducing single use\u2014we have eliminated plastic water bottles for our facilities globally\n- **Reduce the carbon intensity** of our ingredients through creative plant-forward menus and supporting regenerative food systems\n- **Reduce the carbon impact** of cooking through increasing our use of all-electric kitchens\n\nThe food system accounts for roughly 30% of global energy use.\nData centers are at the heart of the connections we enable. They power the internet and make digital communication possible. Data centers also account for the highest percentage of Meta\u2019s energy use, water use and GHG emissions.\n\nWe can have the largest impact on overall emissions reductions by designing, building and operating some of the most sustainable data centers in the world. Data center buildings we completed in 2021 exhibit a Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) of 1.09 and Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) of 0.26.\n\nOur Odense data center earned Green Data Center of the Year honors for Special Contribution to improving Energy Efficiency at the Data Center World Awards. The site also earned the Sustainable Data Center Award at the Data Cloud Global Awards.\n\nData centers consume 10-50 times the energy per floor space of a typical commercial office building.\nAs a leader in efficiency and renewable energy, we are a Platinum member of the U.S. Green Building Council and active on the LEED Advisory and Technical committees to help shape the future of its green rating system for data centers.\n\nFor Meta, efficiency and renewable energy are key components of our approach to designing, building and operating sustainable data centers. We focus on eliminating waste, boosting wellness, incorporating sustainable products and being a good neighbor in the communities where we have operations.\n\nSince our first Prineville data center building earned the LEED Gold certification in 2011, we have continued to achieve Gold certification levels, or higher, for all data center buildings. To date, we have certified 28 LEED Gold data center buildings, totaling nearly 17 million square feet. In 2021, six of our new construction data center buildings, in the following locations, were awarded LEED Gold certification, totaling over 3 million square feet:\n\n- One in Los Lunas, New Mexico\n- One in New Albany, Ohio\n- Two in Prineville, Oregon\n- Two in Henrico County, Virginia\n\nAs a leader in efficiency and renewable energy, we are a Platinum member of the U.S. Green Building Council and active on the LEED Advisory and Technical committees to help shape the future of its green rating system for data centers.\n\nEach site is designed to promote biodiversity, plant native and adaptive landscape, mimic the natural hydrology of the site and reduce urban heat island effect. As of 2021, we have protected more than 1,000 acres of open space on our data center campuses. We choose plant species, efficient irrigation, alternative water sources when available, and smart scheduling technologies that together save 80% more water using the EPA\u2019s WaterSense Water Budget Tool, saving more than 80,000 kilogallons (kGal) of water per year.\n\nUrban heat islands occur when natural land cover is replaced with pavement, buildings and other surfaces that absorb and retain heat.\n\nEach data center site is equipped with electric vehicle charging stations and the electrical infrastructure for future expansion.\n\nWe work to keep construction and demolition waste out of landfills and incineration facilities by recovering, reusing and recycling materials. Building projects completed in 2021 recycled over 50,000 tons of construction waste.\n\nWe source only Forestry Stewardship Council (FSC) certified new wood products. FSC certification confirms environmental protections for responsible forest management, protects customary rights of indigenous people and prohibits the use of highly hazardous chemicals.\nFor Our People\n\nMeta\u2019s data centers are designed by engaging multidisciplinary teams of designers and innovators. Dedicated to the highest design standards, we create spaces that are sustainable, inclusive and focused on how employees feel and perform at work. We design our sites and buildings with features intended specifically for human delight and the celebration of culture, spirit and place.\n\nData center workspaces maximize natural light, provide views to outdoor landscaping, include artworks from local artists, and mimic local geographic features via biophilic building and landscape architectural designs. In 2021, we adopted strategies into our data center design to improve interior acoustics for better privacy and concentration, as well as lighting quality to better simulate natural light and improve visibility.\n\nFollowing LEED guidelines, we design our data centers to increase fresh air in our office spaces by 30% to improve cognition. Each data center building completed in 2021 passed rigorous indoor air quality testing, confirming we have reduced indoor air contaminants, which is proven to improve occupants\u2019 comfort, lower absenteeism and increase productivity.\n\nHealth transparency goals for material ingredients are achieved through certifications, including Health Product Declaration, Cradle to Cradle certification and the Declare label.\n\nThe concentration of indoor air pollutants can be 2-5 times higher than typical outdoor concentrations.\nIn Altoona, Iowa, we are testing low-emission construction equipment, including solar hybrid lighting towers, temporary power generators with battery backup and electric heaters. We are partnering with general contractors and equipment suppliers to thoroughly evaluate the performance of this equipment using a triple bottom-line approach with the hope that we can eventually scale the use of this equipment across our construction sites globally.\n\nIn collaboration with our construction partners, Hardhat in Hand, our premier construction training program and workforce development initiative, launched across data center sites. We work with Hardhat in Hand to expand the local skilled trades talent pipeline, increase diversity in the construction industry and provide a path to reliable, well-paid job opportunities in a growing industry.\n\nEfficient Construction\n\nConstruction has traditionally been an industry that generates a lot of waste. Typically, raw materials are shipped to the site and then skillfully crafted to construct spaces to meet societal needs. Through building strategies like prefabrication, manufacturing, industrialization, and Design for Safe Manufacturing and Assembly (DFSMA), the Infra Construction Management team can reduce the volume of raw materials brought to site and construction waste generated, thereby reducing the overall carbon footprint. This not only enables the teams to work within available labor resources to build more and faster, but also has the added benefit of reducing waste generation on site while maintaining our high quality and safety standards.\n\nWe have seen that virtual reality increases engagement, helps with education, reduces surprises and increases transparency. We use 3D Terrestrial Laser Scanners to create point-cloud to compare the installation to the model. At each stage, we capture 360-degree progression photos to document building installation and take remote field site walks. We use drones to track construction progression, site logistics and volume calculations to right-size materials to the site\u2019s conditions.\n\nWe have seen that virtual reality increases engagement, helps with education, reduces surprises and increases transparency.\nData Center\nWater Efficiency\n\nBecause data centers rely on water to cool servers and maintain humidity levels, our teams are always looking for ways to reduce our water use. One method we use to conserve water is through direct evaporative cooling, which relies on outside air.\n\nTraditional technologies, like chilled water plants and cooling towers, rely on water to reject heat. In areas facing specific environmental challenges, such as high levels of dust, extreme humidity or elevated salinity, using direct cooling could severely impact IT equipment.\n\nIn these cases, we use indirect cooling systems to minimize the risk to our buildings and the servers housed within. In partnership with Nortek Air Solutions, we have developed an indirect cooling technology called the StatePoint Liquid Cooling (SPLC) system. The first of its kind to be deployed to data centers, SPLC produces cold water instead of cold air. The system uses less water than a typical indirect cooling system because it uses air to cool water instead of using water to cool air.\n\nBased on evaluation of our current water use, we have identified winter humidification needs as an area of opportunity to further improve our operating efficiency by optimizing our relative humidity (RH).\n\nWe piloted the RH adjustment at our data center in Los Lunas, New Mexico, and found by lowering our current 20% minimum RH to 13% minimum RH, we were able to reduce water use by 40% over nine months.\n\nWe have rolled out the RH minimum changes across our existing data centers and updated design standards for new construction. We expect this change will allow us to reduce water use 10% to 65% annually.\nCIRCULARITY\n\nOur approach to circularity.\n\nThe quantity of raw materials extracted from the earth has more than doubled over the past three decades.\n\nWe see circularity as key for the essential evolution from a linear system that is extractive, polluting and finite to a circular one that is sustainable. We also see it as our responsibility to use our products, family of apps and knowledge to catalyze circularity in our industry and beyond.\n\nTo help ensure alignment across all of Meta's program pillars, team leads meet quarterly in a cross-functional working group to share program updates, identify potential new project collaborations and learn from their peers about this rapidly evolving field.\nEmbedding circularity principles into how we design, build and operate our data centers helps us elevate resource efficiency to reduce water and waste.\n\nOur circularity principles also extend to the kinds of materials we use. To lower the carbon impact of concrete\u2014a large source of global GHG emissions\u2014we expanded our partnership with researchers from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\u2019s civil engineering and computer science departments to use an artificial intelligence (AI) model to generate low-carbon mix designs. These alternatives use high amounts of byproducts from other industries, such as fly ash and slag, as a replacement for cement. We incorporated lessons learned from the first pilot phase to train the model\u2019s AI to identify concrete mixes that optimize for early strength gain while lowering the carbon footprint.\n\nWe also piloted the use of recycled ground glass as a substitute for cement in various concrete applications in our data center locations in northern Huntsville, Alabama, and Gallatin, Tennessee. These pilots explored the feasibility of replacing cement with powdered glass from products such as bottles or window-panes that would otherwise end up in landfills. If successful, these efforts have the potential not only to lower the carbon footprint of the concrete we use but also to create a market demand for discarded glass products.\nCIRCULARITY\n\nWe are prioritizing the use of recycled materials in new system designs, in addition to our continued focus on ensuring hardware is easy to disassemble and reuse.\n\nWe understand that most of the embedded emissions from our data center infrastructure come from manufacturing, and circularity will be key to improving resource efficiency.\n\nStarting with design and material selection, we are prioritizing the use of recycled materials in new system designs, in addition to our continued focus on ensuring hardware is easy to disassemble and reuse.\n\nIn 2021, Meta\u2019s Sustainability team partnered closely with Quality and Engineering teams to co-create an internal Design for Circularity guide to integrate principles of design for reuse and design for end of life into the product development process. We are also focused on Design for Serviceability, making our equipment easy to repair in the field so our data center technicians are able to quickly and safely identify and resolve issues, thereby extending the lifespan of our hardware.\n\nTo continue to improve resource efficiency, we are exploring ways to extend the life of racks and components used in our data centers. We shared an example of this thinking in 2020 with battery backup units, and we are continuing to drive toward our goal of enabling a circular supply chain. By conducting internal reliability studies, configuring the logistics and developing necessary financial and asset tracking systems, we have extended the life of certain racks within our data centers. We are working toward harvesting and redeploying components and systems at scale that continue to meet our reliability standards for both critical spares and for integration into new racks.\n\nIn 2021, after many months of planning and conducting internal reliability studies, we focused our attention on the opportunity to extend the lifetime use of memory within our racks. Critically, memory is a carbon-intensive component within our infrastructure, and the opportunity to use this resource to its fullest extent is a key net zero strategy to \u201cuse less\u201d and avoid emissions in our upstream supply chain.\n\nBeyond circularity efforts within our data centers, we also work closely with our downstream partners to find a second life for parts outside of our data centers through secondary markets and to ensure all residual materials are responsibly managed.\n\nWe understand that most of the embedded emissions from our data center infrastructure come from manufacturing, and circularity will be key to improving resource efficiency.\n\nStarting with design and material selection, we are prioritizing the use of recycled materials in new system designs, in addition to our continued focus on ensuring hardware is easy to disassemble and reuse.\n\nIn 2021, Meta\u2019s Sustainability team partnered closely with Quality and Engineering teams to co-create an internal Design for Circularity guide to integrate principles of design for reuse and design for end of life into the product development process.

This is the most direct way we can tackle climate change\u2014the single largest threat to the well-being of people, the environment and businesses alike. A better reality will not truly be possible unless we, our partners and our suppliers work together to strategically reduce GHG emissions.\nIn 2020, we announced our goal to expand our net zero goal to include our value chain in 2030.\n\nWe have laid the foundation to reach our 2030 climate target:\n\n\u2022 Our climate program is aligned with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and is guided by the latest science on what is necessary to transition to a zero-carbon future.\n\n\u2022 In 2020, we achieved net zero GHG emissions in our direct operations (Scopes 1 and 2) by reducing our emissions by 94% compared to 2017 levels.\n\n\u2022 As we focus our attention on decarbonizing our Scope 3 emissions, we are working now to identify solutions that can scale as our business grows.\n\nThe climate impact associated with building the metaverse is something we are spending a lot of time thinking about and analyzing. New tools, products and facilities to support this growth will be a major challenge on the road to meet our already ambitious target.\n\nWe are actively building highly efficient data centers to offset the carbon footprint of building the metaverse.\n\nThe rapid expansion of hardware, data centers and offices to support our business means we must boldly innovate and optimize for efficiency. Early on in this decade, we do not expect decarbonization and growth to be in harmony. In fact, our emissions increased 11% from 2020 to 2021, and as we return to our offices, that number will remain high. This reality is clear and underscores the need for us to drive collaborative and innovative solutions across our business and with our suppliers today so that growth can happen sustainably.\n\nCO\u2082 emissions are increasing more than 250 times faster from human activity than from natural sources after the last Ice Age.\nOur strategy to reach net zero in our value chain entails three steps:\n\n1. We will focus on decarbonizing where we have the most direct control in the choices we make. Principles such as hardware circularity and integrating low-carbon technologies will be vital to reduce the emissions of our new and existing facilities.\n\n2. We will engage with our suppliers. Helping our suppliers set their own climate targets will reduce their emissions associated with our footprint while hopefully spurring decarbonization beyond Meta.\n\n3. Finally, we will support carbon removal projects of the highest standards to address the residual emissions that we cannot reduce.\n\nReducing Our GHG Emissions\n\nReducing GHG emissions across our global operations and value chain is our top priority and the most effective strategy to reach net zero. We will do this by:\n\n1. Using less and opting for what makes sense to do our work\n2. Choosing better and prioritizing efficiency in our supply chain, construction and other purchases\n3. Selecting alternatives, such as materials with low-carbon impact, that are easily recyclable\n\nAs we build the metaverse and the technology that comes with it, we will continue to focus on hardware circularity and efficiency to minimize our emissions as we grow. Because much of our emissions footprint is outside of our operational control, assisting our suppliers and vendors to set reduction targets through our supplier engagement program is critical to cutting our total emissions.\n\nCutting Workplace Emissions in Half\n\nWe are targeting a 50% reduction in the carbon impact of our workplace operations in 2030 on a per headcount basis. To achieve this goal, we are focused on achieving the following reductions from a 2019 baseline per capita:\n\n- 40% energy use reduction\n- 50% waste reduction\n- 100% sustainable employee commuter shuttle fleet\n- 40% reduction in drive alone commuter trips\n- 40% reduction in embodied carbon of building materials\n- 60% reduction in carbon intensity of culinary offerings\n\nShifting to a green economy could produce over 65 million new low-carbon jobs.\nGREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS\n\nGHG Accounting\n\nWe disclose our GHG emissions annually based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Our GHG footprint includes the emissions associated with running our business and data centers, as well as the indirect emissions created upstream from our operations and downstream in our products.\n\nWe quantify our emissions via activity data, life cycle assessments (LCAs) and financial data. We prioritize calculating our emissions through activity data that directly measures an activity that results in GHG emissions, such as kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity. Due to the complex nature of our business and value chain, we use proxy methods to help calculate our emissions when activity data is not available. We are focused on increasing granularity and using the most accurate methods available to calculate our emissions. Our emissions are verified by a third party and we invite you to learn more about our methodology here.\n\nScope 3 emissions usually account for more than 70% of a business\u2019s carbon footprint.\n\nMETA\u2019S 2021 NET CARBON FOOTPRINT\n\n| Category                        | mt CO\u2082e |\n|---------------------------------|---------|\n| 1% Scope 1                      | 55,000  |\n| <1% Scope 2                     | 2,000   |\n| 99% Scope 3                     | 5,651,000|\n| 42% Capital Goods               | 2,410,000|\n| 42% Purchased Goods & Services  | 2,371,000|\n| 10% Use of Sold Products        | 558,000 |\n| 3% Upstream Transportation & Distribution | 180,000 |\n| 1% Fuel & Energy Related Activities | 75,000 |\n| 1% Other                        | 29,000  |\n| 1% Employee Commuting (includes work from home emissions) | 22,000 |\n| <1% Business Travel             | 5,000   |\n\nThese market-based emissions were 43% smaller than our location-based emissions (9.9 Mt CO\u2082e). Our market-based emissions adjust for emissions reductions from purchasing decisions we have made. This includes our contracting of over 7,500 MW of renewable energy and purchase of over 700,000 gallons of sustainable aviation fuel for business travel, which has an up to 80% lower carbon footprint than traditional jet fuel.\n\nWe removed 90,000 tons of CO\u2082 through carbon removal projects to cover our Scope 1 and 2 emissions.\nSupporting Carbon Removal Projects\n\nOur commitment to net zero means that for any emissions we cannot eliminate, we will purchase carbon removal credits to sequester an equivalent amount of CO\u2082 from the atmosphere.\n\nIn 2021, we supported carbon removal projects in Kenya and Mexico that represent over 200,000 tons of carbon sequestration via forests and soil. We partner with nonprofits, peers and other experts to inform the composition of our project portfolio and ensure that our due diligence process is rigorous.\n\nThe projects we select reflect our responsibility to address the social and environmental impacts of our emissions. We prioritize carbon removal projects that:\n\n- Are designed to be a reliable and additional source of carbon sequestration\n- Are quantified using existing standards and verified by a third party\n- Do not create adverse impacts elsewhere\n- Prioritize climate justice and equity\n\nTechnological carbon removals are a small but important component of our net zero strategy. Because technological carbon removals are in their infancy and not yet available at a meaningful scale, forward-looking companies like Meta must invest today to ensure removals are viable and available in the future. Among the ways we are helping to drive development in the sector are collaborative actions that will aggregate the resources of multiple companies to create rapid change at a large scale.\n\nIn 2022, our contribution to the Frontier advance market commitment will help catalyze a market for technological carbon removal credits and unlock the opportunity to learn from global scientific leaders on emerging carbon removal technologies.\n\nDriving Demand for Sustainable Aviation Fuel\n\nAs a founding member of the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA), we are supporting efforts to drive market demand for sustainable aviation fuel. Spearheaded by RMI and Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) and supported by their founding companies, SABA aims to accelerate the path to net zero aviation by driving investment in and adoption of sustainable aviation fuel, which could substantially reduce emissions from air travel.\nMeta is one of the largest corporate buyers of renewable energy.\n\nWe are driving the transition to renewable energy in our communities by selecting projects that are on the same electricity grids as our data centers. At the end of 2021, Meta had contracts in place for more than 7,500 megawatts (MW) of solar and wind energy across our global portfolio. Of that, over 4,900 MW of new renewable energy is now operating.\n\n4,900 MW is enough to power 3.6 million U.S. homes.\nWe help lead the changes that make clean energy solutions more accessible to other companies.\n\nEnabling the Transition to Renewable Energy\n\nTransitioning to renewable energy at the scale our world needs requires systems-level changes. So when we switch to renewables, we are not creating sustainable solutions only for ourselves. We help lead the changes that make clean energy solutions more accessible to other companies.\n\nNot all utilities offer electric rates (or \u201ctariffs,\u201d as utilities call them) that allow customers to support their facilities with renewable energy. When this is the case, we work with utility partners to create new green tariffs or pursue other new renewable energy arrangements to maintain our goal of supporting our global operations with 100% renewable energy.\n\nThese utility offerings allow large energy customers to purchase renewable energy and renewable energy credits via their retail electricity service and address their sustainability goals.\n\nThe green tariffs and renewable energy arrangements we have supported account for over 4,000 MW of new wind and solar capacity.\n\nIn 2021, we worked with the local utility, Salt River Project (SRP), to establish a new renewable energy supply agreement to support our Mesa, Arizona, data center. Of the 500 MW of solar that will be added in the next few years, 450 MW will support our 960,000-square-foot Mesa data center with 100% renewable energy, leaving 50 MW for SRP to offer residential and small business customers, supporting broader customer access to renewable energy.\n\nRenewable Energy Progress\n\n| Year | Total Electricity Used (million MWh) | Nonrenewable | Renewable |\n|------|-------------------------------------|--------------|-----------|\n| 2016 | 1.83                                | 44%          | 56%       |\n| 2017 | 2.46                                | 51%          | 49%       |\n| 2018 | 3.42                                | 75%          | 25%       |\n| 2019 | 5.14                                | 86%          | 14%       |\n| 2020 | 7.17                                | 100%         | 0%        |\n| 2021 | 9.42                                | 100%         | 0%        |\n\nWind power, sold at a fixed price over a long period of time, mitigates the price uncertainty associated with traditional energy sources.\nEconomic Impact\n\nTo fully understand the impact of Meta\u2019s renewable energy projects on jobs and the economy, we released a study in May 2021 that looked at the economic impact of 55 solar and wind projects that support our U.S. data centers. The projects studied total 5,763 MW\u2014some of which are operating today and others that will come online over the next three years\u2014and represent an estimated $7.4 billion in investment. During construction, these renewable energy projects have supported or will support over 42,000 jobs across the country and contribute more than $4.3 billion in U.S. gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nOur portfolio of solar and wind projects spans 18 states and 46 counties, and many of these projects have benefited under-resourced communities. Of the 55 U.S. solar and wind projects in our portfolio studied, 96% are located outside of major metropolitan areas and 82% are located in counties with poverty rates above the national average. The analysis showed that construction of these renewable energy projects have generated or will generate $2.6 billion of labor income for workers, and project operations will generate $70 million in annual employee compensation.\n\nEnergy Storage\n\nDemand for electricity varies significantly throughout the day. Fossil fuel generators can be quickly activated or deactivated to account for these variations. Renewable energy technology, like wind and solar, are weather-dependent, so they do not necessarily match the variations in electricity demand on their own. However, energy storage can help to smooth the small deviations in energy production on the system to help integrate greater volumes of renewable energy.\n\nAdditionally, to prevent wasted energy when demand is low on sunny or windy days, and to support grid reliability on cloudy, calm days, large-scale storage is critical. Adding energy storage to the grid is an important tool that enables utilities to move the electricity produced from a solar project, for instance, into times of the day when sunshine is not available. This provides greater reliability and flexibility to the utility system and enables a much lower carbon footprint, as utilities integrate even more renewable energy on their grids.\n\nMeta is also providing funding for added storage to local utilities, allowing them to prepare for and transition to the zero-carbon grid of tomorrow.\n\nNear our Los Lunas data center in Valencia County, New Mexico, we partnered with our local utility, Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM), to add 50 MW of battery storage alongside the addition of 240 MW of solar through our innovative green tariff. This unique commercial structure allows customers like us to directly pay for capacity resources like energy storage to offset the need to add nonrenewable energy resources to the system.\n\nIn total, Meta has worked with utility partners, PNM and Tennessee Valley Authority, to add 130 MW of battery energy storage to the grid in New Mexico, Kentucky, and Mississippi.\nIn 2021, we announced our goal to become water positive in 2030.\n\nAll living things rely on water. Without it, ecosystems dwindle and communities suffer. So when it comes to this precious resource, using less is not enough.\n\nRising temperatures can lead to deadly pathogens in freshwater sources, making the water dangerous for people to drink.\nTo achieve this goal, Meta will restore 200% of the water we consume in high water stress areas, and 100% of the water we consume in medium water stress areas. Our water restoration projects always have a hydrological connection to the source water consumed in our operations and are verified by independent third-party verifiers. Since 2017, we have supported a total of 18 water restoration projects in six watersheds. Together, these projects are expected to restore more than one billion gallons of water annually. In regions experiencing high levels of water stress, these projects have already restored about 617 million gallons of water as of 2021.\n\nOften the most impactful contributions to the sustainability of a watershed go beyond projects that return volumetric benefits. That is why we are also supporting capacity-building projects that might have a catalytic effect in watersheds around the world. These projects could include supporting local environmental nonprofits, governance, research and other non-volume-generating activities. We also strive to be good water stewards by working with others to advance industry understanding and practices. In 2021, we joined the Rio Grande Water Fund and the Texas Water Action Collaborative to support collective action initiatives in these important regions. We are also members of the World Resources Institute\u2019s Aqueduct Alliance and sponsors of the Swedish International Water Institute\u2019s World Water Week conference.\n\n### 2021 Water Data\n\n|                      | 2017     | 2018     | 2019     | 2020     | 2021     |\n|----------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| **Water Withdrawal** | 1,609,000| 2,367,000| 3,430,000| 3,726,000| 5,043,000|\n| **Water Consumption**| 838,000  | 1,279,000| 1,971,000| 2,202,000| 2,569,000|\n| **Water Restoration**| \u2014       | 132,000  | 145,000  | 2,250,000| 2,336,000|\n\n*Reported volumes represent total volume restored through water restoration projects for each year, not including contracted projects not yet implemented.\n\n2.3 billion people live in water-stressed countries.\nMeta partnered with DigDeep to fund water systems for Navajo families.\n\nWater quality and quantity are often very local issues, so we have joined forces with nonprofit and community partners to create and implement water restoration initiatives that benefit the areas in which we operate.\n\nIn 2021, Meta partnered with DigDeep to fund water systems for Navajo families that lack access to water in Dilkon, Arizona. Each system includes a 1,200-gallon water tank, indoor plumbing, power connections to provide running water, and recurring water delivery to refill the water tank (managed by Navajo community partners). The water is supplied from existing, deep groundwater wells. Meta\u2019s contribution will install tanks at 14 households, providing approximately 300,000 gallons of water per year to families.\n\nHere are a few of the projects we supported in 2021:\n\n**Navajo Community Water Supply**\nJadito Wash Watershed, Arizona\n\nThe Navajo Nation is the largest contiguous Native American reservation in the continental U.S. Located within the Four Corners region of the American Southwest, its borders span 71,000 square kilometers. One-third of the Navajo Nation population lacks access to running water. Navajo households pay 70 times more for the water they must haul into their homes compared to water users in typical urban areas.\n\n\u201cThroughout the pandemic, DigDeep\u2019s Navajo Water Project team members have shown great tenacity and innovation in their efforts to expand clean water access on the Navajo Nation. With the lessening of COVID-19 restrictions, we are thrilled to share that we have finally been able to resume the in-home installations of our Home Water Systems. Meta\u2019s continued support of DigDeep\u2019s Navajo Water Project has been instrumental to helping us get tapped water into more homes during this crucial time.\u201d\n\u2014BJ Davis, Chief Relationship Officer at DigDeep\nRestoring Wetlands\nRichland Creek Wildlife Management Area, Texas\n\nTexas\u2019s Richland Chambers Reservoir has been addressing the growing water supply needs of the Dallas-Fort Worth region since the 1980s. Construction of the 40,000-acre reservoir resulted in the loss of substantial floodplain, riparian hardwood forest and wetland habitat within the Richland and Chambers Creeks watersheds.\n\nThe Richland Creek Wildlife Management Area (WMA) was created to help offset habitat loss. An extensive wetland treatment system covers over 5,000 acres of the WMA and helps treat raw Trinity River Water before it is delivered to municipal and industrial water users in Dallas-Fort Worth.\n\nDucks Unlimited has been working to build wetland habitat at WMA since 1987, constructing over 5,000 acres of wetland so far. In 2021, Meta partnered with Ducks Unlimited to fund a new wetland habitat in the Upper Trinity River basin.\n\nWater from the Trinity River floods this newly created wetland complex during the winter season, providing habitat for a diverse array of shorebirds, waterfowl and raptors. The wetlands naturally treat the surface water by filtering out sediment, nitrogen and phosphorus from the water, which flows back into the Trinity River in spring. This project will restore over 200 million gallons of water annually.\n\nMason Lane Ditch Piping\nVerde River Watershed, Arizona\n\nOak Creek, one of the few remaining perennial streams in Northern Arizona, is a tributary of the Verde River. It runs through high desert canyons and the famous red rocks of Sedona before joining with the Verde River. Oak Creek provides recreation and supports a vibrant ecosystem of mammals, birds and aquatic species, including the endangered Gila Chub and Gila Topminnow.\n\nAlong Oak Creek, 19 separate ditches divert irrigation water to residents. Although the ditches are important contributors to the local economy, most are more than 150 years old and limited capital exists to invest in infrastructure upgrades to meet the needs of water users and aquatic habitat.\n\nThe Mason Lane Ditch provides water to over 220 acres of irrigated land along its five-mile path. Degradation throughout the canal resulted in leakage and seepage, threatening its ability to meet agricultural water needs. Erosion in one particular section of the canal formed several large leaks, spilling seven cubic feet of water per second from the ditch and reducing Oak Creek\u2019s flow by 15%.\n\nMeta provided support to Bonneville Environmental Foundation, which allowed for a partnership between The Nature Conservancy and the Mason Lane Water Users Association to install 5,280 feet of piping to reduce transmission losses and reduce the volume of water diverted from Oak Creek. This project will restore over 180 million gallons of water to Oak Creek per year.\n\nIn addition to projects that return volumes, we are investing in projects that have catalytic impacts on watersheds. In 2022, we will continue to support new water restoration projects in the watersheds where we operate, collaborate with other stakeholders in collective action to address shared water challenges, and invest in technologies to improve our water efficiency.\nFor Stefanie Woodward, her role is more than a job\u2014it\u2019s personal. Having grown up in Arizona, she understands the impact of water stress on local watersheds and has spent her career focused on water conservation in both the nonprofit and private sectors. Stefanie\u2019s hope is a world in which future generations can continue to enjoy the natural wonders in her home state and many others around the world.\n\nHow did your passion for water conservation and resource preservation lead you to Meta?\n\nMy education focused on climate resilience, corporate sustainability and water. After grad school, I worked in the nonprofit sector developing guidance on corporate water stewardship and helping companies establish water stewardship programs as a consultant. My role with Meta gives me the opportunity to synthesize all of these experiences, and I am really excited about where our program is headed.\n\nHow can a company like Meta address environmental issues?\n\nWe all have to do our part to ensure a safe, clean water supply. Private companies like Meta can work in collaboration with environmental nonprofits, utilities and the public sector to address shared water challenges on a broader scale.\n\nWhy is becoming water positive a priority for Meta?\n\nWater is an essential element in operating a tech company, and data centers can have a big water footprint. While we have some of the most water efficient data centers in the world, we also recognize that to be good water stewards, we need to collaborate with stakeholders beyond our own operations.\n\nSince 2017, we have partnered with environmental organizations and water utilities to restore water in the watersheds where we operate. In 2021, we announced our commitment to becoming water positive in 2030, and the program has since grown to 18 projects in six watersheds.\n\nHow do you explain to your family and friends what you do at Meta, and what do they think?\n\nAt first, I got a lot of questions about how exactly a tech company uses water. Now they understand and love hearing about the wide variety of water projects we support\u2014from restoring wetlands to providing clean water to those without access to working with farmers or restoring landscapes with beaver dams. Some of the most gratifying projects to me are the ones benefiting communities and ecosystems in my home state of Arizona\u2014especially those in the same creeks where I love to hike with friends and family.\n\n40% of the global population lacks access to clean and safe drinking water.\nBiodiversity is critical to ecosystem health.\n\nIn the last hundred years, more than 90% of crop varieties have disappeared from farmers\u2019 fields.\n\nThe loss of biodiversity\u2014the rich assortment of living organisms that includes plants, bacteria, animals, insects; every living thing\u2014has critical implications for humanity, from the collapse of food chains and health systems to the disruption of entire supply chains. According to the World Economic Forum\u2019s 2022 Global Risks Report, biodiversity loss is listed as the third most severe risk on a global scale over the next 10 years.\nWe continuously take steps to both mitigate impacts from our offices and data centers and seek opportunities to protect and promote biodiversity where we operate facilities.\n\nIn 2021, we installed beehives at our Seattle, Dublin and New York offices, housing over 180,000 bees.\n\nProtecting Our Pollinators\n\nPollinators play a key role in supporting ecosystems, ensuring food security and providing ecosystem services such as clean air and soil stability. Given their critical importance, we aim to support pollinators where possible. In 2021, we installed beehives at our Seattle, Dublin and New York offices, housing over 180,000 bees, and continue to support pollinators where we operate:\n\n- We are providing nearly 30 acres of improved pollinator habitat at our data center site in Gallatin, Tennessee.\n- At our data center in Clonee, Meath, Ireland, we implemented a beekeeping program to help cultivate beehives and planted a variety of native plants on site to provide resources for over 500,000 bees.\n- We partnered with the London Beekeepers Association to provide habitat on our terraces that support nearly 500 species of insects native to the U.K.\n\nOf the 100 crop species that provide 90% of the world\u2019s food, over 70 are pollinated by bees.\nGreen Roof\n\nOur Menlo Park headquarters features a 12.5-acre green roof that provides a diverse landscape for local species, offering habitats ranging from grasslands to oak savannas and meadows. The roof serves as a home to over 600 trees and, to date, 5,300 birds representing 50 avian species have been found foraging and nesting on the roof by the Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society during monthly surveys.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to develop our 80-acre Bayfront Campus in Menlo Park, California, by creating an 11-acre park. We focused on diversifying tree species, particularly oaks (Quercus), both to avoid monoculture and to transition to species adapted to our changing climate, which is getting warmer and dryer. Over the past eight years, we have planted 2,650 new trees.\n\nWe also partner with a number of local nonprofits striving to promote biodiversity and improve habitats near our Menlo Park headquarters, including Canopy, whom we partnered with to plant trees in the Belle Haven neighborhood of Menlo Park; Save The Bay, which focuses on restoring and protecting wetlands in the Bay Area; and the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory, which restores habitat for endangered bird species, such as the snowy plover and burrowing owl.\nLeveraging Our Platforms to Protect Wildlife\n\nMeta has strong standards and policies in place to help prevent illegal wildlife trafficking from happening on our platforms. For example, our Community Standards prohibit the sale of live animals between private individuals (i.e., non-brick-and-mortar stores) on our platform and the publishing of content that coordinates or supports the poaching or selling of endangered species and their parts. Meta\u2019s Commerce Policies are even stricter, prohibiting the sale of any live animals, pets, livestock or animal parts.\n\nContent reviewers are trained on these topics, including modules on ivory and specific species known to commonly surface. These policies align with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) Appendix I.\n\nEducational alert features on Facebook and Instagram are designed to prevent wildlife trafficking online and inform people about the harmful impact of wildlife exploitation. When an Instagram user searches a hashtag associated with harmful behavior to animals, such as #tigerselfie or #elephantivory, or a Facebook user searches linked terms such as \u201cbuy antique ivory,\u201d an advisory will warn about these dangers and provide an opportunity to learn more.\n\nWe also took proactive measures to prevent the creation and searchability of violating content by blocking specific hashtags on Instagram known to be associated with the sale of endangered species across different geographies. As a result, in 2021, our teams completed a project that permanently blocked 25 hashtags related to endangered species across four markets to prevent users from searching for or creating them on the platform. In 2022, we plan to expand this effort to further limit the creation or sharing of this type of content and raise further awareness on protecting endangered species.\n\nOur teams completed a project that permanently blocked 25 hashtags related to endangered species across four markets.\n\nAs a result, in 2021, our teams completed a project that permanently blocked 25 hashtags related to endangered species across four markets to prevent users from searching for or creating them on the platform. In 2022, we plan to expand this effort to further limit the creation or sharing of this type of content and raise further awareness on protecting endangered species.\n\nPartnerships Reduce Illegal Trading\n\nCross-sector collaboration and industry partnerships are crucial in scaling impact in this area. In 2018, in partnership with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), TRAFFIC, and other leading businesses, we launched the Coalition to End Wildlife Trafficking Online, aiming to reduce the illegal trade in ivory and other wildlife products by 80%.\n\nSnow Leopards are among the top 10 endangered species.\n\nTo protect just one tiger, we have to conserve an estimated 10,000 hectares of forest.\nDriving climate action with our platforms and products.\nOur world is facing challenges that no one has faced before, with climate change topping the list.\n\nMeta was born to innovate, ask questions and build products that enable people to change and grow. So, in conjunction with our efforts to operate for a better reality, we leverage the capabilities of our platforms to drive climate action through our core products. We create solutions that connect people not only with each other but also with resources, information, tools and opportunities.\n\nOn the current path of CO\u2082 emissions, temperature could increase by as much as 4.4\u00b0C by the end of the century.\nWHAT WE CREATE\n\nPeace of Mind\n\nWhen a natural disaster or other crisis strikes, it is not only those on the frontlines who are affected. Our Crisis Response product allows individuals to mark themselves safe and give their loved ones peace of mind. In 2021, 12 million people marked themselves safe in 70 countries.\n\nThe tool also connects people who want to help with ways to help. More than 73 million people visited the Crisis Response page, while about 227,000 community help posts were generated and about $2.2 million was raised through the product.\n\nIt is estimated that nearly two billion adults know little to nothing about climate change.\u00b3\n\nAt the same time, misinformation about climate change continues to spread both online and offline.\n\nThis reality led to the creation of the Climate Science Center (CSC). The CSC increases access to science-based and dynamic climate information to drive awareness and inspire more people to take action.\n\nWe work with the world\u2019s leading climate science organizations, including the IPCC, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and others, to ensure that the information we feature is timely and accurate.\n\n\u00b3 Facts about climate change\nRAISING AWARENESS\n\n2021 Climate Science Center Updates\n\nMeta expanded the CSC\u2019s reach to more than 100 countries, attracted more than 3.8 million followers, and served more than 100,000 daily visitors.\n\nWe also partnered with experts from Monash, Yale and Cambridge to directly address climate myths. The Facts About Climate Change section includes misconceptions about the existence and causes of global warming, as well as the impact it has on humans and other life on Earth.\n\nIn collaboration with the UN Foundation, we featured their four-part Say it with Science series on the CSC, which features conversations between IPCC scientists and youth climate advocates from around the world, exploring the links between climate change and food, oceans, health and resilience. The goal of Say it with Science is to make climate science more accessible and engaging for younger audiences and to elevate the voices of young climate advocates.\n\nData for Good partnered with the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication to conduct a global Climate Change Opinion Survey across 31 countries and territories on Facebook. The survey provided new insights about public knowledge, attitudes, policy preferences and behaviors about climate change. For example, we found that more than six in 10 respondents across countries surveyed say they want more information about climate change, highlighting a global gap in knowledge about the subject and underscoring why Meta continues to provide authoritative information through tools such as the CSC.\n\nClimate Talks\n\nA six-episode podcast series, Climate Talks, features Meta team members, partners, scientists, activists and influencers. Hosted by Sophia Li, each episode allowed us to facilitate conversations examining various sustainability topics from multiple angles.\n\nThe Future of Business Is Green\n\nOver 200 million businesses use Meta\u2019s platforms to support their businesses. Our Sustainability for Business site provides resources for advertisers to find ways to decarbonize.\n\nSustainable Opportunity\n\nIn 2021, we introduced our first program for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). Working with the SME Climate Hub and our partners across Europe, Meta Boost Guide to Green provides training and resources to help users grow their businesses sustainably.\n\nWorldwide, just 38% of small businesses have invested in adapting to environmental risks, compared to 60% of large ones.\nEncouraging collaboration to combat false and misleading information.\n\nWe are committed to fighting the spread of climate misinformation on our platforms. We partner with more than 80 independent, third-party fact-checking organizations who are certified through the nonpartisan International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) to identify, review and take action on this content.\n\nAs with all types of claims rated false by our partners, we reduce the distribution of these posts in Feed so fewer people see them, and we show warning labels with more context for people who do see them, try to share them or already have shared them. Accounts that post misinformation repeatedly, including climate misinformation, will see their overall distribution reduced and may lose the ability to advertise or monetize.\n\nIn partnership with the IFCN and an independent six-member judging panel of climate domain experts, we launched the $1 million Climate Misinformation Grant to fund partnerships and proposals from fact-checkers, climate organizations and solution providers working to combat false and misleading information about climate change.\n\nWe received applications from around the world. Of the 30 global semifinalists, representing 71 entities, nine grantees were selected.\n\nThe grant was structured to encourage collaborative partnerships among applicants with diverse backgrounds, supported by the IFCN\u2019s fact-checkers. The proposals we have received include innovative approaches to fact-checking, media literacy, capacity-building and awareness raising and cover the full spectrum of climate information\u2014authoritative content, debunking of misinformation and inoculation approaches.\n\n\u201cGreenwashing\u201d refers to when companies misrepresent the sustainability of their products, services or operations.\nTACKLING CLIMATE MISINFORMATION\n\n\u201cMisinformation about climate change is a huge, interconnected problem, and solutions need to be equally large and interconnected. Adding capacity to the fact-checking community to skillfully and promptly respond to climate misinformation is a crucial part of the puzzle. In particular, we need stronger links between fact-checkers and experts in climate science and solutions. This grant program will lay the foundation for important future work in fighting back against misinformation that confuses the public about climate change and delays desperately needed climate action.\u201d \u2014John Cook, research fellow at the Climate Change Communication Research Hub at Monash University\n\nDoes climate change interest wane as other global threats capture attention?\n\nLarge-scale decrease in the social salience of climate change during the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThere are concerns that climate change attention is waning as competing global threats intensify. To investigate this possibility, we analyzed all link shares and reshares on Meta\u2019s Facebook platform (e.g., shares and reshares of news articles) in the United States from August 2019 to December 2020 (containing billions of aggregated and de-identified shares and reshares). We then identified all link shares and reshares on \u201cclimate change\u201d and \u201cglobal warming\u201d from this repository to develop a social media salience index\u2014the Climate SMSI score\u2014and found an 80% decrease in climate change content sharing and resharing as COVID-19 spread during the spring of 2020. Climate change salience then briefly rebounded in the autumn of 2020 during a period of record-setting wildfires and droughts in the United States before returning to low content sharing and resharing levels. This fluctuating pattern suggests new climate communication strategies\u2014focused on \u201csystemic sustainability\u201d\u2014are necessary.

The metaverse is an immersive, embodied successor to the mobile internet.\n\nOur focus will be to bring the metaverse to life, helping people connect, build communities, grow businesses and unlock new ways they can participate in the transition to a just, low-carbon economy.\n\nWe are already developing exciting new technologies that will help people connect and explore in the metaverse, including our virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and wearable hardware technologies and devices. Our net zero commitment is inclusive of these products, and we are committed to building the metaverse sustainably.\n\nIn 2021, we began conducting LCAs of our Reality Labs products, including Quest 2, to better understand the environmental impacts associated with each phase in the product life cycle\u2014materials, transportation, use phase and end of life. These LCAs enable teams to identify opportunities to incorporate circularity and reduce GHG emissions in our product development process.\nAllowing customers to purchase refurbished products for our devices delivers the same user experience while giving gently used products new life.\n\nThe Reality Labs team has already started on our journey to move the needle toward reducing the carbon footprint of our products, including:\n\n- Evaluating opportunities to incorporate plastics and metals with recycled content into products as these materials are available\n- Prioritizing the use of FSC or Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification certified fibers in our consumer packaging\n- Transitioning segments of our logistics network to lower-carbon modes of transit, such as leveraging ocean freight instead of air freight\n- Educating product development teams on hardware circularity principles through release of our internal Design for Circularity guide, with the intent of continuing to reduce waste, enable disassembly and improve material recovery\n\nMeta is committed to doing our part to extend the life of our products. In 2021, we launched our Meta Quest \u201cAs Good As New\u201d program, enabling customers to purchase refurbished products for our flagship devices, including Quest 1 and Quest 2. These devices have all the same features, performance and quality, while also giving our gently used products new life.\n\nThe impact from refurbishing a device is, on average, three times less than that of producing a new device.\nPartnerships enable us to scale positive impact.\nWe must work together to realize systems-level change.\n\nCollaboration is core to everything we do. Throughout this report, we have shared example after example of how partnerships enable us to use our size and scale to make a lasting positive impact.\n\nIt will take everyone to make the systems-level changes required for a better reality: world-class experts in sustainability and social issues, climate leaders, academic researchers, local utilities, community nonprofits, suppliers and every one of our thousands of employees.\n\nHere is a closer look at how we build new collaborations and support established initiatives, inside and outside of Meta.\n\nAlmost 90% of employees engaged in their company\u2019s sustainability work say it enhances their job satisfaction.\nWe empower employees to see themselves as part of the climate solution.\n\nMeta\u2019s employees are integral to the success of our company\u2019s bottom line and to championing our company\u2019s culture, so the success of our sustainability program depends on having employee voices at the table. We invite all employees to join our efforts by participating in executive Q&A sessions, educational training, local Green@ chapters or climate-focused hackathons.\n\nNo matter their role at Meta, we empower employees to see themselves as part of the climate solution through year-round programming. In 2021, we offered several powerful new initiatives to engage and activate employees in fresh ways.\n\n\u201cTo me, sustainability is the lens through which we need to view our future,\u201d said Christian Monzon, Technical Program Manager for Meta. \u201cI feel a responsibility to do my part in addressing climate change and promoting sustainable solutions where I can.\n\nMeta\u2019s core sustainability department is driving tremendously impactful work, but we would be significantly limiting our impact potential if we didn\u2019t also create advocates and champions among our 70,000+ employees.\n\nI help lead 12 Green@ chapters based in the Americas with the goal of fostering Meta\u2019s sustainability culture by introducing and encouraging sustainable choices and behaviors for all Metamates on and off our campuses,\u201d Christian continued.\nINTERNAL ENGAGEMENT\n\nEmployee Activation\n\nAcross Meta, employees are integrating climate action into daily activities. Employees focused on local community action continued to grow our global Green@ chapters. Employee activation and discussion on Workplace led to expansion of major activations for Earth Day, Climate Week and executive Q&As. Employee advocacy inspired many to promote and enroll in the Climate Reality Project education series. And employees leveraged their technical expertise to sponsor the Fall Hackathon for the second year in a row.\n\nSustainabiliTEA Talks\n\nIn 2021, we launched SustainabiliTEA Talks, a new live executive Q&A series on our internal communications platform, where Meta sustainability leaders engage in a dialogue about their personal passions, program work and ways for employees to get involved. Through this interactive forum, driven by employee questions, the broader community gets to see an honest portrayal of the challenges and opportunities in this space. Our first session featured Meta\u2019s net zero 2030 program and ways employees can contribute to reducing company emissions. Our second session highlighted Meta\u2019s participation in COP26 with policy leaders in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nEarth Week, Climate Week and Sustainability Summit\n\nIn April 2021, we organized our third annual Earth Week Celebration, held live on our internal communications platform. Over five days, we hosted 12 live events, expanded global content across Europe and Asia, and initiated a virtual marketplace with 50 global vendors and the first #MyCarbonCounts employee action campaign to help individuals identify their biggest carbon usage categories and reduce their footprint.\n\nIn September 2021, we held our second Climate and Sustainability Summit, in alignment with Meta\u2019s Climate Week activations. This one-day virtual conference highlighted programming across Meta and celebrated the cross-functional teams that make this work a reality.\n\nClimate Reality Project Leadership Corps\n\nIt is critical not only to connect employees with Meta\u2019s sustainability strategy and programming but also to provide access to the best-in-class educational resources. In 2021, we partnered with Climate Reality Project Leadership Corps, Al Gore\u2019s premiere training organization, to promote five different global week-long trainings and give our employees the opportunity to view their work and personal activities through the lens of climate justice.\n\nHackathons\n\nAt Meta, many of our best and brightest ideas are born from company hackathons\u2014these events are a core part of our culture that feed innovation into our sustainability programs as well. For the past five years, we have been working alongside a community of 500+ Sustainability Hackers to apply their technical expertise to product ideas for rapid iteration and fast feedback. In 2021, we co-sponsored the Fall Hackathon for a second year. We had a total of eight projects put forth across the U.S. and EMEA, with 85 hackers participating.\n\nWe also centralized all employee resources (for learning, action and engagement) into a single, internal wiki page. In 2022, we look forward to expanding education opportunities for employees hoping to level up their climate action, climate science literacy and understanding of Meta\u2019s climate goals.\n\nEmployee Activation\n\nAcross Meta, employees are integrating climate action into daily activities.

In 2021, we joined the Rio Grande Water Fund and the Texas Water Action Collaborative, both of which bring together nonprofit organizations, companies and other stakeholders to address shared water challenges.\n\nWe also committed to funding the African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative (AFR100), a country-led effort to bring 100 million hectares of land in Africa into restoration by 2030.\n\nInstagram partnered, through providing ad credit, with the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) to support Children, Cities and Climate, a study focusing on the intersection of climate change, cities, health and young people. LSHTM researchers carried out a global survey of over 3,000 young people and their parents to understand their views on the cities they live in and the air they breathe, using promoted social media advertisements on Facebook and Instagram to recruit participants. The research also included an analysis of the child health benefits of improving air quality in 16 global cities, and a literature review of the child health benefits of decarbonization.\n\nClimate change is a challenge too great for any of us to solve alone. But, by coming together, we have the power to make sustainable change.\nWe also worked with The Recycling Partnership to create Communities for Recycling, a personalized Messenger experience that provides recycling information based on where a person lives\u2014and to intuitively improve recycling accuracy.\n\nFollowing are additional organizations that Meta partners with or is a member of, focused on various aspects of sustainability and climate action.\n\n**Aqueduct Alliance**\n\nWe are members of the World Resources Institute (WRI)\u2019s Aqueduct Alliance, a group of leading companies, governments and foundations, to gain strategic guidance and industry insight from the WRI\u2019s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas team and water stewardship activities.\n\n**Business Alliance to Scale Climate Solutions**\n\nIn 2021, we joined the Business Alliance to Scale Climate Solutions (BASCS), a business-driven collaboration for climate solutions that generate results at the scale our world needs. This group provides a central, neutral platform for businesses and experts to meet, learn, discuss and act together as a \u201ccommunity of practice.\u201d\n\n**Open Compute Project**\n\nThe Open Compute Project (OCP) is a collaborative community focused on redesigning hardware technology to efficiently support the growing demands on compute infrastructure. Sustainability and circularity were identified as 2021 strategic initiatives for OCP. Recognizing the role we can play in galvanizing collaboration within the information and communication technology (ICT) sector, Meta helped lead the scoping and definition of the strategic initiative, helping co-author the community\u2019s first white paper dedicated to a call to action on climate change.\n\n**Responsible Business Alliance**\n\nFounded in 2004 by a group of leading electronics companies, the RBA is a nonprofit comprising electronics, retail, auto and toy companies committed to supporting the rights and well-being of workers and communities worldwide affected by the global supply chain. RBA members commit and are held accountable to a common Code of Conduct and use a range of RBA training and assessment tools to support continual improvement in the social, environmental and ethical responsibility of their supply chains.\n\nIn 2021, we provided a case study to a Chatham House Rules discussion with members to share our approach to both reporting and calculation of Scope 3 emissions. We were also actively involved in the Circular Materials Taskforce, which aims to help members adapt their business models and products to the circular economy by supporting integrated, international supply chains that further circular material use and protect human rights and the environment.\n\n\u201cConflict minerals\u201d include the metals tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold, which are often collectively referred to as \u201c3TG.\u201d\nThe Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) is one of the most used and respected resources for companies addressing issues related to the responsible sourcing of minerals in their supply chains. RMI is a multi-industry initiative that promotes an understanding of and commitment to mitigating the impacts of extracting and processing raw materials.\n\nWe maintain a Conflict Minerals Policy and expect our suppliers to conduct their operations pursuant to this policy.\n\nThe Responsible Labor Initiative (RLI) is a multi-industry, multi-stakeholder initiative focused on ensuring that the rights of workers vulnerable to forced labor in global supply chains are consistently respected and promoted.\n\nWe are also proud to be members of other environmental nonprofit trade organizations, supporting their work to advance clean technologies and climate action policies that support economy-wide decarbonization and climate resiliency, including:\n\n- Clean Energy Buyers Association (CEBA)\n- American Council on Renewable Energy\n- Advanced Energy Economy\n\nThe UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP26) brought together 120 world leaders and over 40,000 registered participants.\nComprehensive climate and clean energy policy is central to avoiding the impacts of climate change.\n\nClimate action is critical to achieving a sustainable economy and protecting our planet. We are working internally to decarbonize our operations and supply chain and to reduce our overall environmental footprint. Beyond our operations, we engage with climate-focused stakeholders, organizations and policymakers to advance stewardship, climate science and policies that will help move us all closer to a cleaner and decarbonized world.\n\nWe know that industry, regulatory and stakeholder engagement are critical to realizing our own net zero goals and the progress the world needs to achieve in the coming years. Comprehensive and well-designed climate and clean energy policy is central to transitioning to a future that avoids the worst impacts of climate change.\n\nIn 2021, Meta showed support for key policies in the U.S. and Europe to advance sustainable policies and climate action.\n\nIn the U.S., we actively participate in organizations that advocate for policies that will spur further clean energy deployment and decarbonize the electric sector as a whole. Meta endorsed the Climate Action Now Act (HR 9) in the 116th United States Congress.\nOur goal is not just to be one of the most sustainable companies but also to make it easier for our users and employees to live more sustainably.\n\nIn January 2021, we supported the call to the federal government to prioritize transitioning to a zero-carbon energy economy led by CEBA. And, in October 2021, we released a public statement where we called on Congress to support the climate and clean energy provisions within the Build Back Better Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.\n\nMeta is also fully committed to supporting the European Green Deal, which provides the framework toward a more sustainable and climate-neutral Europe by 2050. We are partnering with the European Union and the governments across the EU in making the ambitions of the Green Deal a reality. In 2021, Meta joined the EU\u2019s European Climate Pact, which aims to engage European citizens on climate action, and we supported the Corporate Leaders Group sign-on letter in support of the EU Nationally Determined Contribution.\n\nBeing a leader in the fight against climate change means bringing our industry forward with us by actively sharing strategies and ideas with the broader technology industry, as well as across other industries that face similar challenges.\n\nEnabling Climate Change Conversations\n\nFrom official events to tackling misinformation on a daily basis, we are using our platforms to enable crucial conversations about climate change. Our goal is not just to be one of the most sustainable companies but also to make it easier for our users and employees to live more sustainably.\n\nOur work in the lead-up to and during the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) demonstrates the way our platforms can serve as powerful tools to generate support for climate action.\n\nDuring COP26, we featured experts and scientists in new content designed to inform and inspire action. We hosted a Facebook and Instagram Live studio at the UNFCCC pavilion, which included over 90 conversations with leading voices on climate change.\n\nWe featured the Say it with Science conversation series on the Climate Science Center on Facebook covering health and climate change. On Instagram, we launched the editorial series Our Planet in Crisis, which features the stories of activists and organizers who are dedicated to spreading awareness and empowering others to take action in their local communities. We also debuted a new video series in Asia focused on climate change, called Forward Together, which shared new Data for Good tools and research on climate change and stories from community leaders in sustainability.\nClimate Week\n\nWe continue to do our part to support The Paris Climate Agreement through our ongoing involvement with organizations like The Climate Group. During Climate Week and the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in 2021, we were able to connect thought leaders for a series of side events.\n\nDuring these sessions, we discussed some of the world\u2019s most pressing issues, including communicating climate change, vaccine equity and the role of tech and open data flows in economic prosperity.\n\nCOP26\n\nIn 2021, Meta delivered our biggest activation at COP yet. At the core of our activation was our presence at the UNFCCC pavilion. Now in our sixth year, we ran a Facebook and Instagram Live Studio\u2014a space for policymakers, advocates, businesses and nonprofits to broadcast progress, challenges and reflections on the urgency of climate change to audiences around the world. We had 90+ high-level visitors.\n\nAt COP26, we executed over 40 initiatives. In addition to a massive expansion of the CSC, we supported the UN in mobilizing action against climate change and encouraging conversations around this important topic.\n\nThe UN\u2019s ActNow chatbot was updated with 10 new actions for people to tackle climate change and was made available on Messenger and Instagram.\n\nIn support of this important moment, Meta developed new camera stickers to help people strike up a conversation by visually showing their support for climate action in their Story or group chat on Messenger and Instagram.\n\nOur Meta delegation on the ground included team members from across the company and hosted:\n\n- \u201cBridging the Gap between Climate Information and Action\u201d in the Business Pavilion\n- \u201cHow can ICT companies help enable Europe\u2019s transition to net zero emissions by 2050\u201d in the EU Pavilion\n- A Reuters event on authoritative climate information\n- Roundtables with youth\n\nAhead of COP26, Meta\u2019s Chief Operating Officer, Sheryl Sandberg, signed a Glasgow Is Our Business open letter that urged governments and companies to join in signatories in making meaningful emissions commitments ahead of COP26. It ran as a full-page ad in The New York Times. Meta also joined the Clean Energy Demand Initiative (CEDI), led by the U.S. Department of State and CEBA, which was launched at COP26. CEDI is intended to signal corporate clean energy demand in constrained regions for renewable procurement, such as Asia-Pacific.\n\nAs key climate policy issues continue to be widely debated by governments around the world, our increased and continuously evolving focus on sustainability and climate policy (including but not limited to the activities described in this report) represents our heightened level of engagement in and attention to these important topics. We are looking forward to participating in COP27.\nOur Board of Directors, its committees and our management provide oversight around our ESG and sustainability efforts.\nThe environmental data found within this report is used for three main reasons:\n\n1. **Measure** performance on issues that matter to Meta\n2. **Analyze** performance over time against targets and standards\n3. **Inform** stakeholders about Meta\u2019s sustainability performance\n\nBefore our data is published externally, we undergo a robust review process to ensure that the data is accurate.\n\n1. **Data Collection:**\n   Data is collected from third-party providers and cross-functional teams at Meta.\n\n2. **Internal Quality Assurance and Quality Control:**\n   Data is compared to previous years, and questionable data is flagged for further investigation.\n\n3. **Third-Party Verification:**\n   Data is sent to our third-party verifier with supporting documents such as invoices, renewable energy certificates and carbon offset retirements.\n\n4. **Legal Review:**\n   Once data is verified, it then gets placed in the annual sustainability report. Our legal team reviews the data and narrative context to ensure disclosures are appropriately stated and in line with relevant standards.\nLOOKING AHEAD\n\nWith greater transparency and our vision to guide us, we will do even more to keep bringing the world closer together\u2014and closer to a better reality for all.

Values are rounded and totals are calculated before rounding throughout this report.\n\n2. \"Other data center-related facilities\" includes facilities where Meta used less than 100,000 MWh of electricity in the reporting year, such as warehouses or colocation facilities. Owned, online data centers are always reported by site, even if they were below this threshold.\n\n3. Meta's methodology for calculating greenhouse gas emissions can be found here.\n\n4. Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions are calculated annually based on the WRI/WBSCD Greenhouse Gas Protocol.\n\n5. (a) Scope 1 includes emissions from diesel, natural gas and refrigerants from offices and data centers and from diesel and gasoline in the transportation fleet owned and controlled by Meta.\n   (b) Scope 2 includes emissions from electricity of offices and warehouses leased, controlled and owned by Meta; electricity of data centers owned and leased (IT load) by Meta; natural gas of offices and warehouses leased and serviced by Meta; and purchased heat. Because Meta does not control building operations in leased data center facilities, as of 2017, only emissions associated with its IT load electricity are included in Scope 2 emissions.\n   (c) Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions throughout Meta's value chain. Starting in 2019, Meta included emissions from all relevant categories in Scope 3. Scope 3 emissions for 2015 to 2018 include business travel, employee commute and construction.\n\n6. In the 2021 reporting year, two updates to reporting were applied to 2020 and later inventories:\n   (a) Data from life cycle assessments for our hardware and sold products were used to calculate our Scope 3 emissions.\n   (b) 2020 use of sold product numbers were recalculated to improve accuracy.\n\n7. Prior to 2020, Meta invested in avoided emissions offsets which are not considered carbon removal.\n\n8. In the 2019 reporting year, three updates to reporting were applied to 2017 (baseline year) and later inventories:\n   (a) Vehicles operated by the Transportation team in support of commuting and inter-campus travel were previously counted in Scope 3 \u2013 Employee commute. After re-visiting Meta's operational control of these vehicles, it was determined that they should be accounted for in Scope 1.\n   (b) It was determined that Meta overestimated natural gas emissions by including estimates for offices which do not in fact use natural gas. Recalculations have been applied to the inventory to remove these inaccuracies.\n   (c) Fugitive emissions from refrigerant losses at offices not under Meta operational control were moved from Scope 2 to Scope 3.\n\n9. In the 2020 reporting year, two emission factors updates significantly impacted the GHG inventory:\n   (a) Economic-Environmental Input-Output emission factors were updated and applied to relevant categories. 2019 numbers were updated to reflect these new emission factors.\n   (b) Waste emission factors were updated and applied starting in 2020.\n\n10. In the 2020 reporting year, two updates to the methodology were applied:\n    (a) A new business travel methodology was developed, which was applied to 2019 and updated. Air travel still includes radiative forcing starting from 2017.\n    (b) Employee commuting now includes telecommuting, or work-from-home, emissions starting in 2020, for which the electricity portion is matched with renewable energy.\n\n11. Sustainable Aviation Fuel was purchased in 2021 and associated emissions reductions are reflected in the inventory.\n\n12. This includes the following categories in Scope 3: downstream transportation and distribution, waste generated in operations, upstream leased assets, and end-of-life treatment of sold products. Prior to 2020, emissions from use of sold products and upstream transportation and distribution are included in this category.\n\n13. In owned and leased data center facilities included in Scope 2 and 3 emissions, Meta has matched building operations with renewable energy.\n\n14. Power Use Effectiveness (PUE) and Water Use Effectiveness (WUE) is calculated based on best available data, including internal meters, design estimates and utility bills where applicable.\n\n15. Not included in Meta's 2021 water withdrawal numbers are an additional 827,289 cubic meters of water withdrawn for the construction of Meta data centers.\n## GRI INDEX\n\nMeta's 2021 Sustainability Report has been prepared with reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards.\n\nGRI is an independent international organization that helps businesses, governments, and other organizations understand and communicate sustainability impacts.\n\n### GRI100 -
