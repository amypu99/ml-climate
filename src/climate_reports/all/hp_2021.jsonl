From an ongoing pandemic to our accelerating climate crisis to persistent inequality, these challenges impact all of us. And the way we respond will help shape our future in profound and lasting ways.\n\nCompanies like ours have a critical role to play in helping solve these challenges. That\u2019s why, in 2021, we announced one of the most comprehensive environmental and social impact agendas in our industry\u2014with aggressive goals focused on climate action, human rights, and digital equity. And we have been taking decisive action to meet them.\n\nIn our 21st annual Sustainable Impact report, we share the progress we are making. There are areas where we are leading but also opportunities for us to do more. Our teams are operating with the deep sense of urgency needed to make continuous improvements, while forging partnerships to maximize our impact. While no single company, sector, or even country can solve the enormous global challenges before us, we know we can create a better future by working together.\n\nClimate Action\n\nOf all the challenges facing the world, none is greater than our climate crisis. And so, we set an ambitious climate goal: By 2040, HP\u2019s entire value chain\u2014Scope 1, 2, and 3\u2014will reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, with a 50% reduction in absolute emissions by the end of this decade. We\u2019ve already achieved a 9% absolute reduction since 2019\u2014but we know we must move faster.\n\nWe are partnering with leading conservation and environmental organizations, including the World Wildlife Fund, Conservation International, the Arbor Day Foundation, and the Jane Goodall Institute, to invest in forest restoration and responsible management to counteract deforestation for non-HP paper used in HP printers and print services. Since 2020, all HP brand paper and paper-based packaging for home and office printers and supplies, PCs, and displays have been derived from recycled or certified sources.\n\nFinally, we are broadening our impact by engaging our hundreds of production suppliers and thousands of non-production suppliers in sustainability programs. In early 2022, we expanded our Amplify Impact channel partner program to empower more than 10,000 partners in over 40 countries to advance their own sustainable impact journeys.\n\nHuman Rights\n\nEven as we work to deepen our impact, we are focused on expanding the diversity of our workforce. Building a diverse and inclusive workforce is not only the right thing to do\u2014it also makes good business sense. Diverse teams will always out-innovate and out-perform the market.\n\nWe aim to double the number of Black and African American HP executives by 2025 and reach 50/50 gender equality in leadership by 2030. And while HP is among the top technology companies for women in leadership positions\u2014and nearly 45% of our U.S. hires in 2021 were racial/ethnic minorities\u2014we are exploring ways to improve inclusive representation at all levels.\n\nDigital Equity\n\nWe are also committed to helping break down the barriers that exclude many from participating in the digital economy. Nearly 3 billion people around the world remain offline due to lack of access, affordability, or usability. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the depth of this issue and even exacerbated it, as many schools and businesses began operating remotely.\n\nThat\u2019s why, in 2021, we pledged to accelerate digital equity for 150 million people by the end of the decade\u2014a goal we aim to meet with the collaboration and support of key priority partners, like Girl Rising, NABU, MIT Solve, and Aspen Digital, through the Digital Equity Accelerator program launched in February 2022.\n\nBuilding a stronger HP\n\nFrom our earliest days as a company, HP has been a place where innovation drives extraordinary contributions to humanity. Time and again, our people have had the vision to see entirely new possibilities for the role we can play in the world\u2014and the ingenuity to create technology that inspires ambitious progress.\n\nThat vision and ingenuity is reflected in the progress we are making against our Sustainable Impact goals today. And the impact on the world\u2014and our business\u2014is clear. Simply put, when we innovate with purpose, we create the conditions for both business and society to thrive.\n\nI am inspired by the progress we are making toward becoming the world\u2019s most sustainable and just technology company. And I hope our success spurs other businesses to join us in creating the future we want to see\u2014for our companies, our families, and our communities.\n\nSaludos,\n\nEnrique Lores\nPresident and CEO\nAbout HP\n\nSTRATEGY: BUILDING A STRONGER HP\n\nFinancial\nAchieve significant value growth\n\nSustainable Impact\nBecome the most sustainable and just IT company; focus on Climate Change, Human Rights, and Digital Equity\n\nPortfolio\nBuild a more growth-oriented portfolio, while we continue to lead decisively in our core businesses\n\nTransform/digital\nBecoming a more digital company to streamline operations and enable new customer value propositions\n\nTalent & culture\nA school for leaders built on Agility, Customer Centricity, and Ambition\n\nKEY FACTS\n\nEnrique Lores\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc.\n\nChip Bergh\nChairman of the Board\n\n\u2022 Incorporated in the State of Delaware, United States\n\u2022 Fortune 100 company\n\u2022 Ticker symbol HPQ on the New York Stock Exchange\n\u2022 Corporate headquarters Palo Alto, California, United States\n\u2022 Approximately 51,000 employees globally\n\u2022 HP operates in more than 180 countries worldwide\n\nFISCAL YEAR 2021 HIGHLIGHTS\n\nUS$63.5 BILLION in net revenue\n\nUS$6.4 BILLION of net cash provided by operations\n\nUS$7.2 BILLION returned to stockholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends\n\n28,000+ patents\n\n250,000+ channel partners\n\nUS$1.9 BILLION R&D spend\n\nSee our full financial performance.\nSustainable Impact\n\n6 Sustainable Impact strategy\n10 Recognition\n11 Governance\n11 Stakeholder engagement\n12 ESG materiality\nSustainable Impact strategy\n\nSustainable Impact is at the heart of HP\u2019s business strategy, and we aim to be the world\u2019s most sustainable and just technology company. In 2021, HP announced our most comprehensive and ambitious Sustainable Impact agenda yet. It connects us to the most defining and urgent issues of our time, where we can have the greatest impact.\n\n- **Climate Action**: Drive toward a net zero carbon, fully regenerative economy while engineering the industry\u2019s most sustainable portfolio of products and solutions.\n- **Human Rights**: Create a powerful culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Advance human rights, social justice, and racial and gender equality across our ecosystem, raising the bar for all.\n- **Digital Equity**: Lead in activating and innovating holistic solutions that break down the digital divide that prevents many from accessing the education, jobs, and healthcare needed to thrive. Drive digital inclusion to transform lives and communities.\n\nOur strategy is rooted in science and is informed by HP\u2019s ESG materiality assessment, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and other external frameworks, ongoing engagement with stakeholders, and alignment with our core businesses. It prioritizes efforts where HP\u2019s technology, talent, and platform can do the most good. Above all, our strategy supports a culture shift that fully integrates Sustainable Impact and purpose throughout every aspect of our business and ecosystem.\n\nWe know we must stand for more than the products we sell, which is why Sustainable Impact is both a business imperative and a key differentiator for HP. In 2021, Sustainable Impact helped HP win more than US$3.5 billion in new sales.\n\nBusinesses that can decouple growth from consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, grow through an inclusive culture, and offer solutions to some of our greatest collective challenges will thrive in the long term. Through our focus on Sustainable Impact, we capitalize on what we do best while anticipating and preparing for the next wave of global challenges. We focus on doing the right thing, even when it is difficult, to deliver lasting value through the power of our technology.\n\nIn 2021, we issued HP\u2019s inaugural Sustainability Bond for US$1 billion, to help finance HP projects that contribute to a more sustainable and just future. See the HP Inc. Sustainability Bond progress statement.\n\nThe HP Amplify Impact\u2122 program aligns with our Sustainable Impact strategy by seeking to educate, excite, and empower HP channel partners to create lasting positive change and maximize sustainable business opportunities. During 2021, more than 1,400 HP partners pledged to enroll in the program. In February 2022, we expanded HP Amplify Impact\u2122 to over 40 countries, as we drive toward our objective of enrolling at least 50% of our more than 10,000 partners by 2025. As of April 2022, Amplify Impact partners had completed more than 10,000 sustainability training courses.\nOur mission\nDrive toward a net zero carbon, fully regenerative economy while engineering the industry\u2019s most sustainable portfolio of products and solutions.\n\nHow we\u2019re driving progress\nThe science is clear, and the time to act is now. The 2021 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis, demonstrates that making dramatic progress this decade is critical. As UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres noted, the publication is a \u201ccode red for humanity.\u201d\n\nIn April 2021, we announced our ambitious climate agenda, and set new goals across our value chain to combat climate change, focused on GHG emissions, circularity, and forests. We use science-based targets to drive progress across our agenda, and set new goals across our value chain. During 2021, we used a total of 32,000 tonnes of postconsumer recycled content plastic in HP products\u2014equivalent to 13% of overall plastic use.\n\nTo decarbonize our supply chain, we continue to increase engagement with HP suppliers. We provide support to help them set and meet their own goals, including science-based targets. Participants in our programs avoided 81,000 tonnes of CO\u2082e emissions and saved 31 million kWh (US$3.9 million) in 2021.\n\nSince 2016, HP brand paper has been derived from recycled or certified sources, and since 2020 this has also been the case for paper-based packaging for home and office printers and supplies, PCs, and displays. We are now working to expand beyond our own value chain and counteract deforestation for the fiber of non-HP paper used in HP printing products and services through the HP Sustainable Forests Collaborative. In 2021, we pledged US$80 million to support the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to help address potential impacts on forests from paper used in printing with HP printers by 2030.\n\nTo drive systemic change, we engage in advocacy, advancing policies that support collective progress. To extend our influence, we join with leading companies in emissions-reduction efforts, policy engagement, and goal setting, including through the Clean Energy Buyers Association, RE100, Ceres, CDP Supply Chain, and WWF\u2019s Climate Business Network.\n\nSustainable Impact goals\n\n| Goal | Progress in 2021 | SDGs |\n|------|-----------------|------|\n| Carbon emissions | | |\n| Reduce HP value chain GHG emissions by 50% by 2030 (compared to 2019), and achieve net zero emissions by 2040 | HP\u2019s carbon footprint of 28,459,500 tonnes of CO\u2082e in 2021 was 9% less than in 2019, primarily due to reductions related to product use resulting from increased energy efficiency and changes to the mix of products sold.

Learn more. | 6, 12 |\nOur mission\nCreate a powerful culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Advance human rights, social justice, and racial and gender equality across our ecosystem, raising the bar for all.\n\nHow we\u2019re driving progress\nWe believe in creating a culture of inclusion, equality, and empowerment for our employees. We also believe in creating a platform for human rights that extends beyond HP, where we advocate for universal rights, strive for policies that fight racism, and advance social justice around the globe.\n\nOur human rights policies and practices advance our commitment to upholding human rights and engaging with rights holders. Through our due diligence process, assessments, and audits, we identify issues that are salient to HP and then determine how to address impacts.\n\nHP relies on one of the IT industry\u2019s largest supply chains, and in our supply agreements we require that all workers receive fair treatment, freely chosen employment, and safe working conditions. Through our supply chain responsibility program, we work to improve labor conditions within supplier factories and tackle industry-wide challenges such as forced labor and conflict minerals. We measure improved performance through Supplier Responsibility Scorecards and develop capability-building programs that build essential worker and management skills to empower our suppliers\u2019 workforces.\n\nWe recognize the fundamental importance of privacy, security, and data protection, which are critical pillars of brand trust. We design these principles into our products, services, and operations, and strive to exceed legal minimums across all of our operations.\n\nHP was built on the values of diversity, equity, inclusion, fairness, and equality. Fostering this culture within our business and across our value chain is a business imperative and is essential to serving our customers globally. HP\u2019s Board of Directors is one of the most diverse of any U.S. technology company. We encourage our suppliers and business partners to commit to diversity, equity, and inclusion goals, and to build the pipeline for diverse talent. We innovate to create inclusive technology that affirms human dignity, promotes independence, and unleashes creativity.\n\nWe are committed to embracing a culture that is not only against racism but actively anti-racist, and to using HP\u2019s platform, technology, and resources as a force for positive change. We accelerate this work through the HP Racial Equality and Social Justice Task Force.\n\nSustainable Impact goals\n\n| Goal | Progress in 2021 | SDGs |\n|------|-----------------|------|\n| Empowered workers | HP has achieved this goal, with a 114% increase through 2021, compared to 2015 (therefore, we will not report on this goal moving forward).

Drive digital inclusion to transform lives and communities.\n\nHow we\u2019re driving progress\nNearly half of the world\u2019s population remains unconnected to the internet and locked out of opportunity, including vital access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunity.\n\nIn 2021, HP set a goal to accelerate digital equity for 150 million people by 2030. Through the Digital Equity Accelerator (launched in early 2022), we aspire to help pave the way toward a more equitable world where women and girls, people with disabilities and aging populations, historically excluded and marginalized communities, and educators and healthcare practitioners have access to the technology and resources they need to ensure their voices are heard.\n\nWe plan to achieve this through impactful programs, strategic investments, and partnerships. For example, we are supporting nonprofit NABU\u2019s work to improve childhood literacy in marginalized communities through books in children\u2019s native languages. We continue enhancing the HP Foundation\u2019s free HP LIFE program to make entrepreneurial skill building more accessible to all.\n\nAlong with our strategic partners, our employees contribute their time, resources, and skills to provide important support to local communities.\n\nSustainable Impact goals\n\n| Goal | Progress in 2021 | SDGs |\n|------|-----------------|------|\n| Digital Equity | Accelerated digital equity for 4.3 million people | 4, 5, 8 |\n| Enroll 1.5 million HP LIFE users between 2016 and 2030 | Enrolled 533,000 since 2016 | 4, 5, 8 |\n| Learning outcomes | Enable better learning outcomes for 100 million people by 2025, since the beginning of 2015 | 4, 5, 8 |\n| Community | Contribute US$100 million in HP Foundation and employee community giving by 2025 (cumulative since the beginning of 2016) | 11, 17 |\n| Contribute 1.5 million employee volunteering hours by 2025 (cumulative since the beginning of 2016) | Reached 692,000 employee volunteering hours | 11, 17 |\n\nHP\u2019S RESPONSE TO COVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has challenged businesses large and small, local and national governments, families, and individuals in ways few of us could have imagined.\n\nThe wellbeing of our employees and their families has remained a top priority. With many of our employees working from home, we have initiatives that promote physical and mental health and work/life balance, including through HP Spirit and Well Beyond. At our sites, we\u2019ve put in place global policies and protocols based on guidance from healthcare experts and public health leaders, and regularly review and update them to reflect the best, most current information available.\n\nAs conditions allow, we are moving into our next phase of return to office planning and are beginning to fully reopen HP offices on a site-by-site basis in line with local health and safety regulations.\n\nIn 2021, HP and the HP Foundation continued to support impacted communities around the world, contributing financial resources and donating PCs, printers, and displays. In support of our goal to accelerate digital equity, we provided technology and other support to underserved students and families through Parents Supporting Parents.

Appropriate stakeholders are identified based on factors such as expertise, willingness to collaborate, reputation, location, sphere of influence, and ability to scale and accelerate progress.\n\nExamples of stakeholder engagement in 2021:\n\n- **Decarbonization:** We engage in initiatives focused on increasing support for clean energy and combating climate change, including RE100, CDP Supply Chain, WWF\u2019s Climate Business Network, Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C, and Ceres. See Footprint, Supply chain responsibility: Environmental impact. Our facilities, and Circular and net zero carbon economy: Energy efficiency.\n\n- **Circular economy:** We are working with partner organizations and suppliers to gain the most value from materials and to keep them in use, contributing to a circular economy. For example, with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation Circular Economy 100, we are driving progress toward a more circular materials- and energy-efficient future. We engage through the HP Sustainable Forests Collaborative to protect, restore, and improve responsible management of forests, and work with WWF\u2019s Forests Forward, the Forest Stewardship Council, and our suppliers to ensure the fiber we use is responsibly sourced. See Renewable materials.\n\n- **Human rights\u2014supply chain:** We engage in multi-stakeholder collaborations, including the Responsible Business Alliance, Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment, and Global Business Initiative for Business and Human Rights, to drive progress and elevate supply\nESG materiality\n\nWe periodically conduct ESG materiality assessments to review relevant ESG topics, reconfirm our long-standing areas of focus, and clarify and shape our Sustainable Impact strategy, investments, and disclosures. This process enables us to focus our efforts on the areas where we can have the greatest impact, determine gaps in our approach, and identify trends and leadership opportunities for our business. ESG materiality assessment informs our goals-setting process, and we have set aggressive goals related to several of our most ESG-material topics to manage performance and drive long-term progress.\n\nApproach\n\nIn 2021, we engaged the sustainability consultancy Environmental Resources Management (ERM) to conduct an ESG materiality assessment. Through interviews, surveys, and other sources, we collected internal and external input on a wide range of topics to determine their relative importance to HP and to external stakeholders, and to understand the degree of impact we can have on each topic area. Prior to this, our most recent ESG materiality assessment was conducted in 2019.\n\nWe collected input from a broad range of stakeholders\u2014including HP employees and executives, customers, suppliers, investors, NGOs, and peer companies\u2014to reflect a diverse range of views. To better understand HP\u2019s impacts and potential impacts related to each topic, the process incorporated the Future Fit Benchmark Technology Sector Impact Areas and Sustainable Development Goals Sector Survey. The assessment also took into account leading reporting frameworks such as the GRI Standards for sustainability reporting and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Technology & Communications Hardware Standard.\n\nBased on these inputs, we evaluated and ranked topics, then validated the results in a workshop with HP executives and experts. Our new 2021 ESG materiality matrix summarizes the outcome of this process.\n\nKey findings\n\nBy integrating a broad range of inputs and fresh insights, our new ESG materiality assessment reflects the rapidly evolving landscape of ESG topics. In some cases, we combined topics or refined names or definitions to better reflect topic scope or content, and digital divide emerged as a new topic during the assessment.\n\nIn addition to determining HP\u2019s ESG material topics, several key themes emerged:\n\n- It is critical to take aggressive near-term action on decarbonization, including by engaging suppliers to reduce climate impact throughout HP\u2019s value chain.\n- Stakeholders increasingly expect transparent reporting on carbon footprint and related impacts, risks, and opportunities, as well as robust social impact data and metrics across the value chain.\n\nThroughout this report, we use the definition of \u201cmateriality\u201d from the GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) Standards, which is different from the term as it has been defined by or construed in accordance with the securities laws or any other laws of the United States or any other jurisdiction, or as used in the context of our financial statements and financial reporting, or our reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Topics identified as ESG material for the purpose of this report should not be construed as being material for SEC or other financial reporting purposes.\n\u2022 HP has the potential to expand social and environmental value creation beyond the value chain, including by advocating for policy related to Climate Action, Human Rights, and Digital Equity.\n\n\u2022 HP has an opportunity to lead our industry toward a more circular economy through closed-loop manufacturing, service-based 3D printing, and robust reuse, repair, and recycling programs.\n\n\u2022 Human rights remain a key focus for customers, policymakers, and investors. Companies are expected to address related risks and opportunities across their value chains, including through cross-industry collaboration with suppliers and business partners.\n\n\u2022 The digital divide is growing, and HP has an opportunity to collaborate with civil society, governments, and others to accelerate digital equity, particularly in the areas of work, education, and healthcare.\n\nESG materiality matrix\n\nOur 2021 ESG materiality matrix maps topics by relative importance to HP\u2019s business success and to external stakeholders, while also summarizing the company\u2019s impact in each area. Topics above the diagonal are considered ESG material for the purpose of this report. Items below the ESG materiality threshold are not covered in as much detail, but remain important to HP.\n\nOur ESG material topics list includes definitions, corresponding GRI Standards Topics, and boundaries for each topic.\nFootprint\n\n15 Carbon and climate impact\n16 Water\n17 Data\nThe manufacturing, delivery, and use of HP products and solutions requires a substantial amount of natural resources and energy use. Our carbon and water footprints cover our entire global value chain, from suppliers to our operations and millions of customers worldwide. We were the first global IT company to publish a full carbon footprint, and one of the first to disclose a complete water footprint. We continue to measure and manage our environmental footprint across the value chain, always pursuing areas for improvement.\n\nTransforming HP to help drive a more efficient, circular, and net zero carbon economy is central to our Sustainable Impact strategy.\n\nHP has achieved triple \u201cA\u201d scores for transparency and action on climate, forests, and water for several consecutive years, and has also been recognized as a CDP Supplier Engagement Leader. See Recognition.\n\nCarbon and climate impact\n\nWe strive to reduce the climate impact of our supply chain, operations, and products and solutions. HP\u2019s carbon footprint in 2021 equaled 28,459,500 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO\u2082e), 3% less than in 2020. An 11% decrease in GHG emissions associated with product use more than offset a 3% increase related to product manufacturing and a 13% rise related to product transportation. This reduction was driven in part by the increased energy efficiency of our products as well as the continued impact of COVID-19 on sales of different product lines, particularly a shift toward Chromebooks, other notebooks, and inkjet printers, which tend to be lighter and are more energy efficient than desktop PCs and LaserJet printers.\n\nWhile GHG emissions from our operations only represent 1% of our footprint, we work to demonstrate leadership in emissions management, reduction, and disclosure. Our global operations produced 159,500 tonnes of Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO\u2082e emissions during 2021, a 7% decrease compared to 2020.\n\n2030 AND 2040 GOALS\n\nReduce HP value chain GHG emissions by 50% by 2030 (compared to 2019), and achieve net zero emissions by 2040.\n\nPROGRESS IN 2021\n\nHP\u2019s carbon footprint of 28,459,500 tonnes of CO\u2082e in 2021 was 9% less than in 2019, primarily due to reductions related to product use resulting from increased energy efficiency and changes to the mix of products sold.\n\nSee additional GHG emissions-reduction goals.\n\nMETHODOLOGICAL UPDATES\n\nThis report reflects several methodological updates to improve the accuracy of our carbon footprint calculations and to align with our 2030 GHG emissions-reduction goal. These include:\n\n- Personal systems: Using a new life cycle assessment (LCA) tool, which allows for updated and refined modeling based on HP-specific parameters, to calculate GHG emissions associated with personal systems.\n- Paper: Using the tonnage of HP brand paper sold during the year to calculate associated GHG emissions, and not including GHG emissions associated with non-HP brand paper used in HP printers. These emissions are now included in Scope 3 category 1 instead of category 11. This aligns with guidance regarding indirect use-phase GHG emissions associated with product use from the GHG Protocol and the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).\n- Nonproduction suppliers: Adding GHG emissions associated with nonproduction suppliers, based on data provided by those suppliers. Learn more.\n\nBased on our updated methodology, we have restated GHG emissions data for 2019 and 2020, for comparability. These methodological updates impact Scope 3 categories 1, 4, 9, 11, and 12.\nHP carbon footprint, 2021\n\n28,459,500 tonnes CO\u2082e\n\nSegments do not add up to total due to rounding.\n** Includes HP brand printer and copier paper sold, which represented 0.5% of our carbon footprint.\n*** This value is zero due to rounding.\n\nSee also:\n- Description of our methodology in the HP Carbon accounting manual.\n- Full list of our GHG emissions-reduction goals and progress.\n- Full carbon footprint data for 2019\u20132021.\n- GHG emissions-reduction initiatives across our business: Supply chain, Our facilities, and Products and solutions.\n- Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures index (includes links to detailed disclosures throughout this report, the HP 2022 Proxy Statement, and our CDP submissions).\n- HP CDP Climate Change response.\n- HP CDP Water Security response.\n\nWater\n\nMany parts of the world grapple with the availability and quality of water, and HP calculates, discloses, and works to reduce water use across our global value chain.\n\nIn 2021, our water footprint equalled 146,756,000 cubic meters, 8% less than in 2020. This resulted primarily from a reduction in indirect water consumption from electricity generation associated with HP product use, which more than offset water consumption in HP\u2019s supply chain.\n\nAlthough water withdrawal in operations only represents 2% of our footprint, we have direct control over those activities. We work to minimize water withdrawal within our facilities and demonstrate strong practice for others in the industry and beyond.\n\nSee also:\n- Description of our methodology in the HP Water accounting manual.\n- Full water footprint data for 2019\u20132021.\n- Water-use reduction initiatives across our business: Supply chain, Our facilities, and Products and solutions.\n- HP CDP Water Security response.\n## Data\n\n### Carbon footprint (Scopes 1-3)*\n\n|                      | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  |\n|----------------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| **GHG emissions from operations** [tonnes CO\u2082e] |       |       |       |\n| Americas             | 215,800 | 171,000 | 159,500 |\n| Europe, Middle East, and Africa | 57,900 | 48,100 | 47,300 |\n| Asia Pacific and Japan | 108,300 | 81,900 | 73,200 |\n| **GHG emissions intensity** [tonnes CO\u2082e/US$ million of net revenue] | 3.7 | 3.0 | 2.5 |\n| **GHG emissions by scope** [tonnes CO\u2082e] |       |       |       |\n| **Scope 1** |       |       |       |\n| Scope 1 emissions, by region |       |       |       |\n| Americas | 61,900 | 50,600 | 48,700 |\n| Europe, Middle East, and Africa | 13,400 | 10,600 | 9,200 |\n| Asia Pacific and Japan | 1,400 | 600 | 700 |\n| Scope 1 emissions, by type |       |       |       |\n| Natural gas | 23,800 | 21,400 | 22,700 |\n| Americas | 20,500 | 19,300 | 20,700 |\n| Europe, Middle East, and Africa | 2,200 | 1,800 | 1,700 |\n| Asia Pacific and Japan | 1,100 | 300 | 300 |\n| Diesel/gas/oil/LPG | 200 | 300 | 300 |\n| Americas | 200 | 200 | 100 |\n| Europe, Middle East, and Africa | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Asia Pacific and Japan | 0 | 100 | 200 |\n| Transportation fleet | 23,300 | 24,000 | 20,100 |\n| Americas | 22,800 | 17,000 | 14,300 |\n| Europe, Middle East, and Africa | 10,200 | 6,800 | 5,600 |\n| Asia Pacific and Japan | 300 | 200 | 200 |\n| **Scope 2 (market-based method)** |       |       |       |\n| Scope 2 emissions, by region |       |       |       |\n| Americas | 153,900 | 120,400 | 110,800 |\n| Europe, Middle East, and Africa | 44,500 | 37,500 | 38,100 |\n| Asia Pacific and Japan | 106,900 | 81,300 | 72,500 |\n| Scope 2 emissions, by type |       |       |       |\n| Purchased electricity for operations | 152,900 | 119,600 | 110,100 |\n| Americas | 2,500 | 1,600 | 200 |\n| Europe, Middle East, and Africa | 44,500 | 37,500 | 38,100 |\n| Asia Pacific and Japan | 105,900 | 80,500 | 71,800 |\n| District cooling and heating (purchased) for operations | 1,000 | 800 | 700 |\n| Americas | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Europe, Middle East, and Africa | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Asia Pacific and Japan | 1,000 | 800 | 700 |\n\n*GHG emissions from operations include Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.\n\n**GHG emissions intensity** is calculated as GHG emissions from operations divided by net revenue.\n\n### Footprint\n\n- Refrigerants (hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs))\n  -

Product use (category 15), and Product end of service (category 12) includes CO\u2082, CH\u2084, N\u2082O, HFCs, and represented 0.35% of our Scope 3 emissions in 2021. Biogenic emissions are present and captured in the paper emissions factor of HP paper manufactured (category 1). Capital goods (category 2) includes CO\u2082, CH\u2084, N\u2082O, and HFCs, and represented 0.35% of our Scope 3 emissions in 2021. Upstream energy production (category 3), Waste generated in operations (category 5), and Business travel (category 6) includes CO\u2082, CH\u2084, and N\u2082O, and represented 0.35% of our Scope 3 emissions in 2021. Employee commuting (category 7), Buildings leased to others (category 13), and Investments (category 15) includes CO\u2082, and represented 0.35% of our Scope 3 emissions in 2021. Upstream leased assets (category 8), processing of sold products (category 10), and franchises (category 14) are not applicable to HP.\n\n- **HP does not estimate or extrapolate diesel use for nonreporting sites.**\n\n- **CO\u2082 emissions associated with CH\u2084 and N\u2082O account for less than 1% of total CO\u2082 emissions in this category.**\n\n- **HP collects all refrigerant consumption data from local facility maintenance teams company-wide, directly accounting for facilities\u2019 refrigerant leakage and use and avoiding the need for extrapolation. We use various tools and sources for global warming potential and ozone depletion values, including the Greenhouse Gas Protocol\u2019s GHG Emissions from Refrigeration and Air Conditioning tool (IPCC Second Assessment Report [1995]).**\n\n- **The total for 2019 of refrigerants, PFCs, CO\u2082, CH\u2084, and N\u2082O varies by less than 1% from Scope 1 Emissions, by region, due to rounding.**\n\n- **Data in this section uses the market-based method. Due to the availability and feasibility of acquiring the data, the company only obtained utility-specific emission factors for its sites in Glasgow, Scotland; Le\u00f3n and Madrid, Spain; and Palo Alto and San Bernardino, California; Boise, Idaho; Indianapolis, Indiana; Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Socorro, Texas, in the United States.**\n\n- **See Methodological Updates on page 15.**\n\n- **Scope 2 GHG emissions used to calculate this category were determined using the location-based method.**\n\n- **This product transportation data is based on LCA-based estimates.

All members are independent directors, excluding Enrique Lores, president and chief executive officer, HP Inc.\n\nBoard of Directors Audit Committee\n\nProvides non-executive input and guidance to the Ethics and Compliance Office.\n\nEthics and Compliance Committee\n\nComposed of HP executives and provides oversight and guidance on the design and implementation of our ethics and compliance program.\n\nEthics and Compliance Office\n\nManages ethical issues across our global operations. Specific responsibilities include oversight of Integrity at HP, coordination of the company\u2019s Compliance Assessment Program, management of anti-corruption and privacy, and the design and management of processes that prevent, mitigate, and remediate all related business impacts.\n\nSee governance information online, including the board\u2019s composition, committees, and charters, as well as our company bylaws and Corporate Governance Guidelines.\n\nReporting concerns\n\nWe make it easy for our employees and third parties to ask questions and report ethics concerns about the broad range of ESG issues. Reporting avenues are available to 100% of employees and include an online form, global in-country 24-hour toll-free phone lines with translation, text messaging (in the United States), mail, and in person. We offer anonymous reporting options where allowed by law. At any time, employees can also reach out to their manager or another leader under HP\u2019s Open Door Policy, seek advice from internal ethics and compliance experts, or consult Internal Audit, Human Resources, local Integrity at HP teams, or Integrity at HP liaisons. HP does not tolerate retaliation against anyone who raises a concern or question.\nItems reported to global Integrity at HP team or other compliance functions in 2021\n\n| Percentage of Total | 2021 |\n|---------------------|------|\n| Human resources     | 30%  |\n| Anti-corruption*    | 5%   |\n| Misuse of assets    | 17%  |\n| Fraud               | 15%  |\n| Theft               | 5%   |\n| Brand protection/channel | 7% |\n| Conflicts of interest | 8% |\n| Inaccurate records  | 11%  |\n| Competition         | 2%   |\n| Total               | 100% |\n\n* Includes allegations of commercial bribery, kickbacks, and Global Business Amenities Policy violations, as well as alleged corruption related to foreign public officials.\n\nInvestigating concerns\n\nSuspected violations of Integrity at HP damage trust in our company. We take all alleged violations seriously, ensure responses are timely, and take disciplinary or remedial actions when appropriate, including coaching, written warnings, and, in serious cases, termination. Serious violations may impact an employee\u2019s Total Rewards package (subject to local labor laws and where legally permissible).\n\nAnti-corruption\n\nCorruption disrupts fair competition, and is at odds with HP values. We do not tolerate corrupt behavior of any kind, including bribery and kickbacks.\n\nOur Anti-Corruption Policy and compliance program require our employees, partners, and suppliers to follow all applicable national laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act. Although HP is not certified to an anti-corruption management system, all of our operational sites and subsidiaries are required to follow HP\u2019s Anti-Corruption Policy and are subject to HP\u2019s compliance program and procedures (or a comparable subsidiary-level policy and compliance program).\n\nRisk assessment and audits\n\nHP conducts regular internal assessments of corruption-related risks across 100% of our global operations, including detailed reviews of the company\u2019s global policies and processes applicable to all business units and global functions worldwide. We also use internal data and Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) to identify high-risk regions and assess risks related to our business. The public sector data analytics tools and processes we adopted in 2019 have enhanced HP\u2019s ability to monitor and mitigate potential risk from its public sector business. These tools are subject to regular review and improvement to enhance the quantity and quality of available data.\n\nWe also periodically retain outside experts to assess our anti-corruption policies and programs. We benchmark our approach against peer companies to identify best practices in areas including operational procedures, employee education, and supplier and partner training and monitoring.\n\nComplementing these assessments, HP conducts regular audits focused on potential corruption risks in our operations. These audits include end-to-end review and testing of compliance policies and processes.\n\nPotential corruption risks are reviewed using HP transactional data and third-party corruption assessments. The Anti-Corruption team may then take various actions to appropriately minimize or eliminate identified risk. This can include termination of partner contracts or special handling measures.\n\nThird-party management and due diligence\n\nHP performs ongoing risk-based due diligence of third parties that support our business, including channel partners, sales intermediaries, suppliers, and lobbyists. We communicate HP\u2019s anti-corruption standards and requirements to 100% of these third parties through contractual terms and conditions as well as our Partner Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct. HP requires all partners and suppliers, respectively, to comply with our Partner and Supplier Codes of Conduct.\n\nHP has implemented and maintains a robust risk-based legal and regulatory due diligence program to detect, mitigate, and prevent third-party anti-corruption compliance risks and violations.\n\nWe determine risk levels based primarily on completion of our due diligence questionnaire by the third party (every three years, for existing partners and suppliers) as well as the country-level CPI. Based on these items, HP decides whether to conduct an additional due diligence investigation. If we determine that the risk cannot be mitigated, we apply consequences to the relevant third party by removing access to specific benefits and/or terminating any contract with HP.\n\nHP requires third parties to complete due diligence on a predetermined basis. In general, all channel partners must complete this process before beginning a contractual relationship with HP and then undergo a renewal process at least\nHuman rights\n\nHP\u2019s stance on human rights is clear and uncompromising. We embrace our responsibility to respect human rights, continually monitoring emerging human rights expectations and best practices.\n\nApproach\n\nWe are committed to ensuring that everyone within HP and throughout our value chain is treated with dignity and respect. We insist that all workers are treated fairly and have safe working conditions and freely chosen employment.\n\nPolicies and commitments\n\nIn 2021, HP strengthened its Human Rights Policy (available in 24 languages), which advances our commitment to upholding human rights, engaging with rights holders, and embedding our approach throughout our business and value chain. This policy and our Sustainable Impact strategy recognize that social and environmental issues are interconnected, and many have human rights dimensions. We work for holistic change across a broad range of areas.\n\nWe have developed specialized policies and practices to support our human rights commitments, including those addressing supply chain responsibility, responsible minerals sourcing, human resources, diversity, equity, and inclusion, racial equality, privacy and data protection, accessibility, and environmental sustainability.\n\nOur policy commitment includes respecting human rights in accordance with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. We commit to respect internationally recognized human rights as expressed in the:\n\n- International Bill of Human Rights, meaning the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.\n- International Labour Organization\u2019s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.\n\nIn addition, we continue to support the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact. We also commit to comply with local laws and regulations. Where laws are silent as to protected human rights or are less stringent than our approach, we work diligently to develop solutions to advance our commitment, supporting progress wherever possible.\n\nTechnology and human rights\n\nTechnology has the potential to improve the lives of people around the world. However, we recognize that technology can also be used for unintended purposes or in contexts that create adverse human rights impacts.\n\nWe sell PCs and printers to consumers, businesses, and governments worldwide. These products and technologies are widely available in the market from HP and its competitors. To avoid the misuse of our products and solutions, HP is committed to complying with all relevant sanctions, restrictions, and embargoes imposed by national governments or international organizations across our worldwide operations. In all of our business, we prioritize the highest standards of corporate ethics, and we operate in strict accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.\n\nWhen we identify potential human rights risks within our value chain, we conduct human rights due diligence. When others make allegations linking our business to adverse human rights impacts, we investigate the claims in line with our Human Rights Policy. Wherever we can exert influence to mitigate alleged human rights impacts we do so.\n\nGovernance and accountability\n\nOur President and Chief Executive Officer, who is also a member of our Board of Directors, approved our Human Rights Policy, and our Head of Corporate Affairs holds operational accountability for this policy. The Head of Corporate Affairs, Chief Supply Chain Officer, and Chief People Officer are responsible for...\nhuman rights across HP. The company operates an internal Human Rights Council to further promote the integration of our Human Rights Policy. The Council is chaired by an HP executive who has performance incentives to manage the company\u2019s human rights program. The Council is informed by independent external human rights experts. Board-level oversight is provided by the Nominating, Governance and Social Responsibility Committee of HP\u2019s Board of Directors.\n\nTraining\nIn 2021, 99.2% of employees (including senior executives) completed annual Integrity at HP training, which typically includes some human rights-related content. For Human Rights Day on December 10, 2021, we released an employee awareness video explaining human rights and why they matter, as well as highlighting our legacy of respecting human rights at HP.\n\nDisclosures\nIn addition to our Sustainable Impact Report, we also publish the HP Modern Slavery Transparency Statement.\n\nHuman rights due diligence\nBuilding on our knowledge and capabilities, and in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, we are responding to new challenges, assessing risks, and monitoring our performance. Progress includes being transparent about issues we face and discover, and how we are resolving them. We practice human rights due diligence across our business on our salient human rights issues (starting with our own operations) including identification, investigation, prevention, and mitigation of adverse human rights impacts that the business may cause or contribute to through its own activities, or which may be directly linked to our operations, products, or services by our business relationships.\n\nRisk assessment\nOur human rights due diligence process is structured to identify and address human rights risks and impacts across our value chain. Given HP\u2019s large global footprint, prioritization is critical to the program\u2019s effectiveness. We prioritize risks based on salience\u2014the severity and likelihood of adverse impacts on stakeholders we might affect directly or indirectly. We strive to continually improve our program by expanding responsible business conduct, ceasing, preventing, or remediating the impact, and reporting on implementation and results.\n\nIn late 2021, we engaged external human rights experts to assist us in governance assessment and a global human rights risk assessment. The process, which is ongoing, will include reviewing stakeholder concerns across our sector, engaging with potentially affected stakeholders and civil society organizations, and reviewing policies and procedures with reference both to proposed human rights laws and to how our voluntary commitments align to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThe assessments will help us identify our priority human rights risks across our value chain, assess the ability of our policies and procedures to encompass new expectations and requirements, and inform creation of a tailored action plan to help drive further enhancements to our human rights efforts. We plan to share highlights when our evaluation is finalized.\n\nAudits and assessments\nWe use audits and specialized assessments to help assess performance and identify corrective action where required. Use of audits and assessments is prioritized by level of risk. As a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), we base our Supplier Code of Conduct on the RBA Code of Conduct and use the RBA Validated Audit Process and Audit Protocol. We only use certified auditors, and most audits are conducted by third-party auditing firms.\n\nThe scope of on-site audits and specialized assessments depends on the nature of the work performed by the entity and the nature of the prioritized risks. For most of our production suppliers, we conduct full audits against our Supplier Code of Conduct. For nonproduction suppliers, we may conduct audits only covering those portions of the Supplier Code of Conduct that are relevant to their operations.\n\nGrievance mechanisms\nWe offer multiple channels for our employees and third parties, such as workers in our supply chain, to ask questions and report concerns. We do not tolerate retaliation against those who engage in our grievance processes, and we expect the same from our business partners.\n\nWe collaborate to provide access to effective remedy and monitor reported grievances, regardless of source, through to resolution. We also track and assess allegations of potentially adverse human rights impacts that are brought to our attention outside of the grievance process, and take appropriate actions when allegations are confirmed.

This is a critical pillar of brand trust and increasingly a source of competitive advantage in an era of accelerated innovation, global data proliferation, and fast-changing regulatory frameworks. We build privacy, security, and data protection into the design and development of our products, services, and operations. We strive to provide protections that exceed legal minimums across all our operations, and to deploy consistent, rigorous policies and procedures to give our customers, employees, and partners confidence when sharing information with us and using our products and services.\n\nSee our Privacy website for additional information.\n\nApproach\n\nOur rigorous policies and standards are designed to keep personal data safe and respect privacy:\n\n- Our Privacy Statement describes our privacy practices, as well as the choices users can make and the rights they can exercise related to personal data.\n- We maintain internal policies and standards that align with international data protection and privacy principles worldwide. These policies and standards cover the data life cycle and continually strengthen privacy protections to meet the requirements of changing regulations and evolving circumstances. This includes implementing enhanced internal policies and procedures to address our obligations as a data controller and processor, and to ensure that data subject rights are respected.\n- Our privacy accountability and compliance framework outlines our procedures and organizational controls for assessing and managing risks associated with collecting and handling personal data. It\u2019s based on requirements for accountability as defined by global laws and regulations.\n- Our Data Protection Officer, together with HP\u2019s Privacy and Data Protection team, provides oversight and leadership for compliance, working closely with appointed privacy leads in business teams throughout the company.\n- HP\u2019s Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Compliance Office oversees compliance with HIPAA laws where they are triggered by our commercial services engagements.\n\nIn 2021, all HP employees were required to complete our privacy principles training, and 97% of employees completed the course during the six-week campaign. The training is intended to reinforce HP\u2019s privacy and data protection principles, and to ensure that employees understand how to respect and protect employee and customer privacy. During the year, we also offered access to online courses that provide additional topic- and role-based training opportunities.\n\nThroughout the year, several regulatory changes influenced adjustments to our privacy program, including requirements from the United States and China that increased emphasis on consent and individual data rights. In addition, as we continue our digital transformation journey, personal data governance is more critical to our business. To address these business and regulatory changes, we have launched a plan to further enhance our privacy capabilities in data environments and user experiences. We are also shifting our third-party privacy risk assessments approach from a questionnaire-based process to one based on evidence, through recognized and independent privacy certifications. To simplify the demonstration of privacy capabilities across global supply chains, we are embarking on this shift together with other companies.\n\nPrivacy complaints, breaches, and requests\n\nHP complies with worldwide privacy and data breach notification laws and regulations, tracks the number of substantiated complaints from third parties and personal data requests made to HP by individuals, and maintains an internal incident-reporting process. Once a potential breach of personal data is identified, a core team\u2014including representatives from privacy, cybersecurity, legal, and communications\u2014manages and communicates about the breach, including any commercial or legal obligations to notify customers.\n\nIn 2021, we saw a notable increase of data rights requests to HP. We believe this was caused by greater user awareness and empowerment in exercising rights as provided by law. See data.\n\nGlobal standards and international data transfers\n\nThe secure movement of data is essential to our business. As legislation continues to evolve, our privacy and government relations teams work with governments worldwide to develop robust and globally interoperable privacy and data transfer frameworks. Learn more.\n\nHP relies on lawful mechanisms for data transfer to drive accountability across the organization. HP is recognized by EU data protection authorities for our Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs), reflecting our high standards of data protection policies and procedures and enabling global data transfer within our company.\n\nHP complies with the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation\u2019s Cross-Border Privacy Rules. Due to recent court rulings in Europe on the Schrems II case that invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield data transfer mechanism, HP no\nSubstantiated complaints regarding breaches of customer privacy and losses of customer data at HP\n\n| Year | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|------|------|------|------|\n| Substantiated complaints from outside parties (including customers) | 14 | 22 | 37 |\n| Substantiated complaints from regulatory or other official bodies | 1 | 2 | 4 |\n| Data breaches (total) | 28 | 33 | |\n| Data breaches (reportable) | 1 | 4 | |\n| Data requests made to HP | 137 | 156 | |\n| Right to access/know (completed) | 2,195 | 4,400 | |\n| Right to access/know (rejected) | 36 | 49 | |\n| Right to erasure/be forgotten (completed) | 961 | 2,596 | |\n| Right to erasure/be forgotten (rejected) | | | |\n\n*Breaches of customer privacy cover any noncompliance with existing legal regulations and voluntary standards regarding the protection of customer privacy related to data for which HP is the data controller. Substantiated complaints are written statements addressed to the organization by regulatory or similar official bodies that identify breaches of customer privacy, or complaints lodged with the organization that have been recognized as legitimate by the organization.\n\n**Reportable data breaches are those that are required to be reported by law. 2020 was the first year that HP disclosed this data in this report. The majority of the total data breaches were caused by human error or technical glitches and not a failure of our product or services security infrastructure.\n\n2020 was the first year that HP disclosed this data in this report. The median number of days taken to respond to right to access/know requests and right to erasure/be forgotten requests in 2021 was 15.\n\nCybersecurity\n\nCybersecurity is a key pillar of our digital transformation and a high priority for HP, our customers, and other stakeholders. Our holistic approach integrates cybersecurity across the value chain, including in the design, development, and delivery of our products, services, solutions, and operations. We build resiliency into our business model, and work to avoid cybersecurity incidents. When issues do occur, we rapidly identify and resolve them, protecting individuals, our customers, and HP.\n\nPolicies and standards\n\nWe maintain consistent, rigorous cybersecurity policies, standards, and procedures to give our customers, employees, and partners confidence when sharing data with us. The HP Cyber Security Policy Suite provides a framework for the company, informs overarching governance in this area, and underpins cybersecurity company-wide.\n\nWe educate employees about our policies and standards, as well as regulatory requirements, emerging threats, and new practices. We regularly update our policies and standards to reflect new processing activities and regulatory developments.\n\nCybersecurity Organization\n\nOur Cybersecurity Organization, led by HP\u2019s Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), maintains governance, processes, resources, and IT partner and vendor relationships to help identify and prevent unwanted access, security threats, and cyberattacks. It also provides extensive incident response, vulnerability management, and business continuity and disaster recovery programs across HP, to support best-in-class end-to-end security throughout HP\u2019s supply chain.\n\nWorldwide Security and Analytics Practice\n\nOur Worldwide Security and Analytics Practice, led by HP\u2019s Chief Security Advisor, advances security within HP\u2019s business units and products and collaborates with customers and clients. The Security Practice leads efforts to educate our employees and clients about cybersecurity, conducts related risk assessments, establishes baselines, and creates cybersecurity roadmaps for HP and our clients.\n\nThe Security Practice also drives alignment with regulatory and compliance requirements such as HIPAA, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, and various privacy laws. The Security Practice coordinates the HP Security Advisory Board, which includes our Chief Security Advisor as well as industry-recognized external experts, and hosts HP\u2019s Bug Bounty program.\n\nCertification, audits, and assessments\n\nThe Cybersecurity Organization regularly conducts audits of HP cybersecurity systems and performs annual risk assessments of related HP systems and processes, including our information security management system (ISMS). It also drives third-party risk assessments into our procurement process.\n\nOur risk-based ISMS maintained ISO 27001 certification during 2021, assuring that HP meets the international standard for information systems security. We regularly commission internal and external audits by independent assessors, and conduct an annual NIST framework assessment.\n\nThe Worldwide Security and Analytics Practice audits HP\u2019s customer-facing cybersecurity systems and conducts annual risk assessments of related systems and processes to help establish baselines and drive improvement in cybersecurity postures.\n\nIncident response\n\nWe have formal processes to address cybersecurity events associated with our worldwide client base that include customer support and mechanisms to escalate issues as\nneeded. Our online Security Bulletins support HP\u2019s commitment to provide prompt notification and remediation of any vulnerabilities related to our products, services, and solutions. When incidents occur, the Cybersecurity Organization, the Worldwide Security and Analytics Practice, and our Chief Technologist for Security respond swiftly, reporting activities to relevant leadership. When a potential cybersecurity event is identified, a core team is responsible for management of the event, including any commercial or legal obligations to notify our customers.\n\nDuring 2021, HP did not experience any cybersecurity events that required disclosure to the US Securities and Exchange Commission or other regulatory authorities. See the Privacy section for analysis of data breaches associated with such cybersecurity events.\n\nExternal engagement\nHP is committed to advancing progress in cybersecurity across the industry and beyond by participating in relevant organizations and advisory boards, including IEEE, ISA, ISACA, (ISO), ISSA, NIST, SANS, ACFE, and IIA. We host the HP Client Advisory Council, which drives awareness and education, and provides a forum for knowledge-sharing with clients worldwide.\n\nProduct security and privacy\nHP continues to conduct and participate in cybersecurity research to identify and understand cybersecurity trends, risks, and threats, and to drive cybersecurity innovation in our products, devices, services, and solutions. We follow security-by-design and privacy-by-design principles and build security and resilience into our products and services throughout the product life cycle, from design, component sourcing, and manufacturing to transportation, service, and take-back. Learn more.\n\nPublic policy\nGeopolitical, socio-economic, environmental, and technological trends drive governments everywhere to consider policy actions that address trust, resilience, equity, and climate change. HP public policy engagements are aligned with our business interests and our core values to drive sustainable impact in climate action, human rights, and digital equity. We seek opportunities to promote sustainable practices and new technologies, such as additive manufacturing (3D printing), which contributed to an effective response to COVID-19.\n\nPolicy priorities\nOur global Government Affairs and Public Policy team leads our engagement with policymakers, regulators, trade associations, and peer companies to advance public policies aligned with HP\u2019s interests and values. Our priorities include:\n\n- Ensuring market access and fostering supply chain resilience.\n- Creating digital trust through robust and interoperable data-governance efforts that preserve open data flows.\n- Advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion and driving digital equity.\n- Promoting sound sustainability policies that address climate change, enable an achievable circular economy, and support adoption of renewable and efficient energy use.\n- Preserving competitive tax structures and creating economic investment incentives.\n- Enhancing innovation through emerging technologies such as additive manufacturing and microfluidics.\n- Protecting against counterfeits.\n\nPolitical engagement\nWe conduct all political engagements in a transparent, legal, and ethical manner and in accordance with integrity at HP.\n\nIn 2021, HP and the HP Employee Political Action Committee (PAC) ceased supporting candidates for elected office (and the HP PAC was dissolved). HP does not make political contributions within or outside of the United States.\n\nWe also make public our U.S. lobbying expenditures and membership in U.S. trade associations that engage in lobbying activity. HP did not make any in-kind political donations in 2021.\n\nIn 2021, for the fourth year in a row, we earned a perfect score and tied for first place overall among S&P 500 companies in the CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability.\n\n| HP corporate political contributions* | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|--------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| State and local candidates and groups [US$] | 111,900 | 138,900 | 0 |\n| HP employee PAC contributions* | 85,500 | 95,000 | 0 |\n| Federal and state candidates, party committees, and PACs supporting diverse candidates [US$] | 1,620,000 | 1,570,000 | 2,140,000 |\n\n* In 2021, HP and the HP PAC ceased supporting candidates for elected office (and the HP PAC was dissolved).\nSupply chain responsibility\n\n29  Approach\n31  Human rights\n31  Health and safety\n32  Responsible minerals sourcing\n34  Supplier diversity\n35  Environmental impact\n39  Performance monitoring and evaluation\n43  Data\nApproach\n\nHP relies on one of the IT industry\u2019s largest supply chains, made up of hundreds of production suppliers and thousands of nonproduction suppliers. Ranging from multinational enterprises to small firms, and operating in countries around the globe, these suppliers provide us with materials, components, and assembly for our products, shipping and delivery to our customers, as well as a wide variety of other goods and services.\n\nWe strive for an ethical, sustainable, and resilient supply chain to protect the people making our products, safeguard our business and brand, strengthen customer relationships, and create opportunities to innovate.\n\nWe require that all workers in HP\u2019s supply chain receive fair treatment, freely chosen employment, and safe working conditions. To reduce our footprint, we collaborate with suppliers to decrease greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water use, waste, and other environmental impacts.\n\nWe engage with suppliers in a wide range of ways to advance responsible practices. HP\u2019s Supplier Code of Conduct stipulates that suppliers must adopt or establish a management system that ensures compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and customer requirements. The management system must also identify and mitigate risks related to the Code and be designed to facilitate continual improvement in the business\u2019s social and environmental performance.\n\nSuppliers representing 95% of HP\u2019s total production supplier spend have gone through a social and environmental assessment.\n\nThe strength of our supply chain responsibility program helps us to address customer expectations. In 2021, almost US$2 billion in retained, existing and new sales took supply chain responsibility into account.\n\nFor an overview of our management approach in this area, including risk assessment, due diligence, grievance mechanisms, policies and standards, continual improvement, capability building, external collaboration, and reporting, see Supply chain responsibility: Our approach.\n\nDriving Sustainable Impact throughout the supply chain\n\nAdvancing social and environmental standards and capabilities across our supplier base is complex and requires long-term efforts. We set goals to sharpen our focus and drive ongoing progress.\n\nOur supply chain is complex, and we work to address a broad range of social, human rights, and environmental topics.\n\n| Supply chain responsibility | Improving the lives of the people who make our products and support our business |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Human rights                |                                                                                  |\n| Health and safety           |                                                                                  |\n| Responsible minerals sourcing |                                                                                |\n| Supplier diversity          |                                                                                  |\n| Environmental impact        |                                                                                  |\n\n2025 GOAL\n\nDouble factory participation in our supply chain sustainability programs by 2025, compared to 2015\n\nPROGRESS IN 2021\n\nHP has achieved this goal, with a 114% increase through 2021, compared to 2015 (therefore, we will not report on this goal moving forward)\n\n2030 GOAL\n\nReach 1 million workers through worker empowerment programs by 2030, since the beginning of 2015\n\nPROGRESS IN 2021\n\nThrough 2021, we reached 349,000 workers\n\n2030 GOAL\n\nAssure respect for labor-related human rights for 100% of our key contracted manufacturing suppliers and higher-risk next-tier suppliers\n\nPROGRESS IN 2021\n\nIn 2021, we continued to conduct human rights assessments of our key contracted manufacturers. We intend to report assurance calculations for 2022\nTransparency\n\nWe disclose the names and locations of the production suppliers that represent 95% of our manufacturing spend. Our products are manufactured in countries and territories worldwide.\n\nIn addition to this report, we disclose information about our supply chain responsibility and human rights performance through our annual SEC Conflict Minerals Report, Modern Slavery Transparency Statement, Report on Cobalt, and CDP Supply Chain disclosures. We also provide tailored supply chain responsibility information to our customers and channel partners to help them achieve their sustainability and human rights goals.\n\nExternal collaboration\n\nHP takes a leading role through collaborations focused on elevating supply chain best practices and tackling shared challenges. Key relationships include:\n\n- CDP Supply Chain program\n- Clean Electronics Production Network\n- Green Freight Asia\n- Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment\n- National Minority Supplier Development Council\n- Clean Energy Buyers Association\n- Responsible Business Alliance (RBA)\n- Responsible Labor Initiative\n\nCapability building\n\nIn collaboration with nongovernmental organization (NGO) partners and other external organizations, we provide programs designed to help suppliers continually improve along their sustainability journeys. During 2021, we reached 37,000 workers through our capability-building programs, in areas such as worker wellbeing, rights and responsibilities, and environmental, health, and safety (EHS) awareness. This included more than 16,000 employees at customer support-related and other nonproduction suppliers who completed training on the HP Supplier Code of Conduct.\n\nSUPPLIER RESPONSIBILITY SCORECARDS\n\nOur Supplier Responsibility Scorecards are intended to set expectations and drive improved performance through consistent, comprehensive, and actionable feedback. This tool provides suppliers with a score that encompasses audit performance, environmental and human rights governance, transparency, goal setting, and performance; conflict minerals management; and other social and environmental topics. Results are summarized across multiple dimensions and contribute to a supplier\u2019s overall procurement score, which impacts the supplier\u2019s relationship with HP and ongoing business. Suppliers discuss their Scorecard with HP as part of regular business performance evaluations, and receive additional points if they demonstrate sustained improvement. In 2021, average scores for final assembly suppliers increased by three percentage points compared to 2020, and average scores for commodity suppliers increased by one percentage point, in part due to closer followup and collaboration with suppliers. Supplier Responsibility Scorecards applied to suppliers representing 76% of our production spend. See Data for full results.\n\nIn 2021, we expanded the scope of our capability-building program to include our customer support business, in addition to production suppliers, nonproduction suppliers, and our own manufacturing operations. Examples of the trainings and opportunities we provide, eight of which ran during the year, are listed in the table below.\n\nIn October 2020, we launched MOVE, a program to help empower migrant workers in Southeast Asia. The initiative provides information on COVID-19 and delivers free training on workers\u2019 rights in four languages to support workers and managers in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand.\n\nIn 2019, we launched a two-year worker wellbeing program in collaboration with Verit\u00e9, an international nonprofit that promotes safe, fair, and legal working conditions in global supply chains.\n\n| Focus areas | Examples of trainings and opportunities |\n|-------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Baseline conformance with HP standards | \u2022 EHS awareness training  \n\u2022 Foreign migrant worker training  \n\u2022 RBA Code of Conduct training  \n\u2022 Rights and Responsibilities training |\n| Ongoing engagement in key areas | \u2022 Supply chain responsibility workshop (including science-based targets training)  \n\u2022 Forced labor webinar  \n\u2022 Grievance mechanism webinar  \n\u2022 Environmental expectation webinar  \n\u2022 Brazil Supplier Forum |\n| Leadership above and beyond HP\u2019s requirements | \u2022 Worker wellbeing program  \n\u2022 MOVE |\nchains. This program aimed to strengthen health and safety knowledge and equip workers with the tools and skills needed to grow professionally and personally. In 2021, we completed our final assessment, in which we found that this program improved workers\u2019 knowledge about occupational health and safety, worker rights, and life skills. The worker wellbeing program reached 10,700 workers.\n\nIn 2021, we launched a new digital learning platform in collaboration with Quizrr, a platform dedicated to driving positive change through innovative training solutions to advance corporate responsibility and capability building in global supply chains. We delivered our Rights and Responsibilities training through this platform.\n\nHuman rights\n\nWe continually deepen our understanding of the social and economic factors that lead to labor concerns, and then focus on areas of risk where we can have the most influence. We collaborate with organizations and government agencies with local expertise to promote long-term, scalable solutions. Our primary focus areas are combating forced labor, protecting workers\u2019 rights, and advancing worker health and safety, including safe use of process chemicals.\n\nWe communicate openly with workers and management in our supply chain to identify and understand workers\u2019 questions, concerns, and priorities. We train our procurement teams, supplier managers, and other employees to be vigilant and report instances of practices that violate our standards. In 2021, we focused on building additional communication channels to collect more extensive worker feedback that will inform future work.\n\nCombating modern slavery\n\nAs part of our commitment to addressing modern slavery, we start with our own operations and suppliers while striving to collaborate more broadly in ways that drive positive change. Modern slavery, as defined in guidance under the UK Modern Slavery Act, can manifest itself in different ways, including through debt bondage, forced labor, and human trafficking. HP is uncompromising in our expectations of ethical behavior by our employees, partners, and suppliers. In our Modern Slavery Transparency Statement, we discuss our efforts to address modern slavery during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021.\n\nWhere significant risks are identified, we work with suppliers and partners to address challenges and enact risk-mitigation plans. As a part of addressing priority findings, HP has confirmed remedy to more than 250 workers in our operations and supply chain, including approximately US$0.4 million in repayments in 2021 addressing findings associated with modern slavery.\n\nAs an example of our programs in this area, in 2019 we launched a partnership with Issara Institute, an NGO that helps tackle issues related to human trafficking and forced labor, to support the monitoring of recruitment processes in Myanmar. In 2021, we kept our focus on worker voice, using Issara\u2019s expertise to help understand and address worker concerns and improve factory worker-management communication as we continued to deal with borders being closed due to COVID-19. We plan to resume our focus on responsible recruitment when borders reopen as the pandemic eases.\n\nTo support and advance supplier due diligence, we sponsor Responsible Recruitment 101, a virtual training for suppliers in Taiwan and Malaysia organized by the Responsible Labor Initiative. The two-session training provides suppliers with a comprehensive understanding of forced labor and modern slavery in relation to their own businesses, the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct, and applicable laws and regulations.\n\nHP is a Gold Level Sponsor of Truckers Against Trafficking (TAT), which helps combat human trafficking in the United States by educating and mobilizing members of the trucking and busing industries and coordinating with law enforcement agencies. We are one of the few shippers that participates directly, and we encourage all carriers moving HP products in the United States to take TAT training.\n\nProcess chemicals\n\nIn 2021, we continued to focus on implementation of a comprehensive worker safety strategy to address process chemicals. Suppliers are required to follow the manufacturing process chemical use restrictions outlined in HP\u2019s General Specification for the Environment (GSE). Additionally, our Supplier Code of Conduct requires suppliers to employ robust management systems to catalog and evaluate process chemicals, eliminate or manage hazardous substances, demonstrate that analyses of safer alternatives were conducted when a hazardous chemical is being used, and provide workers with essential personal protective equipment and training. We gather data from our suppliers about process chemicals and implement corrective action as needed.\nWe encourage suppliers to switch to safer choices, such as changing from solvent-based to water-based paints. In situations where the use of hazardous chemicals is currently unavoidable, we help suppliers identify preferable alternatives through our alternative materials assessment program.\n\nTo drive progress across the industry, we are a founding member of the Clean Electronics Production Network (CEPN), facilitated by the NGO Green America. This collaborative multi-stakeholder effort developed a program to assess the use of process chemicals, strengthen the culture of worker safety and engagement, reduce worker exposure to identified priority process chemicals, substitute those chemicals with safer alternatives within members\u2019 own manufacturing processes, and ultimately reach deeper into members\u2019 supply chains.\n\nIn early 2021, we committed to taking collective action to protect workers in our global supply chain from exposure to hazardous process chemicals as a Founding Signatory of CEPN\u2019s Toward Zero Exposure program, which has been developed with sustainability and social responsibility leaders\u2014including HP. Through the program, electronics brands and suppliers commit to aligned, structured, long-term practices that will protect workers throughout the manufacturing process from exposure to hazardous chemicals. Participants also commit to public disclosure of progress starting in 2023.\n\n### Responsible minerals sourcing\n\nAny connection between the materials used in HP products and armed violence or human rights abuses is unacceptable. To ensure our products are made responsibly, we have adopted industry-leading policies and monitoring practices and are broadening our vigilance beyond conflict minerals to a wider range of minerals and geographies. Through collaborative efforts, we aim to expand the market for responsibly sourced minerals, including those originating from conflict-affected and high-risk areas (CAHRAs).\n\n#### Conflict minerals\n\nAcross our complex, global, multi-actor supply chain, we have the most influence over our direct suppliers. However, in the case of trace and precious minerals, we recognize that we must work to influence the practices of those much deeper in the supply chain.\n\n**Approach**\n\nWhile conflict minerals are rarely used in large volumes in any one IT product or by one company, the tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold (3TG) produced from them are found in relatively small amounts in virtually all electronic products. However, we are typically 4-10 supply chain stages removed from the smelters that purchase the ores and process them into metals. For this reason, HP works with peers across the IT industry to collectively engage the entire supply chain in efforts to eradicate minerals that may have directly or indirectly supported armed groups, and to promote responsible sourcing of minerals regardless of origin.\n\nHP supports retention of the U.S. conflict minerals reporting framework as an economic driver for smelters to responsibly source minerals in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and surrounding countries. In the EU, we support the Conflict Minerals Regulation, which appropriately focuses on responsible smelter sourcing regardless of country of mineral origin, including CAHRAs worldwide.\n\nWe do not support de facto embargoes of minerals from the DRC and adjoining countries, or from other conflict-affected regions. We believe it is more effective to use our leverage (as a company and within cross-industry collaborations) to address issues and promote positive change. This helps to protect people in those regions while maintaining their economic opportunities. We are actively involved in the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) and support its efforts to engage with government stakeholders.\n\n**Eliminating conflict-related risks from our supply chain**\n\nPromoting best practices by smelters is the most direct way to address the risk of conflict minerals entering our supply chain. We require our suppliers to source 3TG for HP products only from smelters that comply with the RMI\u2019s Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP), which requires a third-party sourcing audit. Presence on the RMI conformant list demonstrates a smelter\u2019s conflict-free status.\n\nHowever, our relatively small use of these metals decreases our influence, so we need all industries that use these materials to demand conflict-free 3TG. We will continue to work with our suppliers and across industries to drive demand for conflict-free sourcing, regardless of whether the minerals originate in the DRC or elsewhere.\n\nWe promote conflict-free minerals in our supply chain by:\n\n- **Requiring our production suppliers of goods containing 3TG (\u201c3TG suppliers\u201d) to require their smelters to undergo third-party sourcing audits and use only smelters that are RMAP conformant.**\n- **Encouraging all smelters that purchase and process mineral ores to undergo third-party sourcing audits.**\n- **Supporting multi-stakeholder collaboration to establish secure, conflict-free sources of 3TG ores from the DRC.**\nSuppliers\nHP sets clear requirements of 3TG suppliers in our Supply Chain Social and Environmental Responsibility Policy (which includes our Conflict Minerals Policy), General Specification for the Environment, and Supplier Code of Conduct.\n\nWe assess these suppliers\u2019 responses to the RMI Conflict Minerals Reporting Template, which gives companies a common format for sharing information about 3TG sources with business partners and suppliers across the supply chain. We require corrective action from suppliers where needed, and provide them with training upon request. If any 3TG supplier reports sourcing from a smelter that triggers one of our potential risk indicators, we work with the supplier to establish whether unverified material is potentially used in HP products. When we identify a risk of this occurring, we require the supplier to remove the smelter from our supply chain. If a supplier is non-responsive, we use our procurement leverage to engage the supplier and improve performance.\n\nSmelters\nTo identify and disclose the smelters and refiners in our supply chain, between January and December 2021 HP surveyed suppliers that contributed material, components, or manufacturing for products containing 3TG. Each smelter or refiner reported was identified in at least one of the RMI Conflict Minerals Reporting Templates we received.\n\nPerformance\nIn 2021, we received acceptable responses to RMI Conflict Minerals Reporting Templates from suppliers representing about 98% of our 3TG procurement spend, including both final assembly and commodity suppliers. These responses detailed 267 3TG facilities, greater than 98% of which were compliant or in the process of becoming compliant with an independent assessment program, and/or that we reasonably believe exclusively source conflict minerals from recycled or scrap sources or from outside of the Covered Countries (as of March 2022).\n\nProgress toward DRC Conflict-Free, 2021\n\n| Type of facility | Total | Progress toward DRC Conflict-Free | Percentage |\n|------------------|-------|----------------------------------|------------|\n| Tantalum         | 36    | 36                               | 100%       |\n| Tin              | 68    | 64                               | 94%        |\n| Tungsten         | 46    | 46                               | 100%       |\n| Gold             | 117   | 115                              | 98%        |\n| Total            | 267   | 261                              | 98%        |\n\n*Number of total 3TG facilities in HP Conflict Minerals Report 3TG facility list that were either RMAP compliant or in process of becoming compliant, and/or that we reasonably believe exclusively source conflict minerals from recycled or scrap sources or from outside of the Covered Countries (as of March 2022).\n\nStatus of all supplier-reported 3TG facilities*\n\n| Year | Unknown | Believed to source recycled/ scrap or from outside of the Covered Countries | Compliant or in process** |\n|------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| 2019 | 40      | 18                                                                       | 237                       |\n| 2020 | 1       | 2                                                                       | 247                       |\n| 2021 | 6       | 9                                                                       | 252                       |\n\n*As of March 2022.\n**Smelters or refiners listed by RMI as currently RMAP compliant (including certification or accreditation by similar independent assessment programs cross-recognized by RMAP such as the Responsible Jewellery Council\u2019s Chain-of-Custody certification program or the London Bullion Market Association\u2019s Responsible Gold Standard) or in the process of becoming RMAP compliant.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Conflict Minerals Report\nIn May 2022, we filed our Form SD and Conflict Minerals Report with the U.S. SEC, disclosing our due diligence efforts and results. See our SEC Conflict Minerals Report.\n\nOther regions and minerals\nLearning from our experience combating conflict minerals in the DRC and surrounding countries, we are expanding our efforts. This aligns with growing awareness of mineral-sourcing issues beyond the DRC and surrounding countries covered by the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act. The EU Conflict Minerals Regulation, which covers EU imports of 3TG minerals from all regions of the world, requires all large EU 3TG metal importers and smelters to become \u201cresponsible importers\u201d consistent with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas. Although HP\u2019s operations are not within the scope of the EU regulation, we have voluntarily aligned our policy and approach to support our customers\u2019 requirements consistent with the regulation.\n\nThe RBA is the parent organization of the RMI. In 2020, we supported revision of the RBA Code of Conduct so that it would address sourcing from any CAHRAs worldwide, not only from the DRC and Covered Countries. Leading up to this, we also supported RMI\u2019s work to help smelters develop processes to identify CAHRAs, as well as RMI\u2019s work to fully align its processes and standards for assessing smelters\u2019 sourcing practices with the OECD Guidance on sourcing from CAHRAs.\n\nOur minerals due diligence and reporting also includes cobalt, which has been linked to human rights risks. We expect our suppliers to have policies addressing cobalt, to report to HP the...\nnames of the cobalt refiners they use, and to join us in encouraging these refiners to complete an RMI audit. Additionally, we encourage suppliers to engage in collaborative industry action through RMI. See our Report on Cobalt, and our responsible minerals sourcing expectations for suppliers in HP\u2019s General Specification for the Environment.\n\nMulti-stakeholder initiatives\n\nSourcing minerals responsibly requires globally coordinated efforts across sectors and industries. We collaborate widely with businesses, NGOs, government agencies, and our production suppliers to advance the use of responsibly sourced minerals.\n\nThrough RMI, we help develop and share due diligence standards, tools, trainings, and white papers to build the capabilities of the IT industry and beyond. We also support broader policy efforts through participation in RMI and its Due Diligence Practices, Smelter Engagement, and Sensing and Prioritization Teams.\n\nAdditionally, we collaborate through external forums and initiatives, including the European Partnership for Responsible Minerals, Material Insights, and Public-Private Alliance for Responsible Minerals Trade.\n\nSupplier diversity\n\nOur commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion is a top priority at HP and applies equally to our workforce and to our relationships with suppliers. Through our purchasing decisions and activities, we foster greater opportunity, equality, and representation. Building a more diverse supply chain reflects our values while driving greater innovation, fortifying our business, and strengthening local economies.\n\nWe encourage small businesses and diverse companies\u2014that is those owned by women, minorities, veterans, service-disabled veterans, LGBTQ+ individuals, and aboriginal or indigenous individuals\u2014to compete for our business. In 2021 in the United States, we spent US$276 million with small businesses, US$79 million with minority-owned businesses, and US$91 million with women-owned businesses (see data). During the year, our supplier diversity program in the United States had an overall economic impact of more than US$650 million (see graphic below).\n\nIn 2021, we continued to develop our supplier diversity program in the United States. To accelerate our efforts, we work with the National Minority Supplier Development Council, the Women\u2019s Business Enterprise National Council, and industry groups such as tech:SCALE.\n\nWe launched the HP Racial Equality and Social Justice Task Force in June 2020. Through policies, programs, and executive sponsorships, we will help Black/African American-owned suppliers develop relationships with HP that can strengthen their businesses and build economic power. To drive economic empowerment, our goal is for 10% of HP supplier diversity spend in the United States to be with Black/African American suppliers in\n\nEconomic impact summary of HP supplier diversity program, 2021*\n\n| Category | Amount |\n|----------|--------|\n| Spending with small and diverse suppliers | US$362 million+ |\n| Incomes earned by employees in the jobs supported by HP\u2019s supplier diversity program purchases | US$130 million+ |\n| Jobs supported through HP\u2019s spending with diverse suppliers** | 2,000+ |\n| Federal, state, and local personal and corporate taxes generated | US$200 million+ |\n\n*Data is for the 12 months ending September 30 of the year noted. Figures are based on HP purchases in the United States and Puerto Rico from U.S.-based businesses.\n\n**Goods and services produced by HP\u2019s diverse suppliers and their supply chains.\n\n*** Including professional services, scientific services, technical services, computer and electronic manufacturing, real estate, and numerous other industries.\ncalendar year 2022, up ten-fold from 2020. We achieved 4.5% in 2021.\n\nIn 2021, HP announced an expanded early payment program in partnership with C2FO, which provides broad access to funding for the company\u2019s diverse suppliers. Studies from the Federal Reserve and others have found that diverse businesses face greater difficulty in accessing credit, creating short-term cash flow challenges. We are working to bridge this gap by offering inexpensive access to capital for diverse partners that have been denied equal access historically.\n\nSupplier expectations\n\nWe ask that our suppliers partner with HP by prioritizing diversity, equity, and inclusion within their own operations. To improve the diversity of our suppliers\u2019 workforces, we require top service suppliers in the United States with account teams of 10 or more to implement diversity initiatives to recruit, attract, and hire diverse employees, with a goal that at least 10% of HP supplier account team members be Black/African American by the end of calendar year 2022. We also have targeted programs in the United States with marketing and legal suppliers and partners.\n\nTo advance progress deeper in our supply chain, we have added a clause in new and renewed contracts for suppliers that provide services to HP in the United States, setting the expectation that they should spend a minimum of 10% of any work subcontracted and/or purchased on behalf of HP with diverse businesses. To strengthen the program\u2019s racial equality focus, top suppliers subcontracting work in the United States must spend at least 5% with certified Black/African American businesses. In 2021, our allocatable indirect spend with diverse suppliers through this program was more than US$350 million.\n\nSupporting diversity in the financial sector\n\nHP\u2019s Bank Model\u2014the tool by which HP ranks and prioritizes potential bank partners\u2014incorporates an annual diversity survey that looks at bank diversity overall as well as the diversity of teams that service HP.\n\nIn 2021, HP issued its inaugural Sustainability Bond by partnering with Black/African American-, Latino-, women-, veteran-, and disabled veteran-owned banks, which have received approximately 5% of total underwriting fees. We engaged a Black/African American- and women-owned firm to execute the more than 10% of share repurchases carried out during 2021, and have continued working with a minority-owned firm as one of a small group of commercial paper (short-term borrowing) dealers.\n\nEnvironmental impact\n\nOur production and nonproduction suppliers are essential partners as we work to drive net zero carbon and improved resource efficiency throughout the value chain. For more than a decade, we have worked closely with our suppliers to improve their environmental programs and report progress transparently. Our Supplier Responsibility Scorecards are central to our efforts to set expectations, evaluate performance, and drive ongoing improvement.\n\nWe request 98% of our production suppliers, by spend, as well as strategic nonproduction suppliers, to disclose key qualitative and quantitative information about environmental management and impacts through HP\u2019s CDP Supply Chain membership. Requested information includes GHG emissions and goals, total and renewable energy use, water withdrawal, climate and water risks, and governance.\n\nWe periodically raise our expectations relating to supplier environmental management criteria, such as science-based GHG emissions-reduction targets, third-party verification of GHG emissions, publication of a GRI-based sustainability report.\n\nHP CUSTOMER SUPPORT SUPPLIER PLEDGE\n\nHP is continually expanding the scope of our supply chain responsibility program, integrating it deeper and more broadly throughout our supplier base. In 2021, we launched the Customer Support (CS) Supplier Pledge to boost sustainability standards among the nearly 700 suppliers that HP CS engages with.\n\nDeveloped to support progress toward our 2030 climate and circular economy goals, the Pledge includes several existing components of our supplier program:\n\n- Submitting environmental transparency reporting to CDP Climate Change annually\n- Setting science-based GHG emissions reduction targets, including at least a 50% reduction in absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030\n- Training employees on the HP RBA Supplier Code of Conduct\n\nThe Pledge also sets additional supplier expectations, such as:\n\n- Applying circular economy principles throughout their business, including by using programs such as HP Planet Partners and HP Device Recovery Service\n- Developing and sharing ambitions that align with HP\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion goals\n\nWe aim to enrol our 50 largest CS-related suppliers.\nand transparent reporting of key environmental information through CDP.\n\nWe continue to deepen engagement with suppliers representing GHG emissions \u201chot spots\u201d in our supply chain\u2014such as LCD panels, printed circuit board assemblies, and memory and storage\u2014identified through life cycle assessments (LCAs) and directly collected data. In 2021, this included procurement-driven workshops with 27 suppliers, representing about 60% of HP\u2019s production spend. Focus areas included setting science-based targets and establishing roadmaps for increasing renewable energy use.\n\nTo understand and manage our impacts, we calculate supply chain GHG emissions and water withdrawal in two ways:\n\n- In this section of the report, we include data reported by our first-tier production suppliers, product transportation suppliers, and nonproduction suppliers. This data reflects the volume of HP\u2019s business with each organization. Through engagement with suppliers, we can better understand and influence improvements in performance year over year.\n\n- The supply chain-related data included in our carbon and water footprints is derived from product LCA-based estimates. This analysis is intended to provide as complete an understanding as possible of impacts across the multiple levels of our supply chain, from materials extraction through manufacturing and product use, as well as retail and storage. These calculations use a combination of HP-specific and industry methods and data.\n\n### Greenhouse gas emissions\n\nIn 2008, HP was the first major IT company to publish aggregated supply chain GHG emissions data. We continue working to drive progress in this area, including through our goals (see right). Our goal to reduce supply chain GHG emissions intensity is one of HP\u2019s three value chain goals validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). These goals were developed in collaboration with WWF experts, demonstrating our rigorous goal-setting process.\n\nAlthough GHG emissions intensity decreased by 4% between 2015 and 2020 when calculated as a three-year rolling average, yearly GHG emissions intensity values (not calculated as a rolling average) decreased by 9% during that timeframe. To help reach our goal, we focus our suppliers\u2019 attention on improving energy management and efficiency, using renewable energy, and setting science-based targets.\n\n#### Supplier GHG emissions performance\n\n|                      | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Production supplier Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions* | 2,900,000 | 3,000,000 | 2,700,000 |        |\n| Product transportation | 1,300,000 | 1,250,000 | 1,510,000 | 1,620,000 |\n| Nonproduction supplier Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions* | 210,000  | 190,000  | 140,000  |        |\n\n* 2020 is the most recent year data is available.\n\n#### 2025 GOAL\n\nReduce first-tier production supplier and product transportation-related GHG emissions intensity by 10% by 2025, compared to 2015\n\n**PROGRESS THROUGH 2020**\n\nGHG emissions intensity decreased 4% through 2020, compared to 2015\n\n#### 2025 GOAL\n\nHelp suppliers cut 2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO\u2082e) emissions between 2010 and 2025\n\n**PROGRESS THROUGH 2020**\n\nSuppliers avoided 1.46 MILLION TONNES of CO\u2082e emissions\n\nFor the sixth consecutive year, HP was named by CDP as a Supplier Engagement Leader for our actions and strategies to reduce emissions and manage climate risks in our supply chain.\n\n### Production suppliers\n\n**Approach**\n\nThrough our Supplier Responsibility Scorecards, we set requirements for our production suppliers, including related to energy use and GHG emissions performance and disclosure. In 2021, we continued engaging with suppliers to drive positive change, for example by providing training outlining our environmental expectations.\n\nWe also worked with other organizations during 2021 to accelerate cross-sector improvements:\n\n- HP collaborated with the We Mean Business Coalition, CDP, and industry peers to promote the uptake of SBTi methodology among IT supply chain companies (both production and nonproduction suppliers) based in the Greater China region.\n\u2022 We joined the 2021 CDP Science-Based Targets Campaign and co-signed a letter to a large number of companies\u2014including many in our supply chain\u2014urging them to set SBTI-validated GHG emissions-reduction goals. By the end of 2021, nine of those suppliers had a new target in place, including four with a net zero commitment.\n\n\u2022 To support local demand for renewable energy in countries where some of our suppliers are based, we worked with the U.S. Department of State through the Clean Energy Demand Initiative to produce letters of intent with those countries, which were presented at the COP26 conference.\n\n\u2022 Along with seven of our suppliers, we participated in roundtable discussions hosted by WWF Climate Business Hub, with representatives from the Chinese government and renewable energy developers, to promote policies that will enable greater renewable electricity sourcing in Jiangsu Province.\n\nOur Energy Efficiency Program in China and Southeast Asia, implemented in collaboration with NGOs such as BSR, Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), the World Resources Institute, and WWF, helps suppliers to build capabilities, identify ways to improve energy efficiency, and explore the use of renewable energy.\n\nSince 2010, we estimate that participants in this and other programs have avoided 1.46 million tonnes of CO\u2082e emissions and saved a cumulative 992 million kWh (US$119 million) of electricity, including 81,000 tonnes of CO\u2082e emissions and 31 million kWh (US$3.9 million) in 2021.\n\nMore broadly, through CDP, our production suppliers reported savings of 20 million tonnes of CO\u2082e and US$465 million from reduction initiatives implemented in 2020. This demonstrates the scale of ongoing GHG emissions-reduction activities throughout our production supply chain, regardless of whether driven by HP\u2019s engagement.\n\nWe engaged 98% of our first-tier production suppliers, by spend, to help reduce their environmental impact. Overall, 95% (by spend) reported having GHG emissions-reduction-related goals, and 31% reported science-based targets (13% validated by the SBTi and 18% evaluated by HP). We also encourage suppliers to use renewable energy. Seventy-seven percent reported doing so in 2021, by spend, with 71% reporting renewable energy use goals, up from 70% the prior year.\n\nProduct transportation\n\nApproach\nTo improve efficiency, cut costs, and reduce negative environmental impacts, we work to optimize our logistics network by consolidating shipments, identifying new routes, and shipping directly to customers or local distribution centers. To drive progress, in 2021 we held GHG emissions-reduction workshops with about 20 suppliers representing more than 90% of our CO\u2082e emissions in this area. Sustainability topics are also discussed during our quarterly executive-level meetings with these same suppliers, to promote a focus on environmental topics and encourage them to set related performance goals.\n\nHP is participating in several pilot programs to explore opportunities to reduce GHG emissions from logistics, for example Maersk\u2019s project with industry leaders to scale zero carbon solutions for ocean transport, such as the use of carbon neutral e-methanol or sustainable bio-methanol.\n\nWe require our product transportation suppliers to use the Global Logistics Emissions Council Framework to provide standardized calculations and data that account for variation in different locations. To drive progress across the industry and beyond, we are working with the Clean Cargo Working Group, the Smart Freight Centre, the International Council on Clean Transportation, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) SmartWay program.\n\nWe continue to use SmartWay partners as a first choice for 100% of our products shipped by truck in the United States and Canada. The program aims to help improve road transportation efficiency and reduce GHG and other emissions. In 2021, HP won the U.S. EPA SmartWay Excellence Award for the eighth year in a row, demonstrating leadership in freight supply chain energy and environmental performance for the \u201cLarge Shipper\u201d category in the United States. During the year, we joined the Sustainable Freight Buyers Alliance to decarbonize freight and create demand for low and zero emissions across all modes of transport.\n\nReducing packaging size and weight also has the potential to decrease GHG emissions associated with product transportation. See Packaging innovation.\n\nPerformance\n\nProduct transportation resulted in 1.62 million tonnes of CO\u2082e emissions in 2021, up 7% from the prior year. This was due primarily to product volume increases as well as improved data for emissions related to road (including rail).\nNonproduction suppliers\n\nApproach\nWe purchase a wide range of goods and services related to the operations of HP, such as staffing, business consulting, marketing, and travel. We prioritize collaboration with nonproduction suppliers based on geographical risk and industry, and provide training to help improve reporting and reduce GHG emissions.\n\nPerformance\nIn 2020, the most recent year for which data is available, our nonproduction suppliers reported 140,000 tonnes of Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO\u2082e emissions attributable to HP. See detail in Footprint. During that year, 56% of HP nonproduction strategic suppliers produced environmental reports.\n\nWater\n\nApproach\nMany of our suppliers operate in regions where water stress is a growing threat. We work with production suppliers to improve water management in their operations, including through the Supplier Code of Conduct, which contains provisions on water management, pollution prevention and resource use reduction, and environmental permits and reporting.\n\nPerformance\nIn 2020, the most recent year for which data is available, production suppliers withdrew 36 million cubic meters of water associated with HP, 3% less than in 2019. We believe that stronger supplier water-accounting practices contributed to year-over-year variations in data. By the end of 2020, 94% of our suppliers, by spend, had set water management goals.\n\nSee HP\u2019s 2021 water footprint.\n\nWaste\n\nApproach\nWe work with production suppliers to encourage waste measurement and reporting, reduce waste volumes, and drive progress toward a circular economy. HP requests our suppliers report on waste using the RBA Environmental Survey.\n\nPerformance\nDuring 2020, the most recent year for which data is available, our suppliers generated 126,000 tonnes of nonhazardous waste associated with HP, a 14% decrease from 2019. This was primarily due to reduced waste generation at a significant supplier through waste prevention, reuse, and recycling efforts. Suppliers generated 46,000 tonnes of hazardous waste associated with HP in 2020, down 13% compared to the prior year. This was due largely to significant reductions by three suppliers. By the end of 2020, 76% of our production suppliers, by spend, had set waste-related goals, up from 72% the prior year.\n\nSUPPLY CHAIN TRANSPARENCY\n\nMuch of our production supplier base is in China, so we have a particular focus in that area. The Corporate Information Transparency Index, developed by the Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs (IPE) and NRDC, evaluates the environmental practices of global brands\u2019 supply chains in China. In 2021, HP ranked #7 among global IT companies and #31 overall, of more than 600 brands assessed. On the Supply Chain Climate Action Transparency Index, developed by IPE and CDP, HP ranked #15 of about 680 brands.\n\nDuring 2021, we continued encouraging our suppliers to submit inventories of substances released through IPE\u2019s public pollutant release and transfer register system, and cross-checked supplier sites representing 95% of our spend against IPE\u2019s public database of environmental violations.\n\nWe also collaborated with first-tier manufacturing suppliers in China to determine whether sub-tier suppliers complied with local environmental laws. This review of 730 sub-tier suppliers identified 27 reported violations in 2021. Of these, 18 had been corrected as of November 2021, and we continue working with the relevant first-tier suppliers and IPE to address and resolve the remaining issues. Business with several sub-tier suppliers has been suspended due to unaddressed environmental violations.\nPerformance monitoring and evaluation\n\nWe engage with suppliers in multiple ways to understand performance, identify and address issues, and drive ongoing progress:\n\n- **The supplier Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ).** This includes detailed questions around social and environmental management and practices. As well as assisting HP to evaluate risk, identify areas for improvement, and determine a firm\u2019s inclusion in our audit program, self-assessment helps suppliers become more familiar with HP\u2019s expectations of conformance to our Supplier Code of Conduct. During 2021, 171 production suppliers completed SAQs.\n\n- **Coaching, specialized training, data collection, and ongoing dialogue.** Using these mechanisms, we aim to help suppliers develop robust management systems to address root causes of key risks and challenges; for more detail, see Capability building.\n\n- **Key performance indicator (KPI) monitoring program.** We collect data from high-risk supplier sites weekly on key issues such as working hours, day of rest, and student workers, and collaborate to drive ongoing improvement. See results.\n\n- **Supplier audits.** Our supplier audit process is an essential component of our risk assessment framework and a key mechanism for identifying opportunities for sustained improvement with our suppliers. Supplier audits measure conformance with all provisions of the HP Supplier Code of Conduct in the areas of labor, health and safety, environment, ethics, and management systems. See Supply chain responsibility: Our approach for detail about the audit process. We also work with our final assembly suppliers to confirm they are conducting risk assessments of companies in their own supply chains that represent approximately 80% of their spend and assuring 25% of sites determined to be high risk, based on the RBA Code of Conduct.\n\n- **Supplier sustainability assessments.** We conduct targeted assessments to supplement our comprehensive audits, focusing on specific risk areas including vulnerable workers (such as student, dispatch, and foreign migrant workers) and health and safety (including fire safety and emergency preparedness). In 2021, we piloted a new priority screening assessment at 12 facilities that will aid faster detection of high-priority human rights risks throughout our supply chain, so we can more efficiently drive targeted improvement.\n\n**Performance**\n\nIn 2021, we completed 189 audits of production suppliers, product reuse and recycling vendors, and nonproduction suppliers, as well as 24 other assessments of production suppliers. Travel and factory restrictions, as well as office closures related to COVID-19, decreased our ability to conduct these activities. During the year, 88% of production supplier audits were third-party certified RBA Validated Assessment Program (VAP) audits.\n\nWe see a wide range of maturity levels in our audits, which are scored on a scale of 0-200. In the RBA Factory Lead Certification Program, suppliers with scores from 160 to 180 are eligible for a Silver certification, and those with scores above 180 for a Gold certification (including 36% of supplier facilities audited in 2021).\n\n### Sustainability audits, 2021*\n\n| Product supply chain | Initial audits (initial evaluations of conformance) | Follow-up audits (addressing nonconformances identified in any corrective action plans) | Full re-audits (comprehensive reassessments) |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Production suppliers | 19                                                  | 46                                                                              | 61                                          |\n| Product transportation suppliers | 2 | 0 | 0 |\n| Product reuse and recycling vendors | 10 | 0 | 15 |\n| Nonproduction suppliers | | | |\n| Suppliers supporting HP manufacturing (on HP premises) | 30 | 0 | 0 |\n| Suppliers supporting HP offices (on HP premises) | 3 | 0 | 0 |\n| Service suppliers (on third-party premises) | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| HP operations | | | |\n| HP manufacturing sites | 2 | 0 | 1 |\n| HP offices | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n\n* Audits of production suppliers and suppliers supporting HP manufacturing followed the RBA Code of Conduct either 6.0 or 7.0 (released during 2021) audit protocols. We contract with Environmental Resources Management (ERM) to audit product reuse and recycling vendors for conformance with the following policies and vendor standards: Export of Electronic Waste to Developing Countries Policy, HP Supplier Code of Conduct, and Reuse and Recycling Standards. See Product repair, reuse, and recycling for detail. Audits of nonproduction suppliers supporting HP offices, off-site third-party nonproduction suppliers, and HP offices were focused on labor, ethics, and management systems.\nOver time, we have seen supplier audit scores increase. From 2019 to 2021, the percentage of production supplier initial audits and full re-audits that scored above 160 increased from 45% to 50%. The average score during that period rose from 140 to 149. Twenty-three audits during 2021 were of final assembly supplier sites. Of these, 14 (61%) scored over 160, eight (35%) scored between 100 and 160, and one (4%) scored under 100. The other 103 audits during 2021 were of commodity supplier sites. Of these, 63% scored over 160, 27% scored between 100 and 160, and 10% scored under 100.\n\nWe periodically increase our expectations of suppliers, so suppliers must continually improve to maintain a consistent audit score. For example, in 2021 we adopted version 7.0 of the RBA Code of Conduct, which includes requirements related to worker voice and training, pregnant and nursing women, process chemicals, and water management. During that year, we also added new environmental requirements to our Supplier Responsibility Scorecard.\n\nImmediate priority findings\n\nImmediate priority findings are the most serious type of supplier nonconformance, and require immediate action. In 2021, we identified 14 immediate priority findings, equivalent to 0.18 findings on average for each initial audit and full re-audit of production suppliers conducted. There were two issues related to the charging of recruitment fees, one related to health and safety, one related to forced overtime, one related to falsified overtime records, two related to fire detection, and seven related to fire exits. We required the issues to be immediately addressed, and are working with the suppliers to complete remediation and implement corrective actions to adjust their management systems.\n\nOther findings\n\nFor audits conducted in 2021, suppliers were in full conformance (no major nonconformances identified) for the following provisions: risk of child labor; freedom of association; privacy; protection of identity and nonretaliation; fair business, advertising, and competition; intellectual property; disclosure of information; no improper advantage; and business integrity. Eighty initial audits and full re-audits of production suppliers conducted in 2021 identified 528 major nonconformances, equivalent to 6.6 per audit on average. Six provisions (see table on page 41) out of 45 total represented 67% of all major nonconformances identified. We focus on these and other areas that have the greatest potential for improvement.\n\nHP requires suppliers to provide a detailed corrective action plan addressing all identified nonconformances within 30 days of receipt of the site audit report (except immediate priority findings, which are addressed expeditiously), and has processes in place to monitor progress and subsequent closure of nonconformances. For details, see the RBA VAP Operations Manual and Supply chain responsibility: Our approach.\n### Issues with lowest rates of conformance of sites audited, 2019 and 2021*\n\n| Issue                        | Rate of conformance 2019** | Rate of conformance 2021** | HP\u2019s approach                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Working hours                | 22%                         | 24%                         | Excessive working hours remains the most pressing labor challenge in our supply chain, especially around times of peak production and labor shortages. Workers often voluntarily work long hours to earn more money, and suppliers may lack effective management systems in this area. The rate of conformance increased in 2021 compared to 2019, even while dealing with residual COVID-19 impacts, including movement control orders and other restrictions. Although the RBA declared certain exemptions to working hours requirements of its Code of Conduct due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we audited suppliers during 2021 based on the regular requirements. Among suppliers in our KPI program (73 at the end of 2021, representing approximately 100,600 workers), 95% met our requirements related to working hours in 2021, compared to 93% in 2020. This increase demonstrated the ability of KPI program members to effectively manage this issue in the context of changing production demands during continuing challenges. |\n| Emergency preparedness       | 52%                         | 49%                         | Nonconformances include items such as blocked exit doors, missing or poorly lit exit signs, lack of fire exit instructions, and missing or defective emergency equipment. Most can be quickly remedied, while some take longer, such as replacing all fire exit doors. We supplement our audits with specific health and safety assessments. |\n| Wages and benefits           | 62%                         | 55%                         | In countries without a set minimum wage, the industry prevailing wage applies. The most common issue in wages and benefits is suppliers not paying appropriate social insurance. Examples of corrective actions related to wages and benefits include maintaining documentation of pay stubs and employer contributions to worker insurance schemes, and worker communication. |\n| Occupational safety          | 51%                         | 65%                         | Nonconformances related primarily to current safety permits and first aid response reporting. Suppliers must have tracking mechanisms and keep documentation of remediation and compensation provided to workers involved in an incident. A supplier with a nonconformance must also prove that training has been conducted, or will be conducted within 180 days. |\n| Dormitory and canteen        | 74%                         | 70%                         | Workers must be provided ready access to clean toilet facilities, potable water, and sanitary food preparation, storage, and eating facilities; dormitories provided by the supplier or a labor agent must be clean and safe. Corrective actions in this area are typically straightforward, such as ensuring exit signs are properly illuminated, maintaining fire extinguishers, and having food samples available for quality and safety testing. |\n| Hazardous substances         | 72%                         | 74%                         | Suppliers must properly label and store all hazardous substances in their facilities. Corrective actions may include development of inventory management systems, maintaining a list of approved chemicals, use of auditor-verified vendors, and education on legal restrictions related to material use. During 2021, we continued to work directly with suppliers that had nonconformances in this area to help them fully understand our requirements and resolve the issues. We also committed to the Toward Zero Exposure program in collaboration with the Clean Electronics Production Network, which takes collective action to protect workers in our global supply chain from exposure to hazardous process chemicals. See Process chemicals. |\n\n* Data is from initial audits and full re-audits of production suppliers conducted in 2019 and 2021. Due to our two-year audit cycle and changes to HP\u2019s supplier base, data typically does not represent the same supplier sites as the previous cycle. ** Percentage of sites with no immediate priority findings, non-immediate priority nonconformances, or major nonconformances identified. *** The HP KPI program measures the performance of HP production lines at participating supplier facilities, and not the overall performance of those facilities. In contrast, initial audits and full re-audits assess the overall performance of supplier facilities where other brands in addition to HP may also manufacture products.\n### Rates of conformance of

This method normalizes performance based on business productivity. Intensity is reported as a three-year rolling average to decrease the impact of variance year over year and highlight longer-term trends. Production supplier GHG emissions include Scope 1 and Scope 2. The year 2020 is the most recent for which data is available.\n\nWe believe that variation in this data reflects both changes in actual performance and inconsistency in reporting practices.\n\n***Emissions are calculated based on suppliers\u2019 reported emissions and their dollar volume of HP\u2019s business compared to their total revenue. The majority of these companies report on a calendar-year basis. Data reported here reflects extrapolation to 100% of first-tier production suppliers. Data collected for 2020 represented 96% of HP production spend. The World Resources Institute defines Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions in its Greenhouse Gas Protocol. This data differs from the product LCA-based estimates for materials extraction through manufacturing presented on page 18, which are based on a different calculation methodology and use a combination of HP-specific and industry data. The year 2020 is the most recent for which data is available.\n\n****Suppliers may not report all Scope 3 categories. The number of categories reported by suppliers and the completeness of reporting varies year to year.\n\n\u2020The figures for product transportation GHG emissions are based on data reported by product transportation suppliers that HP contracted to deliver products. They may differ from the product LCA-based estimates presented on page 18, which are based on a different calculation methodology, use a combination of HP-specific and industry data, and include additional upstream and downstream transportation related to the company\u2019s products.\n\n\u2020\u20202019 and 2020 data for the \u201cRoad (includes rail)\u201d segment were restated to reflect more accurate data from a single product transportation supplier.\n\n\u2020\u2020\u2020Total energy includes purchased energy (electricity, etc.) and generated energy (fuel use, etc.). Energy use data is calculated based on suppliers\u2019 reported energy use and their dollar volume of HP\u2019s business compared to their total revenue. Data reported here reflects extrapolation to 100% of first-tier production suppliers. Data collected for 2020 represented 95% of HP production spend.\n\n\u2020\u2020\u2021This metric reports the amount of water withdrawn by suppliers, not the amount consumed by our multi-tier supply chain as reported in our water footprint on page 19. Because water withdrawn can also be returned, this footprint is inherently larger. Refers to first-tier suppliers for manufacturing, materials, and components. Withdrawal is estimated based on suppliers\u2019 reported water withdrawal and their dollar volume of HP business compared to their total revenue. The majority of these companies report on a calendar-year basis. The year 2020 is the most recent for which data is available. Data reported here reflects extrapolation to 100% of first-tier production suppliers. Data collected for 2020 represented 92% of HP production spend.\n\n\u2020\u2020\u00a7Data is estimated based on suppliers\u2019 waste data and their dollar volume of HP\u2019s business compared to their total revenue.

We are committed to fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace that attracts, retains, and advances exceptional talent. Through ongoing employee development, comprehensive compensation and benefits, and a focus on health, safety, and employee wellbeing, we strive to support our employees in all aspects of their lives so they can do their best work\u2014while learning, growing, and feeling engaged.\n\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion\n\nAt HP, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) is a business imperative. Our employees are driven by it, customers call for it, investors expect it, and our reputation is impacted by it. Our commitment extends beyond our employees to our relationships with suppliers, partners, and communities worldwide. DEI has been part of our DNA since the beginning, and it is critical to our future. Our DEI strategy focuses on where we can make the greatest impact across our culture, our people, and our communities.\n\nInnovation at HP comes from the diverse perspectives, backgrounds, knowledge, and experiences of our employees. Our vision is a workplace that is globally connected and drives a responsive culture of belonging that fosters courageous conversations and welcomes ideas from any source. We strive to create an inclusive environment where people can be their authentic selves at work and reach their full potential.\n\nOur goal is to be universally ranked as an employer of choice for underrepresented groups in the technology industry by 2030, and we are determining how to best measure progress. In 2021, 44.9% of our U.S. hires were racial/ethnic minorities, and we continue to work on removing barriers for employees from underrepresented groups by working to remove bias, and by creating world-class programs and training, growth, and development opportunities. Our integrated strategy, embedded deeply into our culture of inclusion and belonging, enables us to attract, retain, promote, and grow top talent.\n\nDEI is a source of strategic business value. Research by McKinsey has consistently shown a correlation between companies with diverse executive teams and the likelihood of financial outperformance\u2014and this relationship has only strengthened over time.\u00b9\n\nSee detailed employee demographics data and HP\u2019s 2021 EEO-1 Report.\n\nHP demographics*\n\n| Category                                      | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|----------------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Board of Directors                           |      |      |      |\n| Women                                        | 42%  | 45%  | 46%  |\n| Racial/ethnic minorities                     | 58%  | 45%  | 46%  |\n| Women in leadership                          |      |      |      |\n| Executives reporting directly to the CEO     | 23%  | 25%  | 25%  |\n| Director level and above                     | 31%  | 32%  | 33%  |\n| Technical roles                              |      |      |      |\n| Women in IT and engineering                  | 22%  | 22%  | 23%  |\n| U.S. racial/ethnic minorities in IT and engineering | 28%  | 31%  | 33%  |\n| Revenue-generating roles                     |      |      |      |\n| Women in sales roles (all levels)            | 28%  | 29%  | 28%  |\n| U.S. racial/ethnic minorities in sales roles (all levels) | 19%  | 20%  | 21%  |\n\n\u00b9 Board of Directors data for 2021 is as of the conclusion of the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders on April 19, 2022.

HP\u2019s Board of Directors is one of the most diverse of any U.S. technology company, comprising 46% racial/ethnic minorities and 46% women.\n\nOur Board of Directors/Executive Leadership reverse mentorship program helps us capitalize on the advantages of a strong and diverse Board of Directors. Through this program, each board member is paired with a member of our executive leadership team to gain in-depth knowledge of HP\u2019s business, programs, and best practices to positively impact our culture, people, and communities.\n\nOur DEI policies and practices are the foundation for a positive and innovative culture of belonging. The HP Global Best Work Environment Policy supports our efforts and includes the Global Harassment-Free Work Environment Policy, Global Non-Discrimination Policy, and Open Door Policy.\n\nBoard of Directors. Through this program, each board member is paired with a member of our executive leadership team to gain in-depth knowledge of HP\u2019s business, programs, and best practices to positively impact our culture, people, and communities.\n\n2030 GOALS\n\nAchieve 50/50 gender equality in HP leadership\n\nPROGRESS IN 2021\n\nWomen represented\n\n32.5%\nof director-level and above positions globally\n(as of October 31, 2021)\n\nAchieve greater than 30% technical women and women in engineering by 2030\n\nPROGRESS IN 2021\n\nWomen represented\n\n22.7%\nof engineering and technology positions globally (as of October 31, 2021)\n\nMeet or exceed labor market representation for racial/ethnic minorities in the United States by 2030\n\nPROGRESS IN 2021\n\nResearch labor market data to determine benchmarks and baselines (in process)\n\nNon-Discrimination Policy, and Open Door Policy.\n\nHP\u2019s Chief Diversity Officer oversees the company\u2019s global DEI strategy, Racial Equality and Social Justice Task Force, Business Impact Networks (BiNs), targeted equity programs, and partnerships to increase our diverse talent pipeline. Working closely with executives and business leaders, the DEI team focuses on aligning DEI to business goals, representing workplace needs.\n\nHP RACIAL EQUALITY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE TASK FORCE\n\nIn 2020, we formed HP\u2019s Racial Equality and Social Justice Task Force, which works to identify and execute on, and hold us accountable on, the biggest opportunities we have as a company to drive sustainable impact in racial equality by working across three main areas:\n\n- People: We will accelerate the strategies, practices, and policies around our pipeline, retention, and promotion of Black/African American talent.\n- Industry: We will leverage our industry leadership and spending power to influence our ecosystem, including our partners, vendors, and suppliers.\n- Local and national: We will advocate for equitable treatment of Black/African American people through public policy, civic action, and clear corporate positions on local and national issues.\n\nThe Task Force is dedicated to achieving its goals by providing the foundation, framework, vision, and guidance for nearly 300 volunteers to help solve some of our communities\u2019 most difficult issues on race. View progress on our stated objectives on the Task Force website. The work and outcomes of the Task Force have been accelerated by our leaders, who have committed to annual objectives aligned to hiring more diverse talent, specifically Black/African American talent.\n\nBeyond the Task Force, volunteers are driving progress in their local communities by focusing on local equality and social justice issues through initiatives such as the Ernie Thorne Scholarship of St. Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire.\n\nMaintain higher than 90% rating on internal inclusion index for all employee demographics annually\n\nPROGRESS IN 2021\n\nAchieved a rating of\n\n87%\n\ncompared with 89% in 2020\n\nDouble the number of Black/African American executives by 2025, from a 2020 baseline\n\nPROGRESS IN 2021\n\nIncreased by\n\n33%\n\ncompared with 2020, about one-third of the way to achieving the goal\n\nDouble Black/African American technical representation in the United States by 2025 (2020 baseline)\n\nPROGRESS IN 2021\n\nIncreased Black/African American technical representation in the United States from 2.3% to\n\n2.6%\nsupporting marketplace opportunities, and driving global accountability for progress and outcomes.\n\nTo ensure leadership embeds a strong focus on DEI, each member of our executive leadership team has individual performance goals under the Management by Objectives program tied to DEI. Our executive leadership team members are evaluated on their actions to advance DEI.\n\nHP\u2019s BINs illustrate our DEI strategy in practice. We have 130 BINs in 37 countries, up from 118 in 2020. Our BINs are open to all employees and represent: Black/African American, Disabilities, Hispanic/Latin American, LGBTQ+, Multicultural, Multigenerational, Veterans, and Women. In addition to leading community outreach programs, BINs promote diversity in pipeline development, local hiring, talent programs, and mentoring. They also implement campaigns such as Black History Month, International Women\u2019s Week, ALLIES@HP, PRIDE Month, and workshops for LGBTQ+ allies.\n\n**Belong, Innovate, and Grow**\n\nOur Belong, Innovate, and Grow strategy continues to drive our culture, embedding DEI across all parts of our businesses and functions, including recruitment, talent and learning culture, mentoring, training, and events. In our annual employee engagement survey, employee feeling that HP values diversity was highly rated, at 94%. Our Inclusion Index reported that 87% of employees experience an inclusive work environment at HP.\n\n### Employee survey results*\n\n**Diversity and inclusion**\n\n|                      | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|----------------------|------|------|------|\n| I feel HP values diversity | 92%  | 95%  | 94%  |\n| I can be myself at work | 85%  | 88%  | 87%  |\n\n*Data refers to the percentage of HP 2019, 2020, and 2021 Voice Insight Action (VIA) employee survey respondents who strongly agreed or agreed with each statement.\n\nIn February 2020, our CEO Enrique Lores took the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion pledge on behalf of HP to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. He also joined the governing committee of CEO Action for Racial Equity, a new fellowship that provides the opportunity for signatories to advance racial equity through public policy.\n\n### People\n\nAs we continue to operationalize and integrate DEI in all parts of HP, our people will more closely reflect our communities globally.\n\nWe are committed to continuing to improve representation of women at HP, with a focus on management. HP is among the top technology companies for women in leadership positions, with women in 32.5% of the company\u2019s director-level and above positions, up from 32% in 2020.\n\nAs of the end of 2021, HP had 10 Distinguished Technologists/Strategists who are women.\n\nAs of 2021, 89% of participants in HP Catalyst (our 12-month emerging leaders\u2019 program) were women, with an overall retention rate of 76%. 38% of participants since 2017 were subsequently promoted or accepted a new role internally. See Employee development. This program is complemented by women\u2019s leadership initiatives such as Disha, a six-month program in India; the Talent Development Program and Women in Leadership Lab in Mexico; the annual women\u2019s leadership conference in the United States; and WOLFPack, an eight-month women\u2019s development program in Costa Rica.\n\nTo address the systemic barriers that exist to diverse representation in leadership and the importance of sponsorship in career development, we have increased our investment in the development of Black/African American leaders. For example, we expanded our Catalyst development program in 2021 to include an additional cohort focused on Black/African American employees in the United States.\n\nOur partnership with the Information Technology Senior Management Forum (ITSMF) continues to train and develop Black/African American and diverse IT leaders through ITSMF\u2019s Management Academy. Through 2021, we sponsored a 100% increase in HP employees in this program, and 50% of graduates have been promoted to management at HP or moved into new or expanded roles. Thirty-three HP leaders are attending the 2021 McKinsey Black, Asian, and Hispanic/Latin American Connected Leader Academies, which hone executive and management leadership capabilities through expert-led virtual and small group discussions.\n\nDuring 2021, 61% of our U.S. hires overall were from underrepresented groups, including women, racial/ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, and military veterans. In 2016, HP committed to hiring 150 veterans or military spouses over the course of five years. Through 2021, HP hired 283 veterans. Our culture of diversity and community allows us to retain, develop, and promote the best talent.\n\nRecognizing that traditional hiring practices can screen out qualified and talented applicants with autism, in 2019 we launched our Spectrum Success program partnership with Vocational Rehabilitation and PROVAIL, focusing on recruitment, hiring, and retention. Of the 23 program candidates through 2021, nine were offered internships. Watch video.\n\nAs part of our efforts to attract and retain people with disabilities, participants in our China HOPE (HP Opportunity and Equality) and Japan\u2019s Internal Service Center programs spend half of their time at HP learning business skills. Through the end of 2021, all HOPE participants had become full-time hires. In India, we work with colleges to identify candidates for our Eklavya program, which offers interns on-the-job training and coaches employees in interacting and communicating with people with disabilities. In Brazil, our disAbilities\nImpact Network focuses on education and awareness at the site and in the community, including connecting with a local nonprofit to provide screen readers to the visually impaired.\n\nIn our communities\n\nWe also strive to advance DEI in the communities where we live and work. We continue to engage with leading industry organizations and conferences that promote women and minority, veteran, and LGBTQ+ representation in technology. This includes the National HBCU Business Deans Roundtable, National Society of Black Engineers, Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, National Association of Multicultural Engineering Program Advocates Inc., Society of Women Engineers, and European Women in Tech.\n\nWe support the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s Business Coalition for the Equality Act, related to LGBTQ+ workplace rights, as well as the UN Human Rights Office Standards of Conduct for Business.\n\nHP works to inspire more women and people from minorities to consider STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) education and careers. For example, we continue our collaboration with UN Women and our partnerships with organizations such as Girl Rising, Girls Who Code, blackcomputeHER, Black Girls Code, and the YWCA\u2019s Curated Pathways to Innovation.\n\nWe partner with historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) to increase the representation of Black/African American engineers in the high-tech workforce. The annual HP HBCU Business Challenge, in partnership with the National HBCU Business Deans Roundtable, tasks students with tackling critical business problems while gaining valuable industry experience. The 2021 event focused on immersive technologies, and students were asked to use virtual reality technology to create a new service or solution. Sixteen schools participated, including the winning team from South Carolina State University.\n\nIn 2021, HP launched the HBCU Technology Conference and partnered with Microsoft on a Bot-a-thon as part of the Future of Work Academy. More than 1,200 students and staff from 70 HBCUs joined the virtual conference and over 150 students from 29 HBCUs participated in the Bot-a-thon, which was focused on developing automation use-cases to improve the student experience at their own institutions.\n\nWe prioritize DEI within our supply chain, and encourage our suppliers and business partners to do the same. See Supplier diversity for more detail.\n\nEmployee engagement\n\nListening and communication drive our engagement approach across three focus areas:\n\n- Develop our people: Support digital literacy and personal growth, and recruit, retain, and develop key talent.\n- Strengthen our culture: Building on our values, drive a customer-first culture, promote key leadership behaviors, and provide a great onboarding experience.\n- Shape the employee experience: Deliver a people-centered, consistent, HP Way-aligned employee experience that supports our mobility, digital transformation, and customer-focused initiatives.\n\nWe regularly collect feedback from employees to better understand and improve their experiences and identify opportunities to continually strengthen our culture. In 2021, 95% of employees participated in our annual VIA employee engagement survey.\n\nHP has maintained employee engagement throughout the pandemic. Overall, 81% of participants had a favorable view of the employee experience in 2021, compared to 82% in 2020. HP continues to be certified as a Great Place to Work, with our rating remaining constant in 2021 compared to the prior year. See also Recognition.\n\nEmployee survey results*\n\n| Sustainable Impact | percentage of employees |\n|--------------------|-------------------------|\n| 2019               | 80%                     |\n| 2020               | 90%                     |\n| 2021               | 100%                    |\n\n* Data refers to the percentage of employee survey respondents who strongly agreed or agreed with the statement (2019 VIA and 2020-2021 Quick Clicks).\n\n2021 VOICE INSIGHT ACTION SURVEY OF HP EMPLOYEES\n\nHighlights:\n\n- 85% are excited about the future of HP (up five percentage points from 2020).\n- 84% believe that HP actively supports their learning and development (up one percentage point).\n- 87% receive feedback throughout the year that supports performance improvement (up two percentage points).\nEmployee development\n\nHuman capital development underpins our efforts to transform and grow HP. Our employees\u2019 talent, diversity, and drive fuel HP, and we prioritize investment in career growth. We are passionate about supporting an inclusive culture and practicing a growth mindset to unlock business innovation and opportunities. Our ongoing success depends on enabling our diverse workforce of skilled employees and maintaining robust leadership pipelines. We believe that a strong professional development program provides employees with the opportunity to build world-leading expertise, while enabling HP to meet emerging customer needs.\n\nPersonalized development and career pathways\n\nWe encourage continuous learning to help support career development. Employees have access to a wide range of development opportunities, including virtual, social, self-directed, mentoring, coaching, face-to-face (when safely permissible) and external programs. We offer a variety of collaborative learning experiences, connection to a network of subject matter experts, and a social learning platform that enables employees to integrate development into their daily routines.\n\nIn 2021, approximately 99% of employees participated in learning and development, and on average, spent an estimated 34 hours participating in these activities during the year.\n\nThe 2021 VIA survey highlighted that 84% of employees feel that HP actively supports their learning and development. It also showed that 79% of employees believe their career goals can be met at HP. During the year, 35% of job vacancies were filled internally.\n\nWe equip managers to support and coach their teams, and in 2021, we launched a new talent development approach to help all people managers create personalized development plans for each team member. These plans focus on skill advancement, new experiential opportunities, and readiness for future roles.\n\nHP\u2019s Power Your Possible platform helps employees identify learning that will support their career plans, while the HP Degree Assistance Program provides funding to more than 500 employees worldwide each year, investing in their careers through higher education. To complement our development portfolios, we also provide opportunities to attend conferences and seminars, and acquire professional memberships, accreditation, and certifications.\n\nLeadership development and talent\n\nWe have a rich leadership curriculum, designed for managers at all organizational levels. Leadership programs provide self-directed learning, coaching, and experiential workshops enabling shared learning and networking. The New Manager Journey, a 12-month virtual program, is delivered to all newly appointed people managers. We have also created the Senior Leader Meeting Connect program to develop global business leadership insights and support learning from external best practices. In addition, we continue to improve our diversity hiring practices.\n\nOur executive leadership team places particular focus on developing the executive leadership pipeline through targeted talent strategies, including external assessments of leadership candidates, executive coaching, job rotations, and experiential leadership development assignments.\n\nWe also invest in emerging and underrepresented leadership talent through formal programs, mentoring, and sponsorship. Our programs focus on team development, new business models, and opportunities to deepen inclusion and growth mindset practices. In 2021, 259 leaders participated in the HP Fast Forward and Catalyst programs. These 12-month experiences strengthen leadership capabilities through monthly peer mentoring, coaching, and guidance from senior sponsors. HP also sponsored leaders to participate in external development programs, such as the ITSMF and the McKinsey Black Leadership Academy.\n\nTechnology and digital skills\n\nWe invest in technical and digital skill capabilities across HP to fuel our future productivity, product development, and technology innovation strategies, in support of our company\u2019s transformation strategy.\n\nIn 2021, we continued our focus on HP\u2019s digital literacy campaign, Speak Digital, to increase employees\u2019 knowledge of digital technologies and emerging trends in customer experience and innovation. This included delivering the HP Digital Explorer series, which aims to deepen insights about how to apply digital skills in process and product design. We also launched programs designed to increase knowledge of data analytics and robotic process automation.\n\nHP has more than 18,000 technical employees who work across a wide range of digital, information, and physical sciences. We support their continuous development, including through HP\u2019s Affinity Groups and Virtual Communities (AGVC) platform, which connects technologists according to technical capabilities and common interests. Across over 30 communities and a range of topics, the AGVC platform provides classroom and virtual learning, practical projects, and opportunities to solve business challenges.\nWe also deliver career growth guidance through the Technical Career Path and Engineering Program Management Career Path, which include mentoring and leadership opportunities.\n\nIn the digital era, we have retained and expanded the HP concept of the \u201cnext bench\u201d\u2014close collaboration with neighboring colleagues\u2014to engage with and respect ideas from colleagues across the business. Find out more in The Evolving Way (page 88). We have also developed a model for creating technical communities across HP that will help us meet the demands of cyber-physical systems. Learn more.\n\nPerformance management and feedback\n\nHP has a strong feedback-based culture and approach to performance management, with 99% of eligible employees receiving annual multidimensional and objective-based performance evaluations. Employees participate in regular feedback and development planning conversations with their managers, and the 2021 VIA survey highlighted that 87% of employees believe they receive feedback throughout the year that enables them to improve their performance.\n\nCompensation and benefits\n\nHP offers a comprehensive Total Rewards package that is both performance based and market competitive. Total Rewards includes salaries, bonuses, incentive programs, and a range of benefits designed to meet our employees\u2019 diverse needs while enhancing their wellbeing and that of their families.\n\nValuing and rewarding employees drives higher engagement and better performance and helps us attract and retain top talent. Compensation and benefits are reviewed periodically for market competitiveness.\n\nOur global wellness program is designed to enhance physical health, financial wellness, and life balance for all of our employees around the world. Other benefit programs vary by country to reflect local market practice and employee needs. Depending on location, these may include:\n\n- Retirement and savings plans\n- Healthcare benefits\n- Insurance protections (e.g., life and disability)\n- Time-off programs (vacation, holidays, parental leaves, injury/illness, etc.)\n- Discount programs\n- Flexible work arrangements\n- Stock purchase plan\n- Other benefits\n\nPay equity\n\nWe believe people should be paid equitably for what they do and how they do it, regardless of their gender, race, or other personal characteristics. To deliver on that commitment, we benchmark and set pay ranges based on relevant market data, and consider factors such as an employee\u2019s role, experience, and performance. We also regularly review our compensation practices, in terms of both our overall workforce and our individual employees, to make sure our pay is fair and equitable.\n\nFor the past five years, HP has reviewed employees\u2019 compensation with the support of independent third-party experts to ensure consistent pay practices.\n\nHP expanded its annual pay equity assessment in fiscal year 2021\u2014evaluating the nine countries with our largest employee populations, which represent 72% of our global workforce. The independent analysis determined there were no systemic issues. Any areas of potential concern, considering what we would expect employees to be paid when evaluating their skills, qualifications, and experience, were reviewed and addressed as part of our off-cycle compensation process.\n\nExecutive compensation\n\nThe HR and Compensation Committee discharges the HP Board of Directors\u2019 responsibilities related to the compensation of our executives and directors and provides general oversight of our compensation structure, including our equity compensation plans and benefits programs. See page 26 of the HP 2022 Proxy Statement for detail.\n\nIn accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules, we recently reported our CEO pay ratio for FY21. Our CEO\u2019s annual total compensation for FY21 was US$20,733,806. Our median employee\u2019s annual total compensation was US$67,667, resulting in a CEO pay ratio of 306:1. For more detail, see page 71 of the HP 2022 Proxy Statement.\n\nHealth and safety\n\nWe strive to keep our employees safe and healthy so they can do their best work. Our environmental, health, and safety (EHS) leadership team uses our global injury and illness reporting system to assess worldwide and regional trends as a part of quarterly reviews. We have internal targets to keep lost workday case rates below 0.5 and recordable incidence rates under 1.0 (see definitions of these rates), and our managers assess progress against those targets annually. Supervisors of employees injured at work are required to complete injury and illness\nThroughout the pandemic, a top priority of HP\u2019s has been the health, safety, and wellbeing of employees and their families. Our cross-functional COVID-19 program management office meets regularly to review the latest data from HP business and site leaders, identify and address emerging risks, and formulate HP\u2019s response to actions taken by governments and public policy organizations. We\u2019ve put in place global policies and protocols based on guidance from healthcare experts and public health leaders, and regularly review and update them to reflect the best, most current information available.\n\nSee more information about our EHS management system.\n\nSee Data.\n\nWellbeing\n\nThe physical health, financial wellbeing, and life balance of our employees is vital to HP\u2019s success. In 2021, we continued to deliver programs that focused on the needs of our workforce during the unprecedented challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThrough our wellbeing vendors and in conjunction with HP Spirit, we offered an array of programs, activities, and virtual gatherings, as well as enhanced benefits and resources to support wellbeing. These included sessions that focused on understanding biometric markers and the impact of sugar on our diet, and ongoing virtual office hours with our medical director and other doctors providing validated COVID-19 information.\n\nOur Well Beyond wellbeing program continued to encourage healthy behaviors through regular communications, voluntary progress tracking through the Virgin Pulse app, fun challenges, and incentives. Depending on location, U.S. employees and spouses/domestic partners can each receive incentives of up to US$550 a year for activities such as completing a wellness assessment and tracking healthy activities. As of October 2021, 78% of eligible employees in the United States, and 59% worldwide, had enrolled in the Well Beyond program.\n\nPhysical health\n\n- As part of our Global Wellness Challenge (GWC) held in April and May, 61% of our employees, including 79% of our U.S. workforce, enrolled in the Virgin Pulse platform, through which we provide access to digital coaching and a wide range of health and wellbeing content.\n- During the GWC, we recorded 6.7 billion employee steps through our Well Beyond platform, equivalent to nearly 10,200 daily steps per participant.\n\nFinancial wellness\n\n- Nearly 3,000 employees in the United States participated in our Save Beyond financial wellness month activities. During August 2021, employees attended weekly question and answer sessions with investment experts from Fidelity more than 1,300 times.\n\nLife balance\n\n- We built on our 2020 \u201cTake Time for You\u201d campaign to integrate mental health into all aspects of our wellbeing programming. We also hosted a webinar during Mental Health Awareness Month and launched a mental health-focused e-newsletter to spotlight our resources in this area.\n- Recognizing employees\u2019 continued caregiving challenges, we offered webinars on resiliency and parenting, along with small group coaching for more individualized support.\nOur facilities\n\nAt our 150 sites in 59 countries around the world, we are taking action to reduce our GHG emissions, energy and water withdrawal, and waste generation. While GHG emissions associated with HP\u2019s operations represent just 1% of our overall carbon footprint, this is the area where we have the greatest control and influence, and therefore the greatest ability to make immediate impact. During 2021, we reduced our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions 7% compared to 2020. By modeling sustainable operations, we also demonstrate our values in action, and highlight industry-leading practices as an example to employees, customers, suppliers, visitors, and others.\n\nEnvironmental, health, and safety management\n\nHP owns and leases facilities around the world. Our EHS Policy (now also available in Chinese and Korean) and EHS management system (which apply to all HP employees and contractors and all operational sites) help us to manage our environmental impact, improve worker safety, verify progress toward our goals and adherence to internal standards, and document compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. We investigate all allegations that our facilities are failing to comply with applicable laws and take corrective action when needed.\n\nEvery year, we perform risk assessments at all of our chemical-intensive and manufacturing sites. In 2021, we conducted on-site audits wherever possible. Where the pandemic prevented in-person visits, we conducted remote audits or postponed them until 2022. Management reviews the findings of all audits, and any deficiencies are identified and action plans are developed.\n\nWhen feasible, we pursue environmental management and green building certifications at HP-owned and leased facilities worldwide. As of the end of 2021, 22 facilities, including all HP manufacturing sites, were certified to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001:2015 (the most recent version), with 17 as part of our global ISO 14001 certificate. Thirteen facilities, including 57% of HP manufacturing sites, were certified to ISO 45001:2018 for occupational health and safety.\n\nAs of October 31, 2021:\n\n- Fifteen sites globally had achieved Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED\u00ae) certifications for buildings, including 12 at the Gold or above level.\n- Three sites had achieved BREEAM certifications for building, including one at the Excellent level.\n- Two locations had achieved SITES certification for sustainable landscape.\n- One site had achieved TRUE certification for waste diversion.\n\nAll new build-outs target the LEED v4 Gold Standard and/or a local equivalent (such as BREEAM). In support of these objectives, HP has developed the HP Green and Smart Construction Playbook for project managers, which provides guidance on key principles such as energy use, indoor air quality, water withdrawal, and waste recycling. We also factor environmental considerations into decisions to lease new sites, asking prospective landlords, through the HP Energy and Sustainability Survey, about features such as LEED certification, renewable energy, electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, and water efficiency.\n\nSites use our HP EcoChampions Playbook to support training and engagement on sustainable operations. The Playbook includes modules with step-by-step guidelines in areas such as energy and water efficiency and waste reduction.\n\nTo drive improvement in health and safety, our EHS management system aligns with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Z10 standard and the ISO 14001 standard. We hire and train safety professionals to implement procedures for reviewing new and ongoing workplace health and safety hazards, and incorporate newly identified hazards periodically into our EHS management system.\n\nSupervisors are required to ensure that all HP work-related health and safety incidents are investigated and issues addressed. When an injury occurs, we identify the root cause and implement solutions to address it. Employees receive guidance to identify and report hazards, and channels exist for them to report hazards outside of their immediate control, for action by facility teams. We ensure our employees feel able to remove themselves from situations they believe are unsafe.\n\nTo continually develop our global EHS management system, we engage with and seek input from safety professionals, management teams, and partners across HP. All locations must proactively implement company-wide health and safety standards. These specify that any new equipment and chemicals, along with any changes to the work environment, are reviewed for safety and environmental issues, and any issues addressed accordingly.\n\nABOUT OUR OPERATIONAL DATA\n\nAll environmental data reported in this section refers to HP operations through October 31, 2021. At that time, we owned or leased 150 sites in 59 countries. From invoices and other documents, HP directly tracked data for 2021 representing 95% of total electricity use, 90% of total natural gas use, 92% of total water withdrawal, 90% of nonhazardous waste, and 100% of total hazardous waste.\nAll HP facilities have assigned technical EHS personnel, and our global EHS team provides guidance and oversight. Joint management worker health and safety committees exist in some locations, and we regularly discuss relevant policies, processes, and regulatory compliance with employees.\n\nIn 2021, more than 1,690 employees and agency contractors took part in 107 instructor-led courses, and over 42,000 web-based EHS training courses were completed. Our training includes information about general workplace issues, as well as targeted information for specific roles.\n\nPromoting a culture of environmental responsibility\n\nOur employees worldwide make a vital contribution to improving our environmental performance, and employee engagement initiatives enable HP\u2019s global workforce to directly support our Sustainable Impact goals and vision. For example, during 2021:\n\n- October EcoChallenge with Ecochallenge.org: More than 1,000 HP employees from 85 teams and 44 countries took part in this three-week personal sustainability challenge, with four HP sites earning top-10 spots.\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions\n\nMost of our GHG emissions from operations are related to the energy used to power our facilities. To save money, drive progress toward our goals, and reduce our climate impacts, we:\n\n- Aggressively reduce energy consumption through optimization and efficiency projects.\n- Increase on-site generation of renewable power.\n- Procure off-site renewable power, including renewable energy credits (RECs), utility supplier green power options, and power purchase agreements (PPAs).\n\nOur global operations produced 159,500 tonnes of Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO\u2082e emissions during 2021. This 7% decrease compared to 2020 drives progress toward our goal of reaching carbon neutrality in HP operations by 2025.\n\nGHG emissions intensity equaled 2.5 tonnes of CO\u2082e per million U.S. dollars of net revenue in 2021, a 17% reduction from 2020. HP operations consumed more energy in 2021 than in 2020 due to partial site re-occupancy and increased activity at manufacturing locations. However, we still achieved a 7% year-over-year reduction in absolute GHG emissions due to reduced fleet usage and increased purchases of renewable electricity and attributes. Prior to the partial site re-occupancy, we maintained our broadened temperature set points, reduced lighting schedules, and manually shut off equipment where it was not required. Later in the year, we also implemented multiple capital-funded energy-conservation projects. Learn more.\n\nSee our full carbon footprint for 2019-2021, HP Carbon accounting manual, and HP CDP Climate Change response.\n\nEnergy efficiency\n\nEnergy use is a significant operating expense for HP and the main driver of our climate impact from operations. Our operations consumed 697,058 MWh of energy in 2021. Excluding energy from our transportation fleet (which HP did not report prior to 2021), energy use in operations increased by 3% compared with 2020, due to partial site re-occupancy and increased activity at our manufacturing sites. Global electricity use...\nincreased by 2% during that period. Excluding energy use from our transportation fleet, energy intensity decreased 8% in 2021 compared with 2020.\n\nPrior to the partial site re-occupancy, our non-critical buildings were closed due to COVID-19, and access restrictions prevented us from implementing capital-funded energy-conservation projects. During that closure, our facility teams ensured these buildings were set for unoccupancy by maintaining our broadened temperature set points upon reoccupation.\n\nLearn more about how we are reducing GHG emissions across our value chain in Supply chain responsibility: Environmental impact and Products and solutions.\n\nLater in 2021, we implemented several capital-funded energy-conservation projects, which included chiller plant optimization, LED lighting upgrades, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) upgrades, air conditioning (HVAC) system replacements, site retro-commissioning, and installation of upgraded controllers for a large site compressed air system. We also confirmed that sites were compliant with the HP occupied temperature set points upon reoccupation.\n\nRenewable energy\n\nBy 2025, we aim to use 100% renewable electricity to power our global operations. In 2021, we procured and generated 264,054 MWh of renewable electricity globally (83.4% wind, 5.0% solar, 9.5% hydro, and 2.1% unknown). Renewables accounted for 54% of our global electricity consumption, compared to 51% in 2020. Sources of renewable electricity in 2021 included RECs, GOs (guarantees of origin), and I-RECs (international RECs) (87.3%), direct purchases (11.2%), and renewable energy generated on-site and on-site PPAs (1.5%).\n\nThrough these purchases, we once again achieved our objective to use 100% renewable electricity in the United States and helped to advance the global market for renewables.\n\nBuilding on previous renewable energy initiatives, such as the solar-covered roof at our Palo Alto headquarters, in 2021 we signed a large on-site solar PPA for our Barcelona, Spain, facility. This will provide approximately 2,174 MWh per year, equivalent to 12.2% of the site\u2019s annual electricity use. HP also signed an on-site solar PPA during 2021 to provide parking canopies at a site in Singapore.\n\nAuto fleet, business travel, and commuting\n\nOur goal is to reduce GHG emissions from HP-owned or leased auto fleet vehicles by 25% by 2025, compared to 2015. During 2021, our company fleet accounted for 20,100 tonnes of CO\u2082e emissions, down 16% compared to 2020 and 39% less than in 2015. By 2030, our goal is to achieve a 100% EV company fleet. We started our first EV fleet pilots in the Netherlands in October 2020 and Belgium in January 2021, and introduced a hybrid as our default fleet vehicle in the United States. By the end of 2021, 2% of our fleet was EVs and 12% was hybrid vehicles.\n\nTo decrease emissions associated with business travel, we provide employees with low-impact travel choices through collaboration with travel providers, planning tools, and transportation alternatives. In 2021, we joined the Eco-Skies Alliance program to support the use of sustainable aviation fuel.\n\nWe have committed to installing EV infrastructure at all feasible sites worldwide by 2030. In 2021, we offered EV infrastructure at 45% of 86 target sites, including 18 new charging stations installed during the year. Wherever feasible, we require new building constructions and leases to include EV infrastructure.\n\nSee data related to business travel and employee commuting.\nWater\n\nWater withdrawal associated with our operations makes up 2% of our total water footprint. This is roughly evenly split between direct withdrawal as described in this section (mainly for use in buildings, cooling, landscaping, and production of high-purity water for manufacturing) and indirect withdrawal associated with generation of the electricity we use in our facilities.\n\nIn 2021, we withdrew 2,556,000 cubic meters of water overall, 2% less than in 2020. This decrease was primarily due to the discovery and repair of a chronically leaking main pipe at our Barcelona, Spain, site in 2020. Water withdrawal intensity per million U.S. dollars of net revenue decreased by 12% between 2020 and 2021.\n\nTo decrease and recycle water used at our facilities, we employ capital practices, sustainable landscaping, infrastructure upgrades, leak monitoring and detection, and greywater reuse. At some locations, we also reduce our dependency on potable water by utilizing alternative sources, including rainwater and reclaimed water.\n\nWe use the World Resources Institute Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas tool to assess the risk of sites and prioritize reductions in water-stressed locations. Using this tool, we assessed 171 HP facilities as part of our risk modeling for 2021. Fifty of the facilities assessed (29% of the total) fall within the high-risk category for water stress. Those locations withdrew 245,000 cubic meters of water during 2021, 9% of our global total and down 17% from the prior year.\n\nHP recycled or reused 310,000 cubic meters of water globally during 2021 for landscaping, indoor plumbing fixtures, and as process water. This was equivalent to 11% of total water withdrawal. The company also captured and used 1,000 cubic meters of rainwater for cooling towers during the year.\n\n2025 GOAL\nReduce potable water withdrawal in global operations by 35% by 2025, compared to 2015, focusing on high-risk sites\n\nPROGRESS IN 2021\nHP withdrew 2,245,000 cubic meters of potable water across global operations in 2021, less than in 2015, and focused reduction efforts on high-risk sites (see water-saving projects completed during 2021, at right)\n\n30%\n\nWastewater\n\nWastewater is not a significant environmental risk at HP\u2019s operations. Our imaging and printing product manufacturing facilities generate process effluents that are pre-treated, strictly monitored, and discharged under government-issued permits. We implement procedures to prevent unauthorized discharges of chemicals to our facility wastewater systems and ensure that...\nthese sites do not discharge untreated wastewater directly to surface water or to groundwater.\n\nWaste\n\nAlthough our facilities do not generate large amounts of waste, we employ a global policy of \u201creduce, reuse, and recycle\u201d that supports our company-wide shift toward a circular economy. HP generated 13,900 tonnes of nonhazardous waste in 2021, as well as 500 tonnes of used electronic equipment recovered from HP operations.\n\nIn 2021, we achieved an 86.4% landfill diversion rate globally, and we use disposal only as a last resort. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted waste management processes, which lowered our global diversion rate from 91.8% in 2019. We reuse electronic equipment when possible or recycle it responsibly through the same programs we offer customers. See Product repair, reuse, and recycling.\n\nIn 2021, to help us achieve site-specific Zero Waste certification, we began conducting in-depth audits of our waste streams, beginning with sites with the largest waste volumes. Following audits, HP teams at our Corvallis, Oregon, and Kiryat Gat, Israel, sites have begun implementing recommendations\u2014such as expanding composting, eliminating disposables such as cups and utensils, and improving waste sorting\u2014that are expected to reduce waste to landfill by 182 tonnes annually.\n\nThe main hazardous waste we generate is liquid from ink-manufacturing facilities. These manufacturing sites prioritize waste management options with low environmental impacts and only use disposal as a last resort. Although ink manufacturing is a source of hazardous waste, Original HP Ink Cartridges used by customers and in our offices can be recycled and are considered nonhazardous in many of our major markets. We generated 7,060 tonnes of hazardous waste in 2021.\n\nSee detailed waste data for 2019\u20132021.\n\nSee HP\u2019s latest disclosure to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Toxics Release Inventory.\n\nHP is conducting environmental investigations and/or remediation at several current or former operating sites. Some historic manufacturing activities of HP and predecessor companies used chemicals now known to have contaminated soil and groundwater. We are also involved in the cleanup of sites affected by the improper disposal and recycling of HP\u2019s waste by third parties. HP proactively works to implement a variety of remediation activities in cooperation with regulatory agencies.\n\n2025 GOAL\nReach zero waste in HP operations by 2025\n\nPROGRESS IN 2021\nIn 2021, we achieved an 86.4% landfill diversion rate globally\n\nComposition of nonhazardous waste and used electronic equipment recovered from HP operations, 2021\n\n| Percentage of Total | Composition |\n|--------------------|-------------|\n| 22%                | Paper       |\n| 14%                | Landfill    |\n| 11%                | Pallets     |\n| 11%                | Other       |\n| 6%                 | Packaging materials |\n| 4%                 | Used electronic equipment recovered from HP operations |\n| 9%                 | Waste to energy |\n| 23%                | Metals      |\n\n*HP sites report nonhazardous waste volumes and disposition based on information provided by our waste disposal vendors. For sites unable to directly track nonhazardous waste, we estimate volumes and disposition using intensity factors based on similar operations.\nCommunity giving and volunteerism\n\nWe work to accelerate digital equity, connect communities to greater economic and social opportunity, and bring technology-related learning experiences to underrepresented and underserved communities worldwide. By leveraging our technology, scope, and scale, together with strategic local and international partnerships, we create positive impact in the communities where we live, work, and do business. Corporate contributions, the HP Foundation, and employee giving and volunteerism are central to our approach. See HP\u2019s Global Charitable Contributions Policy.\n\nIn 2021, HP continued to provide relief and support for those affected by COVID-19, while our employees participated in numerous virtual volunteering opportunities to help those in need. HP donated US$3.08 million in products during the year (see box on next page), and the HP Foundation continued uplifting communities through the HP LIFE (Learning Initiative for Entrepreneurs) program to reach students around the world who have had their educations interrupted.

Our vision is to become a fully circular company powered by service models and circular design in our products, which will affect every part of our business. To minimize environmental impacts, we are working toward product circularity, continued improvements in energy efficiency, using more sustainable materials, and making substantial investments in forests. We extend product life through design, maintenance, upgrades, repair, and innovative service-based business models. At end of service, we strive to reuse or recover all products. Supporting these efforts, we aspire to using 100% renewable energy and producing zero waste to landfill across our manufacturing process.\n\nWe will continue to innovate throughout our product and services portfolio and work with suppliers and channel partners to increase circularity.\n\nWe apply rigorous circular design principles to drive progress toward a circular and net zero carbon economy through our portfolio of personal systems, home and office printing solutions, large format printing, industrial graphics, and 3D printing products and solutions. For reaching goals related to product circularity (see below), counteracting deforestation, and GHG emissions reduction underpin these efforts.\n\nSee the HP Circularity accounting manual.\n\nFour key strategies (see graphic) guide our efforts to transform business models and decouple business growth from resource consumption. By focusing on these areas, we strive to continue to shrink our environmental footprint, support our customers to meet their own sustainability goals, and realize long-term sustainable impact.\n\n**Design for Circularity**\n\nDesign plays a critical role in determining a product\u2019s environmental impacts. We apply rigorous design principles to improve the environmental performance of our products across their life cycle. In 1992, we developed our Design for the Environment program to formally consider factors impacting sustainability performance throughout the product design and development phases. We currently call this program Design for Circularity, to reflect how we are designing products and business processes for a circular economy.\n\nWe use a science-based approach to evaluate our products, identify and prioritize improvement opportunities, and set goals.\n\n**2030 GOAL**\n\nReach 75% circularity for products and packaging by 2030\n\n**PROGRESS IN 2021**\n\n39% circular by weight (this equals the sum of the five metrics below)\n\n32,000 TONNES of recycled content plastic used in HP products and packaging (3.3% of total materials use)\n\n105,700 TONNES of recycled fiber in HP brand paper and packaging (11.1% of total materials use)\n\n227,800 TONNES of certified sustainably managed fiber in HP brand paper and packaging (23.8% of total materials use)\n\n4,300 TONNES of recycled content metal used in HP products (0.4% of total materials use)\n\n7,200 TONNES of reused products and parts (0.8% of total materials use)\n\n**Product circularity**\n\nKeeping products and materials in use for longer, designing out waste, expanding repair, reuse, and recycling, increasing longevity, and implementing circular business models.\n\n**Energy efficiency**\n\nImproving product energy efficiency to reduce customers\u2019 energy consumption and decrease product use carbon and water footprints.\n\n**Sustainable materials**\n\nIncreasing materials efficiency, practicing responsible chemistry, using more recycled content and renewable materials, and tackling ocean plastics.\n\n**Forest positive**\n\nResponsibly sourcing paper and packaging, restoring, protecting, and responsibly managing forests, and inspiring industry action.\nSupporting HP\u2019s efforts to become a more circular business, we carried out our second performance assessment using the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF) Circulytics tool in early 2022. Developed by the EMF to accelerate the transition to the circular economy, it is a comprehensive circularity measurement system for companies.\n\nThe assessment includes data across dozens of metrics, including a company\u2019s products, material flows, energy, water, infrastructure, and leadership. During the assessment, we documented incremental improvements to HP\u2019s scores for both Enablers (which support future progress) and Outcomes (which relate to current performance).\n\nWe also participated in panel discussions in late 2021 and early 2022 to provide feedback on the tool, suggesting refinements to the process and offering guidance and support to other organizations considering adopting Circulytics.\n\nAmong our main design priorities, we work to increase the use of recycled and renewable materials; practice responsible chemistry; enhance product repairability, reusability, longevity, and recyclability; continually improve product energy efficiency; and build in accessibility features. Our program has continually evolved in response to technological and scientific developments, changes to our supply chain, and customer demand.\n\nProduct design and development operations for our personal computing products, LaserJet Enterprise Solutions, and InkJet Printing Solutions are International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 certified. We conduct internal compliance audits and benchmark against industry best practices on an ongoing basis.\n\nRelevant products obtain a range of external certifications (see Product certifications and other information).\n\nThe analog-to-digital shift\nHP industrial graphics and 3D printing technologies are driving an analog-to-digital shift by enabling cost-efficient short runs that reduce inventory and waste and enable companies to engage with customers in new and exciting ways, including through customized and quicker-to-market products. See HP\u2019s Digital Manufacturing Trends Report.\n\nAcross our portfolio, we offer solutions that apply digital technology to improve traditionally analog processes. For example, in the podiatry industry, clinics are able to replace highly variable, manual processes to create custom orthoses with accurate, repeatable, and consistent digital workflows and 3D printing. See Healthcare. HP also works closely with customers across product design, architecture, engineering, training, healthcare, and location-based entertainment to apply virtual reality (VR) technology to activities such as product development, employee training, walk-through simulation, and immersive experiences. Augmented reality and VR in employee training can replace classroom-style learning or be used to train for specific manual tasks, and is a focus area for HP\u2019s Innovation Garage and Campus of the Future initiatives. See Education.\n\nIn 2021, HP joined the International Green Book Supply Chain Alliance to support more sustainable practices within the publishing industry, particularly efforts to eliminate waste and reduce environmental impact.\n\nHP won seven Green Good Design Awards for personal systems products in 2021. Our winning products included:\n\n- HP Elite Folio\n- HP Spectre x360 14\n- HP ProBook 635 Aero G7\n- HP Renew Sleeve\n- HP U27 4K Wireless Monitor\n- HP EliteOne 800 G6 All-in-One\n- HP Elite c1030 Chromebook\n\nLife cycle assessment\nHP uses LCAs and product carbon footprinting (PCF) to quantify the environmental impacts of our products, analyze possible alternatives, and target product performance improvements that deliver value to our customers and our business. We have conducted LCAs and PCFs of hundreds of products over the last several years, spanning our product portfolio. As we develop and expand our service-based models (which we refer to as circular business solutions), we will continue to study and quantify the potential they have to reduce environmental impacts and drive progress toward a more circular and net zero carbon economy. In 2021, we:\n\n- Conducted or updated 15 LCAs of HP desktop, DesignJet, scanners, and enterprise printers.\n- Completed 373 PCFs of new business HP desktops, notebooks, tablets, workstations, thin clients, All-in-One computers, and displays to better understand performance and inform ongoing design improvements.\n- Completed an ISO-compliant, peer-reviewed LCA of the HP Z4 G4 Workstation, which found its most significant environmental impacts occurred during use. The circuit board and storage components were the most significant impact drivers during production, followed by mechanical components and the power supply.\n- Evaluated the potential to decrease GHG emissions associated with molded fiber packaging tooling, by switching from metal\nparts produced using milled aluminum to lighter parts produced with HP 3D printing, using castor oil-based PA11. The ISO 14067-compliant assessment demonstrated a possible reduction in carbon footprint of 60\u201378%.\n\n- Completed three ISO-compliant, peer-reviewed LCA studies quantifying the environmental benefits of EvoCycle cartridges\u2014a hybrid of reused, recycled, and original HP parts\u2014compared with standard Original HP Toner Cartridges, remanufactured cartridges, and new build alternatives sold in France.\n- Completed a cradle-to-grave comparative LCA of flexible packaging production using HP Indigo digital pouch factory and analog technologies. The LCA model was reviewed by a third party and then developed into an online LCA calculation tool for HP Indigo\u2019s 25,000 customers in the flexible packaging market.\n\nHP\u2019s environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040 and ISO 14044. All impact estimates involve some level of reasonable assumptions and uncertainty, resulting largely from industry-wide data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, we have developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP process and product data, as well as high-quality LCA data. We strive to provide the most accurate environmental impact data, but some level of uncertainty will remain, and results should be considered accordingly.\n\n**Product certifications and other information**\n\nProduct certifications help drive performance across the industry by providing comprehensive information that enables customers to make more sustainable product choices. In 2021, HP tracked over US$7 billion in new sales in which it met customer requirements for registered product eco labels.\n\nWe share extensive product safety and environmental information online and contribute to the development of new standards.\n\n**Large format printing**\n\nThe newest water-based HP Latex Ink qualifies for a range of certifications for health and environmental performance. For example, this HP Latex Ink is certified to UL ECOLOGO\u00ae, and HP was the first printing manufacturer with UL ECOLOGO-certified ink. HP Latex Ink has also achieved GREENGUARD Gold certification for meeting some of the world\u2019s most rigorous standards for low chemical emissions in indoor air for the finished print. In addition, our water-based HP PageWide pigmented inks have attained UL ECOLOGO certification and the Nordic Swan Ecolabel.\n\nSee also:\n\n- Eco labels\n- Eco Declarations: In 2021, HP provided Eco Declarations for product groups representing 93% of revenue\n- HP Carbon Footprint Calculators\n- HP product carbon footprint reports\n- Product compliance declarations and certifications\n- Safety data sheets\n\nAs of October 31, 2021, HP\u2019s worldwide patent portfolio included over 28,000 patents.\nProduct circularity\n\nWe design our products to last, and make them easy to repair, so they can stay in use for as long as possible. Innovative service-based solutions, such as HP Device as a Service and HP Managed Print Services, reduce environmental impacts through extended life, device optimization, and easy take-back. When customers return end-of-service products, our repair, reuse, and recycling services help to incorporate products, components, and materials back into the next generation of circular products.\n\nDurability, repairability, and reusability\n\nHP products are often highly rated for durability and repairability. We offer services related to optimization, maintenance, and renewal that extend product life, capture more value from natural resources, and reduce environmental impact.\n\nWe provide free service documentation for most products, supplemented with service options and warranties, including through HP Care Pack Central. The HP Customer Self Repair web page provides information and the HP Parts Store sells PC and printer parts. HP Renew Services helps customers securely recover and repurpose or recycle end-of-use devices.\n\nPersonal systems\n\nWe test the quality and durability of our Pro and Elite notebooks, Pro and Elite desktops and All-in-Ones, and select workstations and mobile thin clients using the rigorous military MIL-STD-810G standard. See our technical white paper about testing the business ruggedness and reliability of HP Business PCs.\n\nDuring 2021, the iFixit product repair site rated the HP EliteBook 840 Aero G8 9 out of 10.\n\nHome and office printing solutions\n\nMany of HP\u2019s home and office printers adhere to relevant eco label standards for extending product life and conserving materials, including EPEAT\u00ae specifications based on IEEE standard 1680.2, as well as Blue Angel environmental criteria. Through modular design, we increase upgradeability and enable many of our printers to be easily disassembled for repair or recycling. Spare parts are available until at least three years after a printer has ceased production.\n\nHP EVOCYCLE TONER CARTRIDGE\n\nIn December 2021, HP introduced in France the HP EvoCycle Toner Cartridge, designed to help public sector and enterprise customers meet their sustainability requirements. Incorporating reused and recycled components from Original HP Toner Cartridges returned within the region through HP Planet Partners, EvoCycle cartridges include 76% reused and recycled components (excluding toner and parts that directly impact print quality), or 45% by absolute weight. This innovative process enables EvoCycle cartridges to have a lower production-phase carbon footprint than standard Original HP Toner Cartridges, while supporting the circular economy by using less virgin plastic. Since cartridges are manufactured and supplied within France, the program also reduces the carbon footprint associated with product distribution and helps sustain local jobs.\n\nEco labels across our personal systems and printers portfolio\n\n| Products          | EPEAT identifies high-performance, environmentally preferable products | ENERGY STAR\u00ae recognizes products with superior energy efficiency | TCO recognizes various ergonomic and environmental features related to personal systems | Blue Angel recognizes criteria in product design, energy consumption, chemical emissions, noise, recyclable design, and take-back programs |\n|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Personal systems  | EPEAT (all) 77% EPEAT Gold registered 29% EPEAT Silver registered 48% EPEAT Bronze registered 0% | 85%                                                              | 40%                                                                                | N/A                                                                              |\n| Printers          | 88% 14% 81% 6%                                                        | 94%                                                              | N/A                                                                                | 67%                                                                              |\n\n*EPEAT data for personal systems is for models registered worldwide, and for printers is for models registered in the United States.

Learn more.\n\nIndustrial graphics\nHP digital presses are major capital investments for our customers, and are designed for upgradeability, repair, and refurbishment. Through firmware updates and component upgrades, HP Indigo presses used by customers are kept up to date. The HP Indigo Certified Pre-Owned program enables us to keep products in use for longer, reducing waste while allowing customers to access HP Indigo products at a lower price point. In 2021, we provided 100 pre-owned presses to customers through the program.\n\nDue to continual upgrades of components and technologies such as printheads, electronics, software, and inks, customers who invested in a PageWide T200 press in 2010 can now experience more than twice the speed, with even greater print quality, color vision, media versatility, and HP Brilliant Ink. See our 2020 HP Sustainable Impact Report for more details about how we protect industrial graphics investments.\n\nPrint and compute as a service\nHP\u2019s service-based solutions are designed to deliver increased value through reduced environmental impact and capital costs. Customers can access the latest technology while HP manages the fleet, and an ongoing relationship provides valuable insights on end user behavior and needs. Our service offerings include regular maintenance, which has the potential to keep hardware in use for longer and reduce waste. Decreasing individual product shipments and customer store visits also reduces the associated GHG emissions. At end of service, we recapture value from materials through a range of product repair, reuse, and recycling options.\n\nPersonal systems\nOur expanding Device as a Service (DaaS) offering provides customers the latest HP technology while improving cost predictability and enabling a better employee experience. Business customers can upgrade their products to the most current and efficient models, with the purchasing and consumption model that works best for them.\n\nHP Renew Services helps phase out end-of-use devices securely and responsibly:\n- **HP Device Recovery Service** buys used devices securely to give them new purpose, extend their lifespans, and reduce negative environmental impact. Watch our video for more details.\n- **HP Sanitization Service**: Confidential data is securely erased according to the NIST 800-88 standard, or the storage media is destroyed, before removing or recycling customers\u2019 old devices. Customers receive a certificate of data sanitization if they purchase this service.\n- **HP Recycling Service**: Devices are recycled securely. Customers receive a certificate of destruction if they use this service.\n\nHome and office printing solutions\nHP Managed Print Services (MPS) helps clients manage and optimize their printer fleets, digital workflows, and paper consumption by combining hardware, supplies, software, and consulting and management services. In late 2020, HP MPS was certified CarbonNeutral\u00ae in accordance with the CarbonNeutral Protocol, and was the world\u2019s most comprehensive carbon neutral Managed Print Service offering. In 2021, we extended CarbonNeutral product certification to HP Component MPS, which provides partners a mechanism to make their contractual obligations carbon neutral using the same stringent requirements and standards as HP MPS.\n\nWe work to reduce GHG emissions across the life cycle of our products, including by improving resource efficiency, promoting settings and user behaviors to reduce energy consumption and paper use, and driving responsible end-of-life activities. For any remaining GHG emissions, we finance high-quality carbon offset projects. Learn more.\n\nHP MPS end-to-end solutions for HP branded devices can help businesses reduce and offset the carbon impact of printing by estimating the total carbon emissions from HP branded printing solutions using HP\u2019s proprietary Sustainable Impact Contents Footprint Integrity and human rights Supply chain responsibility Operations Products and solutions Appendix\n\n71 2021 HP Sustainable Impact Report www.hp.com/sustainableimpact\nImpact Reporting and Analytics (SIRA) tool. The tracking and metrics used to ensure that offsets are carried out effectively are managed by SIRA.\n\nHP Instant Ink helps home users and microbusinesses remain productive by ensuring they never run out of ink or toner. The service anticipates when the cartridge is running low and sends replenishments as well as new recycling envelopes (for ink cartridges) or recycling labels/information (for toner cartridges) automatically. Customers using this service save up to 50% on the cost of ink or toner. We expanded this service from 18 to 37 countries in 2021, including introducing or expanding access to cartridge recycling in some of those locations.\n\nIn 2021, we launched the pilot phase of our HP Instant Ink with Planet Partners project in Germany. Introduced to several hundred Instant Ink subscribers, the initiative allows customers to choose renewed ink cartridges instead of new ones. Renewal reduces the use of materials such as virgin plastics and microchips. The pilot increases the total number of times a cartridge is used to two (including one reuse) and we are working to further increase the total number of uses to four. Each four-piece set of HP 953 cartridges saves the equivalent of more than eight 0.5 liter (16.9 ounce) bottles\u2019 worth of plastic. Once cartridges can no longer be renewed, they are responsibly recycled by HP Planet Partners.\n\nIndustrial graphics\nHP offers Print as a Service in our industrial graphics portfolio with the Indigo click-charge per-print and monthly service business models, which include supplies and spare parts. We continually invest in innovations to extend the lifespan of supplies and spare parts. HP PrintOS is a cloud-based print production operating system that makes it easy to manage any number of print jobs, increasing press utilization, automating production, and delivering accurate color consistently between runs, across presses, and across sites. HP also provides services to repair, renew, and upgrade our industrial graphics presses, as well as consumables recycling and end-of-service solutions.\n\nProduct repair, reuse, and recycling\nWe design HP products to use resources efficiently and to last a long time. When they reach the end of their service, our robust repair, reuse, and recycling programs help ensure that products and materials are repurposed, keeping them at their highest-value state for as long as possible. These programs reduce waste, can give materials and products renewed life, and support our drive toward a more materials-efficient circular model.\n\nSee HP\u2019s Statement on E-Waste and Used Electronic Equipment.\n\nCustomer take-back programs\nHP provides take-back programs (see next page) in 77 countries and territories worldwide through a global network of reuse and recycling vendors.\n### HP global take-back programs for customers\n\n| Program                  | Description                                                                 | Progress in 2021                                                                 |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Repair and reuse**     |                                                                             |                                                                                 |\n| **Hardware**             | Our remanufacturing programs help to extend hardware lifespan, with the aim of reducing environmental impacts from replacing products that still have useful life.

Availability of offerings varies by location. View full list of reuse and recycling programs by country.\n\n** Reused material is defined as recovered products or components of products that are used for the same purpose for which they were conceived. A reused product/part should replace a new product/part shipment, and the product/part needs to have been used by a user and refurbished before being sent to a different user. Prior to 2021, this data also included some units remanufactured to customers that had not been previously used and refurbished. Beginning in 2021, most repair and reuse data is based on the actual weight for every product, adjusted for estimated amounts that were recycled or for which no issues requiring repair were found. Prior to 2021, data was estimated based on the average weight of each product category.\n\n*** The repair and reuse rate is based on the weight of hardware products returned for repair and reuse compared to the weight of our product sales during the year.\n\n**** Recycling volumes in 2021 were adversely impacted in some locations by lockdowns and customer behavior impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n***** During 2021, 8,600 tonnes of waste electronic equipment was collected on HP\u2019s behalf to comply with producer responsibility requirements of the EU WEEE Directive, compared to 92,600 tonnes of HP electronic equipment placed on the relevant markets during the year. Data includes EU countries in which the authorities or the legislative system provide visibility of the recycling volume allocated to HP. Take-back volumes related to non-EU legislation are excluded.\n\n****** The recycling rate is based on the weight of hardware products returned for recycling compared to the weight of our product sales from seven years ago (the estimated average lifespan of our products). It is impractical for HP to report the recycling rate by product category, as materials are not typically sorted at collection points. This rate also does not include packaging recycling, due to limited data available from recyclers.\nProduct reuse and recycling vendors\nWe work with a global network of vendors to provide product reuse and recycling services to customers around the world. To promote transparency and drive social and environmental standards in the electronics industry supply chain, we publish a detailed list of our reuse and recycling vendor sites, updated annually.\n\nVendor audits\nOur specialized reuse and recycling vendors are required to follow environmentally responsible processing techniques and comply fully with relevant regulations. HP prefers our vendors to attain third-party certification (R2, e-Stewards, or WEEELABEX), in line with EPEAT\u00ae and HP Recycling Standards. In addition, we commission third-party audits to monitor vendor conformance with our high standards and ensure that returned items are processed appropriately. We contract with Environmental Resources Management (ERM) to audit vendors for conformance with the following policies and vendor standards:\n\n- Export of Electronic Waste to Developing Countries Policy\n- HP Supplier Code of Conduct\n- Reuse and Recycling Standards\n\nHP uses a risk-based approach to prioritizing reuse and recycling vendor audits, and all vendors must undergo an audit at least every three years. Vendors are assessed on environmental, health, and safety practices and performance, and audits ensure there is no \u201cleakage\u201d of materials to facilities outside our approved vendor network.\n\nVendors with identified nonconformances must submit corrective action plans within 30 days and address those items within 90 days. In extreme cases, we will cease business with vendors that lack sufficient transparency or are unwilling to make the changes we require.\n\nThrough ERM, HP audited 25 vendor facilities in 14 countries during 2021. This represented 23% of reuse vendor facilities and 32% of recycling vendor facilities. This included repeat audits of 15 vendor facilities to evaluate their efforts to improve performance. Because 28% of major nonconformances occurred at sites audited for the first time, HP\u2019s engagement brought best practices, enabling immediate performance improvements. HP has closed investigations of 100% of the major nonconformances identified in 2021. All sites with major nonconformances will be re-audited the following year to determine whether improvements are sustained.\n\nImmediate priority findings are the most serious type of vendor nonconformance, and require immediate action. During site audits in 2021, three immediate priority findings were identified at two recycling vendor sites upon re-audits. In all cases, we worked closely with the vendor to resolve and close the findings. This underlines the importance of revisiting these vendor locations in the following year to confirm closure is sustained.\n\nRead a statement from ERM.\n\n### Reuse and recycling vendor audits\n\n| Category                        | 2019 | 2020* | 2021 |\n|---------------------------------|------|-------|------|\n| Initial audits                  | 4    | 10    | 10   |\n| Repeat audits                   | 30   | 21    | 15   |\n| Countries                       | 24   | 22    | 14   |\n| Major nonconformances identified| 59   | 82    | 50   |\n| Major nonconformances resolved**| 100% | 100%  | 100% |\n| Immediate priority findings     | 1    | 4     | 3    |\n\n* 2020 data is revised due to calculation errors in the methodology from the previous year.\n** As of May 2022.\n\n### Categories of major nonconformance\n\n| Category                        | 2019 | 2020* | 2021 |\n|---------------------------------|------|-------|------|\n| Health and safety               | 34%  | 43%   | 29%  |\n| Environment                     | 14%  | 16%   | 13%  |\n| Hazardous substance/ emergency response | 10%  | 5%    | 12%  |\n| Insurance                       | 5%   | 4%    | 4%   |\n| Subvendor use and audits        | 3%   | 7%    | 13%  |\n| Other**                         | 34%  | 25%   | 29%  |\n\n* 2020 data is revised due to calculation errors in the methodology from the previous year.\n** Includes site security and controls, management systems, labor, data destruction, transboundary shipments, and approved dispositions of processed materials.

To help our customers decrease energy consumption and GHG emissions, we design for energy efficiency and offer convenient service-based solutions that are designed to deliver increased value to customers through reduced environmental impact and capital costs. We use multiple metrics to assess progress and drive improvement.\n\n#### 2025 GOAL\nReduce HP product-use GHG emissions intensity by 30% by 2025, compared to 2015\n\n#### PROGRESS THROUGH 2021\nHP has achieved this goal for the second year in a row, with a 39% decrease through 2021, compared to 2015 (therefore, we will not report on this goal moving forward)\nPersonal systems\nSince 2019, the energy consumption of our personal systems products has dropped by 18%, on average. This included average estimated reductions in energy consumption of 27% in notebooks, 40% in workstations, and 18% in displays. Ongoing design improvements in 2021, including more efficient CPUs and power supplies, contributed to continued reductions in the typical energy consumption of our notebooks and workstations. Increased sales of Chromebooks and other notebooks, which tend to use less energy than desktop PCs, were also a factor.\n\nReduction in energy consumption of HP personal systems products\n\n|          | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|----------|------|------|------|\n| Desktops | 0%   | -17% | -22% |\n| Notebooks| 0%   | 24%  | 27%  |\n| Workstations | 0% | 15%  | 40%  |\n| Displays  | 0%   | 6%   | 18%  |\n| Overall   | 0%   | 14%  | 18%  |\n\n*The average energy consumption of HP products was estimated annually between 2019 and 2021 using high-volume products for all product lines including notebook, desktop, All-in-One, workstation, and thin client computers, as well as displays. Averages are calculated using the most heavily loaded ENERGY STAR configuration as a representative for individual platforms, weighted by products sold. Desktops, Notebooks, Workstations, and Displays data is averaged performance data for multiple product lines weighted by units sold. Data in the \u201cOverall\u201d row for all years stated is weighted by units sold.\n\nThese improvements more than offset a 22% average estimated increase in energy consumption of desktops between 2019 and 2021, due largely to increased memory (primarily between 2019 and 2020).\n\nSee personal systems eco labels information, including ENERGY STAR\u00ae.\n\nHome and office printing\nOriginal HP Toner Cartridges with HP EcoSmart black toner deliver more energy-efficient printing of premium-quality pages. When HP EcoSmart black toner became available in 2019, this new toner formulation contributed to customers using an average of 20% less energy when printing compared to predecessor printing systems not using HP EcoSmart black toner. In 2020, HP transitioned additional HP JetIntelligence platforms to the HP EcoSmart black toner formulation, enabling even more customers to experience the improved energy efficiency of this advancement in low-melt toner technology. Learn more.\n\nThe HP Smart Tank 600, 6000, 700, and 7000 printer series have been designed to reduce GHG emissions from the printing experience, with the lowest carbon footprint of any of our home and office printing solutions. They are ENERGY STAR qualified and EPEAT\u00ae registered, and include around 25% recycled plastic content, including ocean-bound plastics.\n\nSee printer eco label information, including ENERGY STAR.\n\nProduct use carbon and water footprints\nGHG emissions associated with product energy use equaled 8,700,000 tonnes of CO\u2082e in 2021, 31% of our overall carbon footprint. This decrease of 11% in absolute emissions compared to 2020 was driven by reductions in product energy use and by the continued impact of COVID-19 on sales of different product lines, particularly a shift toward Chromebooks, other notebooks, and inkJet printers, which tend to be lighter and more energy efficient than desktop PCs and LaserJet printers.\n\nProduct energy use represented 54% of our water footprint, due to the water used for cooling during electricity generation. This indirect water consumption related to product use equaled 78,900,000 cubic meters, 19% lower than the prior year, due to the same factors that decreased GHG emissions.\n\nSee product use carbon and water footprint data.\n\nSustainable materials\nTo create a circular and net zero carbon economy, we must gain the most value possible from the materials we use, and reduce our overall demand. We use increasing amounts of recycled content plastics (including ocean-bound plastics), and recycled content metals in our products, and we focus on packaging innovation to eliminate unnecessary packaging materials and plastic. HP brand paper and paper-based packaging use recycled or renewable materials, and we are exploring renewable materials use in our hardware products as well.\n\nHP proactively identifies and evaluates materials used in our products and throughout our supply chain. We prioritize materials for replacement, or for transition to a recycled or renewable alternative, based on environmental, social, and supply impacts.\n\nWe publish information on the material content of typical HP personal systems and printers, and continue to expand our full materials disclosure program. In 2021, we more than doubled the number of EPEAT-registered HP products and the number of products for which we are collecting a substance inventory. We collected an inventory of more than 90% of the substances by weight used in 79% of HP EPEAT 2021-registered personal systems products.\nIn 2021, we used 956,400 tonnes of materials in our products and packaging, 2% more than in 2020. This was primarily due to including commercial printers, scanners, ink and toner, and spare parts in the data, which more than offset a shift toward lighter printers better suited to printing at home and reduced paper sales. Of the materials we used in 2021, 39% were circular by weight (reused, recycled, or renewable). See Data for more detail about HP materials use.\n\n**Responsible chemistry**\n\nWe aspire to a world where our products and operations use materials and chemicals that cause no harm. For more than two decades, we have worked to move the electronics industry toward safer alternatives to materials of concern. We assess published lists of substances of concern, customer preferences, new or upcoming legal requirements, and sound scientific analysis that reveals a potential impact on human health or the environment. This approach also improves circularity by increasing the reusability and recyclability of our products. See key milestones in our Green Chemistry Timeline.\n\nThe HP Materials and Chemical Management Policy guides how we specify materials and chemicals for use in products, packaging, and manufacturing processes. This policy applies to all HP employees and businesses worldwide and extends to our suppliers.\n\nWe developed our General Specification for the Environment (GSE) in 1998. It includes a full list of our material restrictions for products, packaging, and manufacturing process chemicals. The GSE goes beyond worldwide regulatory requirements and is updated annually. HP is committed to compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including material restriction requirements under restriction of hazardous substances (RoHS) legislation.\n\nWhen exploring safer alternatives to materials currently in use, we follow a precautionary approach, use the National Academy of Sciences publication A Framework to Guide Selection of Chemical Alternatives, and incorporate the GreenScreen\u00ae for Safer Chemicals methodology. We screen all ingredients in HP-formulated inks using the GreenScreen methodology, as part of our new product development process.\n\nWe also contribute to standards, legislation, and improved approaches to use of materials in the IT sector. In 2021, we became a Founding Signatory of the Toward Zero Exposure program by Green America\u2019s Clean Electronics Production Network (CEPN), to protect workers from chemical hazards in the electronics supply chain. Learn more.\n\nWe are involved in several initiatives under the Chemical Footprint Project (CFP), which is part of our work with the Business-NGO Working Group (BizNGO). In the 2020 CFP survey, HP was recognized as a frontrunner, and shared our answers and scores publicly.\n\nWe continually innovate to reduce use of materials of concern. Highlights in 2021 included:\n\n- 83% of personal systems product series are low halogen.\n- 45% of EPEAT\u00ae-registered personal systems products contain GreenScreen Benchmark 2 or 3 plasticizers and flame retardants.\n- About 70% of InkJet printers were shipped without USB cords and many of the others were shipped with shorter cords, avoiding approximately 34 million meters of cords.\n\n**Increase recycled content**\n\nWe are both a supplier and a user of recovered materials, incorporating recycled and recyclable content into new HP products. This helps to accelerate global market development for recovered and recycled materials, to support progress toward a circular economy. 95% of HP PC and home and office print hardware introduced since 2020 contains a minimum of 5 grams of recycled content.\n\n**Plastic**\n\nOur primary focus is on increasing recycled plastic use, due to issues related to plastic waste and pollution. During 2021, we used a total of 32,000 tonnes of postconsumer recycled content plastic in HP products, equivalent to 13% of overall plastic use. See Data for detail by product group.\n\nHP\u2019s strategy to use plastics responsibly is to:\n\n- Reduce plastic use by making our products smaller and removing unneeded plastic from packaging.\n- Substitute plastic in packaging where feasible with more sustainable materials such as recycled or certified fiber.\n\n**2025 GOAL**\n\nUse 30% postconsumer recycled content plastic across HP\u2019s personal systems and print product portfolio by 2025.\n\n**PROGRESS IN 2021**\n\n13% achieved\n\u2022 Replace virgin plastic with recycled plastic wherever possible.\n\u2022 Source recycled plastic from locations where HP can have positive environmental and social impact, such as ocean-bound plastic.\n\u2022 Invest in take-back and recycling.\n\nIn 2021, HP joined an industry collaboration with Dow Packaging & Specialty Plastics, Reifenh\u00e4user, Cadel Deinking, and Karlville to demonstrate a closed-loop concept for printed pouch packaging. The project showed HP Indigo inks could be removed effectively from the recycled pouches, and new high-quality pouches could be produced using the recovered resin. Learn more.\n\nWe use increasing amounts of recycled content across our product portfolio:\n\u2022 HP\u2019s EliteBook 840 G9 is made with at least 50% recycled aluminum in the product enclosure, 5% ocean-bound plastic in its speaker enclosure, 50% postconsumer recycled content plastic in its keycaps, and 30% postconsumer recycled content plastic in the bezel, and the outer box packaging is 100% sustainably sourced. It is EPEAT\u00ae Gold registered, ENERGY STAR\u00ae qualified, and TCO certified.\n\u2022 HP\u2019s Dragonfly G3, launched in March 2022, is made from 50% recycled plastic from DVDs, 5% ocean-bound plastic in its speaker enclosure, and 90% recycled magnesium in its product enclosure, while the packaging and fiber cushions are 100% sustainably sourced. It is EPEAT Gold registered, ENERGY STAR qualified, and TCO certified.\n\u2022 The new HP ENVY Inspire 7955e All-in-One Printer is made using 45% postconsumer recycled content plastic. It is EPEAT Silver registered, recyclable through HP Planet Partners, and supports Forest First printing, where HP protects or restores forests in equal measure to every page printed.\n\nThrough 2021, we manufactured over 5.4 billion Original HP and Samsung cartridges using a cumulative 134,000 tonnes of recycled plastic, including from recycled HP Cartridges. This has kept 962 million Original HP Cartridges and an estimated 143 million apparel hangers and 5.5 billion postconsumer plastic bottles out of landfills, instead upcycling these materials for continued use. More than 85% of our Original HP Ink Cartridges contain 4\u201375% postconsumer recycled content, and 100% of Original HP Toner Cartridges contain 1\u201375% postconsumer or post-industrial recycled content.\n\nThe OMEN by HP 25L Gaming Desktop achieved EPEAT Gold, is ENERGY STAR qualified, and contains 2% postconsumer recycled content plastic.\n\n\u2022 HP L700 and L800 Latex printers and the new HP PageWide XL printer are made using 20\u201330% postconsumer recycled content plastic. Each is also EPEAT registered and ENERGY STAR qualified, and uses ink that is UL ECOLOGO\u00ae certified\u2014while the PageWide XL ink also carries the Nordic Swan certification.\n\nMetal\nMetal is an increasing focus for HP, particularly as more personal systems products transition away from plastic and we expand our use of recycled metal to more product lines such as some consumer notebooks.\n\nMetals make up a large portion of the materials in personal systems products, so we work with suppliers to source metals with a high proportion of recycled content for some personal systems products (see boxes), including up to 75% recycled content aluminum and up to 90% recycled content magnesium. These metals are more likely to be recyclable through existing infrastructure than materials such as carbon fiber, and still meet the demanding industrial design requirements of our products. This decreases environmental impacts associated with mining and producing virgin materials, including energy use and associated GHG emissions.\n\nTo further improve the impacts of metal, we are also working to increase the use of postconsumer recycled content and introduce the use of recycled steel.\n\nRECYCLED METAL IN PERSONAL SYSTEMS\nThe HP EliteBook x360 1030 G8 is designed and manufactured with 75% recycled aluminum in its top cover and 90% recycled magnesium in its bottom deck and cover.\nTackling ocean plastics\n\nSince 2016, our ambitious program in Haiti has helped to tackle the growing challenge of ocean-bound plastics (OBP). In partnership with the First Mile Coalition and our supplier partners, we have built a self-reliant OBP supply chain that contributes to the circular economy and provides income and education opportunities locally.\n\nOur plastic washing line produces clean, high-quality recycled plastic for use in HP products, and has simplified our OBP supply chain in Haiti by eliminating a washing step off the island. This has increased the value of plastic collected and the prices that collectors receive. In 2021, in collaboration with Lavergne Haiti, we committed additional funding to support a productivity pilot designed to improve efficiency in collection, logistics, and processing while increasing material quality and average collector income.\n\nDuring the year, we supported collectors through the political unrest caused by the assassination of Haiti\u2019s president in July and the devastating impact of the earthquake in August, and the HP Foundation donated over US$300,000 to WORK, UNICEF, and Direct Relief.\n\nBy using OBP in our products, we create consistent demand for plastic collectors. Since 2016, we have used 1,298 tonnes of OBP in our products\u2014equivalent to more than 102 million 16.9 ounce (500ml) bottles\u2014preventing this material from reaching waterways and oceans.\n\nTo drive change across and beyond our industry, we collaborate with a range of initiatives and organizations:\n\n- **NextWave Plastics** convenes leading technology and consumer-focused companies to develop the first global network of OBP supply chains. In 2021, we collaborated on development of the Plastics Framework for Socially Responsible Ocean-Bound Plastic Supply Chains. This reflects our commitment to collector-centered OBP initiatives, codified in our UL OBP certification, which requires us to document and describe how we work to mitigate risks present in informal OBP collection infrastructure.\n\n- **Ocean Heroes Network**, co-founded by Captain Planet Foundation and Lonely Whale, with support from HP, produces OH-WAKE, a new quarterly online magazine with information to help readers build community, become inspired, and learn how to apply their skills to a future with clean seas.\n\n- The NGO WORK in Haiti provides on-site learning centers for the children of parents who work on recycling efforts. These centers are equipped with the latest technology, including HP laptops and printers using cartridges that include some content from waste plastic collected locally.\n\n- **Ocean Plastics Leadership Network** is a membership community dedicated to addressing ocean plastic pollution. We joined as founding members in 2020.\n\n- **Project STOP** collaborates with governments and communities in Southeast Asia to create effective waste management systems that eliminate plastics leakage into the ocean, and provides replicable solutions. As a technical partner, we support the organization\u2019s work to create a circular waste management system in East Java, Indonesia.\n\n- **Planet Partners**, where available for these products, which will avoid any materials going to landfill.\n\n- **HP ECO-CARTON INK CARTRIDGE**\n\n- **HP Presence** is the world\u2019s first conferencing solution made with OBP. HP Presence meeting room solutions contain 5% OBP in the speaker enclosure.\n\n- Exclusively from HP, many Original HP integrated printhead ink cartridges contain OBP (minimum of 5%), validated by UL.\n\n- **Examples include:**\n  - Personal systems products such as the HP Pavilion x360 15 Convertible PC (5% OBP in the speaker enclosure) and the HP Z1 Entry Tower G8 (5% OBP in the speaker enclosure and bezel).\n  - The new Z series, launched in 2021, is the first full series of HP displays to contain OBP, including in large parts such as the stand (5%) and rear cover (5%).\n  - HP Presence is the world\u2019s first conferencing solution made with OBP. HP Presence meeting room solutions contain 5% OBP in the speaker enclosure.\n  - Exclusively from HP, many Original HP integrated printhead ink cartridges contain OBP (minimum of 5%), validated by UL.\n\u2022 HP joined the Trash Free Seas Alliance\u00ae, launched in 2012 by Ocean Conservancy, which develops innovative and pragmatic solutions to remove marine debris and plastics from oceans.\n\nRenewable materials\nHP focuses on sourcing renewable materials that are responsibly managed in order to protect ecosystems and resources for future generations. We strive to ensure that our paper and fiber-based packaging are derived from recycled or certified content, and we are working to eliminate the use of single-use plastic packaging by shifting to fiber-based packaging. To continue expanding our use of renewable materials we are exploring the feasibility of using more biobased plastics in our hardware products.\n\nPaper and forestry products\nPaper is integral to the printing process, so healthy, resilient forests are essential to the future of HP\u2019s business. Our forest-positive vision for printing focuses on creating enduring positive change for forest environments.\n\nThrough the design of our printers and software\u2014including defaulting many print fleets to double-sided printing and reducing paper waste through HP Managed Print Services\u2014we help customers print more responsibly.\n\nHP\u2019s Sustainable Paper and Wood Policy was the first forestry policy published by an IT company. HP requires that all HP brand paper, paper-based packaging, and wood in products is derived from recycled or certified sources. We continue to give preference to Forest Stewardship Council\u00ae (FSC)-certified fiber where available. Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC\u2122) certification or relevant national certification schemes can also be used if they comply with our Sustainable Paper and Wood Policy.\n\nWe work with World Wildlife Fund\u2019s (WWF) Forests Forward program, FSC, and our suppliers to continually improve our programs related to the sourcing of virgin fiber and to increase the amount of certified fiber in our products and packaging. We analyze our supply chain to understand areas of specific risk (due to weak regulation or ecosystem vulnerability) and create tailored strategies as needed. HP reports progress annually to WWF\u2019s Forests Forward and CDP\u2019s forests program.\n\nHP brand paper sold during 2021 represented 0.5% of our carbon footprint. HP is taking steps to make paper use in printing more efficient, through product design features such as pull printing and automatic two-sided printing. In addition, our HP+, carbon neutral HP Managed Print Services, and sustainable forestry initiatives help to reduce and offset emissions associated with printers, Original HP supplies, and paper due to raw material extraction (including forest impact), manufacturing, transportation, and use.\n\nSince 2016, HP brand paper has been derived from recycled or certified sources, and since 2020 this has also been the case for paper-based packaging for home and office printers and supplies, PCs, and displays. By sourcing recycled or certified fiber, HP has established processes to guard against potential deforestation in our supply chain. In 2021, the amount of FSC-certified fiber in HP brand paper continued to exceed 55% by weight. For packaging, we have implemented a conformance assurance program for our suppliers to maintain this accomplishment in the future.\n\nIn 2021, we also announced a goal to counteract potential deforestation for non-HP paper used in HP products and print services by 2030. This is part of our plan to scale up investment in forest restoration, protection, and other initiatives under the HP Sustainable Forests Collaborative.\n\nHP\u2019s aggressive goals not only focus on HP brand paper and packaging, but also address deforestation that goes beyond its own fiber sourcing to include the paper used in its printing products and services.\nOther materials\nWe continue to explore the use of other renewable materials. For example, we are evaluating the sustainability attributes of plastics made from biobased feedstocks rather than fossil fuels and have created criteria to guide the product development teams as they choose materials for new products. Every bioplastic feedstock must be individually evaluated using LCAs to fully understand its environmental and social impacts and confirm that it is less impactful than the material it would replace. Bioplastic feedstocks considered for use in products must be legal, renewable, and sustainably grown without impacting regional food security, land use practices, or critical ecosystems\u2014as verified through a credible crop management certification standard. Also, the use of bioplastic feedstocks must not impact the recyclability of the plastic resins, so they can continue to cycle through the economy.\n\nPackaging innovation\nOur sustainable packaging strategy has three focus areas, aiming to enhance customer experience while driving progress toward a circular and net zero carbon economy:\n\n- **Eliminate** unnecessary packaging material, space, and hard-to-recycle materials such as plastic foam.\n- **Innovate** packaging designs to use materials with lower environmental impact, such as sustainable fiber and recycled plastics.\n- **Prioritize** high recycled content and easily recyclable materials that can readily circulate through the economy.\n\nWatch a video to learn how HP is tackling the plastic packaging challenge, and learn about our work to sustainably source renewable materials and counteract deforestation.\n\nTo address packaging at end-of-life, we offer take-back services and regularly update the Recycle your HP packaging guide to help consumers avoid sending packaging materials to landfill.\n\nKey initiatives in 2021\nThe following is a selection of the many packaging innovation projects at HP designed to advance the circular economy. In 2021, we completed more than 30 new packaging innovation projects that reduced our environmental impact.\n\n**Eliminate**\nHP is shifting away from plastic, foam, and other hard-to-recycle materials, which have been traditionally used in packaging for most personal systems and printing products. For example:\n\n- **Personal systems:** In 2021, we shipped almost 65 million units of personal systems products in molded fiber or hybrid foam/fiber packaging, representing about 74% of units shipped during the year and more than double the number shipped in fiber packaging in 2020. This included 1.8 million units transitioned from foam packaging during the year, eliminating 407 tonnes of hard-to-recycle expanded plastic foam.\n- **Printing:** In 2021, we eliminated over 300 tonnes of hard-to-recycle expanded plastic foam from the packaging of more than 5 million printer units (see Circulate for more detail).\n\n**Innovate**\nWe continue to improve the tooling design and fabrication process in the molded fiber industry with our 3D printing technology, and in 2021, we shipped more than 150,000 HP product units with cushions made using this proprietary technology. See a video about the HP Molded Fiber Advanced Tooling Solution.\n\n**Packaging**\nWe developed a paper wrap for notebooks that protects the device exterior and replaces the traditional plastic bag. In 2021, we launched one platform with paper wrap packaging, and we plan to launch more in 2022.\n\n**Warehouse emissions:** At selected HP ink supplies warehouses, we switched from traditional softwood pallets to pallets constructed with laminated veneer lumber, reducing carbon footprint per pallet.\n\n**Bulk shipping:** By shipping more than 56,000 notebooks, over 184,000 desktop PCs, and about 1,300 workstations in bulk (where several products share one package), HP reduced packaging materials by 815 tonnes in 2021, while also decreasing GHG emissions associated with packaging and transportation.\n\nCirculate\nHP\u2019s efforts to eliminate single-use plastic packaging help to advance the circular economy. We continue to roll out easily recyclable, fiber-based packaging cushions created from recycled content. In 2021, we used approximately 19,000 tonnes of fiber-based packaging cushions, which...\ntypically contain 100% recycled content, to ship HP notebook, desktop, and display units. This included 70 tonnes of fiber-based packaging from new projects launched in 2021.\n\nWe shipped 2.7 million A3 toner supplies in fiber-based packaging in 2021. During the year, we also transitioned more than 5 million printers to fiber-based packaging, including the HP DeskJet 1100, 2100, 2200, 2300, and 3700 series printers, using about 1,000 tonnes of recycled content fiber.\n\nWe also continued to use recycled material for pallets. In 2021, we used 97,000 pallets made from 50 tonnes of straw from China that might otherwise have been burned as agricultural waste. HP continued its recycled pallet program in North America, using 479,000 recycled pallets during 2021.\n\nLearn how we gain more value from materials through our product repair, reuse, and recycling programs.\n\nLearn about our approach to responsible minerals sourcing, which helps ensure there is no connection between the materials used in HP products and armed violence or human rights abuses.\n\nForest positive\n\nThe HP Sustainable Forests Collaborative, launched in 2019, is driving progress toward our 2030 goal to counteract deforestation for non-HP paper used in our printing products and print services. This commitment builds upon our ambition for HP Consumer Printing worldwide to be forest positive by 2025. The Collaborative\u2019s objectives are to:\n\n- Responsibly source HP branded paper and packaging (see Renewable materials).\n- Restore, protect, and responsibly manage forests.\n- Develop science-based targets for forests (see callout at right).\n- Create print technologies for efficient paper consumption.\n- Influence industry partners to inspire forest-positive action.\n\nIn October 2021, WWF announced its largest U.S. corporate partnership to date, as HP pledged US$80 million to support WWF to help address the potential impacts on forests from paper used in printing with HP printers. Starting in early 2022, the initiative will focus on approximately 950,000 acres (about 380,000 hectares) of forest landscapes, including working with communities, NGOs, and local academics to help protect, restore, and improve forest management.\n\nAs part of this collaboration, WWF has joined HP\u2019s Sustainable Forests Collaborative in an advisory role.\n\n2030 GOAL\n\nCounteract deforestation for non-HP paper used in our products and print services by 2030. Continue to source only sustainable fiber for all HP brand paper and paper-based packaging for home and office printers and supplies, PCs, and displays.\n\nPROGRESS IN 2021\n\nDuring the year, we addressed 23% of our total fiber footprint for paper used in our products and print services. Our programs counteracted deforestation for non-HP paper representing 19% of this footprint. Since 2020, all HP brand paper and paper-based packaging for home and office printers and supplies, PCs, and displays have been derived from recycled or certified sources. During 2021, these equaled 4% of this footprint.\n\nHP Forest Positive program\n\n| 2021* | 2021** |\n|-------|--------|\n| Hectares responsibly managed* | 14,270 |\n| Hectares restored* | 150 |\n\n*See HP Forest positive accounting manual for details about our program, methodology, and definitions.\n\n**This data is based on the period October 1, 2020\u2013September 30, 2021.\n\nThe HP Sustainable Forests Collaborative partners include Domtar, New Leaf Paper, Chenming Paper, Crown Van Gelder, Sylvamo, Mondi, Felix Schoeller, Lenzing Papier, Boise Paper, and Andhra Paper. Environmental NGOs Arbor Day Foundation and WWF play an advisory role.\nIn 2021, progress included:\n\n- **Brazil (Atlantic Forest):** We funded restoration of 150 hectares of forest in partnership with WWF and in coordination with local NGOs and government institutions (see table on previous page). This effort supports biodiversity corridors and water provision in the Upper Paran\u00e1, Serra do Mar, and Mogi Guacu/Mantiqueira regions.\n\n- **China:** In 2021, 14,270 hectares of forest were placed under FSC certification (see table on previous page). With HP funding, WWF has begun on-the-ground activities toward restoring 25 hectares of wild elephant habitat in Yunnan. HP funded research to draft the Operational Management Manual for Biodiversity of Planted Forest. The manual will be developed through case studies, field training, and forest pilot planning to address challenges in select forest farms.\n\n- **Arbor Day Foundation and Eden Reforestation Project:** Through these initiatives, we planted nearly 11 million trees, contributing to the World Economic Forum\u2019s 1t.org initiative\u2014a global movement to conserve, restore, and grow 1 trillion trees by 2030.\n\n- **Conservation International:** We continued to support Conservation International initiatives focused on local farming communities and forest protection. In 2021, the partnership broadened beyond Brazil to include areas in Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador.\n\nHP is the founding sponsor of the FSC One Simple Action digital marketplace, launched in 2021, which helps consumers in North America understand why FSC matters, and find products to buy if they want to be part of the solution for forests. We believe that FSC certification is the most rigorous standard available in the marketplace, designed to ensure that critical forest ecosystems\u2014and the wildlife and workers that depend upon them\u2014are protected.\n\n**Product responsibility**\n\nWe are committed to the safety, security, and privacy of our customers when they use HP products. The company maintains high standards in these areas and continues to innovate across its portfolio.\n\n**Product safety**\n\nHP is committed to providing products that are safe for their intended use and that comply with the applicable government regulations of the countries where we market those products. All HP branded electrical products undergo evaluations and testing to ensure that they meet HP safety standards. This is consistent with HP\u2019s Safe & Legal Product requirements, which outline relevant internal and international safety standard requirements (e.g., the Safety Standard UL/EN/IEC 62368-1). We work to identify opportunities for ongoing improvement in this area.\n\nWe share extensive product safety information online to support customers\u2019 informed purchasing decisions. View Declarations of Conformity for European Union requirements. Contact HP Sustainability and Compliance Center regarding declarations for other countries.\n\nSafety data sheets are available for HP formulated products, including inks, toners, batteries, and 3D printing materials and fusing and detailing agents. The information includes physical, chemical, and toxicological properties, regulatory details, and recommendations for safe handling. Many HP products also qualify for eco labels and other certifications that cover health and safety as well as environmental aspects.\n\n**Home and office printing solutions**\n\n**Indoor air quality**\n\nHP voluntarily designs and tests its printing systems to prevent emissions that exceed eco label guidelines and document that its printing systems are compliant with Blue Angel and EPEAT\u00ae indoor air quality (IAQ) criteria. Original HP Toner and Ink Cartridges are designed and tested with health in mind.\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, HP commissioned Fraunhofer Institute WKI to perform studies that tested the emission rates of volatile organic compounds and ultrafine particles of different toner cartridge brands used in popular HP laser printers. WKI\u2019s tests on brands most commonly available in the North America, Latin America, and Europe, Middle East, and Africa regions found that 95% of the non-HP cartridges tested failed to meet Blue Angel emission criteria. WKI\u2019s tests on brands most commonly available in Asia Pacific and Japan found that 93% of the non-HP toner cartridges tested exceeded Blue Angel emission limits.\nIn December 2021, HP won an Outstanding Case Study award from the Sustainable Purchasing Leadership Council for a study that provides information about the importance of considering IAQ in printing-system purchasing decisions.\n\n**Large format printing**\n\nFor our textile printing solutions, which include HP Stitch printers, HP conducts a hazard and regulatory assessment for each substance in the ink formulation to determine its suitability for the application. We also obtain the ECO PASSPORT by OEKO-TEX\u00ae, an independent safety certification for chemicals and colorants used in the manufacturing of textiles, which supports customers who wish to obtain the OEKO-TEX STANDARD 100 certification for their textile products.\n\nSome HP inks are assessed to provide information about suitability for printing applications involving toys. Test results for specific HP inks can be made available to customers upon request. For these assessments, we typically consider general chemical regulatory compliance criteria and material-specific requirements for ink formulations, with an emphasis on standards relating to paper and printing on books and puzzles.\n\nSee Product certifications and other information.\n\n**Industrial graphics**\n\n**Food contact material compliance**\n\nWe incorporate relevant food contact material regulations, industry guidance, and brand requirements into our formulation qualification process to support a variety of food packaging printing solutions offered by our Indigo, PageWide Industrial, and Specialty Printing Systems technologies. Whenever possible, HP strives to formulate with chemicals previously evaluated and deemed suitable for use in food packaging printing applications.\n\n**3D printing**\n\nFor our 3D printing solutions, we conduct a hazard and regulatory assessment for each substance in the fusing and detailing agent formulations to determine suitability for applications such as toys, medical devices, and cosmetics packaging. To ensure we meet customers\u2019 sustainability requirements, we also review formulations against restricted substances lists as required by individual customers. HP 3D printing materials HP PA 11, HP PA 12, HP PA 12 GB, HP CB PA 12, HP PP enabled by BASF, and HP TPA enabled by Evonik, as well as the corresponding HP 3D 600/700/710 and HP 3D 710 R Fusing and Detailing Agents, have been tested for problematic heavy metals, phthalates, BPA, and migration of certain components.\n\n**Product security and privacy**\n\nCybersecurity is an increasing concern for our customers worldwide. We continually work to enhance HP products, solutions, and services to offer industry-leading security and resiliency capabilities, and seek to address and anticipate an ever-evolving cyber-threat landscape.\n\nHP follows security-by-design and privacy-by-design principles, including Zero Trust principles, in the development of our products, from design through manufacturing, renewal/reuse, and recycling. We build protection, detection, and recovery capabilities into the devices, not just in software, providing customers separate, auditable security mechanisms to help manage and recover from security risks. We design business PCs and printers with future threats in mind, with built-in hardware-enforced security and resiliency capabilities that integrate seamlessly with an organization\u2019s broader infrastructure. Aiming to deliver the most secure devices, and the services and solutions to help our customers use endpoint infrastructures safely and confidently, is the foundation of our strategy.\nHP\u2019s leadership team oversees our portfolio-wide approach to security and provides the resources needed to support HP\u2019s continued leadership. Our Security Advisory Board, consisting of several HP leaders as well as external advisors with broad backgrounds in offensive and defensive security, advises us on the ever-changing threat landscape, augmenting our work in HP R&D and HP Labs research activities.\n\nWe continually conduct threat analysis on emerging attack vectors, which in turn helps guide product security development efforts. We employ cybersecurity specialists and conduct cybersecurity architecture reviews, penetration testing, code reviews, and automated code scanning using industry-leading tools. When issues arise, we take appropriate actions to remediate reported security vulnerabilities.\n\nIn 2018, we adopted the industry best practice Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure approach, which describes how we work with partners, industry, and the security community to address vulnerabilities. When notified about a suspected vulnerability, we investigate thoroughly and, if confirmed, work with the submitter on remediation and a coordinated public release of information.\n\nThe HP supply chain security group works to ensure that our products can resist attacks throughout the supply chain life cycle, from component sourcing and manufacturing to transportation, service, and take-back.

Original HP Toner and Ink Cartridge recycling data is for calendar year. The remaining data is based on the HP fiscal year. Although for HP print cartridges we report the composition of recovered materials, we cannot provide this data for hardware because we do not have operational control over all recycling processes and so do not have access to this information. Recycling volumes in 2020 and 2021 were adversely impacted in some locations by lockdowns and customer behavior impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In some cases, segments do not add up to total due to rounding. Although we do not include data prior to 2019 in the Product repair, reuse, and recycling section, the vast majority of product hardware recycling data, and all toner and ink cartridge recycling data, reported in past years was associated with the business units that are now a part of HP Inc. Through 2015, Hewlett-Packard Company reported 1,497,500 tonnes of cumulative computer hardware and supplies recycling combined.\n\n**Data for 2020 and 2021 reflects a more complete data set and enhanced calculation methodology. Beginning in 2021, this data is based on the actual weight of every product. Prior to 2021, data was estimated based on the average weight of each product category.\n\n***Reused material is defined as recovered products or components of products that are used for the same purpose for which they were conceived. A reused product/part should replace a new product/part shipment, and the product/part needs to have been used by a customer and refurbished before being sent to a different user. Prior to 2021, this data also included some units remarked to customers that had not been refurbished or used. Beginning in 2021, this data is based on the actual weight of every product. Prior to 2021, data was estimated based on the average weight of each product category.\n\n****The repair and reuse rate is based on the weight of hardware products returned for repair and reuse compared to the weight of our product sales during the year.\n\n*****The recycling rate is based on the weight of hardware products returned for recycling compared to the weight of our product sales from seven years ago (the estimated average lifespan of our products). It is impractical for HP to report the recycling rate by product category, as materials are not typically sorted at collection points. This rate also does not include packaging recycling, due to limited data available from recyclers.\n\n******Includes cartridges returned by customers only.\n### HP materials use\n\n| Material | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  |\n|----------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Total    | 990,600 | 942,000 | 956,400 |\n| By type  |       |       |       |\n| Electronic products | 587,800 | 562,700 | 602,700 |\n| Metal    | 209,600 | 202,800 | 191,700 |\n| Plastic  | 270,200 | 251,500 | 243,900 |\n| Other**  | 108,000 | 108,400 | 167,100 |\n| Paper    | 230,600 | 213,300 | 193,900 |\n| Packaging| 172,200 | 166,000 | 159,800 |\n| Recycled content plastic in HP products and packaging*** | 34,200 | 34,200 | 32,000 |\n| Recycled content metal in HP products**** | 4,300 |       |       |\n| Recycled fiber in HP brand paper and packaging | 87,500 | 100,800 | 105,700 |\n| Certified sustainably managed fiber in HP brand paper and packaging***** | 254,600 | 248,300 | 227,800 |\n\n*For 2019 and 2020, the data in this table does not include the following products or packaging for these products: commercial, industrial, or 3D printing products; scanners; personal systems accessories sold separately; spare parts; or the weight of ink and toner in cartridges.

Collecting data from more than 100 sites globally is complex, and the process can vary by issue, business unit, function, and geography. As a result, company-wide metrics can be difficult to define and implement. We continue to standardize our measurement systems and metrics. Data is rounded to reflect the appropriate level of certainty.\n\nReporting performance beyond our immediate operations is also challenging. We must make assumptions when estimating Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, product energy consumption and resulting GHG emissions, the percentage of HP products that are recycled, and other metrics. Where appropriate, we provide context for data to help readers understand limitations and draw appropriate conclusions.\n\nForward-looking content reflects approaches, goals, and priorities established by the HP teams responsible for implementing them. These were set in consultation with internal, and in some cases external, stakeholders, and consider leading corporate practices.\n\nFeedback\n\nYour comments and suggestions are important to us.

Risks, uncertainties and assumptions include factors relating to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the situation, the effects of which may give rise to or amplify the risks associated with many of these factors listed here; the need to manage (and reliance on) third-party suppliers, including with respect to component shortages, and the need to manage HP\u2019s global, multi-tier distribution network, limit potential misuse of pricing programs by HP\u2019s channel partners, adapt to new or changing marketplaces and effectively deliver HP\u2019s services; HP\u2019s ability to execute on its strategic plan, including the previously announced initiatives, business model changes and transformation; execution of planned structural cost reductions and productivity initiatives; HP\u2019s ability to complete any contemplated share repurchases, other capital return programs or other strategic transactions; the competitive pressures faced by HP\u2019s businesses; risks associated with executing HP\u2019s strategy and business model changes and transformation; successfully innovating, developing and executing HP\u2019s go-to-market strategy, including online, omnichannel and contractual sales, in an evolving distribution, reseller and customer landscape; the development and transition of new products and services and the enhancement of existing products and services to meet evolving customer needs and respond to emerging technological trends; successfully competing and maintaining the value proposition of HP\u2019s products, including supplies; challenges to HP\u2019s ability to accurately forecast inventories, demand and pricing, which may be due to HP\u2019s multi-tiered channel, sales of HP\u2019s products to unauthorized resellers or unauthorized resale of HP\u2019s products or our uneven sales cycle; integration and other risks associated with business combination and investment transactions; the results of the restructuring plans, including estimates and assumptions related to the cost (including any possible disruption of HP\u2019s business) and the anticipated benefits of the restructuring plans; the protection of HP\u2019s intellectual property assets, including intellectual property licensed from third parties; the hiring and retention of key employees; the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical trends and events, including the ongoing situation in Ukraine and its regional and global ramifications and the effects of inflation; risks associated with HP\u2019s international operations; the execution and performance of contracts by HP and its suppliers, customers, clients and partners, including logistical challenges with respect to such execution and performance; changes in estimates and assumptions HP makes in connection with the preparation of its financial statements; disruptions in operations from system security risks, data protection breaches, cyberattacks, extreme weather conditions or other effects of climate change, medical epidemics or pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other natural or manmade disasters or catastrophic events; the impact of changes to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including environmental regulations and tax laws; potential impacts, liabilities and costs from pending or potential investigations, claims and disputes; and other risks that are described herein and in HP\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021 and that are otherwise described or updated from time to time in HP\u2019s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nAs in prior periods, the financial information set forth in this document, including any tax-related items, reflects estimates based on information available at the time of preparation of this document. While HP believes these estimates to be reasonable, these amounts could differ materially from reported amounts in HP\u2019s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2022, Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022, and HP\u2019s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The forward-looking statements in this document are made as of the date of this document and HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update these forward-looking statements.\n\nThroughout this document, we use the definition of \u201cmateriality\u201d from the GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) Standards, which is different from the term as it has been defined by or construed in accordance with the securities laws or any other laws of the U.S. or any other jurisdiction, or as used in the context of our financial statements and financial reporting, or our reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Topics identified as ESG material for the purpose of this document should not be construed as being material for SEC or other financial reporting purposes. In addition, historical, current, and forward-looking sustainability-related statements may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future.\n\nHP\u2019s Investor Relations website at investor.hp.com contains a significant amount of information about HP, including financial and other information for investors.

HP\u2019s management is responsible for the Subject Matter in accordance with the Criteria. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Subject Matter based on our review.\n\nOur review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) AT-C section 105, Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements, and AT-C section 210, Review Engagements. Those standards require that we plan and perform our review to obtain limited assurance about whether any material modifications should be made to the Subject Matter in order for it to be in accordance with the Criteria. A review consists principally of applying analytical procedures, making inquiries of persons responsible for the subject matter, obtaining an understanding of the data management systems and processes used to generate, aggregate and report the Subject Matter and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. A review is substantially less in scope than an examination, the objective of which is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Subject Matter is in accordance with the Criteria, in all material respects, in order to express an opinion. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. A review also does not provide assurance that we became aware of all significant matters that would be disclosed in an examination. We believe that our review provides a reasonable basis for our conclusion.\n\nIn performing our review, we have also complied with the independence and other ethical requirements set forth in the Code of Professional Conduct and applied the Statements on Quality Control Standards established by the AICPA.\n\nAs described in Appendix A, the Subject Matter is subject to measurement uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent in the nature and the methods used for determining such data. The selection of different but acceptable measurement techniques can result in materially different measurements. The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary. Furthermore, Scope 3 emissions are calculated based on a significant number of estimations and management assumptions due to the inherent nature of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard criteria.\n\nThe information included in HP\u2019s 2021 Sustainable Impact Report, other than the Subject Matter, has not been subjected to the procedures applied in our review and, accordingly, we express no conclusion on it.\n\nBased on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying schedules of select sustainability indicators for the year ended October 31, 2021, in order for the schedules to be in accordance with the Criteria.\n\nMay 12, 2022\n\nErnst & Young LLP\n303 Almaden Blvd\nSan Jose, CA 95110\nUnited States of America\nTel: +1 (408) 947-5500\n## Schedule of Select Environmental Metrics for the year ended October 31, 2021\n\n| Indicator name | Scope | Unit of measure | Reported value | Criteria |\n|----------------|-------|-----------------|----------------|----------|\n| Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions | Global | Tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (tCO\u2082e) | 48,700 | World Resources Institute (WRI)/World Business Council for Sustainable Development\u2019s (WBCSD) The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standard 305-1 Direct (Scope 1) Emissions and HP\u2019s Carbon accounting manual<sup>1</sup> |\n| Scope 2 GHG emissions (location-based method) | Global | tCO\u2082e | 198,200 | WRI/WBCSD\u2019s The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, WRI/WBCSD\u2019s The Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, GRI Standard 305-2 Energy Indirect (Scope 2) GHG Emissions and HP\u2019s Carbon accounting manual<sup>2</sup> |\n| Scope 2 GHG emissions (market-based method) | Global | tCO\u2082e | 110,800 | WRI/WBCSD\u2019s The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, WRI/WBCSD\u2019s The Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, GRI Standard 305-2 Energy Indirect (Scope 2) GHG Emissions and HP\u2019s Carbon accounting manual<sup>2</sup> |\n| Scope 3 GHG emissions<sup>3</sup> | Global | tCO\u2082e | 28,300,000 | WRI/WBCSD\u2019s The Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard, WRI/WBCSD\u2019s The Greenhouse Gas Protocol Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions, GRI Standard 305-3 Other Indirect (Scope 3) GHG Emissions and HP\u2019s Carbon accounting manual<sup>2</sup> |\n| Direct energy use in operations (corresponds to Scope 1 emissions)<sup>4</sup> | Global | MWh<sup>5</sup> | 202,750 | GRI Standard 302-1 Energy Consumption Within the Organization and HP management definitions disclosed in the 2021 Sustainable Impact Report |\n| Indirect energy use (corresponds to Scope 2 emissions)<sup>5</sup> | Global | MWh<sup>5</sup> | 494,308 | GRI Standard 302-1 Energy Consumption Within the Organization and HP management definitions disclosed in the 2021 Sustainable Impact Report |\n| Voluntary purchases of renewable energy | Global | MWh<sup>5</sup> | 261,196 | GRI Standard 302-1 Energy Consumption Within the Organization and HP management definitions disclosed in the 2021 Sustainable Impact Report |\n| Direct water withdrawal<sup>6</sup> | Global | Cubic meters<sup>7</sup> | 2,556,000 | GRI Standard 303-3(a) Water withdrawal and HP management definitions disclosed in the 2021 Sustainable Impact Report |\n\n---\n\n<sup>1</sup> Where possible, based on HP Inc.\u2019s reporting timeline and requirements, HP Inc. uses the most up-to-date emission factors available at the time.\n\n<sup>2</sup> Carbon accounting manual is available at [http://h20195.www2.hp.com/V2/getpdf.aspx/c05179524.pdf](http://h20195.www2.hp.com/V2/getpdf.aspx/c05179524.pdf).\n\n<sup>3</sup> Scope 3 GHG emissions includes the following categories: Category 1 Purchased goods and services, Category 2 Capital goods, Category 3 Fuel- and energy-related activities not included in Scope 1 or Scope 2, Category 4 and 9 Transportation and distribution, Category 6 Business travel, Category 7 Employee commuting, Category 11 Use of sold products, and Category 12 End-of-life treatment of sold products.\n\n<sup>4</sup> Direct energy use refers to direct energy consumption in HP\u2019s operations including natural gas, renewable energy generated on-site, diesel (LPG), and transportation fleet similar to the Scope 1 emissions boundary.

The standalone Executive Summary provides a high-level overview of our Sustainable Impact strategy, progress, and vision for the future.\n\nAlthough this GRI Standards topic was not determined to be material in HP\u2019s ESG materiality assessment, we recognize that it is relevant to some stakeholders, and we provide information about HP\u2019s programs and performance in this area.\n| Disclosure | Location |\n|------------|----------|\n| 103-1 Explanation of the material topic and its Boundary | 75, 98 |\n| 103-2 The management approach and its components | 75 |\n| 103-3 Evaluation of the management approach | 75, HP 2021 10-K |\n| 301-1 Materials used by weight or volume | 90 |\n| 301-2 Recycled input materials used | 90 |\n| 301-3 Reclaimed products and their packaging materials | 72, 89 |\n| GRI 302: Energy | |\n| 103-1 Explanation of the material topic and its Boundary | 36, 74, 98 |\n| 103-2 The management approach and its components | 36, 53, 74, HP Carbon accounting manual |\n| 103-3 Evaluation of the management approach | 98 |\n| 302-1 Energy consumption within the organization | 64 |\n| 302-3 Energy intensity | 64 |\n| 302-4 Reduction of energy consumption | 54 |\n| 302-5 Reductions in energy requirements of products and services | 74 |\n| GRI 303: Water and Effluents* | |\n| 103-1 Explanation of the material topic and its Boundary | 38, 56, 98 |\n| 103-2 The management approach and its components | 38, 57, 72, Export of Electronic Waste to Developing Countries Policy |\n| 103-3 Evaluation of the management approach | HP 2021 10-K |\n| 303-1 Interactions with water as a shared resource | 72, 80, 70, 57 |\n| 303-2 Management of water discharge-related impacts | 38, 57, 67 |\n| 303-3 Water withdrawal | 57 |\n| 303-4 Water discharge | 57, 73 |\n| 303-5 Water consumption | 57, 73 |\n| GRI 305: Emissions | |\n| 103-1 Explanation of the material topic and its Boundary | 44, 98 |\n| 103-2 The management approach and its components | 44, Supply chain responsibility: Our approach, HP Supplier Code of Conduct |\n| 103-3 Evaluation of the management approach | 44 |\n\n* Although this GRI Standards topic was not determined to be material in HP\u2019s ESG materiality assessment, we recognize that it is relevant to some stakeholders, and we provide information about HP\u2019s programs and performance in this area.\nWe determined that 95% of HP first-tier production suppliers, by spend, had environmental management system (EMS) certification (e.g., ISO 14001) for manufacturing sites during 2021. Data represents review of 96% of HP production spend. The HP Supplier Code of Conduct requires our suppliers to have an effective EMS for manufacturing sites, regardless of third-party certification. We audit suppliers to this standard. HP 2021 10-K\n\nNew suppliers that were screened using environmental criteria 95% of HP production suppliers, by spend, have been screened using environmental criteria. This includes new suppliers that were onboarded during 2021.\n\nThis is not practical to report by significant locations of operations, given variation by country.\n\nThe types of injury HP recorded in calendar year 2021 included head/neck (17% of the total), hands/wrists (17%), lower extremities (17%), arms/shoulders (8%), back (13%), and other (29%). Some injuries are classified using multiple injury types. It is not practical to break down the injury data that HP reports by employment contract (employees and contractors that HP manages) or by gender. Despite a comprehensive COVID-19 response plan, HP did experience several presumptive work-related COVID-19 exposures, which accounted for about 20% of all recordable incidents that we recorded as occupational illnesses. HP experienced zero fatalities for the years reported (calendar years 2019\u20132021). HP does not report absentee rate.\n\nEach year, HP leaders identify human capital development priorities to help advance our business and human resource strategies. This involves analyzing the capabilities and skills we need to deliver on culture and talent development, business transformation, leadership agility, employee engagement, and innovation. This needs assessment is informed by data sources such as our employee engagement survey, succession planning, and business performance metrics. Employees also work with their managers to create annual personal development goals that build on their strengths, improve performance, and progress their careers. We track and measure employee development at program and audience levels, with clear targets for both. We systematically evaluate all formal development programs through our learning management system, measuring improvements in employee performance and business impact.\n| Disclosure | Location |\n|------------|----------|\n| GRI 405: Diversity and Equal Opportunity | 46, 98 |\n| GRI 103: Management Approach | 46, HP 2021 10-K |\n| 103-1 Explanation of the material topic and its Boundary | 46, 98 |\n| 103-2 The management approach and its components | 46, HP 2021 10-K |\n| 103-3 Evaluation of the management approach | 46, HP 2021 10-K |\n| 405-1 Diversity of governance bodies and employees | 46, 61, HP Board of Directors, HP 2022 Proxy Statement |\n| GRI 406: Non-discrimination | 46, 98 |\n| GRI 103: Management Approach | 46, HP 2021 10-K |\n| 103-1 Explanation of the material topic and its Boundary | 46, 98 |\n| 103-2 The management approach and its components | 46, HP 2021 10-K |\n| 103-3 Evaluation of the management approach | 46, HP 2021 10-K |\n| 406-1 Incidents of discrimination and corrective actions taken | 46, 98 |\n| GRI 407: Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining | 46, 98 |\n| GRI 103: Management Approach | 46, HP 2021 10-K |\n| 103-1 Explanation of the material topic and its Boundary | 46, 98 |\n| 103-2 The management approach and its components | 46, HP 2021 10-K |\n| 103-3 Evaluation of the management approach | 46, HP 2021 10-K |\n| 407-1 Operations and suppliers in which the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining may be at risk | 46, 98 |\n| GRI 408: Child Labor | 46, 98 |\n| GRI 103: Management Approach | 46, HP 2021 10-K |\n| 103-1 Explanation of the material topic and its Boundary | 46, 98 |\n| 103-2 The management approach and its components | 46, HP 2021 10-K |\n| 103-3 Evaluation of the management approach | 46, HP 2021 10-K |\n| 408-1 Operations and suppliers at significant risk for incidents of child labor | 46, 98 |\n| GRI 409: Forced or Compulsory Labor | 46, 98 |\n| GRI 103: Management Approach | 46, HP 2021 10-K |\n| 103-1 Explanation of the material topic and its Boundary | 46, 98 |\n| 103-2 The management approach and its components | 46, HP 2021 10-K |\n| 103-3 Evaluation of the management approach | 46, HP 2021 10-K |\n| 409-1 Operations and suppliers at significant risk for incidents of forced or compulsory labor | 46, 98 |\n| GRI 412: Human Rights Assessment | 46, 98 |\n| GRI 103: Management Approach | 46, HP 2021 10-K |\n| 103-1 Explanation of the material topic and its Boundary | 46, 98 |\n| 103-2 The management approach and its components | 46, HP 2021 10-K |\n| 103-3 Evaluation of the management approach | 46, HP 2021 10-K |\n| 412-1 Operations that have been subject to human rights reviews or impact assessments | 46, 98 |\n\nHP discloses the rates of conformance in production supplier sites audited, as well as the data needed to calculate the approximate number of nonconformances.

This energy data is converted into GHG emissions avoided using emission factors for electricity and fuel types. This data also includes estimates of product transportation-related emissions avoided, related to specific initiatives to improve product transportation efficiency.\n\n3 All HP brand paper is derived from certified sources; paper-based packaging for PCs, displays, home and office print, and supplies is reported by suppliers as recycled or certified, with a minimum of 97% by volume verified by HP. Packaging is the box that comes with the product and all paper-based materials inside the box. Packaging for commercial, industrial, and 3D products, scanners, personal systems accessories, and spare parts is not included.\n\n4 Absolute reduction of Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions compared to 2019. Excludes non-HP paper consumed during product use.\n\n5 Moving forward, this will be replaced by a new goal, which has been submitted to and is awaiting validation by SBTi. This will support our broader goal to achieve carbon-neutral HP operations by 2025.\n\n6 Product-use GHG emissions intensity describes the performance of our portfolio, taking into account changes to product mix and business growth. HP product-use GHG emissions intensity measures per-unit GHG emissions during anticipated product lifetime use. These values are then weighted by contribution of personal systems and printing products to overall revenue in the current year. These emissions represent more than 99% of HP product units shipped each year, including notebooks, tablets, desktops, mobile computing devices, workstations, and displays; HP InkJet, LaserJet, DesignJet, Indigo, Scitex, and Jet Fusion 3D printers; and scanners.

Includes all HP-owned and -managed sites worldwide. Zero waste is defined by the US or TRUE certification standards.\n\n13 Filter by weight will be 1) certified to rigorous third-party standards, 2) recycled, or 3) balanced by forest restoration, protection, and other initiatives through HP\u2019s Forest Positive Framework.\n\n14 HP brand paper and paper-based packaging for home and office printers and supplies, PCs, and displays are derived from certified and recycled sources, with a preference for Forest Stewardship Council\u00ae (FSC\u00ae) certification. Packaging is the box that comes with the product and all paper-based materials inside the box.\n\n15 We calculate the annual tonnage for paper used in our products and print services that will be addressed through projects with civil society forestry organizations to counteract possible deforestation by taking the estimated annual total tonnage of paper consumed in the use of our printing products and print services minus the weight of such paper that we mitigate internally, through our responsible sourcing programs. Non-HP paper represented 96% of our total fiber footprint during 2021. See HP Forest positive accounting manual.\n\n16 All HP brand paper is derived from certified sources; paper-based packaging for PCs, displays, home and office print, and supplies is reported by suppliers as recycled or certified, with a minimum of 97% by volume verified by HP.

Packaging for commercial, industrial, and 3D products, scanners, personal systems accessories, and spare parts is not included.\n\n17 This data does not include participation in RBA audits. Participation in our supply chain sustainability programs is quantified by those programs that go beyond audits to build supplier capabilities to meet our standards. This includes deep-dive assessment, weekly reporting of labor metrics, procurement engagement through our supplier Sustainability Scorecard, and in-depth coaching and workshops tailored to supplier risks.\n\n18 This replaces and expands on our prior goal to develop skills and improve the well-being of 500,000 factory workers by 2025, since the beginning of 2015. Progress through 2021 against that goal includes a total of 349,000 factory workers: 77,800 factory workers in 2015; 45,700 in 2016; 119,900 in 2017; 12,000 in 2018; 11,000 in 2019; 46,000 in 2020; and 37,000 in 2021. Prior to 2020, data included production supplier workers only. In 2020, we expanded the scope of our program to also include nonproduction supplier workers and workers at HP-controlled manufacturing facilities. Total does not equal sum of data for each year due to rounding.\n\n19 Labor-related human rights are defined as modern slavery, working hours, pay, and safety. Assure based on key performance metrics based on evidence and analysis of published disclosures, mandated data submittals, certifications, audits, etc.\nExcludes new hires joining HP after February 1, 2021 (although all new hires are given 30 days to complete Integrity at HP New Hire training as part of their mandatory onboarding process).\n\nOur programs aim to accelerate digital equity through providing access to at least one of the following hardware, connectivity, content, or digital literacy.\n\nWe enable better learning outcomes by supporting education through provision of learning and digital literacy programs and solutions.\n\nIncludes valuation of employee volunteer hours, employee donations, HP Foundation match, and HP Foundation grants.\n\nThis ESG materiality assessment followed the \u201cdouble materiality\u201d principle, which considers both how topics impact a company and how the company impacts the environmental, social, and economic aspects of those topics.\n\nCarbon and water footprint data presented in this section related to our production suppliers (except for HP brand paper) is calculated using product life cycle assessment-based estimates for materials extraction through manufacturing and product transportation. Production supplier GHG emissions and water withdrawal data presented on page 44 is based on a different methodology. See Methodological updates on page 15 for more detail.\n\nMethodological updates to improve the accuracy of our carbon footprint calculations also impacted calculations in the following water footprint categories: water consumption in HP supply chain\u2014direct use in operations, water consumption in HP supply chain associated with the generation of electricity, and water consumption associated with the generation of electricity used by HP products. Please see Methodological updates on page 15 for more detail.\n\nAs a percentage of U.S. personnel with the title of Executive, formerly called Vice President.\n\nIncludes new hires joining HP after February 1, 2021 (although all new hires are given 30 days to complete Integrity at HP New Hire training as part of their mandatory onboarding process).\n\nIncludes new hires joining HP after February 1, 2021 (although all new hires are given 30 days to complete Integrity at HP New Hire training as part of their mandatory onboarding process).\n\nIncludes new hires joining HP after February 1, 2021 (although all new hires are given 30 days to complete Integrity at HP New Hire training as part of their mandatory onboarding process).\n\nIncludes new hires joining HP after February 1, 2021 (although all new hires are given 30 days to complete Integrity at HP New Hire training as part of their mandatory onboarding process).\nSupplier diversity\n\n1 Data is for the 12 months ending September 30 of the year noted. Figures are for purchases in the United States and Puerto Rico from U.S.-based businesses. Suppliers are categorized as minority-owned or women-owned, not both. These categories include all sizes of businesses.\n\n2 HP\u2019s allocatable indirect spend is calculated based on suppliers\u2019 spending with diverse suppliers and their dollar volume of HP\u2019s business compared to their total revenue.\n\nEnvironmental impact\n\n1 Intensity is calculated as the portion of first-tier production and product transportation suppliers\u2019 reported GHG emissions attributable to HP, divided by HP\u2019s annual revenue. This method normalizes performance based on business productivity. Intensity is reported as a three-year rolling average to decrease the impact of variance year over year and highlight longer-term trends. Production supplier GHG emissions include Scope 1 and Scope 2.\n\n2 This continues a goal from before the separation of Hewlett-Packard Company on November 1, 2015, extending the goal to 2025. Includes data from suppliers associated with HP Inc. and HP Inc. pre-separation business units.\n\n3 HP estimates supplier GHG emissions avoided based on supplier-reported energy savings from specific energy efficiency projects (compared to projected energy use without those projects) and supplier use of zero-emissions energy. This energy data is converted into GHG emissions avoided using emission factors for electricity and fuel types. This data also includes estimates of product transportation-related GHG emissions avoided, related to specific initiatives to improve product transportation efficiency.\n\n4 Ibid.\n\n5 These are the total GHG emissions reductions and financial savings reported by suppliers through CDP; not amounts attributable to HP.\n\n6 Based on HP consumer and commercial PCs and displays shipped in 2021. 100% renewable electricity achieved by purchasing both Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) and International Renewable Energy Credits (IRECs) as defined by EPEAT\u00ae.\n\n7 Due to COVID-19, in limited cases SmartWay partners were not available during 2021.\n\nPerformance monitoring and evaluation\n\n1 These include child labor, forced labor, severe forms of discrimination, health and safety issues posing immediate danger to life or risk of serious injury, and perceived violation of environmental laws posing serious and immediate harm to the community. We take such findings very seriously and require suppliers to cease all related practices and report corrective actions taken within 30 days of the original audit. Recruitment fees must be reimbursed within 90 days of discovery and are verified by an on-site inspection within 180 days of discovery. We follow up closely to ensure that all required corrective actions are completed, and visit sites to confirm resolution. Immediate priority findings do not necessarily involve termination of the supplier; we work with suppliers as appropriate to improve their performance and worker conditions in these areas.\n\n2 Immediate priority findings (14 in 2021) include child labor, forced labor, severe forms of discrimination, health and safety issues posing immediate danger to life or risk of serious injury, and perceived violation of environmental laws posing serious and immediate harm to the community. Prior to 2020, we reported non-immediate priority nonconformances and major nonconformances together as major nonconformances. Starting in 2020, to more fully align with RBA Protocol 6.0 definitions, HP began distinguishing non-immediate priority nonconformances from major nonconformances and referring to those as \u201cother nonconformances.\u201d In 2021, the 528 other nonconformances identified included all non-immediate priority nonconformances (96.4% of the total) and all major nonconformances (3.6% of the total) as defined by the RBA Protocol 6.0 and 7.0.\n\nOperations\n\nOur employees\n\n1 As of October 31, 2021.\n\n2 McKinsey & Company, 2020, \u201cDiversity wins: How inclusion matters\u201d, https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters.\n\n3 \u201cLeadership\u201d is defined as director level and up at HP.\n\n4 Annually, HP employees fill out a survey called Voice Insight Action (VIA) to help us understand overall employee engagement, including their sense of belonging in the company.\n\n5 As a percentage of U.S. personnel with the title of Executive, formerly called Vice President.\n\n6 As of October 31, 2021.\n\n7 Ibid.\n\n8 Estimate is based on 1.09 million hours of formal organized learning, 0.55 million hours of self-directed learning, and more than 0.11 million hours of manufacturing and technology training.\n\n9 In the United States, the minimum amount of vacation time for salaried exempt employees is three weeks per year.

In 2021, more than US$7.5 billion in retained, existing, and new sales was tied in some way to HP\u2019s accessibility programs.\nLetter from our President and CEO\n\nFrom our earliest days as a company, HP has been a place where innovation drives extraordinary contributions to humanity.\n\nWe are confronting a set of global challenges that are testing the very foundation on which our society is built. From an ongoing pandemic to our accelerating climate crisis to persistent inequality, these challenges impact all of us. And the way we respond will help shape our future in profound and lasting ways.\n\nCompanies like ours have a critical role to play in helping solve these challenges. That\u2019s why, in 2021, we announced one of the most comprehensive environmental and social impact agendas in our industry\u2014with aggressive goals focused on climate action, human rights, and digital equity. And we have been taking decisive action to meet them.\n\nIn our 21st annual Sustainable Impact report, we share the progress we are making. There are areas where we are leading but also opportunities for us to do more. Our teams are operating with the deep sense of urgency needed to make continuous improvements, while forging partnerships to maximize our impact. While no single company, sector, or even country can solve the enormous global challenges before us, we know we can create a better future by working together.\n\nClimate Action\n\nOf all the challenges facing the world, none is greater than our climate crisis. And so, we set an ambitious climate goal: By 2040, HP\u2019s entire value chain\u2014Scope 1, 2, and 3\u2014will reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, with a 50% reduction in absolute emissions by the end of this decade. We\u2019ve already achieved a 9% absolute reduction since 2019\u2014but we know we must move faster. So, we\u2019re rethinking our materials, as well as how to keep them in circular use, and how to reduce our footprint.\n\nWe\u2019ve made significant progress in reducing plastic waste and using more recycled plastic. We have reduced single-use plastic packaging by 44% compared to 2018. And we have increased the use of postconsumer recycled content plastic across our personal systems and print product portfolio to 13%, as we aim for 30% by 2025.\n\nWe also are disrupting the US$10 billion fiber-based sustainable packaging market, with our 3D-printing enabled HP Molded Fiber Advanced Tooling Solution and acquisition of Choose Packaging, the inventor of the only known commercially available zero-plastic paper bottles.\n\nWe are partnering with leading conservation and environmental organizations, including the World Wildlife Fund, Conservation International, the Arbor Day Foundation, and the Jane Goodall Institute, to invest in forest restoration and responsible management to counteract deforestation for non-HP paper used in HP printers and print services. Since 2020, all HP brand paper and paper-based packaging for home and office printers and supplies, PCs, and displays have been derived from recycled or certified sources.\n\nFinally, we are broadening our impact by engaging our hundreds of production suppliers and thousands of non-production suppliers in sustainability programs. In early 2022, we expanded our Amplify Impact channel partner program to empower more than 10,000 partners in over 40 countries to advance their own sustainable impact journeys.\n\nCONTINUED >>\n\nCOVER IMAGE: EMPOWERING GIRLS\nHP partner, Girl Rising, uses the power of storytelling to highlight the connection between girls\u2019 education and climate change.\n\n2021 HP Sustainable Impact Report Executive Summary\n\nRead more in the 2021 HP Sustainable Impact Report\nLetter from our President and CEO\n\nHuman Rights\nEven as we work to deepen our impact, we are focused on expanding the diversity of our workforce. Building a diverse and inclusive workforce is not only the right thing to do\u2014it also makes good business sense. Diverse teams will always out-innovate and out-perform the market.\n\nWe aim to double the number of Black and African American HP executives by 2025 and reach 50/50 gender equality in leadership by 2030. And while HP is among the top technology companies for women in leadership positions\u2014and nearly 45% of our U.S. hires in 2021 were racial/ethnic minorities\u2014we are exploring ways to improve inclusive representation at all levels.\n\nDigital Equity\nWe are also committed to helping break down the barriers that exclude many from participating in the digital economy. Nearly 3 billion people around the world remain offline due to lack of access, affordability, or usability. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the depth of this issue and even exacerbated it, as many schools and businesses began operating remotely.\n\nThat\u2019s why, in 2021, we pledged to accelerate digital equity for 150 million people by the end of the decade\u2014a goal we aim to meet with the collaboration and support of key priority partners, like Girl Rising, NABU, MIT Solve, and Aspen Digital, through the Digital Equity Accelerator program launched in February 2022.\n\nBuilding a stronger HP\nFrom our earliest days as a company, HP has been a place where innovation drives extraordinary contributions to humanity. Time and again, our people have had the vision to see entirely new possibilities for the role we can play in the world\u2014and the ingenuity to create technology that inspires ambitious progress.\n\nThat vision and ingenuity is reflected in the progress we are making against our Sustainable Impact goals today. And the impact on the world\u2014and our business\u2014is clear. In fact, our Sustainable Impact initiatives helped the company win more than US$3.5 billion in new sales in fiscal year 2021\u2014a three-fold increase over the prior year. Simply put, when we innovate with purpose, we create the conditions for both business and society to thrive.\n\nI am inspired by the progress we are making toward becoming the world\u2019s most sustainable and just technology company. And I hope our success spurs other businesses to join us in creating the future we want to see\u2014for our companies, our families, and our communities.\n\nSaludos,\n\nEnrique Lores\nPresident and CEO\nSustainable Impact Strategy\n\nHP aims to be the world\u2019s most sustainable and just technology company.\n\nOur ambitious agenda is rooted in science and aligned to the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

Sustainability Bond Framework, we have allocated the nearly $1 billion of net proceeds from the Sustainability Bond to eligible projects during the period May 1, 2019\u2013October 31, 2021. No proceeds remain unallocated.\n\n3 Absolute reduction of Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions compared to 2019. Excludes non-HP paper consumed during product use.\n\n4 Percentage of HP\u2019s total annual product and packaging content, by weight, that will come from recycled and renewable materials and reused products and parts by 2030.\n\n5 Percentage of HP\u2019s total annual product and packaging content, by weight, that comes from recycled and renewable materials and reused products and parts. 2021 data does not include the following products or packaging for these products: PageWide Industrial and 3D printing products; and personal systems accessories and print accessories sold separately.\n\n6 Fiber by weight will be 1) certified to rigorous third-party standards, 2) recycled or 3) balanced by forest restoration, protection, and other initiatives through HP\u2019s Forest Positive Framework.\n\n7 HP brand paper and paper-based packaging for home and office printers and supplies, PCs, and displays are derived from certified and recycled sources, with a preference for Forest Stewardship Council\u00ae (FSC\u00ae) certification. Packaging is the box that comes with the product and all paper-based materials inside the box.\n\n8 We calculate the annual tonnage for paper used in our products and print services that will be addressed through projects with civil society forestry organizations to counteract possible deforestation by taking the estimated annual total tonnage of paper consumed in the use of our printing products and print services minus the weight of such paper that we mitigate internally, through our responsible sourcing programs. Non-HP paper represented 96% of our total fiber footprint during 2021. See HP Forest positive accounting manual.\n\n9 All HP brand paper is derived from certified sources; paper-based packaging for PCs, displays, home and office print, and supplies is reported by suppliers as recycled or certified with a minimum of 97% by volume verified by HP. Packaging is the box that comes with the product and all paper-based materials inside the box. Packaging for commercial, industrial, and 3D products, scanners, personal systems accessories, and spare parts is not included.\n\n10 The 2021 Sustainable Impact Report reflects several methodological updates to improve the accuracy of our carbon footprint calculations and to align with our 2030 GHG emissions reduction goal. See details here.\n\n11 HP estimates supplier GHG emissions avoided based on supplier-reported energy savings from specific energy efficiency projects (compared to projected energy use without those projects) and supplier use of zero emissions energy. These energy data are converted into GHG emissions avoided using emission factors for electricity and fuel types. This data also includes estimates of product transportation-related GHG emissions avoided, related to specific initiatives to improve product transportation efficiency.\n\n12 Product use GHG emissions intensity describes the performance of our portfolio, taking into account changes to product mix and business growth. HP product use GHG emissions intensity measures per unit GHG emissions during anticipated product lifetime use. These values are then weighted by contribution of personal systems and printing products to overall revenue in the current year. These emissions represent more than 99% of HP product units shipped each year, including notebooks, tablets, desktops, mobile computing devices, workstations, and displays; HP inkjet, LaserJet, DesignJet, Indigo, Scitex, and Jet Fusion 3D printers; and scanners. Although HP updated its carbon footprint calculation methodology in 2021 (see the methodological updates box on page 15 of the 2021 HP Sustainable Impact Report here), we continue to calculate this metric using the original methodology, for comparability with past years.\n\n13 As of October 31, 2021\n\n14 As of December 31, 2021. Not all products are available in all countries. Since 2016, we have been working hard to tackle the growing challenge of ocean-bound plastics (OBP), supporting the creation of a robust local OBP supply chain in Haiti and incorporating small quantities of OBP into the design and manufacture of more than 300 of our products, using a total of 1,290 tonnes of OBP to date.\n\n15 Recycled content plastic (RCP) as a percentage of total plastic used in all HP personal systems, printer hardware, and print cartridges shipped during the reporting year. Total volume excludes brand-licensed products and after-market hardware accessories. Total RCP includes post-consumer recycled plastic, closed-loop plastic, and ocean-bound plastics used in HP products. Personal systems plastic is defined by EPEAT\u00ae eco label criteria. Subject to relevant restrictions on the use and distribution of materials destined for recycling and/or recycled feedstocks.\n\n16 Calculated as the percentage of primary plastic packaging (by weight) reduced per unit shipped. Excludes secondary and tertiary packaging components. Includes HP personal systems and printer hardware packaging. Does not include packaging for the following: Graphics Solutions hardware other than PageWide XL and DesignJet printers; 3D printing hardware; print supplies; refurbished products; and accessories such as third-party options, drop in box, and aftermarket options.\n17 All HP brand paper is derived from certified sources; paper-based packaging for PCs, displays, home and office print, and supplies is reported by suppliers as recycled or certified with a minimum of 97% by volume verified by HP. Packaging is the box that comes with the product and all paper-based materials inside the box. Packaging for commercial, industrial, and 3D products, scanners, personal systems accessories, and spare parts is not included.\n\n18 October 1, 2020\u2013September 30, 2021. See HP Forest positive accounting manual for details about our program, methodology, and definitions.\n\n19 This replaces and expands on our prior goal to develop skills and improve the wellbeing of 500,000 factory workers by 2025, since the beginning of 2015. Progress through 2021 against that goal includes a total of 349,000 factory workers: 77,800 factory workers in 2015; 45,700 in 2016; 119,900 in 2017; 12,000 in 2018; 11,000 in 2019; 46,000 in 2020; and 37,000 in 2021. Prior to 2020, data included production supplier workers only. In 2020, we expanded the scope of our program to also include nonproduction supplier workers and workers at HP-controlled manufacturing facilities. Total does not equal sum of data for each year due to rounding.\n\n20 Labor-related human rights are defined as modern slavery, working hours, pay, and safety. Assure based on key performance metrics based on evidence and analysis of published disclosures, mandated data submittals, certifications, audits, etc.\n\n21 \u201cLeadership\u201d is defined as director level and up at HP.\n\n22 As a percentage of U.S. personnel with the title of Executive, formerly called Vice President.\n\n23 Board of Directors data for 2021 are as of the conclusion of the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders on April 19, 2022. Board of Directors data for 2020 are as of the conclusion of the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders on April 13, 2021. Board of Directors data for 2019 are as of November 1, 2019. Other data are as of October 31 of the year noted. Employee data refers to regular full-time and part-time employees.\n\n24 Data refers to the percentage of HP 2021 Voice Insight Action (VIA) employee survey respondents who strongly agreed or agreed with each statement.\n\n25 Data is for the 12 months ending September 30, 2021. Figures are for purchases in the United States and Puerto Rico from U.S.-based businesses. Suppliers are categorized as minority-owned or women-owned, not both. Diverse businesses are those owned by women, minorities, veterans, service-disabled veterans, LGBTQ+ individuals, and aboriginal or indigenous individuals.\n\n26 Goods and services produced by HP\u2019s diverse suppliers and their supply chains.\n\n27 This data does not include participation in RBA audits. Participation in our supply chain sustainability programs is quantified by those programs that go beyond audits to build supplier capabilities to meet our standards. This includes deep-dive assessment, weekly reporting of labor metrics, procurement engagement through our supplier Sustainability Scorecard, and in-depth coaching and workshops tailored to supplier risks.\n\n28 Retained, existing, and new sales are tracked through internal HP processes that identify customer requests related to sustainability and supply chain responsibility. Sales values take into account total contract values.\n\n29 We enable better learning outcomes by supporting education through provision of learning and digital literacy programs and solutions.\n\n30 Our programs aim to accelerate digital equity through providing access to at least one of the following: hardware, connectivity, content, or digital literacy.\n\n31 Includes valuation of employee volunteer hours, employee donations, HP Foundation match, and HP Foundation grants.\n\nBACK COVER IMAGE: CIRCULAR MODEL\n10,300 tonnes of Original HP and Samsung toner cartridges recycled in 2021.\nForward Looking Statement\n\nThis document contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties.
