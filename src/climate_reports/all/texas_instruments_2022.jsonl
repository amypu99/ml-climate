With each generation, semiconductor technology has become smaller, more efficient and more affordable, and today, our products are helping customers to develop electronics and new applications that are contributing to a more sustainable future.\n\nOur founders had the foresight to know that building a great company required a special culture to thrive for the long term. For many years, we have run our business with three overarching ambitions in mind:\n\n\u2022 First, we will act like owners who will own the company for decades.\n\u2022 Second, we will adapt and succeed in a world that is ever changing.\n\u2022 And third, we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and that we would want as our neighbor.\n\nWith these ambitions guiding our decision-making for the long term and our products helping to create a better world, we are confident that our collective efforts will be impactful and long-lasting. We take great pride in our commitment to being a good corporate citizen, which impacts our communities and the world in two ways:\n\nFirst, our ambitions guide how we run our business and are foundational to ensuring that we operate in a sustainable, socially thoughtful and environmentally responsible manner. Central to these ambitions is a belief that in order for all stakeholders to benefit, the company must grow stronger over the long term.\n\nSecond, semiconductors will play a critical role in creating a better world and helping to reduce the impact on the environment.\n\nAs engineers, we are fortunate to work on exciting technology that helps our customers innovate to create a better world. Our semiconductor products are powering sustainable technology around the world, such as electric vehicles and renewable energy applications, and helping to make a positive impact in a growing number of ways.\n\nIn 2022, despite the ongoing global challenges related to the pandemic and resulting supply chain disruptions, TI maintained a focus on keeping our employees safe, keeping our factories running, adding capacity to support customer demand and giving back to our communities when needs continued to be great.\n\nI am proud of how TIers adapted and performed in 2022. We have learned through the decades that challenging years are when our ambitions are most critical in guiding our decisions and when TIers rise to the challenge.\n\nYou can count on us to stay true to our ambitions: to think like owners for the long term, adapt and succeed in a world that\u2019s ever changing and behave in a way that makes our stakeholders proud. When we\u2019re successful, our employees, customers, communities and shareholders all win.\n\nHaviv Ilan\nPresident and CEO\nReport overview\n\nSince 2006, TI has published program information, goals, progress on goals and relevant data \u2013 including a focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) and sustainability priorities \u2013 as part of its commitment to being a good corporate citizen.\n\nAs with previous years, our 2022 Corporate Citizenship Report provides insight into how we think about \u2013 and how we perform \u2013 in various ESG areas relevant to our business using these widely accepted reporting frameworks:\n\n- The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)\u00b2\n- The Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\u00b3\n- The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)\u2074\n\nIn addition, we participate in the CDP\u2075 Climate Change and Water Security questionnaires and make both available at TI.com/ccr.\n\nTo strengthen our reporting, we solicit input from internal and external stakeholders year-round, examine third-party sustainability assessments and benchmark trends and best practices. We then compare these inputs to our company priorities to determine what topics and disclosures to include in our annual Corporate Citizenship Report.\n\nOur commitment to corporate citizenship\n\nWe take great pride in being a good corporate citizen, which impacts our communities and the world in two ways:\n\n- First, our ambitions guide how we run our business and are foundational to ensuring that we operate in a sustainable, socially thoughtful and environmentally responsible manner. Central to these ambitions is a belief that in order for all stakeholders to benefit, the company must grow stronger over the long term.\n- Second, semiconductors will play a critical role in creating a better world and helping reduce environmental impacts.\n\n\u00b2The GRI is an independent, international organization that helps businesses take responsibility for their impacts by providing them with a global common language to communicate those impacts.\n\u00b3The Financial Stability Board established the TCFD to develop recommendations for more effective climate-related disclosures that could promote more informed investment, credit and insurance underwriting decisions.\n\u2074The SASB is an independent nonprofit organization that sets standards to guide companies\u2019 disclosure of sustainability information to their investors.\n\u2075The CDP is a nonprofit that runs the global disclosure system for investors, companies, cities, states and regions to manage their environmental impacts.\n2022 highlights\n\nWe take great pride in being a good corporate citizen with a long-standing commitment to responsible, sustainable manufacturing.\n\nCreating a sustainable future\n\nIn 2022, TI continued to drive efficiencies in its fabrication processes and equipment to reduce energy, material and water consumption, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.*\n\n- 23% reduction in Scope 1 & Scope 2 GHG emissions (vs 2015)\n- 28% reduction in energy use per chip (vs 2015)\n- 3.2% reduction in water use\n- 90% waste diverted from landfills\n\n* TI\u2019s goals and commitments can be found in the company\u2019s annual Corporate Citizenship Report.\n\nWorking at TI\n\nWe bring together 33,000 of the world\u2019s smartest people to create a better world by making electronics more affordable through semiconductors.\n\n- 30+ honors for D&I and talent development\n- 15 employee resource groups\n- 50.7 average learning hours per TIer\n\nBuilding stronger communities\n\nOur ambition to be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and want as our neighbor guides our work to build stronger communities.\n\n- $52.6 million in giving by TI, the TI Foundation, employees, retirees and other giving\n- 257,000 hours of employee and retiree time donated to helping others\nEnvironmental sustainability\nReducing environmental impact\n\nTI takes great pride in being a good corporate citizen and has a long-standing commitment to responsible, sustainable manufacturing. We produced our first Corporate Citizenship Report in 2006, and we remain committed to our long-term environmental sustainability programs of conserving natural resources, reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and mitigating climate change.\n\nAs a semiconductor company that manufactures billions of chips per year, we believe that it is important to drive efficiencies in our fabrication process. Multi-year sustainability goals guide our work (see the next page), and we strive to efficiently manufacture chips to reduce energy use, GHG emissions, water use and the generation of landfill waste.\n\nTI semiconductor products are and will increasingly play a critical role in helping reduce the impact on the environment. Our semiconductors are helping customers to develop smaller, more efficient and affordable technology that makes electrification, renewable energy and energy storage solutions possible.\n\nProgress\n\nOver the past several years, TI has made progress in conserving energy and water, reducing energy consumption per chip, diverting landfill waste and working toward our long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and scope 2 absolute GHG emissions by 25% from a 2015 base year by 2025.\n\nIn 2022, we experienced slight year-over-year increases in consumption and emissions as TI\u2019s production increased. This was because of continued customer demand throughout the year, and ramping two new 300-millimeter factories in Richardson, Texas, and Lehi, Utah.\n\nDespite our operational growth, we remain committed to reducing our environmental impact. We invest in hundreds of projects every year aimed at reducing that impact, such as using advanced manufacturing tools and technologies; signing multiyear solar and wind power contracts to deliver renewable electricity in Texas; and installing a solar roof at our site in Bangalore, India.\n\n2022 per-chip efficiency improvements\n\nFor more than a decade, TI has driven efficiencies in its fabrication processes and equipment to reduce environmental impacts. We measure and track normalized, or per-chip data, for GHG emissions, energy, water and material consumption as a way of assessing the overall resource efficiency of our manufacturing process.\n\nBy comparing normalized data, we can account for the resources and emissions associated with the production of a single chip and see how that has improved over time. When comparing our per-chip data from 2010 to 2022, we have significantly reduced manufacturing-related impacts and resource consumption.\n\n2010-2022: Per-chip efficiency improvements\nEnvironmental commitments\n\nTI implements programs to reduce energy, material and water consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). The following table summarizes the progress we are making toward our reduction goals.\n\n| Focus | Goal | Progress by Year-End 2022 |\n|-------|------|---------------------------|\n| Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions | TI actions to reduce emissions: | By year-end 2025: |\n| | \u2022 Use alternative gases and chemicals with lower global warming potential. | 25% reduction in absolute scope 1 and scope 2 emissions from a 2015 base year*. |\n| | \u2022 Install emissions abatement devices. | 23% reduction in GHG emissions. |\n| | \u2022 Purchase electricity from renewable energy sources. | |\n| | \u2022 Optimize product manufacturing, shipping and distribution. | |\n| | \u2022 Avoid unnecessary business travel and subsidize employee commuting at certain sites. | |\n| Energy | TI actions to reduce energy consumption: | By year-end 2025: |\n| | \u2022 Design and operate buildings and fabrication sites to optimize efficiency and achieve Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification7 for all new buildings. | 50% reduction in energy intensity per chip from a 2015 base year. |\n| | \u2022 Upgrade and refurbish tools and equipment. | 28% reduction in energy intensity per chip. |\n| | \u2022 Use sensors and other automated controls. | |\n| | \u2022 Implement routine energy conservation projects. | |\n| Water | TI actions to reduce water consumption: | In 2022, conserve: |\n| | \u2022 Improve the efficiency of our deionized water plants through actions such as optimizing the recovery rates of our reverse-osmosis filters. | 3.4% equivalent of 2021 total water usage in 2022. |\n| | \u2022 Reduce manufacturing tool water use by optimizing flow rates. | 3.2% reduction in water use. |\n| | \u2022 Identify additional manufacturing tools where water can be reused in other processes. | |\n| | \u2022 Expand the use of microfilters and ultrafilters to recover more wastewater. | |\n| Waste and material management | TI applies a three-step approach to waste and material management: | In 2022, divert: |\n| | \u2022 Examine what we need. | 90% of solid waste materials generated from landfills. |\n| | \u2022 Reuse what we can. | 90% materials diverted from landfills. |\n| | \u2022 Recycle what is allowed. | |\n\n*TI adjusted its 2015 GHG emissions baseline from 2,471,357 to 2,832,709 MTCO2e in the 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report to reflect structural changes to its operations in line with the guidance provided by the WBCSD/WRI\u2019s The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard.\n\n7LEED is the most widely used green building rating system in the world.\nGreenhouse gas emissions\n\nOur commitment to reducing GHG emissions\n\nTI sets GHG emission and energy reduction goals to reduce environmental impacts and improve efficiencies. By 2025, TI aims to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 25% from a 2015 base year.\n\nOur organizational boundary includes TI manufacturing sites, larger non-manufacturing sites, and support facilities subject to contracts considered embedded leases by us for financial accounting purposes. Our operational boundary includes scope 1 and scope 2 emissions from these sites and facilities, as applicable.\n\nActions we are taking\n\nWe have taken steps to reduce GHG emissions in our operations, shipping and distribution, and through our supply chain for years.\n\nScope 1\n\nTI directly emits scope 1 GHG emissions from gases used in the manufacturing process and fuels consumed on-site, such as natural gas and diesel. We are working to reduce these emissions by:\n\n- Installing newer, more efficient manufacturing tools and technologies.\n- Eliminating nonessential fluorinated gases and using alternative gases and chemicals.\n- Installing thermal point-of-use abatement devices on some tools that treat the exhaust gases used in semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nScope 2\n\nTI indirectly emits scope 2 GHG emissions from electricity purchased for manufacturing or other operations. We are working to reduce these emissions by:\n\n- Purchasing and securing renewable energy sources around the world.\n- Increasing the energy efficiency of our manufacturing systems, buildings and tools.\n\nScope 3\n\nTI\u2019s supply chain, employee travel and commuting, and product distribution network generate scope 3 GHG emissions. We lessen these impacts by:\n\n- Encouraging suppliers to optimize their production and operational efficiencies.\n- Shipping items in bulk from regional distribution centers to reduce the number of shipments and transportation-related emissions.\n- Limiting business travel and providing videoconferencing capabilities.\n- Providing on-site electric vehicle charging stations, shuttles and biking infrastructure.\n- Subsidizing mass transit and carpooling at select sites.\n\nWe continue to estimate and calculate the value chain emissions that are most relevant to TI in line with the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard, a supplement to the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard.\n\nMonitoring potential risks\n\nTI faces potential risks and opportunities associated with climate change, which are described in detail in its TI\u2019s 2023 CDP Climate Change response. Our CDP response, the Emissions section of the GRI Index and our TCFD Index also contain information about our climate change-related governance and management strategies.\n\nPerformance\n\nAs of year-end 2022, TI\u2019s scope 1 and 2 absolute emissions were down 23% since 2015. For additional GHG data, see our Performance Data Appendix.\nEnergy\n\nOur commitment to reducing energy intensity per chip\n\nTI\u2019s global operations, and design, manufacturing, assembly and test sites focus on lowering energy consumption and associated GHG emissions by setting annual reduction goals and implementing efficiency projects. TI has a goal to reduce energy use per chip by 50% at worldwide manufacturing sites by year-end 2025 from a 2015 base year. We have progressed 28% toward this goal at the end of 2022.\n\nActions we are taking\n\nTI implements more than 200 projects each year to reduce energy throughout its operations. These have helped us conserve 320-gigawatt hours (GWh) of energy over the last five years, even as our production increased by 25% during the same period.\n\nWe focus most of our efforts on our manufacturing operations because they account for over 90% of our total energy use. Other ways we save energy include:\n\n- Designing and operating buildings and fabrication sites to optimize efficiency and achieve LEED certification.\n- Upgrading and refurbishing tools and equipment.\n- Using sensors and other automated controls.\n- Improving control and optimizing set points of our chilled water plants.\n- Installing energy-efficient LED lighting, fans and drive mechanisms for our air-handling systems.\n\nPerformance\n\nBecause of increased production, TI consumed 3.75 TWh of energy in 2022, up from 3.19 TWh in 2021. For additional energy data, see our Performance Data Appendix.\n\nFor more information about how TI manages energy use, see the Energy section of the GRI Index.\n\nRenewable energy\n\nTI is committed to increasing renewable energy use in the coming years as part of its GHG emissions reduction goal. TI secures reliable energy supplies, including renewable resources where available, that are cost-effective and align with business needs and objectives.\n\nIn late 2022, TI started:\n\n- Receiving 47 megawatts (MW) of solar power for its North Texas operations, backed by a 15-year contract. In early 2023, we added 18MW of additional wind power through an 11-year contract.\n- Using its first significant rooftop solar system in Bangalore, India.\n\nWe measure energy use per chip output, or intensity, to assess the overall energy efficiency of our manufacturing processes.\n\nERM CVS provided limited assurance verification of TI\u2019s energy and renewable electricity use for 2022.\n\nWhile the North Texas project came online in December 2022, renewable energy generated in that month is not included in the total renewable energy number of 2022. While renewable energy procurement and use increased in 2022, the percentage of renewable electricity compared to total electricity decreased due to expanded production with new factories coming online.\nOur commitment to water conservation\n\nTI has a particular focus on using water responsibly and efficiently. Conserving processed and potable water and treating and recycling wastewater enables us to reduce costs and promote long-term availability. We maintain and optimize our wastewater treatment systems to comply with regulations and permit limits.\n\nIn 2022, we implemented water reduction projects that saved an annualized amount of water equal to 3.2% of our 2021 usage versus our goal of 3.4%.\n\nActions we are taking\n\nAnnually, TI implements projects to reduce overall water use throughout its operations. To improve water efficiency, TI:\n\n- Invests in reduction, recycling and reuse projects.\n- Optimizes the efficiency of deionized water plants, improving the recovery rates of reverse-osmosis filters.\n- Reduces manufacturing tool water use by optimizing flow rates and identifying where to reuse water in other processes.\n- Uses additional microfilters and ultrafilters to recover more wastewater.\n- Maximizes the amount of condensate and microfiltration water directed to cooling towers.\n- Purifies and recycles higher-quality production water back to the inputs of ultra-pure water plants.\n\nMonitoring water quality\n\nWe regularly monitor water withdrawal quality at our manufacturing facilities and conduct regular testing to maintain internal standards. Our manufacturing facilities also track water discharge quality by standard effluent parameters.\n\nManaging wastewater\n\nTI has internal standards, programs and procedures to ensure that wastewater produced by all sites complies with local, state and national discharge requirements. Parameters evaluated by each site are standard for the semiconductor industry and typically include biological oxygen demand, total suspended solids, metals, pH and temperature. We also:\n\n- Restrict or remove substances such as metals, toxic organic compounds, nitrates and sulfides from wastewater before discharge.\n- Collect wastewater sludge containing solvents, concentrated metals or acid solutions and dispose of them off-site per regulatory requirements. In some cases, we send these compounds to reclamation facilities for reuse by other industries.\n- Conduct required wastewater sampling to ensure operation within our permit limits.\n\nPerformance\n\nWhile overall water use increased by 19% over 2021 as production increased to support our customers, we conserved more than 174 million gallons and reused 25%, or nearly 2.2 billion gallons, of all water consumed. For additional water data, see our Performance Data Appendix.\n\nTo learn more about our water and effluent management strategies, see TI\u2019s 2022 CDP Water Security response and the Water and Wastewater section of the GRI Index.\nWaste and material management\n\nOur commitment to reducing landfill waste\nTI responsibly manages the use and disposal of materials and chemicals to protect the environment and reduce landfill waste. TI aims to divert 90% of materials from landfills to reduce environmental impacts.\n\nActions we are taking\nWe properly dispose of waste and materials that we cannot recycle or reuse according to applicable federal, state and local laws, and make every effort to:\n\nStep 1: Examine what we need.\nMost of the materials we need are for fabricating semiconductors. When purchasing materials and chemicals, we consider the resulting waste, and whether an opportunity exists to reuse existing materials, purchase recycled materials or use environmentally friendly items instead.\n\nStep 2: Reuse what we can.\nWe reuse materials and chemicals by:\n\n\u2022 Recovering metals from solids, liquids, scrap wafers and other materials.\n\u2022 Repurposing and reselling used and surplus chemicals, chemical containers and older manufacturing equipment.\n\u2022 Reusing wafer carriers and food service tableware.\n\nStep 3: Recycle what is allowed.\nOur recyclable material and chemicals come primarily from our offices and manufacturing sites. These are managed and regulated differently depending on local requirements.\n\nManaging chemicals and gas use\nManufacturing semiconductors involves using hazardous and nonhazardous chemicals and gases, which is why TI\u2019s product-management systems have stringent controls in place. We continually:\n\n\u2022 Identify and use the safest, lowest-risk materials in operations to protect TIers, site communities and consumers. Where possible, we use high-pressure water instead of chemicals in certain cleanup applications or replace chemicals with environmentally benign substitutes.\n\u2022 Screen all incoming materials and chemicals before incorporating them into semiconductor manufacturing processes to comply with regulatory and customer requirements. We also incorporate any chemical restrictions and standards into supplier contracts.\n\u2022 Assess potential environmental, safety and health (ESH) impacts of materials as new scientific information becomes available and new regulations go into effect.\n\u2022 Follow strict standards and protocols for responsibly purchasing, transporting, tracking and disposing of chemicals safely.\n\u2022 Provide specific procedures and training for the use, labeling, storage and disposal of chemicals or hazardous substances, including the proper use of personal protective equipment.\n\u2022 Use ventilation controls, abatement systems, leak detectors and appropriate treatment technologies.\n\nIf concerns about a material or chemical arise during our screening process, we elevate the matter to our review board, comprising internal subject-matter experts. If a material or chemical is necessary for manufacturing but still raises concerns, our manufacturing leaders review the situation and, if necessary, seek a safer alternative or implement more stringent use controls.\n\nTransparency on material content\nWe give customers documents and tools that outline measures we take to ensure that our products comply with global material restrictions and regulations. These include:\n\n\u2022 Controlled Chemical and Materials Specifications.\n\u2022 TI-restricted chemicals and materials.\n\u2022 TI\u2019s approach to environmental and product stewardship.\n\u2022 A search tool to find material content; download restricted chemical test reports; or locate products\u2019 RoHS, REACH and green status.\n\u2022 Quality, reliability and packaging data.\n\u2022 Lead-free conversions.\n\u2022 Low Halogen (Green) Statement.\n\u2022 Environmental FAQs.\n\nPerformance\nWe diverted 90% of the 50,673 metric tons of waste and surplus materials generated in 2022 from landfills, meeting our goal.\n\nWe achieved this by reusing and recovering chemicals where viable; selling surplus chemicals; recycling certain waste for use in energy recovery, and recycling scrap wood, paper, glass, metals and organic materials. For additional data, see our Performance Data Appendix.\n\nSee the Materials section of the GRI Index for more information about how TI manages materials.\nProduct quality\n\nOur commitment to quality and support\n\nTI\u2019s holistic approach to quality permeates every aspect of the company\u2019s supply chain, from process technology and design through manufacturing, packaging, testing and delivery. We continuously improve our products and process technologies to deliver high-quality, reliable semiconductor solutions that meet our customers\u2019 needs.\n\nTo reduce environmental impacts and extend product longevity, we optimize the quality and reliability of our technologies. We measure customer returns, which assess our performance on both resolution cycle times and return parts per billion. These measures help maintain high levels of customer service and product quality and reliability.\n\nTo drive continuous improvement, we assess, categorize and aggregate the reason for each return to identify systemic improvement opportunities. More than 85% of TI products have yet to have a single customer return in three years.\n\nActions we are taking\n\nQuality and reliability\n\nEvery organization within TI works together to ensure quality and deliver reliable products. We continuously improve our products and process technologies to build reliable technologies that meet stringent quality standards for industrial (Joint Electron Device Engineering Council) and automotive (Automotive Electronics Council Q100) products. We use specialized materials and controls to build high-quality products, test silicon and package technologies and continuously monitor wafer-level reliability.\n\nWhen we start product qualification, we aim to have high, data-backed confidence that the product is fully reliable and will meet our customers\u2019 long-term quality needs.\n\nQuality and reliability permeate every corner of TI\n\nTI leverages various strategies to maintain quality and reliability. For example, our:\n\n- **Quality System Manual** describes quality-management processes and systems.\n- **Quality policy and procedures** provide a framework to identify and resolve quality issues quickly. We incorporate industry requirements and standards, along with customer specifications and feedback, to mitigate risks and drive improvement throughout a product\u2019s life cycle.\n- **Internal quality standards** help us comply with numerous industry standards and quality specifications, including International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001, ISO 14001, ISO 45001, International Standard for Automotive Quality Management Systems 16949 and the Underwriters Laboratories rating.\n- **Reliability testing** enhances or accelerates potential failure mechanisms, helps identify the root cause and reveals how to prevent failure modes.\n\nWe measure several product and service quality performance indicators to make continuous improvements.\n\nProduct longevity\n\nTo maintain product longevity and continuity of supply for our customers, we have life-cycle management policies and inventory and manufacturing strategies that enable us to sell and support products for a decade or more.\n\nTI\u2019s product life cycles are typically 10 to 15 years and often extend longer, consistent with many customers\u2019 requirements. We are committed to product longevity for our customers and have strategies and internal policies to uphold this commitment.\n\nNosa, a TI product marketing engineer, combines his passion for technology with his work to deliver high-quality solutions that meet our customers\u2019 needs.\nProduct logistics\n\nTI strives to pack and ship products efficiently to assure timely distribution to customers, comply with international shipping regulations and reduce environmental impact.\n\n**Actions we are taking**\n\nOur product distribution centers (PDCs) are mindful of plastic consumption and are giving plastic dunnage a second life as packaging for outbound shipments when feasible. We reuse and recycle various materials to cut down on packaging waste.\n\nFor example, we:\n\n- Pack large quantities of products into each shipment to eliminate multiple deliveries. We also increase packing density to move actual weights closer to charged dimensional weights.\n- Use air pillows in packaging that are recyclable, reusable and contain recycled content. Some of our PDCs use shredded cardboard dunnage made from discarded boxes to protect contents.\n- Work with our customers to understand their delivery needs and ship in bulk when possible. This practice enables us to ship mutually agreed-upon low-priority freight when space becomes available on more affordable shipping options.\n- Require that suppliers ship all new 300-mm wafers in reusable containers. When empty, we return these containers to the supplier for reuse or use them internally.\n- Reuse packing materials that protect products during shipment (such as bubble packs and foam); shipping materials (such as boxes, crates and pallets); cases that ship precious-metal reclaimable items to suppliers; and plastic reels used in product distribution. We reuse bubble wrap from our Education Technology business unit as dunnage for TI.com shipments.\n- Comply with the European Union (EU) Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment and EU Packaging and Packaging Waste recycling programs for evaluation modules imported into that region.\n- Place our PDCs in regions close to customers to accelerate delivery times, improve efficiency and facilitate product deliveries in the event of a disaster.\n- Eliminate heavy and expensive custom-cut foam, nonrecyclable foam, and foam and cardboard waste.\n- Use reusable metal containers instead of shipping boxes at some of our PDCs to eliminate plastic and cardboard waste.\n\nSee the [Marketing and Labeling section](#) of the GRI Index for more information about how TI manages product content labeling.\nResponsible business practices\nGovernance\n\nAt TI, we believe good corporate governance is important to our long-term success. We\u2019ve had written governance guidelines since 1973, refining them over the years to meet company and shareholders\u2019 needs.\n\nOur ambitions and core values are integral to building TI stronger, and we demonstrate responsible and ethical business practices by adhering to our stated principles.\n\nBoard of directors\n\nTI\u2019s board of directors is dedicated to responsible and effective corporate governance and oversees the company\u2019s global business strategy. It includes three committees \u2013 the audit committee, the compensation committee and the governance and stockholder relations committee.\n\nThe board discusses its governance practices annually to ensure they truly make sense for TI in today\u2019s business climate. Where ESG-related issues may have significance for TI, these matters are reviewed with the relevant committee. For example, the audit committee reviews the company\u2019s practices with respect to risk assessment and risk management, specifically including environmental-related risks. The governance and stockholder relations committee also oversees ESG matters in connection with its responsibility to review public issues of interest to company stakeholders.\n\nLearn more about TI\u2019s corporate governance:\n\n- Board Oversight of ESG Matters\n- Board of directors and committees\n- Corporate governance documents\n- 2023 Proxy Statement\n- 2022 Annual Report\n- 2022 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Form 10-K\n- General Disclosures section of the GRI Index\n\nAbout TI\u2019s board of directors\n\nAt year-end 2022, TI had a unitary board system with 12 board members, including 10 independent directors, whose leadership and diverse backgrounds bring a vast amount of experience and knowledge to our company.\n\nThe directors\u2019 combined strengths assist them as they oversee the company\u2019s current and future strategy, risks, and performance with the best interests of TI shareholder in mind.\n\nBoard diversity 2022\n\n| Gender | Age | Ethnicity |\n|--------|-----|-----------|\n| Female - 33% | Age \u2264 60 years - 33% | Black - ~8% |\n| Male - 67% | Age 61+ years - 67% | Hispanic - ~8% |\n| White - 75% | | Asian - ~8% |\n| | | |\nEthics and compliance\n\nOur founders had the foresight to know that building a great company required a special culture to thrive for the long term. At TI, we refer to culture as Living Our Values \u2013 ambitions, values and code of conduct, and it\u2019s how we operate daily.\n\nEvery TIer plays a critical role in upholding these principles, which we reinforce through leader involvement, employee engagement and training.\n\n**Actions we are taking**\n\nWe provide TIers, managers, and leaders the training and tools they need to help them make the right decisions, do business the right way and build a stronger company for the long term.\n\nEvery employee receives ethics and compliance training. The topics may vary, but over a multi-year cycle, they include TI\u2019s code of conduct, environmental, safety and health (ESH), confidential information protection, information technology security, avoiding workplace and sexual harassment, and other compliance topics.\n\nAdditionally, we train employees in specific roles in human rights policies, export compliance, anti-corruption, insider trading, global competition law and the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct.\n\nWe also engage managers on what it means to live our values and uphold our standards of ethical conduct by providing tools to reinforce our culture and ethics and compliance expectations within their organizations.\n\nOur GRI Index contains more information about our compliance with laws and regulations, anti-corruption, anti-competitive behavior and nondiscrimination practices.\n\n---\n\n**Our Code of Conduct**\n\nWe expect each TI employee to understand our code of conduct, which translates our ambitions and values into the standards we must uphold and provides clarity about the behaviors we will not tolerate.\n\nWhen a TIer sees behaviors inconsistent with our ambitions, values, code of conduct or policies, it is their responsibility to speak up. They can do so by talking to a manager or human resources, or by contacting the TI Ethics department directly or anonymously.\n\n**Direct contact:**\n- Email ethics@ti.com\n- Write to P.O.

These policies and practices define the activities we engage in and the responsibilities and practices of our political action committee (PAC).\n\nWe advocate for policies that help us attract talent, drive innovation and promote competitiveness. Our specific areas of policy interest include tax, trade, talent and racial equity. To these ends, we collaborate with various U.S. and international industry associations on policy objectives. We are more active in some organizations than others and may not align on all positions.\n\nTI\u2019s PAC is 100% employee-funded, regulated, transparent and nonpartisan. The TI PAC enables certain employees to voluntarily join together to support federal, state and local political candidates whose positions align with the company\u2019s business objectives.\n\nWe provide additional information and disclosures on TI.com about the company\u2019s political activities, TI\u2019s PAC, the political activity of employees, and related policies and expectations.\n\n---\n\n14TI chose not to make any corporate contributions to local ballot initiatives in 2019 and 2020. 2020 PAC contributions were impacted due to COVID-19.\nSupply chain responsibility\n\nTI requires suppliers to share its commitment to responsible and fair business practices throughout the supply chain. We will not knowingly engage with a supplier that violates our values or requirements.\n\nWe primarily buy materials for fabrication processes; factory equipment and maintenance; logistics services; and nonproduction supplies and services from approximately 8,600 suppliers of various types and sizes. We seek suppliers that help us scale as we grow; reduce total costs and waste; improve efficiencies; and deliver innovative services, materials and product support.\n\nOur worldwide procurement team coordinates the buying of goods and services, sets procurement strategies, identifies and vets qualified suppliers, negotiates terms and pricing and determines the best fulfillment methods.\n\nResponsible sourcing\n\nTI invests in driving sustainable and responsible business practices throughout its supply chain to mitigate business, labor and environmental risks. For example, we:\n\n- Collect and carefully consider a supplier\u2019s human rights practices and environmental and safety records before purchasing.\n- Specify performance requirements and expectations in our policies, contracts and purchase orders.\n- Engage with industry groups such as the Semiconductor Industry Association and Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International to discuss supply chain best practices and standards.\n\nRequirements and expectations\n\nOur supplier website includes TI\u2019s business requirements and standards for safe working conditions, labor and human rights protection, environmentally responsible operations and ethical behavior. We communicate these standards in our Supplier Code of Conduct, Supplier Ethics Expectations, Supplier Environmental and Social Responsibility Policy, Anti-Human Trafficking Statement and other governing documents.\n\nAs a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), an industry coalition dedicated to corporate social responsibility in global supply chains, TI also complies with the standards outlined in the RBA Code of Conduct.\n\nSupplier diversity\n\nIn the U.S., we actively pursue business opportunities with minority- and women-owned business enterprises (MWBEs) to drive economic equity and provide the company with unique, innovative, cost-effective products and services.\n\nEach year, we set spending goals based on the types of projects we have planned and the availability of qualified vendors. In 2022, we spent more than $325 million with diverse U.S. suppliers.\n\nBusiness continuity\n\nTI continually assesses risks to its supply chain, including financial health and concentration in geographic areas, to ensure that procurement and management processes are rigorous enough to prevent or manage reputational issues, order fulfillment problems, shipping delays or increased costs. For more information about risk factors, see page 9 of our SEC Form 10-K.\n\nWe require that suppliers maintain a business continuity plan in the event of a business interruption and make the contents of such plans available to us upon request. We also require that suppliers communicate with TI and implement their business continuity plan within 24 hours of a triggering incident to maintain supply continuity.\n\nAssessment\n\nWe prioritize the suppliers we examine based on our financial investment, criticality, products and services they provide and their geographic location. Additionally, independent third-party auditors evaluate select TI facilities each year against the RBA\u2019s Validated Assessment Program protocol standards. We make these reports available to our customers.\n\nWe also conduct regular audits to evaluate employment contracts, working hours and dormitory conditions. For more information about our assessment processes, see our Anti-Human Trafficking Statement.\n\nPerformance\n\nIn 2022, we evaluated nearly 230 suppliers, which included 160 production suppliers that support our manufacturing operations with 335 factory locations; 98% of all suppliers assessed met our performance expectations. The remaining 2% required corrective actions, which included additional training or enhanced policies.\n\nRegardless of a supplier\u2019s respective risk rating, we require any supplier with actual or potential risks (such as those related to hiring activity, working hours, and wages and benefits) to take corrective actions. We monitor these actions through to completion.\n\nFor more information about supply chain management, see our Supply Chain Responsibility webpage and the Procurement Practices section of the GRI Index.\nResponsible minerals\n\nTI has processes to ensure that its products do not contain minerals derived from sources that finance or benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. These minerals include tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold (3TG). TI has started taking steps to disclose the use of cobalt in its supply chain.\n\nActions we are taking\nWe work diligently with our supply chain, including subcontracted manufacturers, to identify and eliminate non-conformant material sources. Our standard operating procedures for conflict minerals supply chain management conform with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s Due Diligence Guidance, which requires establishing policies, structures and procedures, risk management and communication mechanisms.\n\nWe distribute our Conflict Minerals Policy to our suppliers and expect their full and prompt response to our information requests.\n\nTracing chain of custody\nTo gain insight into the country of origin, chain of custody and status of conflict minerals in our supply chain, we rely primarily on the findings of the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP).\n\nRMAP is a program in which an independent third party evaluates smelters\u2019 management systems and procurement practices and determines whether the smelter has demonstrated that it is conformant with the applicable RMAP standard. It is overseen by the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), which was established by members of the RBA and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative.\n\nTI is a member of the RBA and working groups participating in both the RMI and the Responsible Labor Initiative.\n\nPerformance\nOur research and information gathering show that in 2022, the suppliers in our supply chain for integrated circuits used 3TG minerals originating exclusively from conformant smelters.\n\nFor more information and to access our SEC Form SD filing and Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT), see our Conflict Minerals webpage.\nLabor and human rights\n\nOur commitment to human rights\nRespecting and protecting human rights are fundamental to our society's viability and to our business' success. TI is committed to protecting and upholding human rights and ensuring individual dignity, freedom and respect in its operations and supply chain.\n\nWe take steps to ensure that all employment is voluntary, and that work hours and pay are fair and consistent with local labor standards and laws. We forbid the use of child labor in our operations and throughout our supply chain.\n\nEmployees have the freedom to associate, the right to collective bargaining or both, as provided by local statute. We regularly conduct global employee surveys and virtual and in-person roundtable discussions to understand site-specific work environments better.\n\nFurther, our Supplier Code of Conduct sets the same expectations of our suppliers and their suppliers to commit to the same principles and to uphold human rights, ethical practices and provide a safe work environment.\n\nActions we are taking\nWe monitor human rights risks and eliminate violations by:\n\n\u2022 Conducting periodic risk assessments and due diligence with suppliers using the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n\u2022 Conducting third-party audits, on-site interviews and assessments in high-risk geographies to ensure the protection of employees\u2019 and contractors\u2019 rights.\n\u2022 Assessing labor standards, delivering training and awareness-building practices, and providing incident-reporting tools.\n\nTo ensure that we are adopting and applying best practices and processes to respect human rights within our company, our industry and across our supply chain, we are a member of the RBA, the world\u2019s largest industry coalition dedicated to corporate social responsibility in global supply chains.\n\nHow we address concerns\nWe train and encourage employees to speak up, express opinions and raise questions or concerns to any manager in multiple ways. We will not tolerate threats or retaliation against employees for reporting or speaking up. When we learn of concerns, we immediately evaluate the situation and work to address it.\n\nFor more information about how TI manages human rights, see the Anti-Human Trafficking Statement, Supply Chain Responsibility website, and the Non-Discrimination, Child Labor, Forced or Compulsory Labor and Procurement Practices sections in the GRI Index.\nRisk management and business continuity\n\nTI continuously monitors, plans and trains for both unanticipated and emerging operational risks, such as cyberattacks, natural disasters, extreme weather events, pandemics, geopolitical issues, social unrest, terrorism, or supply-chain or product-distribution delays.\n\nOur internally owned and regionally diverse manufacturing footprint includes 12 wafer fabrication plants, seven assembly and test sites, and multiple bump and probe facilities across 15 sites worldwide. In addition to our internal capacity, we have strong partnerships with external foundries and subcontractors to offer supply continuity.\n\n**Actions we are taking**\n\nWe mitigate disruptions to our business by:\n\n- Monitoring risks, developing and modifying plans to address those risks, and training employees on crisis response.\n- Assessing changes to environmental conditions, supply continuity, and the global regulatory and political landscape.\n- Operating a 24/7 year-round security communication center.\n- Owning much of our manufacturing to provide customers with a greater assurance of supply and geopolitically dependable capacity.\n- Building and positioning inventory globally at product distribution centers that are strategically located close to customers.\n\n**Responding to emergencies**\n\nDepending on the nature and severity of an incident, we activate our emergency response system. Our emergency response team assembles to quickly identify the appropriate resources, services and infrastructure required to mitigate potential losses and coordinate our response and communications.\n\nConducting business modeling, scenario and impact analysis to develop and refine management strategies, policies and standards, and contingency plans helps us determine:\n\n- Critical business processes that make up our operations and the people accountable for ensuring their viability.\n- Possible threats and risks, and whether controls are in place to manage them.\n- Process recovery times to ensure that we respond and recover efficiently and with the right resources.\n- Contingency strategies for all critical business processes that pose a high risk to people, revenue and reputation.\n- Comprehensive recovery strategies to cover all aspects of response and recovery, prioritizing the continuation of products and services.\n\nOur Readiness 2 Recover program helps us measure the effectiveness of and compliance with our business continuity management requirements. Every two years (or as needed), we conduct risk assessments to identify and rectify existing controls and gaps.\n\n**Preparing for various scenarios**\n\nAs a global corporation, TI faces unexpected global events that occur without warning, from earthquakes and pandemics to severe weather events. The impact of these types of incidents can be minimal or substantial. When challenges arise, we aim to prevent human, environmental, financial and reputational effects while maintaining production and distribution.\n\nOur business continuity and emergency response planning include creating realistic scenarios and guiding leadership teams through various exercises to learn, refine and improve our responses to actual incidents. Our business continuity management framework is modeled after the ISO 22301 business continuity management standard, which helps us plan, implement, monitor and protect against business interruptions.\n\nTo engage our leaders in enterprise risk planning, we regularly:\n\n- Teach them how to assess and prioritize risks based on severity and potential impact on our people or products.\n- Ask them to evaluate and update contingency strategies based on lessons learned from either real events or scenario-based exercises.\n- Conduct drills, training, tabletop exercises and site-level exercises to prepare for unforeseen events.\n\nFor more information, see our SEC Form 10-K.\nInformation protection\n\nTI works continuously to identify and eliminate potential threats to its employees, customers, IT infrastructure, proprietary technologies and confidential information. This protection is key to business growth and profitability, and maintaining compliance with relevant regulations.\n\nReducing cybersecurity risks\n\nOur cybersecurity risk-management process is based on best practice management and governance frameworks, such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls. We leverage foundational cybersecurity principles in our program, such as security by design, defense-in-depth, least privilege and resilience-focused backups to manage risk.\n\nUsing guidance from these organizations and information collected from our assessments, we develop cybersecurity plans, policies and protocols to reduce our risks and strengthen our security posture to protect our company, technology and intellectual property (IP). Our policies include defining the acceptable use of our information assets, access requirements for specific IP or technologies, protecting personal information and privacy, and complying with regulations such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the China Cybersecurity Law.\n\nActions we are taking\n\nOur global information security team identifies and responds to potential threats and works with our business units and support teams to improve security. As part of this, we take these types of actions:\n\nProtect\n\n- Restrict access to data on our computers, servers, networks and other IT systems.\n- Implement technical measures to protect TI\u2019s web presence from external attacks, including protections for ordering products online at TI.com.\n- Deploy industry-standard protections, such as multifactor authentication, malware defenses and access review processes.\n- Conduct risk and compliance assessments of third parties that request access to our IT resources and information.\n\nDetect and respond\n\n- Monitor and limit the use of USB or thumb drives and external hard drives.\n- Monitor IT systems and respond to alerts regarding inappropriate activity.\n\nTrain\n\n- Send simulated phishing and spear-phishing emails to employees and accompanying education and awareness communications when needed.\n- Deliver cybersecurity awareness and confidential information protection training to all TIers and specialized security training to our IT team.\n\nStay proactive\n\n- Leverage third parties for annual penetration tests to validate our controls and ability.\n- Conduct regular tabletop exercises to practice our response.\n- Perform regular threat hunting and red team exercises.\nWorkplace\nWorking at TI\n\nOur passion is to create a better world by making electronics more affordable through semiconductors.\n\nWe were pioneers in the world\u2019s transition from vacuum tubes to transistors and then to integrated circuits (ICs) \u2013 and we\u2019ve been advancing IC technology and the ability to reliably produce ICs in high volumes for decades.\n\nEach generation of innovation builds upon the last to make technology smaller, more efficient, more reliable and more affordable. Our innovations are at work all around you in things you experience every day, from connected cars to intelligent homes, from drones to smartphones.\n\nAt TI, we bring together 33,000 of the world\u2019s smartest people \u2013 problem solvers known simply as TIers \u2013 who are committed to shaping the future of electronics.\n\nWe ensure that our passion is a lasting reality by operating with three ambitions in mind:\n\n\u2022 We will act like owners who will own the company for decades.\n\u2022 We will adapt and succeed in an ever-changing world.\n\u2022 We will be a company that we\u2019re personally proud to be a part of and would want as our neighbor.\n\nWhen we successfully achieve these ambitions, our people, customers, communities and shareholders all win.\n\nTexas Instruments awards and rankings\n\nIn 2022, TI was awarded 30-plus honors and recognitions around the world. These awards recognized our focus on creating a diverse and inclusive workplace, developing TIers, committing to our sustainability progress and building opportunities to launch careers. Each award represents our commitment to living our values and pride in our company.\nOur people and values\n\nOur people, known simply as TIers, are living our values every day to make our company passion a reality \u2013 to create a better world by making electronics more affordable through semiconductors.\n\nOur values\n\nTrustworthy\nWe start by being trustworthy. We act with integrity and do the right thing, every time. We operate in a socially responsible way. Being trustworthy is foundational for us as a company and as individuals.\n\nInclusive\nWe thrive by being inclusive. We create an environment that unlocks everyone\u2019s potential, where we treat one another with respect, value our differences, and are encouraged to put our thoughts and ideas on the table.\n\nInnovative\nWe win by being innovative. We imagine new technologies that produce compelling products, open new markets and improve our competitiveness. We are curious, persistent and determined to overcome barriers.\n\nCompetitive\nWe embrace a competitive world. We hate to lose, so we continuously challenge ourselves to perform at our best. We invest in the best opportunities for sustainable growth. To stay competitive, we attract, develop and retain the best people.\n\nResults-oriented\nWe are results-oriented and hold ourselves accountable. Our customers have choices, and we act with urgency and deliver on our commitments. We improve our performance every day to help our customers succeed.\n\nEngineering and digital marketing team members discuss ways to bring our new portfolio of products and customer solutions to market.\nDiversity and inclusion\n\nWe are different by design, and believe that our diverse backgrounds and perspectives make TI\u2019s products more innovative and our company stronger. We work to create an inclusive culture where we respect and encourage ideas, and where our people know that they can succeed and build long-term careers.\n\nOur commitment to an inclusive environment focuses on three strategic priorities:\n\n\u2022 Building diverse representation at all levels.\n\u2022 Creating a culture of inclusion and belonging.\n\u2022 Impacting the communities where we live and work.\n\nActions we are taking\n\nTI has intentionally designed global inclusion programming around these priorities to reinforce that the company values every voice, and to encourage TIers to bring their full selves to work and share their ideas.\n\nReducing bias in our processes\n\nWe are focused on reducing bias within our processes when interviewing candidates, reviewing job performance, conducting talent reviews and making compensation and advancement decisions. We also make unconscious bias content available in performance management workshops and directly to TIers through our learning and development system.\n\nWe further train leaders to understand and recognize unconscious bias and use objective criteria and feedback from multiple sources to assess professional growth and to gather independent feedback when assessing job performance.\n\nCreating conversations that matter\n\nOne of the ways that TI is co-creating an inclusive culture is through year-long group-based dialogue teams. These dialogue teams aim to build self-awareness by learning to identify personal and systemic barriers to inclusion and how to interrupt exclusionary behaviors and challenge stereotypes.\n\nImpacting change in our communities\n\nOur ambition calls us to be a company that we\u2019re personally proud to be a part of and would want as our neighbor. We support employees\u2019 efforts to get involved in our communities by serving on nonprofit boards, participating in ongoing volunteering and giving campaigns to create more inclusive communities, and working to spread awareness and education throughout the year.\nWorkforce representation\n\nFor decades, TI has remained committed to diversity and inclusion. While there is always more work to do, the progress we\u2019ve made regarding diversity and inclusion is encouraging.\n\nActions we are taking\n\nWe regularly assess our workforce relative to availability across gender, race and ethnic demographics to understand where we have gaps and where we need to place more emphasis to continue our progress toward having diverse representation at all levels. Women and underrepresented minorities\\(^\\text{15}\\) are not reflected in engineering majors and careers at the same levels as men and non-minorities. For this reason, we focus on growing the engineering pipeline through partnerships with high schools, universities and nonprofit organizations.\n\n---\n\n\\(^{15}\\) We define other underrepresented minorities (URMs) as Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders, American Indians or Alaska Natives, or two or more races. Any totals less than 100% are attributable to a small percentage of undisclosed data.\nEmployee resource groups\n\nTI\u2019s employee resource groups (ERGs) provide a community that promotes a sense of belonging through open dialogue, education, volunteerism, well-being, and professional development and business engagement opportunities.\n\nEach of our employee-led ERGs has goals and objectives that align with our company values and business objectives, with support from at least one TI executive sponsor.\n\nIn 2022, ERGs advanced our diversity and inclusion strategy through four focus areas \u2013 career, company, culture and community. They hosted programs, panels and events that engaged TIers around the world. For example:\n\n- The Women\u2019s Employee Network championed various events, including a Women Growth Summit and technical ladder roundtables in India. These focused on career development, helping prepare, support, mentor and develop women at all levels.\n- The Indian Employee Network organized sessions focused on improving the quality of life and well-being of TIers. Through dozens of events, members received support throughout the pandemic, resources for parents and new meditation and breathing techniques to promote wellness.\n- The Christian, Muslim and Jewish Employee Networks held faith-based collaborative events, bringing together members from across TI to learn more about similarities across cultures and religions.\n- The Black Employee Network (BEN) hosted programming such as a \"Conversations with BEN\" series to support Black TIers and their career progress, to discuss contemporary issues, and to build a networking community.\n\nRead more about how TI champions diversity and inclusion on TI.com and see Diversity and Equal Opportunity in the GRI Index.\n\nTI Diversity Network\n\nFor more than 30 years, the TI Diversity Network has helped educate employees and elevate topics that matter to employees through TI employee-led ERGs that include thousands of members. Every network is open to all TIers, and our company encourages employees to join a network and get involved.\n\nThe Women\u2019s Employee Network hosted programming for all TIers focusing on open dialogue, development and awareness during Women\u2019s History Month.\nRecruitment\n\nTI\u2019s ability to grow and thrive depends on recruiting and retaining the best talent in the industry. The company takes a multifaceted approach to hiring employees with diverse experiences and backgrounds to drive innovation and growth.\n\nActions we are taking\n\nWe actively engage and recruit top engineering and business students for internships and full-time positions through career fairs, information sessions, networking and career preparation events, and partnerships with various student associations. We work closely with local community colleges and high schools to recruit and develop technicians and maintenance mechanics for our current and future manufacturing sites.\n\nCandidates choose TI because we offer:\n\n- Exciting and impactful work.\n- The opportunity to collaborate with some of the world\u2019s smartest minds in technology.\n- Competitive pay and benefits packages to help our employees live their best lives.\n- Career development opportunities where employees feel empowered to own their career paths.\n- An inclusive and diverse culture where all employees can be themselves and bring their best to work.\n- Flexible work options to help TIers and their families get the most out of their personal life.\n\nWe are focused on growing a diverse talent pipeline through leading industry organizations. For example:\n\n- We continue to grow the pipeline of female engineers and business leaders through partnerships with universities and through our women\u2019s ERG and industry organizations, such as the Society of Women Engineers.\n- We also partner with veteran services offices at U.S. universities and two-year technical institutions, military bases, and organizations such as RecruitMilitary to hire skilled veterans.\n\nFor more information about how TI manages recruitment, see indicator 401-1 and the Labor/Management Relations section in the GRI Index.\nTalent development\n\nAt TI, we are dedicated to providing employees with the tools and resources they need to chart the course for their careers. We help TIers set aspirational goals and create personal development plans to map the skills they need to succeed.\n\n**Actions we are taking**\n\nWe encourage all employees to discuss development and performance with their managers at least three times a year to receive feedback, document progress and determine any necessary refinements.\n\nAdditionally, we offer formal learning and development opportunities at all levels to help every TIer \u2013 new and experienced \u2013 continuously evolve. Employees can access our internal hiring and learning platforms at any time to explore careers and chart development paths or complete mandatory training and other learning modules. We also customize learning opportunities to facilitate professional growth from internships to retirement.\n\n**Interns**\n\nInternships at TI provide an opportunity to put education into practice on interesting projects that matter. From day one, our interns receive hands-on, meaningful work that can make a real impact.\n\nOur internship program provides access to key leaders and enables each to network and learn from TIers at all company levels.\n\n**Early career**\n\nRecent college graduates can participate in:\n\n- Make an Impact, a yearlong program that enhances job performance and accelerates career growth using case studies, group projects and assessments, as well as boot camps that provide intensive training on tools, processes and fundamental skills.\n\n- Global rotation programs that help graduates transition from student to professional and gain experience in various roles.\n\n- Early career pivotal learning roles, which expose nominated employees to new roles or skill sets by working closely with leaders, technical experts and talent across TI. Since 2014, we promoted 26% of this program\u2019s participants to management.\n\n**Management**\n\nWe equip TIers to succeed in management by:\n\n- Transitioning from individual contributor to manager to manager of managers.\n\n- Understanding their leadership impact, how they build relationships with key stakeholders, and how they create and communicate strategies.\n\n- Building their technical and behavioral skills to advance careers broader, deeper and higher. About 60% of managers began their careers at TI and we have promoted 99% of executive-level leaders from within.\n\n- Recognizing and reducing unconscious bias.\n\n**Technical leaders**\n\nTI has tailored development to help engineers sharpen their technical abilities, share best practices and develop soft skills such as leadership, communication and influence. Technical leaders can pursue election to TI\u2019s prestigious Tech Ladder, which can represent as many as 24% of our technical leaders.\n\nTI\u2019s Advancing Diverse Technical Leadership (ADTL) program provides coaching, formal training, roundtables and relationship-building opportunities to inspire a more diverse pool of talent for its Technical Ladder, and to help retain, develop and move underrepresented minorities and women into technical leadership roles.\n\nFurther, ADTL has helped retain a significant proportion of its participants since 2016, with the number of participants elected to the TI Technical Ladder increasing nearly 60%.\n\nFor more information about how TI manages employee development, see the Training and Education, Employment and Labor/Management Relations sections in the GRI Index.\n\n---\n\n1. The increase in training hours is the result of our updated tracking system that more accurately captures on-the-job training that occurs in our factories worldwide.\nCompensation and benefits\n\nWe offer competitive compensation and benefits designed to ensure that our talented employees, who will drive future growth, remain at TI.\n\nOur compensation philosophy is based on pay for performance. Both the employee\u2019s contribution to TI\u2019s success and company performance determine an individual\u2019s compensation.\n\nProfit sharing\nOne of the unique aspects of TI\u2019s compensation strategy is a global profit-sharing program that rewards TIers for contributions to the company\u2019s financial success. TI makes payouts as a percentage of eligible earnings based on profitability each year.\n\nOur profit-sharing formula is based on profit from operations (PFO) and begins when TI reaches 10% PFO. The maximum payout is 20%, when PFO reaches 35%. All TIers receive a payout based on the same percentage of eligible earnings. Our profit-sharing plan has paid out at the maximum level possible for the last seven years, equating to a 20% bonus for all eligible employees.\n\nRetaining talent\nRetaining employees with institutional knowledge, as well as technical and operating expertise, is a top priority for TI. We take a multidisciplinary approach to retention by offering:\n\n- Competitive pay and benefits.\n- Tailored career development plans, mentoring programs and executive interaction to develop and encourage professional growth.\n- Connection to peers through our ERGs.\n- Unlimited opportunities to refine skills.\n\nOur commitment to equitable pay\nWe have a long-standing practice to pay our employees fairly and equitably. TI maintains competitive and equitable compensation policies. We designed checks and balances into our compensation system, including conducting regular in-depth analyses, to ensure we achieve them.\n\nIn 2022, TI retained a third party to conduct a separate compensation analysis examining gender and race pay parity (including base, and bonus pay and equity) that considered job type, job level and country. Our analysis confirmed that within the U.S. and worldwide, TI pays women as much as men. In the U.S., TI pays minorities as much as non-minorities. Globally, women make $1.015 for every $1.000 men earn. In the U.S., women make $1.002 for every $1.000 men earn, and minorities make $1.002 for every $1.000 non-minorities earn.\n\nCompetitive benefits\nTI\u2019s benefits programs vary by country according to local market practice. These programs can include medical, dental and vision plans; short- and long-term disability plans; and paid time off and retirement plans designed to adhere to local laws and regulations. Additionally, our expanded benefits support workplace inclusion and equality, and we are committed to creating an environment of respect by providing inclusive benefits that support the unique needs of TIers and their families.\n\nTI offers and encourages employees to take full advantage of various programs to reduce daily stressors that can interfere with well-being, workplace satisfaction and productivity, such as ongoing access to its Employee Assistance Program (EAP) and on-demand resources, which include:\n\n- Resources and referrals for childcare and elder care.\n- Confidential counseling sessions and tools to support well-being.\n- Concierge services for vacation planning, making reservations or other personal transactions.\n\nTo refine work-life program offerings, we engage employees and audit our programs annually to remain competitive and improve services.\n\nParental leave\nAt TI, we believe in supporting our employees in all aspects of their lives, including the transition to parenthood. We offer parental leave benefits to all new parents, enabling them to take time off to bond with their new child and adjust to new demands in their lives.\n\nWe are proud to be a family-friendly workplace and remain committed to supporting our employees throughout their parenthood journeys. Our U.S. parental leave benefits allow employees to take paid time away from work without worrying about financial or job security. This benefit extends to all employees, regardless of gender, sexual orientation or family structure.\n\nIn 2022, Glassdoor recognized TI in its annual Best Places to Work ranking for the company\u2019s culture, atmosphere and great employees.\n\nFor more information about how TI manages compensation and benefits, see the Employment, Economic Performance and Diversity and Equal Opportunity sections in the GRI Index.\nSafety and health\n\nOur commitment to safe workplaces\n\nTI invests in and incorporates safe and healthy practices and controls into its employees\u2019 daily routines to help prevent workplace injuries and illnesses.\n\nTI\u2019s safety goals include a days away, restricted or job transfer (DART) case rate of 0.08 or less and a recordable case rate of 0.20 or less.\n\nActions we are taking\n\nSafety\n\nOur safety-oriented culture includes implementing safety requirements and best practices globally to provide employees with a safe and healthy work environment.\n\nTo maintain one of the industry\u2019s best safety records, we:\n\n\u2022 Create and operate safe worksites.\n\u2022 Maintain proper safety and ergonomic protocols and controls.\n\u2022 Develop and maintain internal standards, which often exceed regulatory requirements.\n\u2022 Design and build inherently safe buildings and engineer out equipment risks.\n\u2022 Require relevant safety training.\n\u2022 Provide personal protective equipment.\n\u2022 Inspect our equipment.\n\u2022 Continuously audit our processes to assess compliance and performance.\n\nHealth\n\nTo reduce exposure to health risks, TI applies rigorous industrial hygiene standards that establish the minimum requirements necessary for the safe use and proper storage of hazardous chemicals and other materials. These standards include hazard communication and training, chemical labeling, and hazardous waste management.\n\nAdditionally, we eliminate or limit the use of potentially harmful materials, install ventilation and isolation controls, and conduct general hygiene and individual assessments. The resources that we offer to TIers to take control of their health vary by country, depending on the extent of government health benefits available.\n\nIn the U.S., we provide free on-site flu vaccines and preventive screening programs, fitness and nutrition programs, employee assistance programs, and counseling and education services. Our health management service provides coaching and oversight to improve the well-being of TIers who have experienced a significant medical event; have extended work absences; or are dealing with multiple diagnoses, treatments and providers.\n\nOur benefit advocacy service helps estimate the costs of medical procedures and assists with locating affordable and quality health providers.\n\nPerformance\n\nOur DART and recordable rates continue to be among the lowest in the U.S. semiconductor industry, according to the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nIn 2022, TI\u2019s DART rate was 0.18 while the 2021 industry average was 0.7 (2022 industry data is not yet available).\n\nFor more health and safety data, see the Performance Data Appendix. See the Occupational Health and Safety Section in the GRI Index for more information.\n\n*The 2022 increase is due to COVID-19 infections. The case rate without the virus is 0.18.\n*The 2022 increase is due to COVID-19 infections. The DART rate without the virus is 0.10.\nGiving and volunteering\nGiving\n\nOne of our three ambitions is to be a company that we\u2019re personally proud to be a part of and would want as our neighbor. For decades, TI has worked to build stronger communities where the company operates.\n\nOur giving and volunteering programs:\n\n1. Engage TIers globally through giving campaigns and volunteering programs.\n2. Improve our global communities through contributions to nonprofit organizations where TI operates.\n3. Combine monetary investments with employee involvement for the greatest impact.\n\nWe seek to improve the quality of life and strengthen our site communities across the globe. TI and the TI Foundation make well-considered and well-measured investments in several areas.\n\nEducation\nTI targets its largest area of philanthropic giving at improving education. Since 2010, the TI Foundation has invested more than $73 million in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education to improve math and science learning outcomes and opportunities for Black, Latino and female students who historically face economic and educational barriers. Globally, we aim to improve access to educational resources in TI\u2019s international site communities.\n\nArts\nWe help sustain the arts that make Dallas culturally inclusive and vibrant through multi-year TI Foundation grants to premier organizations that emphasize the diversity of their outreach efforts and programming and through transformative grants to diverse groups that can become larger in scale and impact.\n\nRacial equity\nWe support programs that dismantle barriers to racial equity, emphasizing police training and practices that reinforce accountability so that all people are policed equitably and our communities are safer places to live and work.\n\nHuman services\nWe aim to strengthen programs and services for critical needs among racially and economically marginalized populations. We also preserve emergency funds for site communities and employees devastated by natural or human-caused disasters.\n\nMatching gifts\nTo double the impact of U.S. employee giving, the TI Foundation matches active and retired employee donations of up to $30,000 per year to eligible nonprofit organizations. In 2022, the TI Foundation provided more than $11 million in matching gifts.\n\nPhilanthropic impact since 2010\n\n| TI and TI Foundation matching gifts, grants, and in-kind donations | $442m |\n| Our generous employees and retirees donated | $114m |\n| The amount of volunteer hours by employees and retirees | 1.9m |\n\nTIers across the globe embody the philanthropic spirit our company founders set for TI. Their generosity \u2013 especially during a time when so many are in great need \u2013 is humbling, inspiring and gives us one more reason to be proud employees of Texas Instruments.\n\nANDY SMITH, DIRECTOR OF GIVING & VOLUNTEERING\n2022 giving highlights\n\nHuman services\nOur company\u2019s North Texas headquarters is located in one of the most prosperous regions in the U.S., but hunger is a problem for one in eight residents, driven by inflation. In response, the TI Foundation made a $300,000 grant to the North Texas Food Bank, helping provide approximately 1 million meals. The grant supported the food bank\u2019s mission to nourish North Texas, including in Dallas, Collin and Grayson counties, where our company has large operations.\n\nOther notable support included more than $230,000 given by our employees and the TI Foundation \u2013 including matching gifts \u2013 to help the American Red Cross and its international affiliates provide humanitarian relief in Ukraine. TI also donated $150,000 to the China Youth Development Foundation in response to a 6.8 magnitude earthquake that struck the southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan.\n\nRacial equity\nThe TI Foundation made a two-year, $250,000 grant to Project Unity for programs that aim to remove racial divides in North Texas. Programs focus on dialogue and trust-building between area law enforcement, youth and communities. The grant to Project Unity is the third investment by the TI Foundation as part of its commitment to support programs that dismantle barriers to racial equity.\n\nArts\nThe TI Foundation awarded $1.3 million in grants to Dallas arts organizations to support their objective of sustaining the arts that make Dallas culturally inclusive. Recipients ranged from a new, experimental arts organization to long-standing partners that present a variety of cultural experiences that reflect the diversity in audiences and programming.\n\nEducation\nTI and the TI Foundation made $14 million in education grants, which included matching employee and retiree donations. With the evolving learning landscape and widening disparities in mind, the TI Foundation continued its 10 years of supporting public school districts in southern Dallas County through $4.7 million in funding.\n\nWe also furthered our two decades of support for the National Math and Science Initiative\u2019s College Readiness Program, which serves four historically low-income public school districts in southern Dallas County and one in Utah that primarily serves Navajo tribal nation students.\n\nInvesting in students\u2019 social and emotional wellness\nA new $1 million grant built on the work that TI began in 2021 with United Way of Metropolitan Dallas and Educate Texas on a \u201cHeal, Play, Learn\u201d program that addresses social and emotional wellness; physical activity; and arts engagement for students, teachers and families in southern Dallas County\u2019s Cedar Hill and DeSoto public school districts.\n\nThe 2022 grant allowed those two districts to continue programming from 2021, during which 2,500 students, teachers and family members participated. Funding also enabled the program to expand into the Lancaster Independent School District, also in southern Dallas County.\n\nWhile not specifically a STEM investment, the active learning components of Heal, Play, Learn align with Texas grade-level math and science requirements. They are also heavily focused on soft-skill STEM concepts, such as critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity and collaboration. Districts reported improved teacher and student morale and higher enrollment by 5% for students who were part of the program vs. those who were not.\nVolunteering\n\nOur employees are passionate about giving back and improving the quality of life in their communities.\n\nTI has more than 20 global community involvement teams and other civic-minded employees who work hard to solve local needs. Together, they mentor students, coach robotics competitions, volunteer at food banks and homeless shelters, clean up neighborhoods, plant trees and give valuable time to serve their communities in other ways.\n\n2022 contributions\n\nVolunteering programs brought TIers back together after the COVID-19 pandemic. At nearly 257,000 hours of employee and retiree time donated, the number of hours spent volunteering doubled from 2021 at a value of $7.7 million. In the U.S., the TI Foundation matches the value of employees\u2019 volunteer hours up to $1,000 per year, which added almost $400,000 of additional support for their favorite causes. For example:\n\n- Food bank donations and other activities by TIers in Dallas, Taiwan, Japan and Maine addressed hunger.\n- Employee networks in Santa Clara and Dallas helped build bikes for impoverished children.\n- TIers at our manufacturing site in Lehi, Utah, distributed refurbished computers to area students through an e-waste recycling program.\n- Our community involvement teams in China, Malaysia and the Philippines focused their time on volunteering with children and at schools, painted murals, donated groceries to low-income families, and shared the joy of learning math and science.\n\nFor more information about how we manage community citizenship, see Local Communities in the GRI Index and Education Engagement.\n\nLiving a legacy through community impact\n\nNathan \u2013 a wet process owner at TI\u2019s Lehi, Utah, manufacturing site \u2013 was recognized with a 2022 TI Founders Community Impact Award, which the company bestows on TIers who have made outstanding contributions to the communities where they live and work. The biennial award honors our company\u2019s founders and their long history of philanthropy and volunteerism.\n\nNathan demonstrates a remarkable commitment to working with the unsheltered and hungry in the Salt Lake City area, which like many large U.S. cities is experiencing a rise in homeless populations. He received a $10,000 grant from TI to direct to a nonprofit organization of his choice. Five other finalists each received $2,500 in grants to direct to selected nonprofits.\n\n\u201cI serve this specific community because I was very close to losing my home and have been on food stamps before,\u201d Nathan said. \u201cI know how a safe home and knowing where your next meal will come from has a tremendous effect on the rest of your life. I believe every human has inherent value, and it is easy to fall into an unsheltered situation and very hard to get back out of it.\u201d\n\nRead more.\n$9.6 million raised for United Way to help communities thrive\n\nTI\u2019s annual United Way campaign raised $9.6 million in 2022 from employees and retirees, company sponsorships and TI Foundation grants and matching gifts. We support advanced programs in three areas that make up the building blocks of opportunity:\n\n- Education, which opens doors, broadens horizons and sets kids up for success.\n- Income, which brings financial stability \u2013 a key ingredient of a steady, successful life.\n- Health, which affects everything from how well a child can learn to how much an adult can earn.\n\nVolunteer participation during the campaign was high, with 1,700 hours spent supporting more than 50 activities across our U.S. sites to support United Way partner agencies.\n\n\u201cThe generosity of TIers and their giving and volunteering spirit never ceases to amaze me,\u201d said Andy Smith, director of giving and volunteering for TI and executive director of the TI Foundation. \u201cOur company\u2019s United Way campaign proved that when we live and give united to build stronger communities, we can advance the common good and create lasting change for every person.\u201d\n\nTI\u2019s history with United Way of Metropolitan Dallas dates to the early 1960s, when TI co-founder J. Erik Jonsson helped oversee the efforts of the American Red Cross and the Community Chest in Dallas to create what was then called the United Fund. Since then, our company, the TI Foundation and our employees have worked closely with United Way to build stronger communities.\nAppendices\n## Performance Data\n\n### Giving and volunteerism\n\n|                | 2018  | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  | 2022  |\n|----------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| **Total**      | $49.08| $52.46| $54.57| $64.95| $52.57|\n\n1.

For information about TI's ownership structure, see SEC Form 10-K, Part I. |\n| 2-2 | Entities included in the organization's sustainability reporting | TI has two reportable segments: analog and embedded processing. We report the results of our remaining business activities in Other (see SEC Form 10-K, Part I, Item 1, pages 2-4). TI's Corporate Citizenship Report covers environmental, social and governance (ESG) topics for all TI-owned entities and facilities included in financial statements. |\n| 2-3 | Reporting period, frequency and contact point | TI has produced its Corporate Citizenship Report annually since 2006, with a reporting period that covers the previous calendar year (2022, unless otherwise stated). This period aligns with the company's financial reporting period. TI published its 2022 report in June 2023.

In 2023, ERM Certification and Verification Services conducted limited assurance of scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) data for 2022 (see the Assurance Statement). We currently do not seek independent assurance of any additional nonfinancial data; however, Ernst & Young audits the TI Foundation's financial records annually. |\n| 2-6 | Activities, value chain and other business relationships | For information about the markets TI serves, see SEC Form 10-K, Part I, pages 5-6. We market and sell our products through direct sales channels, including our website and broad sales and marketing team, and, to a lesser extent, through distributors. Over the past several years, we have been investing in new capabilities to build closer direct customer relationships. As a result, in 2022 about 70% of our revenue was direct, which includes TI.com, as customers valued the convenience of purchasing online. Closer direct relationships with our customers help to strengthen our reach of market channel advantage and give us access to more customers and more of their design projects, leading to opportunities to sell more of our products into each design. Additionally, broader and deeper access gives us better insight and knowledge of customer needs. Our investments in new and improved capabilities to directly support our customers include website and e-commerce enhancements as well as inventory consignment programs and order fulfillment services. Our TI.com e-commerce channel offers a localized online experience in many countries, with convenience features such as immediate availability, local currency, payment methods, invoicing and importer of record. Our new application programming interfaces (APIs) give customers the ability to directly access real-time inventory information about TI products from their own systems, enabling them to purchase available chips immediately to better support their supply needs, reducing cost and delays. For more information, see SEC Form 10-K, Part I, Item 5, pages 6-7. In 2022, TI brought two new 300-mm factories online in Richardson, Texas, and Lehi, Utah.

We accept no responsibility, and deny any liability, to any party other than Texas Instruments for the conclusions we have reached. |\n\n**Our conclusion**\nBased on our activities, as described below, nothing has come to our attention to indicate that the 2022 data and information for the disclosures listed under \u2018Scope\u2019 above are not fairly presented in the Report, in all material respects, in accordance with the reporting criteria.\n\n**Emphasis of matter**\nWithout affecting our conclusion, we draw attention to the explanatory notes provided by Texas Instruments relating to the data on page 10 and page 42 of the Report, in particular the limitations relating to additional sources of Scope 1 GHG data on page 10 and page 42 of the Report, which should be read in conjunction with the data.\nOur assurance activities\nConsidering the level of assurance and our assessment of the risk of material misstatement of the Report a multi-disciplinary team of sustainability and assurance specialists performed a range of procedures that included, but was not restricted to, the following:\n\n- Assessing the appropriateness of the reporting criteria for the Report.\n- Interviews with management representatives responsible for managing the selected issues.\n- Interviews with relevant staff to understand and evaluate the relevant management systems and processes (including internal review and control processes) used for collecting and reporting the selected disclosures.\n- A review at corporate level of a sample of qualitative and quantitative evidence supporting the reported information.\n- An analytical review of the year-end data submitted by all locations included in the consolidated 2022 group data for the selected disclosures which included testing the completeness and mathematical accuracy of conversions and calculations, and consolidation in line with the stated reporting boundary.\n- In-person site visit to Texas Instruments\u2019 North Dallas Campus (USA) and Miho (Japan) facilities/production sites to review source data and local reporting systems and controls. As well as a virtual site to Portland (Maine, USA) facility to review source data and local reporting systems and controls.\n- Confirming conversion and emission factors and assumptions used.\n- Reviewing the presentation of information relevant to the scope of our work in the Report to ensure consistency with our findings.\n\nThe limitations of our engagement\nThe reliability of the assured information is subject to inherent uncertainties, given the available methods for determining, calculating, or estimating the underlying information. It is important to understand our assurance conclusions in this context.\n\nOur independence, integrity and quality control\nERM CVS is an independent certification and verification body accredited by UKAS to ISO 17021:2015. Accordingly, we maintain a comprehensive system of quality control, including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Our quality management system is at least as demanding as the relevant sections of ISQM-1 and ISQM-2 (2022).\n\nERM CVS applies a Code of Conduct and related policies to ensure that its employees maintain integrity, objectivity, professional competence, and high ethical standards in their work. Our processes are designed and implemented to ensure that the work we undertake is objective, impartial and free from bias and conflict of interest. Our certified management system covers independence and ethical requirements that are at least as demanding as the relevant sections of Parts A & B of the IESBA Code relating to assurance engagements.\n\nThe team that has undertaken this assurance engagement has extensive experience in conducting assurance on environmental, social, ethical and health and safety information, systems and processes, and provides no consultancy related services to Texas Instruments in any respect.\n\nOther Matters - observations\nWe have provided Texas Instruments with a separate management report. Without affecting the conclusions presented above, we have the following observations:\n\n- We recommend attention is given during 2023 to: Develop and refine Fluorinated Heat Transfer Fluids (FHTFs) data collection and reporting to align with IPCC 2019 across all international sites to align with industry peers, and include FHTFs from the US and international sites within the 2023 GHG inventory.\n\nBeth Wyke\nHead of Corporate Assurance Services\nMalvern, PA\n\n2 June 2023\nERM Certification & Verification Services Incorporated\nwww.ermcvs.com | post@ermcvs.com", "source": "texas_instruments_2022", "added": "2025-04-27", "created": "2025-04-27", "metadata": {"Source-File": "climate_reports/tp_reports/texas_instruments_2022.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.1.59", "pdf-total-pages": 76, "total-input-tokens": 158269, "total-output-tokens": 48555, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 2285, 2], [2285, 3881, 3], [3881, 6712, 4], [6712, 9144, 5], [9144, 10382, 6], [10382, 10411, 7], [10411, 13127, 8], [13127, 15774, 9], [15774, 18687, 10], [18687, 21405, 11], [21405, 24151, 12], [24151, 28258, 13], [28258, 31666, 14], [31666, 33971, 15], [33971, 34002, 16], [34002, 36219, 17], [36219, 38458, 18], [38458, 39746, 19], [39746, 44342, 20], [44342, 46336, 21], [46336, 48744, 22], [48744, 52613, 23], [52613, 55362, 24], [55362, 55372, 25], [55372, 56960, 26], [56960, 58465, 27], [58465, 60611, 28], [60611, 61648, 29], [61648, 63798, 30], [63798, 65674, 31], [65674, 69331, 32], [69331, 73730, 33], [73730, 76687, 34], [76687, 76711, 35], [76711, 79511, 36], [79511, 82909, 37], [82909, 85680, 38], [85680, 87196, 39], [87196, 87207, 40], [87207, 88265, 41], [88265, 91339, 42], [91339, 94151, 43], [94151, 96856, 44], [96856, 98209, 45], [98209, 100249, 46], [100249, 104610, 47], [104610, 108746, 48], [108746, 112175, 49], [112175, 115908, 50], [115908, 118406, 51], [118406, 122294, 52], [122294, 126219, 53], [126219, 129415, 54], [129415, 132284, 55], [132284, 136329, 56], [136329, 138801, 57], [138801, 142369, 58], [142369, 145826, 59], [145826, 148555, 60], [148555, 151934, 61], [151934, 155478, 62], [155478, 160125, 63], [160125, 164264, 64], [164264, 168016, 65], [168016, 171440, 66], [171440, 173951, 67], [173951, 176565, 68], [176565, 179863, 69], [179863, 183459, 70], [183459, 186597, 71], [186597, 191379, 72], [191379, 196964, 73], [196964, 198104, 74], [198104, 201595, 75], [201595, 205450, 76]]}}
