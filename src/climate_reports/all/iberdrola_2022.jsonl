Sustainability Report\nIndependent Assurance Report on the Statement of Non-Financial Information/Sustainability Report of Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries for 2022\n\n(Translation from the original in Spanish. In the case of discrepancy, the Spanish language version prevails)\n\nTo the shareholders of Iberdrola, S.A.\n\nWe have been engaged by Iberdrola, S.A. management to perform a limited assurance review of the accompanying Statement of Non-Financial Information/Sustainability Report for the year ended 31 December 2022 of Iberdrola, S.A. (hereinafter, the Parent) and subsidiaries (hereinafter, the Group), prepared in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (hereinafter GRI Standards), and the disclosures specified for the purposes of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) for the \u201cElectric Utilities & Power Generators\u201d sector (hereinafter, the Report).\n\nIn addition, pursuant to article 49 of the Spanish Code of Commerce, we have performed a limited assurance review to evaluate whether the Consolidated Non-Financial Information Statement (hereinafter NFIS) of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2022, included in the accompanying Report which forms part of the Group\u2019s consolidated Directors\u2019 Report for 2022, has been prepared in accordance with prevailing mercantile legislation and selected GRI Standards, based on each subject area in the \u201cDisclosures from the Statement of Non-Financial Information\u201d of the Report.\n\nThe Report includes additional information to that required by the GRI Standards, the disclosures specified for the purposes of the SASB for the \u201cElectric Utilities & Power Generators\u201d sector, and by the prevailing mercantile legislation concerning non-financial information, which has not been the subject of our assurance work. In this respect, our work was limited exclusively to providing assurance on the information contained in the \u201cGRI content Index\u201d, \u201cSASB content Index\u201d and \u201cDisclosures from the Statement of Non-Financial Information\u201d included in the accompanying Report.\n\nIn addition, we have performed a Moderate Assurance review of the application of the principles of inclusivity, materiality, responsiveness and impact on the information included in the \u201cStakeholder engagement\u201d section of the accompanying Report, prepared in accordance with the AA1000AP AccountAbility Principles (2018).\n\nResponsibility of the Parent\u2019s Directors and Management\n\nManagement of the Parent is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Report in accordance with the GRI Standards and with the disclosures specified for the purposes of the SASB for the \u201cElectric Utilities & Power Generators\u201d sector, in accordance with each subject area in the \u201cGRI content Index\u201d and the \u201cSASB content Index\u201d of the Report.\nThe Directors of the Parent are responsible for the content and authorisation for issue of the NFIS included in the Report. The NFIS has been prepared in accordance with prevailing mercantile legislation and selected GRI Standards based on each subject area in the \u201cDisclosures from the Statement of Non-Financial Information\u201d of the aforementioned Report.\n\nThis responsibility also encompasses the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control deemed necessary to ensure that the Report is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe Directors of the Parent are also responsible for defining, implementing, adapting and maintaining the management systems from which the information required to prepare the Report was obtained.\n\nFurthermore, the Directors of the Parent are also responsible for implementing the processes and procedures required for compliance with the AA1000AP AccountAbility Principles (2018).\n\nOur Independence and Quality Management\n\nWe have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including international independence standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.\n\nOur firm applies prevailing international quality standards and accordingly maintains a quality system including policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe engagement team was comprised of professionals specialised in reviews of non-financial information and, specifically, in information on economic, social and environmental performance. It also included specialists in the AA1000AP AccountAbility Principles (2018) on Stakeholder engagement and on social, environmental and financial performance.\n\nOur Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express our conclusions in an independent limited assurance report based on the work performed. We conducted our review engagement in accordance with the requirements of the Revised International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000, \u201cAssurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information\u201d (ISAE 3000 (Revised)), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), and with the guidelines for assurance engagements on the Non-Financial Information Statement issued by the Spanish Institute of Registered Auditors (ICJCE). Furthermore, we conducted our engagement in accordance with AccountAbility\u2019s Type 2 Sustainability Assurance Standard AA1000AS v3 (2020).\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement, and consequently, the level of assurance provided is substantially lower.\nOur work consisted of making inquiries of management, as well as of the different units and areas of the Group that participated in the preparation of the Report, reviewing the processes for compiling and validating the information presented in the Report and applying certain analytical procedures and sample review tests, which are described below:\n\n- Meetings with the Group\u2019s personnel to gain an understanding of the business model, policies and management approaches applied, the principal risks related to these matters and to obtain the information necessary for the external review.\n\n- Analysis of the scope, relevance and completeness of the content of the Report based on the materiality analysis performed by the Group and described in the \u201cAbout this report\u201d section, considering the content required by prevailing mercantile legislation.\n\n- Analysis of the processes for compiling and validating the data presented in the Report for 2022.\n\n- Review of the information relative to the risks, policies and management approaches applied in relation to the material aspects presented in the Report for 2022.\n\n- Review through meetings with Group personnel responsible for implementing the Stakeholder Relations Model and reviewing the internal documentation on the deployment of the model, and the nature and scope of the processes defined in order to comply with the AA1000AP AccountAbility Principles (2018), and evaluating the reliability of the information on performance indicated in the aforementioned scope.\n\n- Corroboration, through sample testing, of the information relative to the content of the Report for 2022 and whether it has been adequately compiled based on data provided by the information sources.\n\n- Review of information on the Taxonomy of activities in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2020/852 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment.\n\n- Procurement of a representation letter from the Directors and management.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the assurance procedures performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that:\n\na) The Statement of Non-Financial Information/Sustainability Report of Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2022, has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the GRI standards and the SASB disclosures for the \u201cElectric Utilities & Power Generators sector included in \u201cGRI Contents Index\u201d and \u201cSASB Contents Index\u201d of the Report.\n\nb) The NFIS of Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2022, included in the Report, has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with prevailing mercantile legislation and selected GRI Standards based on each subject area in the \u201cDisclosures from the Statement of Non-Financial Information\u201d of the Report.\n\nc) The information included in the \u201cStakeholder engagement\u201d section of the Report regarding the principles of inclusivity, materiality, responsiveness and impact has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the AA1000AP AccountAbility Principles (2018).\nEmphasis of Matter\n\nRegulation (EU) 2020/862 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment stipulates the obligation to disclose information on how and to what extent the undertaking\u2019s activities are associated with economic activities aligned to the objectives of climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation, in addition to the information related to eligible activities. The Directors of the Parent have included information on the criteria that, in their opinion, best allow them to comply with the aforementioned obligations, which are defined in the \u201cTaxonomy\u201d section of the NFIS included in the accompanying Report. Our conclusion is not modified in respect of this matter.\n\nRecommendations\n\nWithout prejudice to the conclusions presented above, our key observations on the application of the principles of inclusivity, materiality, responsiveness and impact defined in the AA1000AP (2018) AccountAbility Principles Standard are as follows:\n\nOn the principle of Inclusivity\n\nIn 2016 Iberdrola approved its Stakeholder Relations Model, based mainly on standard AA1000, to develop its stakeholder relations policies, last revised in December 2022, provide a system for relations with Iberdrola Group\u2019s stakeholders and create a corporate culture in this respect. Since then, improvements have been progressively made to the Model in accordance with the benchmarks applicable in this regard, with the main aim of achieving greater decentralisation at local level in the five countries where the Group is present. Specifically, in 2022, relations with local stakeholders continued to be promoted and the Model was implemented in new facilities.\n\nWith regard to this principle, we recommend that the decentralisation efforts continue, uploading this new global segmentation and local prioritisation into the available stakeholder management tool. We also recommend that the Stakeholder Relations Model be implemented in the new facilities planned for 2023.\n\nOn the principle of Materiality\n\nFor the eight stakeholder categories defined, the Stakeholder Relations Model enables the identification of material topics, as well as risks and opportunities in corporate areas and three businesses in the five countries where the Group in present, and also provides a reputational and human rights perspective. In 2022 the material topics identified were further analysed, and a report was prepared for each of the five countries where the Group is present, which were presented to the Company\u2019s various governing and management bodies.\n\nWith regard to this principle, we recommend that Iberdrola continue to work on assessing the results obtained, thereby integrating the most significant material topics identified into the Parent\u2019s internal management and decision-making processes.\nOn the principle of Responsiveness\n\nOnce the main material topics have been identified, implementation of the Stakeholder Relations Model enables responses to local stakeholder expectations to be designed and subsequently monitored. These topics are also taken into account when establishing the Group\u2019s ESG objectives, and in the Company\u2019s materiality analysis process.\n\nWith regard to this principle, we recommend that Iberdrola continue to work on designing action plans that take into account the most significant material topics identified.\n\nOn the principle of Impact\n\nThe Statement of Non-Financial Information/Sustainability Report includes Iberdrola\u2019s main impacts on the various stakeholders, in line with the concept of \u2018social dividend\u2019 enshrined in Iberdrola\u2019s governance and sustainability system and which is understood to be \u201cthe creation of value, whether direct, indirect or induced, through its activities, for all stakeholders\u201d. The Stakeholder Relations Model also covers the impact on the stakeholders from two different perspectives: the impact of the action plans on stakeholders; and the impact of the material topics on stakeholders, which was recently included in the Model, taking into account the latest reporting trends and standards.\n\nWith regard to this principle, we recommend that Iberdrola continue to make progress in aligning the model with the ESRS reporting standards, so that the tool serves as a source of information in the double materiality process in future years.\n\nUse and Distribution\n\nIn accordance with the terms of our engagement letter, this report has been prepared for Iberdrola, S.A. in relation to its Statement of Non-Financial Information/Sustainability Report for 2022 and for no other purpose or in any other context.\n\nIn relation to the Consolidated NFIS, this report has been prepared in response to the requirement established in prevailing mercantile legislation in Spain, and thus may not be suitable for other purposes and jurisdictions.\n\nKPMG Asesores, S.L.\n\n(Signed on original in Spanish)\n\nPatricia Reverter Guillot\n\n24 February 2023\n\nAA1000\nLicensed Report\n000-38/V3-MDCED\nStatement of Non-Financial Information.

Annex 2. Statement .................................................................................................. 326\n\u201cIn 2022, a year characterised by a complex and uncertain environment, Iberdrola has continued to accelerate the electrification of energy uses with the development of more renewables, grids and storage, and also with the drive for green hydrogen. With these investments, we are making possible structural improvements in energy costs, efficiency, security of service and emissions. Our activity is also generating industrial infrastructure and jobs, and we contribute to promoting education, innovation, tax revenues to pay for public services, and improvement in the balance of payments through the reduction of fossil fuel imports. All of the foregoing, together with numerous activities relating to the protection of the most vulnerable communities and other social causes, shows Iberdrola\u2019s commitment to the creation of prosperity and the protection of the environment, today and for future generations.\u201d\nIn 2022, which was characterised by a highly uncertain and unstable economic, political, and social environment, Iberdrola\u2019s workforce continued to work and innovate to provide efficient, high-quality service to the 100 million people who trust us all over the world. To ensure that we can continue to build a better future for all, we have also made every effort to speed up the transformation of the energy sector in terms of guarantee of supply, competitiveness and environmental impact.\n\nBoth tasks, which are strongly intertwined, have guided our activities in dozens of countries, including Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, France, Germany, Australia and Japan.\n\nThe \u20ac11,000 million invested last year firstly allowed us to implement new electricity transmission and distribution, as well as to strengthen and digitalise existing ones. These include, for example, the projects carried out in the United States, which will enable us to continue to improve the grids in New England and New York in coming years; and the new investments in transmission in Brazil, like the Rio Formoso line and the eight new infrastructure projects under development that will placed into service over the next three years.\n\nThe networks team also engaged in major projects to maintain and restore service in emergency situations, like the Celia storm in Spain, the Dudley, Eunice and Franklin storms in the United Kingdom, and the Elliot storm in the United States. The investments made and the optimisation of grid management made possible by digitalisation have allowed the group\u2019s supply quality parameters to continue to progress despite these incidents.\n\nOur investment effort has also led to the creation of more than 2,000 new MW of clean energy and to progress in the construction of approximately 7,700 additional MW. We have already invested approximately \u20ac6,000 million in this new capacity under construction, with the allocation of 60% of this amount to 3,500 MW in offshore wind farms in the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Germany. This cements our leadership in this technology, in which, in addition to these projects, we have 1,300 MW in operation.\n\nOur position at the forefront of energy storage has been strengthened by the launch of the T\u00e2mega gigabattery, the largest clean energy project in Portugal. This pumped hydroelectric storage, one of the largest in Europe with a capacity of 1,200 MW, is already capable of storing 40 million kWh in energy, equivalent to the needs of 11 million people for 24 hours.\nIberdrola\u2019s contribution to the transition from a fossil fuel-based model to a fully decarbonised model in 2022 has been especially visible through two highly meaningful milestones. Firstly, definitive abandonment of coal, with the demolition of the chimney of our last facilities of this kind in the world, in Palencia (Spain), which plant was closed in 2017.\n\nSecondly, the completion of the Puertollano (Spain) green hydrogen plant, the largest for industrial use in Europe at the time, which is part of the portfolio of more than 60 projects under development in eight countries to help to decarbonise sectors like the chemical industry and heavy-duty transport.\n\nAs a result of all this activity, which increases the investments made by Iberdrola in the last 20 years to \u20ac140,000 million, net profit earned in 2022 reached \u20ac4,339 million, 11.7% more than last year. The decision to grow in countries like the United States and Brazil has allowed us to offset the results of Iberdrola Espa\u00f1a, which shrank by 16% in an environment strongly affected by the high energy prices.\n\nThe Group\u2019s results in 2022 enabled us to propose to the shareholders an approximately 10% increase in shareholder remuneration, in line with the increase in net profit, to \u20ac0.49 per share, which is equivalent to dividend yield of 4.5%.\n\nIn accordance with our current strategy, last year\u2019s growth was achieved by maintaining our financial strength, rating and full access to the capital markets, as shown by the issue of more than \u20ac9,500 million in green and sustainable financing instruments during the year.\n\nFinancial markets rated the Group\u2019s performance in 2022 very highly. Iberdrola registered a total shareholder return of 9.8%, beating the IBEX 35 (-5.5%) and the European sector index, Eurostoxx Utilities (-14.4%).\n\n**Contributing to a more prosperous, fair and sustainable society**\n\nIberdrola\u2019s growth in terms of size and strength has gone hand in hand with the reinforcement of our commitment to the social dividend.\n\nJust last year we made 4,700 new hires within the Group, and support 400,000 jobs at thousands of suppliers across the world through our purchases, which exceeded \u20ac17,800 million this year. And we have continued to contribute to support public services for all citizens with taxes in the total amount of \u20ac7,500 million, \u20ac2,600 million of which were paid to the Spanish public treasury.\nWe continue to promote the talent and professional development of our workforce \u2013 with more than 68 hours of training per employee per year \u2013 as well as future professionals through scholarships, grants and technical training provided to thousands of young people every year. And we continue to be fully committed to our responsibility to contribute to full equality between men and women, through actions to foster scientific and technological careers among women and facilitate their access to professions traditionally dominated by men, including the Escola de Electricistas electricians\u2019 school for women in Brazil.\n\nWe have also proven our leadership in caring for the environment by reducing our emissions to just 59 g/kWh, one fourth of those of our competitors in Europe, aspiring to achieve zero net emissions at our generation plants and our own consumption by 2030, and across our entire business by 2040; and of having zero or a positive impact on biodiversity by 2030. We are convinced that this aspiration is achievable and compatible with the generation of value for our shareholders, employees, suppliers and other stakeholders.\n\nWe have also further strengthened the wager on innovation as a strategic key factor that spans all our businesses and activities: We have allocated more than \u20ac360 million to cutting-edge initiatives to promote electrification, which led the European Commission to consider us again as the private utility that invests the most in this concept in the world.\n\nIn these turbulent times, support for disadvantaged groups must be ever more present in the decision-making of all economic and social players. For this reason, in 2022 we engaged in various activities to protect our vulnerable customers: we offered work integration opportunities to impoverished young people in partnership with institutions like Unicef and the Red Cross; we promoted social action through the group\u2019s foundations across the world, which allocate more than \u20ac20 million to these tasks; and, of course, we continued to support our nearly 17,000 volunteers, who have continued to contribute their free time to help those most in need.\n\nThis report shows, once again, our Group\u2019s industrial and economic success. But, above all, it shows that Iberdrola is an enterprise of long-term responsible social transformation, the continuation of which is reflected in the new strategic plan presented in November, which establishes a record investment of \u20ac47,000 million up to 2025 in order to continue to promote a sustainable energy model based on electrification, which generates wealth and opportunities for all.\nWe are proud of what we have built in the last twenty years, in accordance with our century-old history. And we know that, by continuing to make our history, we will achieve a society that is more fair, equitable, sustainable and prosperous, as well as a more inhabitable planet for future generations.\n\nIgnacio S.

Iberdrola, the utility of the future\nI.1. About Iberdrola\n\n- Purpose and values\n- A successful and well-established business model\n- Presence and areas of activity\n- Main products and services\n- Key operating figures\n- Corporate and governance structure, ownership and legal form\nPurpose and values\n\n\u25a0 GRI 2-23\n\nIberdrola\u2019s corporate purpose, which is in line with the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda of the United Nations, mirrors the main social trends and addresses major economic, social and environmental challenges, reflecting the expectations of Stakeholders and defining Iberdrola\u2019s role as an agent of social change and transformation in the energy sector. It is expressed as follows:\n\nTo continue building together each day a healthier, more accessible energy model, based on electricity.\n\nThis purpose, which is in line with the creation of shared value, social dividend and corporate social responsibility, expresses:\n\n- The Iberdrola group\u2019s commitment to the well-being of people and the preservation of the planet.\n- The Iberdrola group\u2019s commitment to a real and comprehensive energy transition, based on the decarbonisation and electrification of the energy sector and of the economy as a whole, which contributes to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \u2014 particularly the fight against climate change \u2014 and generates new opportunities for economic and social development.\n- The conviction that a more electricity-based energy model \u2013 which abandons the use of fossil fuels and mainstreams the use of renewable energy sources, efficient energy storage, smart grids and the digital transformation \u2013 is also healthier for the population, whose well-being depends on the environmental quality of their surroundings.\n- The aspiration for the new energy model to also be more accessible to all, and to favour inclusiveness, equality, equity and social development.\n- The intent to promote this new model in collaboration with all agents involved and with society as a whole to ensure the availability of local energies that contribute to security of supply.\n\nTo attain this Purpose, the Iberdrola group has condensed its corporate values into the following three concepts:\n\n- **Sustainable energy**: the group seeks to always be a model of inspiration, creating economic, social and environmental value in all of its surroundings, and with the future in mind.\n- **Integrating force**: the group works with strength and responsibility, combining talents, for a Purpose that is to be achieved by all and for all.\n- **Driving force**: the Iberdrola group brings about small and large changes in order to make people\u2019s lives easier, always seeking to improve, and to do so efficiently and with high self-imposed standards.\nA successful and well-established business\n\nIberdrola firmly believes that the transition to a carbon neutral economy by 2050 is technologically possible, economically viable and socially necessary. The energy transition to a low-emissions economy is a great opportunity to create independence and wealth, generate employment and improve the state of the planet and people\u2019s health. The group is therefore committed to leading the way, a path it embarked on more than 20 years ago with a firm commitment to renewable energies and that has led it to invest more than \u20ac140,000 million since then. And it will continue with an ambitious investment plan of \u20ac47,000 million between 2023 and 2025, focused on increasing its installed renewable, onshore and offshore wind, photovoltaic, battery and hydroelectric capacity, plus electricity grids. This plan aspires to achieve carbon neutrality for Scopes 1 and 2 by 2030, offsetting any residual emissions after 2030. The ultimate aspiration of this commitment is to achieve Net Zero emissions by 2040. Iberdrola is therefore making a decisive contribution to the development of an autonomous, safe, clean and competitive energy model, supporting industry and employment in the communities where it operates.\n\nThis commitment will be fulfilled by promoting:\n\nA business model with characteristics that accelerate value creation for all\n\n1. **Aimed at satisfying the expectations of its stakeholders by incorporating ESG+F factors into the company\u2019s strategy and management.**\n\n2. **Investment** is particularly focused on the **networks** business, which has predictable **regulatory frameworks** with investment incentives, and constitutes essential infrastructure to handle the transition of the energy model.\n\n3. It is supplemented by **selective investments in renewables**, thus optimising the risk-return profile. This mainly includes offshore wind, photovoltaic, onshore wind, hydroelectric, battery and green hydrogen production projects, all of which are necessary to achieve a decarbonised energy and economic model.\n\n4. **Geographical diversification**, with a focus on countries with high credit ratings.\n\n5. Historical commitment to a **robust financial position** that preferentially relies on **green finance** instruments thanks to the fact that the investment plan is highly aligned with the **EU Taxonomy**.\n\n6. Dividend policy establishes a **strong and growing dividend** in line with the increase in the company\u2019s profits.\nPresence and areas of activity\n\nAfter more than 170 years of history, the Iberdrola group today is a global energy leader, the world\u2019s leading wind energy producer, and one of the largest electricity companies by market capitalisation. Iberdrola was two decades ahead of the energy transition to meet the challenges of climate change and offer a sustainable and competitive business model that creates value for society.\n\nThe group supplies energy to almost 100 million people in dozens of countries, with over 600,000 shareholders, a workforce of close to 40,721 and assets valued at more than \u20ac155,000 million.\n\nGRI 2-1\n\nIberdrola\u2019s leadership is underpinned by its smart grid and renewables businesses, and by a diversified portfolio of projects and markets, with a presence in countries with high credit ratings.

Streamlining criteria have been used in order to properly report on such a large number from the viewpoint of the disclosures required by the GRI Standards; accordingly, the number of Iberdrola\u2019s locations of operation at year-end 2022 is deemed to be 259 for the purposes of this report.\n\nCorporate and governance structure, ownership and legal form\n\n- **GRI 2-1 2-12 2-24**\n\nIberdrola is an independent public company (sociedad an\u00f3nima) with a registered office in Bilbao (Plaza Euskadi, 5), organised under Spanish law and listed on the stock market, and is configured as the holding company for an international group with a presence in Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Brazil, Mexico, and other EU member states and Australia, among other countries.\n\nUsing country subholding companies and head of business companies, the group combines a decentralised structure and management model with coordination mechanisms that ensure the global integration of all businesses and an effective system for separation of functions, checks and balances, and controls. In addition, the Governance and Sustainability System provides for a number of measures that give listed country subholding companies a special framework of enhanced autonomy.\nThe corporate and governance structure of the Iberdrola group is reflected in the following chart:\n\nThe company\u2019s governance structure is based upon this corporate configuration, which duly differentiates between strategic definition and supervision, on the one hand, and day-to-day and effective management, on the other:\n\na. The Board of Directors of Iberdrola (holding company) is vested with powers relating to strategic definition and the governance model, as well as strategic supervision, organisation and coordination.\n\nb. The country subholding companies strengthen strategic organisation and coordination through the dissemination, implementation and supervision of overall strategy and basic management guidelines at the country level, for which they have non-executive directors and audit and compliance committees, in addition to their own internal audit and compliance units or divisions. These entities group together the shareholdings in the head of business companies and one of their main functions is to centralise the provision of common services to these companies.\n\nc. The listed country subholding companies (AVANGRID, Inc. and Neoenergia, S.A.) have a special framework of enhanced autonomy in regulatory matters, related party transactions and management.\n\nd. The head of business companies assume decentralised executive responsibilities, enjoy the independence necessary to carry out the day-to-day administration and effective management of the businesses and are responsible for the day-to-day control thereof. They are organised through their respective boards of directors and specific management decision-making bodies; they may also have their own audit committees, internal audit areas and compliance units or divisions.\n## Governance structure\n\n### Composition of the Board of Directors\n\n#### GRI 2-9\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, Iberdrola\u2019s Board of Directors is made up of the following 14 members:\n\n| Position                        | Director                                      | Status          | Nationality | Date of first appointment | Date of last appointment | Membership on Board Committees                                      |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Chairman                        | Jos\u00e9 Ignacio S\u00e1nchez Gal\u00e1n                   | Executive       | Spain       | 21-05-2001                | 29-03-2019               | Chair of the Executive Committee                                    |\n| Chief Executive Officer         | Armando Mart\u00ednez Mart\u00ednez                    | Executive       | Spain       | 25-10-2022                | 25-10-2022               | Member of the Executive Committee                                   |\n| First Vice-Chair and Lead       | Juan Manuel Gonz\u00e1lez Serna                   | Independent     | Spain       | 31-03-2017                | 18-06-2021               | Member of the Executive Committee, Chair of the Remuneration Committee |\n| Independent Director            |                                               |                 |             |                           |                          |                                                                     |\n| Second Vice-Chair               | Anthony L.

On 20 October 2020, he was reappointed as a member of the Board of Directors on an interim basis.\n\n<sup>6</sup> On 1 January 2023, Santiago Mart\u00ednez Garrido and Ainara de Elejoste Echebarria were appointed to the positions of non-director secretary and non-director deputy secretary, respectively.\nThe Board of Directors is composed of two executive members (14%) and twelve non-executive members (86%).\n\nIndependent directors make up 71% of total members, including the two deputy chairmen, the lead independent director and the chairmen of all the consultative committees.\n\nThe Board of Directors is characterised by its independence (86% non-executive directors and 71% independent directors), gender balance (each gender representing 50% of non-executive directors and no gender with a representation of less than 43% of all directors), and the diversity of skills, experience and nationalities of its members.\n\nThe gender and age diversity of the members of the Board of Directors are shown below:\n\n- **GRI 405-1 2-9**\n\n| Diversity on the Board of Directors |\n|-------------------------------------|\n|                                      |\n| **2022** | **2021** | **2020** |\n| N\u00ba | % | N\u00ba | % | N\u00ba | % |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| By gender | | | | | |\n| Men | 8 | 57 % | 8 | 57 % | 9 | 64 % |\n| Women | 6 | 43 % | 6 | 43 % | 5 | 36 % |\n| By age group | | | | | |\n| Between 31 and 50 years old | 1 | 7 % | 1 | 7 % | 1 | 7 % |\n| Over 51 years old | 13 | 93 % | 13 | 93 % | 13 | 93 % |\n| Total | 14 | 100 % | 14 | 100 % | 14 | 100 % |\n\nThe balanced presence of women and men is reflected in the fact that each gender represents 50% of non-executive directors since 2021, surpassing the percentages envisaged in Directive (EU) 2022/2381 for 2026.\n\nSeparation of functions, checks and balances, and controls\n\n- **GRI 2-11 2-13**\n\nThe chairman of the Board of Directors is considered the executive chairman and reports to the Board of Directors.\n\nHe exercises the power to represent the Company individually, its senior management, the leadership of the Board of Directors (moderating debates and ensuring that the Board and the Executive Committee, which he also chairs, are functioning properly), and the other powers granted by the Board of Directors, the Governance and Sustainability System, and by law.\nIn his capacity as executive chairman, he also assumes all duties not expressly assigned by the Board of Directors to the chief executive officer. The areas, divisions and positions that do not report to the chief executive officer or other specific bodies report to him.\n\nThe company has had a chief executive officer, as a separate position from the executive chairman, since 25 October 2022. The chief executive officer coordinates the businesses of the group\u2019s companies as the person in overall charge of all of them.\n\nThe chief executive officer strengthens and facilitates the exercise of the powers attributed to the chairman of the Board of Directors, to whom he is subordinate. He therefore reports to the executive chairman. He also reports to the Board of Directors and regularly reports to the Board on his management, making any necessary proposals for decisions on matters within the scope of its powers.\n\nSubordinate in turn to the chief executive officer are the directors of the global businesses of the Group\u2019s companies, along with the chief executive officers of the country subholding companies, among others, who are hierarchically subordinate to their boards of directors and, in the case of listed country subholding companies, with full respect for the special framework of enhanced autonomy given to them by the Governance and Sustainability System.\n\nIn addition, the company has a structure of executives and professionals authorised to implement its strategy and basic management guidelines, with powers provided according to two operating principles: (i) the principle of joint action, which governs the exercise of powers of a decision-making or organisational nature; and (ii) the principle of joint and several action, which governs the exercise of powers of mere representation.\n\nThe management team regularly reports to the Board of Directors, the Executive Committee and the consultative committees as described in the Annual Activities Report of the Board of Directors and the Committees thereof.\n\nThe structure of the Board of Directors\u2014with a large majority of independent directors\u2014, the configuration of its positions, and the existence of consultative committees, provide the structure for a system of checks and balances that ensures that neither the executive chairman, the chief executive officer nor the Executive Committee have decision-making powers that are not subject to the appropriate checks and balances, thus ensuring that they are under the effective supervision of the Board of Directors.\n\nIn particular, the first deputy chair and lead independent director and the second deputy chair, both of whom are independent Board members, serve as a counterbalance to the executive chairman, ensuring that his actions are subject to the appropriate controls.\n\nSimilarly, the group\u2019s corporate and governance structure is designed in such a way that management power is not centralised in a single governing body or in a single person, but rather is decentralised among the boards of directors of the head of business companies, with the Company\u2019s main function being supervision, organisation and strategic coordination at the group level.\nCommittees of the Board of Directors\n\nExecutive Committee\n\n- **GRI 2-9 2-11 2-24**\n\nThe Executive Committee has all the powers inherent in the Board of Directors other than those that cannot be delegated pursuant to law or the *Governance and Sustainability System*.\n\nThe main activities of this Committee consist of continuously monitoring the implementation of the strategy, meeting objectives, the governance model, and submitting proposals to the Board of Directors or making decisions regarding strategic issues in cases of urgency. In particular, this includes investments and divestments that are significant for the Company or its group, assessing whether they are in line with the Company\u2019s budget and strategy, analysing and monitoring business risks, and taking into consideration any environmental and social aspects.\n\nConsultative committees\n\n- **GRI 2-9**\n\nConsultative committees are permanent, internal, informational and consultative bodies within the Board of Directors, without executive powers, with informational, advisory, control and proposal-making powers within their respective scopes of activity, which focus on the following:\n\n  - **Audit and Risk Supervision Committee**: internal audit, internal control and risk monitoring systems, preparation of financial and non-financial information, the audit of the financial statements, and compliance in accordance with the terms set out in its *Regulations*.\n  - **Appointments Committee**: selection, appointment, re-election and removal of the members of the Board of Directors and of the Company\u2019s Senior Management as provided for in its *Regulations*.\n  - **Remuneration Committee**: remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors and of senior management as provided in its *Regulations*.\n  - **Sustainable Development Committee**: review and update of the *Governance and Sustainability System*, preparation of the *Statement of non-financial information*, and supervision of the policies on sustainable development, people management, inclusion and diversity, equal opportunity, occupational health and safety, stakeholder engagement, respect for human rights, sustainability, etc., in accordance with the terms set out in its *Regulations*.\n\nFor more detailed information regarding the composition, operation and activities of the company\u2019s governance bodies, see the *Annual Activities Report of the Board of Directors and of the Committees* thereof.\nBeneficial ownership\n\n- **GRI 2-1 2-6**\n\nAt 31 December 2022 the company\u2019s share capital totalled \u20ac4,771,570,500.00, represented by 6,362,094,000 shares of the same class and series, each with a par value of \u20ac0.75.

Governance and Sustainability System\n\n- Introduction to the Governance and Sustainability System\n- By-Laws\n- *Code of Ethics*\n- Policies and commitments\n- Long-term risks and opportunities. Comprehensive Risk System\nIntroduction to the Governance and Sustainability\n\nThe Company has a Governance and Sustainability System, which evolved from the former Corporate Governance System, and which is structured around three pillars: environmental, social and corporate governance.\n\nLeadership in sustainable development, social commitment, good governance and transparency is one of the hallmarks of Iberdrola\u2019s identity. The Board of Directors therefore regularly reviews the Governance and Sustainability System, keeping it updated and ensuring that it includes the recommendations and best practices accepted in international markets.\nBy-Laws\n\nThe By-Laws at the core of the internal regulations and make up the backbone of the Governance and Sustainability System. Based on the Purpose and Values, they constitute the guidelines that define the identity and uniqueness of the Company and its business enterprise.\n\nCode of Ethics\n\n- GRI 2-12 2-23\n\nIberdrola, S.A. strives for its conduct and that of the people related thereto to comply with and conform not only to current law and its Governance and Sustainability System, but also to generally accepted ethical and sustainable development principles.\n\nThe Company therefore promotes a preventive culture based on the principle of \u201czero tolerance\u201d with regard to committing illegal acts and all forms of fraud and corruption.\n\nThe Board of Directors of Iberdrola, S.A. has approved the Purpose and Values of the Iberdrola group, which sets out the raison d\u2019\u00eatre and the ideological and axiological basis of the business enterprise of the companies that form part of the Iberdrola group and governs their day-to-day activities. The content of the Purpose and Values of the Iberdrola group is further developed and specified in the Code of Ethics of Iberdrola, S.A.\n\nThe Code of Ethics is intended to serve as a guide for the conduct of directors, professionals and suppliers in a global, complex and changing environment. The code has been prepared taking into account the good governance recommendations generally accepted in international markets and the sustainable development principles accepted by Iberdrola, S.A., which constitute a basic tool for monitoring the activities of the Iberdrola group\u2019s companies. It also meets the company\u2019s prevention obligations with regard to the criminal liability of legal entities. It includes the commitment made by Iberdrola, S.A. to the principles of business ethics and transparency in all areas of activity, establishing a set of principles and guidelines for conduct intended to ensure ethical and responsible behaviour by all directors, professionals and suppliers of the Iberdrola group\u2019s companies.\n\nThe code therefore applies to all directors, professionals and suppliers of the Iberdrola group's companies, and to investees that are not part of Iberdrola, S.A. but over which the company has effective control, within the legally established limits, regardless of their rank, geographical location or functional reporting, and of the group company where they perform their services.\n\nExcluded from the scope of application are listed country subholding companies and their subsidiaries, under their own special framework of strengthened autonomy, as they have their own code of ethics or conduct, inspired by a purpose and values that are ultimately in line with the Purpose and Values of the Iberdrola group and governed by the principles set forth in the Code of Ethics.\n\nThe Code of Ethics forms part of the Governance and Sustainability System, which was approved by the Board of Directors of Iberdrola, S.A. in 2002 and last amended on 20 December 2022.\n\nFor more detailed information on the group\u2019s Compliance System, see the \"Ethics and integrity\" section of chapter \"IV.1. Good governance, transparency and Stakeholder engagement\".\nPolicies and commitments\n\nGRI 2-23\n\nThe Iberdrola group has a set of corporate policies that further develop the principles reflected in the Governance and Sustainability System and that contain the guidelines governing the conduct of the company and the companies of its group, as well as those of the directors, officers and employees thereof, within the framework of the Purpose and Values of the Iberdrola group.\n\nThese policies, the full versions of which can be found in the Corporate Governance tab of the website, are grouped into four categories.\n\n- Purpose and Values of the Iberdrola Group (see \"Purpose and Values\"), Code of Ethics (see the \"Code of Ethics\" section), General Sustainable Development Policy and Stakeholder Engagement Policy (see \"III.2. Stakeholder Engagement\" section).\n- Environment and Climate Change\n- Social Commitment\n- Corporate Governance\n\nThese policies and commitments serve to guide the company and its workforce for the management of their activities, and, more specifically, as a guide on the material topics dealt with in this document.\n\nGeneral Sustainable Development Policy\n\nIberdrola has a General Sustainable Development Policy approved by the Board of Directors in 2007 and last revised on 20 December 2022. It sets out the general principles and foundations that govern the group\u2019s sustainable development strategy. The goal is to ensure that all its corporate activities and businesses are carried out by fostering the sustainable creation of value for shareholders and taking into consideration other stakeholders related to its business activities and its institutional reality, equitably contributing along with all the groups that play a role in the success of its business enterprise.\n\nThe policy contains 5 overarching principles of conduct in relation to:\n\n- the creation of shared sustainable value\n- transparency\n- the development and protection of intellectual capital\n- innovation\n- responsible taxation\n\nAnd 8 principles of conduct in relation to the principal Stakeholders:\n\n- workforce\n- shareholders and the financial community\n- customers\n- regulatory entities\n- suppliers\n- media\n- society in general\n- environment\nThe principles of conduct included in these sustainable development policies are described throughout this report.\n\n**Environment and Climate Change Policies**\n\nEnvironmental policies are the response to environmental challenges such as climate change and the loss of biodiversity, while helping to identify and take advantage of the opportunities arising from the energy and ecological transition.\n\n- **Sustainable Management Policy.**\n- **Environmental Policy.**\n- **Climate Action Policy.**\n- **Biodiversity Policy.**\n\nSpecifically, the group\u2019s commitment to sustainability is built around the following main principles of conduct, as set out in its **Sustainable Management Policy:**\n\n- development of a business model based on environmentally sustainable economic activities;\n- competitiveness of the energy products supplied, through efficiency in the processes of generation, storage, transmission, distribution and sale of energy;\n- high quality of service and reliability and security in the supply of energy products;\n- reduction in the environmental impact of all activities performed by group companies;\n- creation of shared sustainable value with the company\u2019s shareholders and its other Stakeholders;\n- promotion of the group\u2019s social commitment and, in particular, respect for human rights as set out in the **Policy on Respect for Human Rights;** and\n- encouragement of the responsible use of energy\n\n**Social Commitment Policies**\n\nWithin the framework of the Company\u2019s sustainable development strategy, the policies relating to social commitment reflect the group\u2019s connection with human rights, the development of professional relationships based on diversity, inclusion and a sense of belonging, which is essential in managing people to promote equal opportunity and to ensure non-discrimination.\n\n- **Policy on Respect for Human Rights**\n- **People Management Policy**\n- **Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy**\n- **Selection and Hiring Policy**\n- **Knowledge Management Policy**\n- **Innovation Policy**\n- **Quality Policy**\n- **Corporate Security Policy**\n- **Policy on the Responsible Use of Artificial Intelligence Tools and Algorithms**\nCorporate Governance Policies\n\nThe corporate governance policies and rules are intended to ensure the proper functioning of the main corporate bodies, the administration and management of the Company, and the development of the business generally, all in accordance with applicable law.\n\nIn particular, these policies and rules are structured into four parts\n\n- Corporate governance and regulatory compliance policies\n- Risk policies\n- Governance rules of the corporate decision-making bodies and of other functions and internal committees\n- Market abuse prevention rules\n\nLong-term risks and opportunities. Comprehensive Risk System\n\nIberdrola\u2019s Board of Directors and senior management is firmly committed to and engaged in the management of the group\u2019s risks:\n\n- **Ex-ante:** acceptable levels of tolerance to risk are reviewed and approved on an annual basis through risk policies that establish (through limits and indicators) the qualitative and quantitative risk appetite at the group level and at each of the main businesses and corporate functions, in accordance with the objectives established in the strategic plan and the annual budgets.\n- **Ex-post:** periodic monitoring of significant risks (key risk maps) and threats and the various exposures of the group, as well as of compliance with the approved limits and indicators.\n\nRisk management within the group is based on foresight, independence, commitment to the group\u2019s business objectives and the engagement of senior management and the Board.\n\n### Functions of the Risk Committee\n\n**Active management**\n\n**Credit risk**\n- Analysis and approval of counterparties and limits, establishment of approval criteria, and monitoring of exposures in order to minimise credit losses.\n\n**Market risk**\n- Analysis and approval of detailed limits and monitoring of exposures in order to constrain the effects of volatility in the markets in which the group operates.\n\n**Coordination of second lines / Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)**\n\nTo ensure, under the internationally recognised three lines model, that there are mechanisms for all significant risks of the group to be controlled at all times and that they are regularly reported to the various committees and externally.\n\nBy way of supplement, the group has a Compliance System, linked to the Board\u2019s Sustainable Development Committee, with elements that include the Code of Ethics and the Compliance Unit.\n\nOverall supervision of operational risk through the group\u2019s corporate Insurance, Security and Cybersecurity, Information Technology and Occupational Safety and Health units and the businesses.\nComprehensive Risk Control and Management System\n\nThe group\u2019s General Risk Control and Management Policy approved by the Board of Directors establishes the mechanisms and basic principles for appropriate management of the risk/opportunity ratio, at a risk level that makes it possible to:\n\n- Attain strategic goals with controlled volatility\n- Ensure the group\u2019s corporate stability, financial strength and reputation (Stakeholders).\n- Contribute to achieving the SDGs, with a special focus on goals seven and thirteen\n- Disseminate a risk culture\n\nIn accordance with the three lines model, the General Risk Control and Management Policy and related policies are implemented within a comprehensive risk control and management system, supported by a Risk Committee, which is based on properly defining and assigning duties and responsibilities at the operational and supervisory level to develop suitable procedures, methodologies and support tools.\n\nRisk policies and limits of the Iberdrola group\n\nThe General Risk Control and Management Policy is further developed and supplemented with the specific policies established in relation to certain risks, corporate functions or businesses of the group, which are also annually approved by the Board of Directors of the group\u2019s parent company, and which include limits and indicators that are subsequently monitored.\n\nThe country subholding companies adopt the group\u2019s risk policies and specify the application thereof, approving the guidelines on specific risk limits, based on the nature and particularities of the businesses in each country. The listed country subholding companies, and companies with significant interests held by other shareholders, approve their own policies under their own special framework of strengthened autonomy.\n\nPrincipal risk factors of the Iberdrola group\n\nThe risk factors to which the group is subject are generally grouped into the following categories:\n\n| Category                        | Definition                                                                                                                                 |\n|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Corporate Governance            | Non-compliance with applicable law, the Governance and Sustainability System, the recommendations set forth in the CNMV\u2019s Code of Good Governance, and international standards |\n| Market                          | Exposure to volatility in variables like electricity and other energy commodity prices, emission rights, exchange rate, interest rate, solvency, liquidity, inflation, raw materials, etc. |\n| Credit                          | Contractual breach by a counterparty, causing economic or financial losses, including payment and replacement cost risks                      |\n| Business                        | Uncertainty as to the behaviour of variables intrinsic to the business, including characteristics of demand, hydraulic resources, wind, solar, etc |\n| Regulatory and political        | Regulatory changes made by the regulators that can affect remuneration of the regulated businesses, environmental or tax provisions, etc.     |\n| Other*                          | External events or inadequate internal procedures, including those stemming from i) technical failures, human error and technological obsolescence, ii) operation and construction of facilities, iii) supply and the supply chain, iv) cybersecurity and systems, v) safety and health, vi) pandemics, extreme natural phenomena and climate change, vii) regulatory compliance, viii) reliability of financial and non-financial information, ix) fraud and corruption, and x) litigation, arbitration and tax matters. |\n| Reputational                    | Potential negative impacts on the company\u2019s reputation arising from situations or events that fail to meet the expectations of its Stakeholders |\n\n* Operational, technological, environmental, social and legal\nGiven the multidimensional nature of the risks, the taxonomy defined in the system contemplates additional classification variables for better monitoring, control and reporting of such risks. These additional categories include the classification of risks into Structural Risks, Hot Topics and Emerging Risks, the latter being understood as potential new threats, the impact of which is as yet uncertain and the probability of which is undefined, but which are growing and could become significant for the Group.\n\nThe system contemplates the continuous monitoring and detection of emerging risks and other non-financial risks, including environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks with significant reputational consequences.\n\n**Evaluation of risk management processes**\n\n- **GRI 2-12**\n\nGenerally, the group\u2019s Comprehensive Risk Control and Management system allows for proper ex ante identification of risks or sounds alarms that allow for the making of decisions intended to minimise the impact of the risks.\n\nThe group\u2019s Risk Committee meets at least on a monthly basis. This committee is supplemented with the Credit Risk and Market Risk Committees, which also meet on a monthly basis. On at least a quarterly basis, the Audit and Risk Supervision Committee of the Board of Directors monitors trends in the group\u2019s risks:\n\n- It reviews the group\u2019s quarterly risk report, which includes monitoring of compliance with the risk policies and limits and the updated key risk maps submitted by the group\u2019s Risk Management and Internal Assurance Division.\n- It coordinates and reviews the Risk Reports sent periodically (at least half-yearly) by the Audit and Compliance Committees of group companies that have such a body.\n- On at least a half-yearly basis, it prepares a risk report for the Board of Directors.\nI.3. Climate action and TCFD\n\n- Introduction to climate action\n- Climate Action Policy\n- Climate governance\n- Management of climate opportunities and risk\n- Objectives and elements of climate action\n- Indicators and metrics\n- Other aspects associated with the energy transition\nIntroduction to climate action\n\n- GRI 201-2  \u25a0  SASB IF-EU-110a.3\n\nIberdrola, a global leader in the fight against climate change, firmly believes that the transition to a carbon-neutral economy by 2050 is technologically possible, economically feasible and socially necessary.\n\nA common denominator of all of Iberdrola\u2019s activities is the sustainable creation of value, in accordance with its social dividend, in addition to the search for leadership. For this reason, in the last two decades, Iberdrola has undertaken a commitment to lead the energy transition, through a sustainable model executed with innovation, flexibility and efficiency in all of its business lines.\n\nAnchored in its commitment to the Paris Agreement and the energy transition, Iberdrola\u2019s climate action Plan reflects the way in which the Group faces the energy transition based on its experience in the renewable energy sector, maximising opportunities arising from climate change and anticipating energy and innovation needs, while optimising resources and reducing the risks posed by climate change in the areas in which the Group does business. Levers are established that drive Iberdrola\u2019s strategy towards the decarbonisation of the company and society, including related metrics and targets, as well as potential financial impacts for the climate scenarios under analysis. All of the foregoing is performed in accordance with recommendations of the \"VI.7. TFCD content index\".\n\nClimate action Plan\n\nIberdrola\u2019s Climate Action Plan establishes an ambitious roadmap aimed at achieving zero net emissions of CO\u2082 equivalent by 2040. This Plan establishes the levers, actions and associated metrics which in turn contribute to the decarbonisation of the economy as a whole, as well as the values supporting it.\n\nWe believe that this aspiration will also promote the sustainable creation of value and is based on the commitment to ensuring a positive contribution to nature and society, contributing to social and economic development through the generation of jobs and wealth. This commitment was presented at COP27, held in Egypt in November 2022.\n\nClimate goals\n\nIberdrola updated its Strategic Prospects for 2025 and 2030 in 2022. The new investment plan (focusing on renewables, smart grids and efficient storage), together with the investments already made in recent years, has enabled the Group to increase the ambitiousness of its emissions-reduction targets.\n\nThe commitment to accelerate the decarbonisation of the economy involves the maximum reduction of each economic player\u2019s direct emissions, as quickly as possible. Iberdrola supports immediate action in the main climate forums: the planet cannot wait. For all these reasons, Iberdrola will use its best efforts to achieve the emissions reduction that science demands of the electricity sector (for Scopes 1 and 2) ten years before the required date (2040). In this way, Iberdrola aspires to achieving carbon neutrality for its Scopes 1 and 2 by 2030, offsetting any residual emissions after 2030. Iberdrola follows the current fledgling methodological and market developments on the offset of emissions, and a detailed market survey will be conducted to work under the highest quality standards.\nThe ultimate aspiration of this commitment of the Iberdrola group is to achieve Net Zero emissions by 2040. If this commitment is achieved, by 2039, the group\u2019s absolute emissions will have been reduced by 90% compared to 2020, and residual emissions will be neutralised.\n\nIberdrola undertakes to use its best efforts to achieve this commitment, for which purpose it will align its strategy, investments, operations and public positioning therewith. In any case, Iberdrola is also committed to facing the energy transition by ensuring the creation of value for its shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers, and the communities in which it does business. The company therefore reserves the ability to adjust its planning to successfully perform in significant material aspects, such as the company value, quality of supply, social/labour conditions, and a fair transition.\n\n**Levers of the Action Plan**\n\nThe actions identified to date to achieve this commitment are grouped into four main levers and one cross-dimensional lever that spans all scopes:\n\na. Investment in 100% renewable technology generation, increasing storage capacity and promoting new technologies (e.g., hybridisation).\n\nb. Investment in 100% smart and robust grid operation as an essential pillar of a decarbonised and electrified energy system.\n\nc. Designing and offering customers green solutions that contribute to the electrification and gradual decarbonisation of energy demand.\n\nd. Green purchases through the acquisition of renewable energy for own consumption, on the one hand, and the establishment of alliances and partnership agreements for joint reduction of emissions and to speed up and facilitate the development of green products, on the other.\n\ne. The promotion of partnerships in green technologies and decarbonisation.\n\nThese levers are supported by an ambitious investment plan and a strong network of partnerships, which drive Iberdrola\u2019s strategy towards the decarbonisation of the company and of society.\n\n**Investment plan**\n\nTo meet the commitment set out in the Climate Action Plan, Iberdrola will continue to promote and spearhead a business model and an investment plan fully integrated into a decarbonised future.\n\nThe 2023-2025 Iberdrola Strategic Plan commits \u20ac47,000 million up to 2025 in order to promote the energy transition, with more than \u20ac27,000 million allocated to networks and investments and \u20ac17,000 million in renewable energy, to deliver 52,000 MW of renewable installed capacity by the end of the period (from ~40 GW in 2022), while increasing storage capacity to 102 GWh. In addition, \u20ac3,000 million will be allocated to the development of green products providing added value to customers. For private customers, proposals focus on solar self-consumption, electric mobility, and green climate control. Industrial customers are offered plans for decarbonisation through climate control and green hydrogen.\n\nThis plan reasserts the 2030 view driven by growth across all markets and the acceleration of electrification. It is expected that by the end of the decade more than \u20ac65,000 million will have been spent in grid assets and 80,000 MW of renewable installed capacity will have been created, thanks to new investments between \u20ac65,000 and \u20ac75,000 million between 2026 and 2030.\nIn line with the investment plan, over the next years, \u20ac2,000 million euros are expected to be invested through 2025 and \u20ac4,000 million through 2030, thus doubling R&D efforts by the end of the decade, which will make it possible to continue to strengthen our model, promoting the development of innovative and sustainable technologies.\n\n**Strategic Plan 2023-2025 in figures**\n\n| \u20acM total | \u20acM investment in networks | \u20acM investment in renewables | Net Zero in scopes 1, 2 and 3 before 2040 |\n|----------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| 47,000   | 27,000                    | 17,000                      | 0                                      |\n\n**Partnerships, global climate agenda, and awareness-raising**\n\nOur aspirations are supported by a strong network of partnerships to promote decarbonisation. In keeping with its strategy, Iberdrola supports ambitious approaches in the framework of its climate policies and the establishment of plans and objectives. Through partnerships, statements and campaigns, Iberdrola also publicly supports ambitious and robust frameworks to face the current challenges as regards climate, energy, environmental and other issues, seeking to generate value and prosperity for society as a whole. In this context, there is a need for all players to be aligned with and committed to the fight against climate change, which makes awareness-raising among society a key.\n\nIberdrola is an active participant, with a high degree of visibility, in the main milestones of the multilateral climate agenda, participating in a large number of technical seminars and high-level conferences. Iberdrola wants to actively and decisively contribute to a sustainable, low-carbon future \u2013 an effort that will also promote social and economic development through the creation of employment and wealth. To this end, the Company is committed to conducting its policy-impacting activities within its areas of influence and alliances in which it participates, in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement.\n\nHence, Iberdrola has played an important role in the inauguration of and parallel events at meetings of the United Nations General Assembly and the various editions of New York Climate Week, climate conferences such as the European Green Growth Summit and the 2022 Green Growth Forum, as well as at the multilateral meetings organised by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\n\nIberdrola also belongs to various international coalitions, backs diverse external initiatives and cooperates with numerous international organisations, business and/or multi-actor coalitions, think tanks and research centres, supporting ambitious global climate action.\nIberdrola has been a member of the UN Global Compact since 2002, and it has belonged to the Red Espa\u00f1ola del Pacto Mundial since 2004, as a founding member. Through this membership, Iberdrola has assumed, inter alia, the commitment to implement the Ten Principles and to promote the 2030 Agenda, contributing to the attainment and dissemination of the SDGs. The company has been identified as a LEAD company on numerous occasions, owing to its high levels of commitment to the principles of the Global Compact, and it has been at the forefront of the climate action platform since its inception in 2016, and which has focused this year on working on a fair transition thinklab as a forum for collaboration and to drive climate action from an inclusive point of view and create value for society as a whole.\n\nIberdrola has been one of the companies most intensely involved in the successive Conferences of Parties (CoPs) on Climate Change, organised by the UNFCCC on an annual basis. At COP27 held in Sharm el-Sheikh in November 2022, Iberdrola was an official partner of the main business alliance on climate, We Mean Business, worked with the United Nations on organising a high-level event at its pavilion, and played a leading role, organising more than 10 high-level events with more than 60 impactful presentations at the principal meetings and events.\n\nIberdrola is very actively involved in the We Mean Business initiative through its support for specific campaigns, including the implementation of initiatives in Spain to promote climate action among small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME Climate Hub). As part of the New York Climate Week, We Mean Business mentioned Iberdrola as a leading company in climate action thanks to its contribution to a more sustainable energy model, placing it at the head of the \u20184A\u2019s\u2019 (Ambition, Action, Advocacy y Accountability) campaign.\nAs part of the coexistence between renewable energy and the preservation of biodiversity, as well as its contribution to social and economic development, Iberdrola forms part of CLEANAction (Coalition Linking Energy and Nature for Action), founded by BirdLife International, WWF, IRENA and The Nature Conservancy, among others.\n\nIberdrola is also part of Race to Zero, a global alliance promoted by the High Level Climate Champions and the United Nations, bringing together companies, governments and various players in civil society committed to reaching a zero net emissions future no later than by mid-century.\n\nOne of the most prominent initiatives in which Iberdrola takes part is the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, a part of the World Economic Forum platform. This is a global community of CEOs who support and promote action to achieve the transition to a net zero emissions economy. Iberdrola\u2019s chairman, Ignacio Gal\u00e1n, has joined this alliance along with 70 other business leaders in various industries and regions.\n\nAnother noteworthy initiative is the Corporate Leaders Group, a business alliance with broad recognition in Europe and internationally for spearheading the most ambitious stances on climate policies, in which Iberdrola actively participates at all levels, holding the vice presidency.\n\nIberdrola has also been a member, since its inception, of the Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA), a coalition of governments, regions and companies focused on promoting the shutdown of coal within the framework of a fair transition to a clean energy model. Here, with a broader approach to a just transition, it has contributed to the creation of the collaborative platform promoted by BSR and BTEAM called Energy for a Just Transition.\n\nIndustry campaigns, which contribute to sending a signal of demand for green products, and which thus have a driving effect on the various players in the supply chain, include its joining the SteelZero initiative of The Climate Group, which brings together organisations committed to speeding up the transition to a net zero steel industry, in 2022.\n\nAlong these lines, Iberdrola was the first Spanish company to adhere to the EV100 initiative, intended to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles, as Iberdrola has made a commitment to electrify its entire vehicle fleet and to facilitate recharging by its employees in Spain and the United Kingdom by 2030.\n\nIberdrola\u2019s support for the \u201cLeadership for Net Zero\u201d project of the Madrid Club, to highlight the role of democratic leadership in the fight against climate change, has played an important role in reinforcing multilateral dialogue for climate action.\n\nIn 2022, within the framework of COP27 and the main international climate milestones, Iberdrola has joined in important declarations, alliances and campaigns, including the following:\n\n- 1.5\u00b0C Business Sign-on Statement at COP27, promoted by the We Mean Business Coalition to reaffirm the commitment and maintain efforts to limit the rise in temperature to 1.5\u00b0C, reducing global emissions by half by 2030.\n- Global wind energy manifesto for COP27 of GWEC, released beforehand in September, signed by more than 100 leading companies in wind energy, asking the signatories of the Paris Agreement to optimise planning and permits, update grid infrastructure, and develop energy markets to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy.\n- World Economic Forum (WEF) letter in support of ambitious frameworks for climate policies: Open Letter for world of the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27).\n\u2022 COP27 Action Declaration on climate policy engagement promoted by Corporate Knights in support of ambitious climate policy frameworks to reduce emissions by half by 2030 and achieve the net zero global goal by 2050.\n\nIberdrola also supported the Green Jobs for Youth initiative, promoted in partnership with the International Labour Organization (ILO), the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), seeking to promote the creation of green jobs among young people.\n\n**IBERDROLA UNICEF Alliance**\n\nIberdrola has entered into an alliance of great social impact with UNICEF to promote education and employment for vulnerable young people, as part of the opportunities offered by the energy transition and climate action, both in Spain and at the international level.\n\nIn Spain, Iberdrola promotes the alliance by contributing our knowledge, experience, innovation, financial resources, human resources and the involvement of our value chain. To this end, Iberdrola designs training itineraries of a high technical quality in the various areas of the green economy and, together with social entities supporting the young people, it develops their abilities to obtain internships and/or employment within our value chain.\n\nAt the international level, Iberdrola supports Learning Passport, UNICEF\u2019s global education platform, and supports projects in Somalia and Brazil. In Brazil, with the 1 Million Opportunities (1MiO) programme for the inclusion of vulnerable adolescents and young people in the job market, promoting young people\u2019s skills, work opportunities, and green jobs, particularly in the Semiarid and Amazon regions. In Somalia, with the UPSHIFT Social Innovation programme, which seeks to train children in innovation and entrepreneurship so that they can develop social-impact projects to help their communities. In the Learning Passport programme, which provides ongoing access to quality education, Iberdrola provides content on climate change to create opportunities for children and young people so they can learn about and become committed to climate action.\n\n**Climate action values**\n\nDue to its cross-dimensional nature, the Climate Action Plan is based on the aspiration of making climate action compatible with the general social interest and contributing to sustainable development, so as to contribute to building an energy model in harmony with nature and human beings.\n\nIberdrola\u2019s \u201cConvive\u201d programme is a clear example of this ambition, as it brings together all initiatives and alliances that create bridges for energy transition in harmony with nature and with people.\n\n**Positive for society**\n\nIn supporting energy transition and the green economy, Iberdrola is committed to a just and inclusive transition, promoting economic and industrial development, as well as universal access to competitive energy.\n\nThus it becomes an economic and industrial driver, encouraging the creation of new business lines and industries of the future, contributing to the strength of the industrial fabric and to the creation of new jobs connected to the green economy.\n\nThe Iberdrola UNICEF alliance described above is an example of an initiative seeking to promote training and employment.\n\nIberdrola is also aware that the transition toward a decarbonised model will entail structural changes with a strong impact on certain regions, areas and groups. So that no one is to be left behind, this transition must be fair and inclusive.\nOn this path, Iberdrola is part of the Agreement for a just transition for coal power plants: jobs, industry and territories, along with the Ministry for Ecological Transition, Ministry of Labour and Social Economy, other companies that own coal-fired thermal power plants in Spain, and union organisations, assuming the commitments established for fulfilling the 2015 Paris Agreement and the Energy and Climate Strategic Framework in its Fair Transition Strategy. This strategy promotes ensuring that workers and territories make the most of the transition opportunities and minimise the negative impacts thereof through support and recovery measures.\n\nThis year, Iberdrola has continued to work on the open innovation platform launched in 2020 to channel entrepreneurship initiatives that serve as to accelerate the processes for collaboration between citizens, public entities and companies in the regions where Spanish coal plants have been shut down, Lada and Velilla. This innovative tool promotes the generation of knowledge among the parties involved, actively seeking interests and synergies so as to tackle the specific demographic and economic challenges of each area. This initiative follows the principles, methodologies and goals established by the European Commission for a new European \u201cGreen Deal\u201d, which assign Spain a number of specific objectives and resources. It is based on listening and co-creation methods, which are the basis for the development of a portfolio of social and economic development initiatives at 5 different levels of action: (1) community initiatives, (2) social entrepreneurship projects, (3) large-scale public-private actions, (4) new public services, and (5) experimentation in new regulations.\n\n**General objectives**\n\n- To accompany the closure of Iberdrola\u2019s plants in Lada and Velilla with a process to identify new social and economic opportunities for these areas.\n- Promoting new initiatives associated with the SDGs in the area.\n- Offering a space for advanced experimentation for the European Commission\u2019s Green Deal strategy in Spain\n\n**Specific objectives**\n\n- Designing, implementing, and assessing an open innovation platform as an instrument of intervention for the closure of first-generation thermal plants.\n- Promoting a portfolio of innovation projects directly associated with the aspirations of local citizens.\n- Creating a network of public and private players associated with the platform to work as an open innovation platform.\n- Identifying a set of principles, criteria and methodologies for the transformation of territories facing the closure of polluting energy plants (fair transition processes).\n- Attracting potential financing partners for this type of process.\n\nWork on the Platform is expected to be completed in 2023, when a detailed study of the impact on the area will be conducted.\n\nIberdrola is also accelerating universal access to competitive energy as a lever for human and economic development. As part of the Electricity for All Programme, the goal is to provide electricity to 16 million persons who currently lack it by 2030. It also attends to customers who are economically disadvantaged or in any other situation of vulnerability, establishing specific procedures of protection and collaborating in providing ongoing access to energy supply in accordance with the policies established by the competent government authorities in each case.\nPositive for nature\n\nClimate action is supported by a strong commitment to the protection of nature, jointly tackling the threefold environmental crisis (climate, biodiversity and overexploitation of resources) that we are facing.\n\nIberdrola interacts with different ecosystems and species in various geographic areas. Aware of the urgent need to stop and reverse the unprecedented loss of biodiversity denounced by the scientific community, Iberdrola has strengthened its commitment to the protection of and action for biodiversity and nature with the 2030 Biodiversity Plan, which applies to the entire Iberdrola group and sets out its commitment to have a net positive impact on biodiversity by 2030. Along these lines, the Iberdrola 2020-2030 Trees Programme has the goal of planting 20 million trees by 2030, and it is estimated that it will contribute to the capture of up to 6 MtCO2eq in 30 years, a clear example of a project that makes it possible to achieve this twofold goal of leading change and generating a positive impact. More information can be found in the \"Objectives and Biodiversity Plan 2030\".\n\nIberdrola also supports a circular economy model encompassing the entire value chain within Iberdrola\u2019s boundary and including both internal actions (optimisation and improvement) and driving actions, in relation to both suppliers and customers. The greatest lever to promote the circular economy is currently the reduction in the use of fossil fuel thanks to the goals of deploying renewable technology.\n\nFor example, in 2022, Iberdrola, through its PERSEO programme and FCC \u00c1mbito, a subsidiary of FCC Servicios Medio Ambiente, launched EnergyLOOP to lead the recycling of components of renewable facilities, one of the greatest medium- and long-term challenges in the sector. This initiative will also contribute to the energy transition and to boost the circular economy in Spain. More information can be found in the \u201cInnovation and digital transformation projects\u201d section.\n\nClimate governance\n\nIberdrola was a pioneer in establishing the fight against climate change as a priority in the Corporate Governance System, now the Governance and Sustainability System. The first policy relating to the measures taken by the Company was approved in 2009. The Climate Action Policy establishes the framework for Iberdrola\u2019s strategy and business model in the fight against climate change, which is in line with the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda. Through this policy, Iberdrola is committed to continue assuming a leadership position (directly and by establishing partnerships), promoting awareness (impacts, challenges and benefits of its achievement) and contributing to a carbon-neutral and sustainable future.\n\nIberdrola\u2019s principles of conduct include implementation of the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) and of other leading organisations for identifying and reporting long-term risks relating to climate change. Along these lines, Iberdrola was one of the first companies to publicly commit to implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). For this purpose, the company created an internal multidisciplinary working group in 2017 to coordinate all the work performed in this area.\nSo as to be always focused on the best compliance with and implementation of the policies, the Company has several corporate bodies and internal committees that ensure the monitoring of those policies. The amendment of the By-Laws approved by the shareholders in June 2021 formalises the obligation of the Board of Directors to approve, supervise and regularly report on the Climate Action Plan. This Statement of Non-Financial Information is the instrument through which the Company and its Board of Directors fulfil this obligation.\n\nIn line with the need for professionalisation, diversification and qualification on relevant topics, the Board has a training and refresher programme for its members, the topics of which include decarbonisation and the fight against climate change. In 2022, there were a total of 8 meetings to discuss topics pertaining to climate change within the corporate decision-making of Iberdrola, S.A. In particular, the directors of Innovation and Sustainability and of Climate Change and Alliances met on a recurring basis with the Sustainable Development Committee, and the director of Risk and Internal Assurance met with the Audit and Risk Supervision Committee. Both environmental risks and the risks associated with climate change were discussed at these meetings, as were the corresponding alert mechanisms to properly monitor them. The Sustainable Development Committee was also presented at several meetings with the proposed amendment to the Climate Action Plan, which was ultimately approved by the Board of Directors in October 2022. Finally, the programme for the information and training of the Board of Directors and its committees also considered this matter last year, for these purposes including the preparation of a training document for the Board of Directors in relation to the technologies available in the context of the energy transition, and a physical meeting was held with the Sustainable Development Committee on innovation and major elements for better climate change governance.\nIn turn, the remuneration structure for executive directors and the management team takes into account economic/financial, operational and sustainability aspects. A long-term remuneration plan (2020-2022 Strategic Bonus) was approved in April 2020. This plan sets out parameters relating to the Sustainable Development Goals, such as reducing the average intensity of CO\u2082 emissions and increasing the number of suppliers subject to sustainable development standards, among others (see additional details in the \"Remuneration policy\" section under \"Corporate Governance\").\n\nMore detailed information can be found in Section \"I.2. Governance and Sustainability System\", as well as the following link: Governance and Sustainability System.\n\nThe group is exposed to various risks inherent in the different countries, industries and markets in which it operates, and the activities it performs, and which may prevent it from achieving its objectives and implementing its strategies. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors, being aware of the importance of this aspect, is committed to fully developing its abilities to ensure that the significant risks of all of the group\u2019s activities and businesses, including the risks of climate change, are adequately identified, measured, managed, and controlled.\n\nManagement of climate opportunities and risks\n\nClimate change is a systemic, global risk, and one of the global crises faced by Humanity. Companies should contribute to the fight against this risk through actions to mitigate climate change, reducing their emissions and decarbonising their business model; as well as acting against the impacts of climate change, improving their adaptation and resilience. Climate change poses various risks, with increasing long-term impacts that, to a greater or lesser degree, may not be considered new risks for the sector. Climate change accelerates the existing risks set out in the Iberdrola group\u2019s risk catalogue (see General Risk Control and Management Policy), which are therefore monitored. They may be classified as:\n\n- Physical, stemming from possible material impacts on the facilities and the supply chain as a result of effects of the future evolution of climate variables (higher temperatures, rising sea levels, changes in precipitation patterns, increased extreme weather events in terms of both frequency and intensity, etc.). Based on TCFD nomenclature, a distinction is made between acute risks and chronic risks.\n- Transition, associated with all the risks that can appear in the gradual global decarbonisation process, such as regulatory changes, market, technological and reputational risks, grievances (such as for deficient reporting), changes in demand, etc.\n- Other risks may arise as a result of these risks, including those relating to deterioration in the credit of counterparties (suppliers, banks, others), social phenomena (humanitarian crises, impacts on crops and fishing, refugee crises, epidemics) and greater competition for financial resources.\n\nThe identification, analysis and management of the risks arising from climate change are addressed through a multi-departmental focus, with cooperation between corporate and business functions.\n\nIberdrola faces climate change risks from a favourable position, as it has:\n\na. Extensive experience in the management of risks accelerated by climate change, both physical (at the operational level) and transitional (such as regulatory and market risks).\n\nb. Financial strength.\n\nc. A diversified business (from the business, geographic and technological standpoint), with low exposure to gas assets and no coal plants.\nFor more information on Iberdrola\u2019s risks, as well as its governance, identification and monitoring systems, see the \u201cLong-term risks and opportunities.

This is because of the crucial influence of governments and regulators on the structure and operation of markets and public utility sectors. The physical risks to facilities and their operation require global management, applying best practices and selecting the appropriate technologies: Iberdrola\u2019s growth, through strong development of renewable energy and flexible and smart grids, is an example of this.\n\nIberdrola has been a pioneer in promoting renewable energy and fighting climate change, and has achieved a leadership position allowing it to benefit from opportunities and anticipate the potential risks of transition, such as those included in the following table, thus actively contributing to global decarbonisation.\nAnalysis of transition scenarios\n\nThe new strategic plan for the 2022-2025 period, internally updating forecasts to 2030, was published in 2022. The risks and opportunities of various climate transition scenarios in the short, medium, and long term were analysed within this framework.\n\nIberdrola has analysed risks and opportunities in different scenarios since 2018. Working groups were expanded in 2022 to increase the involvement of the countries in which the Iberdrola Group has a presence. This has strengthened and homogenised the internal tools that support compliance with national regulations on TCFD reporting.\n\nBenchmark scenarios\n\nDuring the last year, specific transition scenarios were built, adjusted on the basis of benchmark scenarios, considering the specificities of each geographic area in which the Iberdrola group has a presence. Elements from international and regional public scenarios as well as other internal regional considerations were included. The goal was to formulate them at a scale suitable to the businesses of the Group.\n\nThree transition scenarios were considered for the analysis of risks and opportunities. A baseline scenario, in line with the group\u2019s strategic forecasts, and two alternative scenarios, for which the potential risks and opportunities by comparison to the baseline scenario were assessed:\n\n- **FOCUS ON ENERGY TRANSITION (FET)**: This is the baseline scenario, based mainly on the forecasts made in the Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) published by the International Energy Agency in the Word Energy Outlook (WEO \u201921), and is in line with the Paris goals. Iberdrola\u2019s strategy has been consistent with this scenario in recent years, and it continued to be in force during the work to prepare for Capital Markets Day (held on 9 November 2022). Two more recently published scenarios were also taken into account to establish this baseline scenario: the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) (WEO \u201922) and the Consumer Transformation Scenario (CT) published by the National Grid in the Future Energy Scenarios set (FES \u201922). The APS scenario assumes that all the aspirational goals announced by governments, including energy access and long-term net zero goals, will be met on time and in full. If implemented on time and in full, a temperature increase of about 1.7\u00ba C in the APS by 2100 would be maintained. The UK CT scenario is based on a high level of electrification, arising from customers\u2019 willingness to change behaviour, high efficiency and improved demand flexibility.\n\n- **SLOWER TRANSITION SCENARIO**: this scenario considers a slowdown in fulfilling more ambitious commitments or potential breaches of commitments made. As a result, global warming would be limited to less than 2\u00ba. This scenario is based on the forecast published by WEO22 for the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), which shows the trajectory of the policies currently approved. Regional scenarios like the Falling short Scenario (FS) published by National Grid (FES 2022), which involves not reaching Net Zero in the United Kingdom by 2050, have also been combined.\n\n- **FASTER TRANSITION SCENARIO**: this third scenario considers more optimistic and ambitious hypotheses, based on the estimates in the Net Zero Scenario (NZ) (WEO2022), which describes a way to globally achieve stabilisation of a 1.5\u00ba C increase in global average temperatures, together with universal access to modern energy by 2030. It is also based on the regional projections made by National Grid for its accelerating decarbonisation scenario, combining increased consumer commitment with significant great technological and investment advances, called the Leading the Way Scenario (LW) (FES 2022).\n2023 - 2025 period\n\nThe short term is described by the period covered by the Strategic Plan published by Iberdrola at Capital Markets Day 2022, which updates the group\u2019s strategy describing the opportunities for growth identified for the next 3 years. In this Plan, Iberdrola reaffirms its strategy for growth based on smart grids and renewable energy, optimising the implementation of its project portfolio in a complex macroeconomic context. The key risk-inducing variables are inflation, interest rates, economic growth, commodity prices, exchange rates and regulation.\n\nTo minimise risks, Iberdrola opts for sustained investment in grids, in predictable frameworks with incentives for investment. It provides for selective investment in renewables, ensuring the projects with the best risk profile are chosen, seeking to build a portfolio with future growth and viable alternatives. Priority is given to investment in financially appealing markets, with a high rating, ambitious electrification goals, and regulatory stability. Iberdrola is committed to maintaining its financial strength, always taking the social, environmental and governance pillars into account.\n\nAll of this allows for the affirmation that no significant risks arising from climate transition scenarios other than the basic case in the short term have been observed, thanks to the resilience of the business model and the strategy of the Iberdrola Group.\n\nHowever, the exceptional situation arising from the invasion of Ukraine by Russia has led to the implementation of various measures by governments, particularly in Europe, that might delay progress towards a low-carbon economy (intervention in electricity markets, rate hikes, etc.) The Iberdrola Group supports measures that provide a \u201cgreen exit\u201d from the crisis.\n\n2025 - 2030 period\n\nIt is in the medium term that climate transition scenarios are a key tool for evaluating the impact of climate change on the company and its current strategy. The analysis of the three scenarios described for the 2025-2030 period is intended to identify the impacts and opportunities offered by variations in key parameters in the energy sector and macroeconomic domain for the businesses and geographic areas in which the Iberdrola Group has a presence. The key parameters in the scenarios are linked to operational business indicators, such that changes therein have both positive and negative impacts on the businesses. The levels of correspondence (medium or high) between the main parameters examined in the climate scenarios and the key parameters of the group\u2019s businesses are specified below.\nAs discussed, the potential scenarios analysed by Iberdrola consider plausible projections made by highly credible organisations, as well as internal assumptions based on the particularities of the specific geographic areas in which Iberdrola has a presence within the countries. The regional values of the parameters selected from each climate scenario have thus been specified. For example, electricity demand could potentially be reduced by 18% in the Slower scenario, or increase by 9% in the Faster scenario compared to the baseline scenario; as for renewable installed capacity, potential reductions of up to 44% are projected in the Slower scenario, and increases of up to 33% in the Faster scenario, in certain geographic areas to be analysed where the Group has a presence.\n\nTo conduct the analysis, the behaviour of the parameters most sensitive to potential changes in the climate scenarios for each country was analysed, both in the main geographic areas in which the group has a presence and in other high-activity countries as shown in the map below:\nThis analysis of scenarios has allowed for the identification of the main risks and opportunities by business and geographic area, as well as the absence of significant impacts in some cases. The table below provides a qualitative description of the trend of the most relevant operating indicators for each business and geographic area under the two alternative scenarios.\n\n### Impact 2030\n\n| Business | Region | Type of Impact | Slower Transition Scenario | Faster Transition Scenario |\n|----------|--------|----------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Retail   | Europe | GWh            | Not significant, Low, Medium, High | Not significant, Low, Medium, High |\n|          | United Kingdom | | | |\n| Global Generation | Spain | MW/GWh | Not significant, Low, Medium, High | Not significant, Low, Medium, High |\n|          | United Kingdom | | | |\n|          | Brazil | | | |\n|          | Mexico | | | |\n| Network  | Spain | ME/GWh | Not significant, Low, Medium, High | Not significant, Low, Medium, High |\n|          | United Kingdom | | | |\n|          | United States | | | |\n|          | Brazil | | | |\n\n- Positive impact\n- Not significant\n- Negative impact\nThe *Slower* scenario shows, in the mid-term, a slower speed in the increase in demand for electricity and for the installation of new renewable generation, and a lower penetration of generation in the mix with respect to the baseline scenario. There is also a smaller change in consumers\u2019 mindset, with the home gas consumption percentages remaining high and electricity percentages remaining low. All of the foregoing is compared to the baseline scenario forecast by Iberdrola for 2030. The main impacts on the group\u2019s businesses and geographic areas are:\n\n- Europe retail: due to the slower speed of electrification reached in this scenario, the projections in the strategic plan for Europe might be negatively affected by a medium magnitude.\n- Spain and USA renewables: some of the developments currently forecast for 2030 would slow down, and their implementation would be postponed due to the reduction in installed renewable capacity compared to the projection in the base case for 2030.\n- The impact on the USA and UK grids would be less significant: due to lower investment in grids than forecast in the plan, as well as lower electrification for homes and vehicles.\n- The rest of the businesses would maintain the expected growth rates.\n\nIn the *Faster* scenario, focusing on achieving net zero by 2050, the key indicators for the decarbonisation scenarios, which are drivers for growth for Iberdrola\u2019s businesses, would already be strongly boosted by 2030. It must be supported by more ambitious commitments from countries and the establishment of the regulatory frameworks and accelerated procedures required to meet this goal. It will also require strengthening and ensuring the financial instruments for technological and infrastructure deployment across all geographic areas. The following opportunities for Iberdrola stand out:\n\n- Spain, USA and IEI renewables: where the impacts could be very high if these more ambitious increases in renewable energy are achieved, driven by European and American commitments and policies. They would also generate significant opportunities in Australia and new Asian countries.\n- Spain, USA and UK networks: This is the scenario with the highest investment in renewables and in transmission and distribution networks to accelerate the network reinforcement and infrastructure improvement projects needed to ensure integration of the system and quality of supply.\n- No significant impacts on the rest of businesses are found, as the investments and developments in the current plan are guaranteed.\n\nThe variations in the operating parameters described above have an impact on financial indicators for the various businesses and geographic areas. The positive and negative impact on EBITDA with respect to the expected data for 2030 in both transition scenario alternatives to the base case is described below. By 2030 there could be more opportunities than risks overall, mainly driven by the Group\u2019s renewable businesses.\nIn the *Slower* scenario, the variations in the operating parameters identified above could have an impact on the Iberdrola group's businesses, reducing EBITDA by \u20ac100 million to \u20ac300 million in 2030, except for the Networks business, which would undergo an impact lower than \u20ac100 million. In the *Faster* scenario, opportunities for growth are identified for the Networks businesses of \u20ac100 million to \u20ac300 million, and of more than \u20ac300 million for the Global Generation businesses, driven by the results of the renewables business in Spain, the USA and IEI. Finally, smaller opportunities could arise in the retail business, achieving slight improvements in EBITDA, estimated to be far below \u20ac100 million.\n\nThe Net-Zero scenario has been evaluated assuming organic growth and a stable balance sheet structure.\n\n**2030-2050 period**\n\nThe projections of the key transition parameters become more uncertain in the long term. However, the strengths of Iberdrola\u2019s management of its strategy are always based on stable and sustained growth in the geographic areas, with lower financial risks, greater regulatory stability, and assurance of the Group\u2019s profit. Thus, with the currently available projections, no significant risks to the decarbonisation path being led by the Iberdrola Group in key geographic areas are expected. Any opportunities that may emerge are expected to be significant, so Iberdrola continues to lead investment, but also innovation and the promotion of new technologies, thus fostering global progress in the industry as well as capitalising on new opportunities as they arise.\n\nTo conclude, the group\u2019s current positioning, based on the levers of its action plan (see \"Climate Action Plan\" section), places it in a favourable position to maximise opportunities and efficiently face transition risks in the various climate scenarios analysed.\n\nThe group believes that the opportunities stemming from the decarbonisation of the global economy (growth in renewables, investments in integrated smart grids, storage, electrification of industrial sectors and transport, green energy, etc.) outweigh the risks.\nIdentification and evaluation of physical opportunities and risks\n\nPhysical risks arising from climate change are specific to each site, gradual, associated with each technology, and occur over relatively long periods, although, as in the specific case of extreme weather events, an increase in the frequency and intensity thereof can already be seen in the short term.\n\nIberdrola monitors and manages physical risks arising from climate change through a permanent climate science analysis process and applies it in the Company\u2019s usual procedures.\n\nAs part of the ongoing learning and knowledge improvement process, Iberdrola is part of the International Energy Agency (IEA) working group on resilience for energy security, among other initiatives. The Iberdrola Group has contributed with its review of and contributions to the Climate Resilience for Energy Security report, published in November 2022.\n\nAnalysis of physical scenarios\n\nIn 2022 Iberdrola applied its methodology to identify and assess physical impacts arising from climate change in line with the requirements set out in the EU sustainable activities taxonomy. Iberdrola has analysed the evolution of the main climate threats based on regionalised projections obtained from leading climate tools in the various regions in which it operates, including Copernicus (Europe), AdapteCCa (Spain), UK Climate Projections, the INPE platform (Brazil), etc. After a prior analysis of the evolution of different climate variables in an RCP4.5 scenario vs an RCP 8.5 scenario in the 2030-2050 time horizon, the conservative RCP 8.5 scenario was selected as the baseline to identify and assess the main climate risks to the company\u2019s various assets.\n\nTaking the methodology defined by IPCC as a reference, the steps taken to identify the main impacts, risks and associated opportunities were the following:\n\n- Analysis of the sensitivity of each technology to the variations in the different climate variables.\n- Impact level based on the sensitivities and expected evolution of climate threats at the regional level.\n- Estimation of risk based on the presence of assets by technology in the different geographic areas and the adaptive capacity thereof.\n\nThe assessment shows that many of the physical risks arising from climate change, both chronic and extreme, affect usual business variables, and thus variables that are managed to a greater or lesser extent in its usual operational processes. However, climate change will affect the probability of occurrence of these risks and potentially the intensity thereof. As part of the analysis of the Group\u2019s various assets within the DNSH framework of adaptation to the EU taxonomy, extreme weather events are identified as one of the main threats for the various technologies and jurisdictions.\n\nThe table below summarises, individually for the various technologies included in the taxonomy and before considering their adaptive capacity/resilience, the estimated impact of the evolution of the main climate variables and the presence (e.g., installed MW) in the various geographies. The impact reflected is global by type of asset, resulting from the combination of the results obtained for the different regions in which Iberdrola operates.\n\n---\n\n7The most recent IPCC report (AR6) includes a new set of illustrative scenarios of emissions that explore the climate response for a broad range of emitters, soil uses and pollutants. The impact of the new scenarios on the evaluation of risks will be revised based on the projections of this new set of scenarios and its inclusion within the regionalised projection tools.\nMain impacts\n\n| Technology                  | Extreme temperature | Scarcity of precipitation | Storms and extreme wind | Forest fires | Extreme precipitation and floods |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------|\n| Onshore and offshore wind energy | \u25cf                   | N/A                       | \u25cf                       | \u25cf            | \u25cf                                |\n| Solar PV                    | \u25cf\u25cf                  | \u25cf                         | \u25cf                       | \u25cf            | \u25cf                                |\n| Battery                     | \u25cf\u25cf                  | N/A                       | \u25cf                       | \u25cf            | \u25cf\u25cf                               |\n| Hydroelectric               | \u25cf                   | \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf                       | \u25cf                       | \u25cf            | \u25cf\u25cf                               |\n| Transmission & Distribution | \u25cf\u25cf                  | N/A                       | \u25cf\u25cf                      | \u25cf            | \u25cf\u25cf                               |\n| Hydrogen                    | \u25cf\u25cf                  | \u25cf\u25cf                        | \u25cf                       | \u25cf            | \u25cf\u25cf                               |\n\n- \u25cf Low potential impact\n- \u25cf\u25cf Medium potential impact\n- \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf Medium/high potential impact\n\nAs can be seen in the table above, in terms of impact, extreme temperature and the associated fires, strong winds and extreme precipitation, together with water scarcity, are some of the variables that most affect the various assets of Iberdrola. It should be borne in mind, as mentioned above, that this table shows global results that are the outcome of the analysis conducted within the EU Taxonomy framework in each of the regions where Iberdrola operates.\n\nThe conclusions of this analysis and of the assessment of the adaptive capacity of the various assets lay the basis for in-depth analysis of future physical risks, focusing in particular on those geographies where significant potential impacts and a wide asset base are identified.\n\nBased on the potential impact, the degree of resilience of the various assets of Iberdrola should be considered to determine the risk level to which they are exposed. Iberdrola analyses the resilience of the various business areas based on three key concepts for framing it: robustness (derived from design and construction procedures), recovery (derived from early-detection tools and action protocols) and adaptive capacity. Some of these measures are summarised in the table below by way of example:\n### Resilience analysis measures\n\n| Robustness | Recovery | Adaptation |\n|------------|----------|------------|\n| **Climatological studies:** Exhaustive studies of the specific climatology in each location to evaluate production uncertainty based on climate variations. Implementation of design improvements to increase resistance against climate change events. | **Monitoring and follow-up:** Monitoring of turbine oil temperature: machine oil temperature is continuously controlled through the machine cooling circuit. | **Innovation Strategy:** Iberdrola\u2019s R&D vision consists of promoting the development of innovative and sustainable technologies, in line with the main vectors for the transformation of the energy sector: the decarbonisation of generation through mass integration of renewable energy, boosting smart power grids, and the electrification of demand. Many of the ongoing innovation initiatives for digitisation and automation, innovation with start-ups, etc. contribute in different degrees to increasing the resilience of assets and infrastructures against climate change. |\n| **Pumping technology:** One of the pillars of the hydraulic generation strategy is the promotion of hydroelectric storage, as well as the optimisation of power plant operation at low loads. Iberdrola is working along two lines: firstly, on the development of hydroelectric pumping technology, through the placement of future projects and converting conventional plants into mixed plants. | **Emergency and self-protection plans:** All Iberdrola facilities have self-protection plans against extreme events, as well as instructions in the case of emergencies, which guarantees rapid and coordinated response to extreme weather events such as landslides, fires and heavy rain. | |\n| **Fire protection action plans,** which are clearing and pruning plans, identifying the type of vegetation and the optimal time for the work, as well as work procedures suited to the time of year, highly restrictive if there is a risk of fire (limited use of machines, available tanks and pumps to contain any fire caused during an activity, etc.) | **Smart grids:** The digitisation of networks is intended to provide the data to transform business processes. Quality and reliable data that can be transformed into key information to learn about the status of the grid, enabling a smarter, more dynamic network management model. | |\n| **Early alert systems:** Meteolow system, incorporating the forecast of weather events such as temperature rises, which allows for the activation of emergency plans sufficiently in advance and with better management of equipment. | | |\n\n### Risk management and resilience mechanisms\n\nThe group believes that the opportunities stemming from the decarbonisation of the global economy (growth in renewables, investments in integrated smart grids, electrification of transport, green energy, etc.) outweigh the risks.\n\nIn terms of physical risks, based on the impacts described in the previous sections (which consider the current uncertainty associated with climate projections) and the mitigating factors considered, it is estimated that the physical risks associated with climate change might not have a significant and permanent impact on the group\u2019s consolidated figures, which is believed to be globally resilient.\n\nIn terms of transition risks, the group\u2019s current positioning as a result of its investment focus on grids and renewable energy puts it in a favourable position for facing such risks.\nTo summarise, the group's main risk management mechanisms, as well as its mitigating actions, are listed below:\n\n- Integration of climate change as a key management and corporate governance element.\n- Many risks deriving from climate change affect the normal variables of the business, and, consequently, variables already managed (to a greater or lesser degree) in the usual operations of the businesses (e.g. redundancy of equipment, emergency plans, crisis plans, digitalisation, line burying and meshing, etc.), which have management processes that already contribute to climate resilience.\n- The fact that many impacts are primarily medium/long-term means that, to a large extent, it is the group\u2019s future assets, rather than its current assets, that will bear the most severe impacts, given that its assets are gradually renewed when they reach the end of their useful life.\n- Regulatory coverage in the Networks business.\n- Insurance coverage.\n- Diversification (geographic, by technology, age, etc.) of assets.\n- Strong business model, with financial capacity.\n- Partnering with other industry players and in the processes of acquiring knowledge from climate science, as a key action to move forward in a cost-efficient manner in developing the resilience of our activities.\n- Innovation remains a strategic variable for the group.\n- The consideration of climate change in decision-making on new investments.\n\nClimate change and new investments\n\nUnder the philosophy of continuous improvement, and in line with the Board of Directors\u2019 commitment to facing the risks of climate change, the Group\u2019s Investment Policy establishes the need to conduct a specific analysis of these risks in the construction dossiers, on which investment decisions on new assets (\u201cFID\u201d, in international terminology) are based.\n\nGiven that the networks businesses are built around multi-annual reviews and that future investments in thermal power plants will be quite small, it has been considered appropriate to focus the analysis on new onshore wind and photovoltaic facilities. Based on the experience gained, the model will be expanded in the future to include offshore wind farms.\n\nThe model, promoted by several corporate divisions with the help of Renewables, has been constructed on the basis of a survey. This document must be completed by the Business (from a technical perspective), taking into account the particularities of each site, as well as climate projections from various sources, with different levels of granularity and time frames, which are made available to the Business specifically for each project.\n\nBased on the survey, appropriate conclusions are drawn and included in the Investment Dossier. The analyses conducted in 2022 within the EU Taxonomy framework will serve to improve the survey.\n\nHowever, as part of Iberdrola\u2019s philosophy of constant improvement and taking into account the evolution of the science (new projections, more powerful tools, etc.), the markets and applicable law, as well as demands from society, the company must continue advancing and analysing the potential risks, both physical (associated with specific facilities) as well as transitional, and continue to strengthen the inclusion of the climate change variable within the various process of the Company and project phases.\nIndicators and metrics\n\nIberdrola includes major indicators in this document to report on aspects relating to climate and to the strategy of the fight against climate change, which are key for the constant monitoring of the strategy's resilience in view of the scenarios analysed. In particular, these indicators include the greenhouse gas emissions inventory, the intensity of emissions, reduction targets, the use of energy, energy intensity, the energy mix, renewable installed capacity, water use, source of water, R&D and Capex in the development of low-emission products, services and/or technology.\n\nIberdrola believes that consistent and improved disclosure of the financial risks relating to climate change will allow for the establishment of a constructive and well-informed dialogue between investors and companies regarding the opportunities and risks relating to their activities.\n\nIn addition, for information on the company's actions to mitigate and adapt to the consequences of climate change, see the \u201cManagement of climate opportunities and risks section\u201d of this chapter as well as the specific Leading the fight against climate change section of the website.\n\nOther aspects associated with the energy transition\n\nDemand-side management\n\n\u25a0 GRI 201-2\n\nAs part of its demand-side management programmes, Iberdrola's main objective is to improve energy efficiency and the smart use of active electrical grids to thus contribute to the more efficient use thereof by consumers and thereby reduce CO\u2082 emissions and contribute to the fight against climate change.\n\nThe types of actions taken include those relating to information, training and the provision of solutions and technologies that help consumers improve energy efficiency and reduce the environmental impact of their energy habits and consumption. Iberdrola engages in demand-side management in all of its geographic areas and for its various types of customers.\n\nThe main activities performed are broken down separately due to the unique nature and law of each country or market.\n\nIberdrola offers home energy management services through internet-connected devices that allow customers to better manage their electricity consumption and thus obtain energy savings (range of Smart Home products). The industrial and commercial sectors also have initiatives to diagnose and propose measures for energy savings and to improve energy efficiency, like photovoltaic solar energy installation, electromobility, efficient lighting, efficient air conditioning, optimisation of heating and cooling processes, etc.\nSASB IF-EU-420a.2\n\nThe percentage of the electricity served through the group\u2019s smart grids is close to 100 % in Spain, above 55 % in the United States and 48 % in the United Kingdom.\n\nAvailability and reliability\n\nThe companies of the Iberdrola group have no direct responsibility for long-term production capacity planning processes, or on the respective electricity systems connecting that capacity, in the countries in which they operate.\n\nGovernment authorities conduct studies to anticipate the long-term needs of the respective electricity system, and Iberdrola\u2019s companies act as market agents, making investment decisions consistent with their business plans.\n\nFuel\n\nA key element in managing the availability of electricity service is the supply of the necessary fuel. Iberdrola is supplied through short- and medium-term gas contracts and purchases on wholesale markets, adjusting to the needs of each territory. It also ensures that it has a stable, long-term and low-risk supply of nuclear fuel.\n\nNuclear plant decommissioning\n\nIberdrola is the only 100%-owner of a nuclear plant in Spain (Cofrentes). It also has interests in Almaraz I and II (52.69%), Trillo (49%), Vandell\u00f3s II (28%) and Asc\u00f3 II (15%), as indicated in the \u201cScope of information section\u201d.\n\nAccording to Law 25/1964 on nuclear energy, the management of radioactive waste, including spent nuclear fuel, and the decommissioning and closing of nuclear plants, is an essential public service reserved to the State, pursuant to Article 128.2 of the Spanish Constitution. This law entrusts Empresa Nacional de Residuos Radiactivos S.A. (Enresa) with the management of this public service. Therefore, in accordance with the sixth General Radioactive Waste Plan (Plan General de Residuos Radiactivos) (PGRR) currently in effect, the State assumes ownership of the radioactive waste and is responsible for the monitoring that may be required after the closure of a nuclear plant, once the period established in the relevant closure declaration has passed.\n\nEnresa prepares the PGRR, which, together with the corresponding economic/financial study, is the basic reference document setting forth the strategies to be followed and activities to be carried out in Spain in the fields of radioactive waste management and plant decommissioning. The PGRR is sent to the Ministry of Ecological Transition in Demographic Challenge every four years, or whenever so required by the Ministry, for approval by the Council of Ministers after a report of the Nuclear Safety Council, after hearing from the Autonomous Communities with respect to territorial and environmental ordinances. The first PGRR was adopted in 1987, and the sixth, approved in June 2006, is currently in force.\n\nThe financing system in Spain for PGRR activities is based on contributions from waste-generating entities and is known as the \u201cFund for the Financing of the General Radioactive Waste Plan Activities\u201d. The fund is managed by Enresa and includes provisions for the decommissioning of nuclear power plants.\n\n---\n\n8 In the case of Brazil as at the closing date, information was not available on the same basis to report this indicator according to the established criterion\nIberdrola makes contributions to the fund through a fee calculated by Enresa and approved by the government, which covers all expenses relating to managing the spent fuel and the radioactive waste generated at its plants, as well as those corresponding to the decommissioning and closure thereof, as provided in the PGRR.\n\nIberdrola also records a reserve on its balance sheet to cover the pre-decommissioning stage of its nuclear power plants. Pre-decommissioning refers to the period from the final cessation of operations of the plant until the decommissioning approval, at which time ownership of the plant is transferred to Enresa. The current sixth PGRR establishes a period of 3 years for this stage.\n\nIn March 2019, Iberdrola signed a protocol agreement for the closure of the nuclear plants between 2025 and 2035. This protocol includes the schedule for a gradual, orderly closure of the reactors making up the nuclear installations in Spain.\nI.4. Our ESG+F proposal\n\n- ESG+F Goals: The sustainability roadmap\n- Iberdrola\u2019s contribution to the SDGs\n- Our main focus: SDGs 7 and 13\nESG + F Goals: The sustainability roadmap\n\nThe group\u2019s Strategic Plan 2023-2025 integrates ESG issues within strategy and operations, thus constituting a key reference point for long-term planning.\n\nThese issues are based on three key factors: the corporate purpose that structures the company\u2019s positioning, stakeholders\u2019 expectations, and finally the demands of the capital markets, represented by the ESG indices and ratings, voting policies, and institutional investor alliances. These factors are included in the materiality analysis reflected on the preceding page.\n\nIberdrola\u2019s commitment to sustainable development, the social dividend, and the generation of value shared with all stakeholders is reflected in multiple indicators that make it possible to measure the positive impact generated by the group; such as, for example, a contribution to GDP of more than \u20ac33,000 million per year and the creation of more than 400,000 jobs globally.\n\nIn addition, Iberdrola\u2019s capacity to create value is reflected in the way in which the group conducts its operations, seeking the maximisation of positive impacts and the avoidance and mitigation of negative ones.\n\nIberdrola\u2019s commitment to the creation of value materialised in 2020 with the launch of its Sustainable Development Plan 2020-2022, \u201cEnergy to Advance\u201d, a roadmap with goals defined around the group\u2019s environmental, social and governance priorities. The current market context, with ever increasing investor scrutiny of the company\u2019s ESG and ever more demanding regulations, requires reviewing these goals, aligning them with best market practices, and ensuring that they are sufficiently ambitious to anticipate the various Stakeholders\u2019 demands and to ensure that Iberdrola maintains its current shared leadership position.\n\nThe company updated this roadmap in November 2022, publishing an ambitious set of goals that have a positive impact on all its stakeholders. Iberdrola thus reasserts its determination to be an active player in the creation of a more sustainable and inclusive energy model for future generations, maintaining its recognition as the leading utility in ESG.\n\nIn environmental terms, the goal is to continue to contribute to the creation of an energy system in harmony with nature and human beings, facing the threefold environmental challenge of the fight against climate change, the preservation of biodiversity, and the circularity of resources.\n\nIn social terms, the company continues to focus on maximising its positive impact through the generation of quality jobs, focusing on diversity, safety, health and education; on improving the products and services offered to our customers; on creating a responsible value chain; and on developing the communities in which we do business.\n\nIn terms of governance, the goal is to maintain robust corporate governance and compliance standards, continually revised and evaluated to ensure their adaptation to the context, regulations and best market practices.\n\nESG issues are thus integrated throughout the company\u2019s operations, as well as within the company\u2019s financial strategy and objectives. Iberdrola has provided the market with a recurring flow of green and sustainable financial instruments for years, and it intends to continue to issue the majority of its financing under green or sustainable standards.\n\nAll this has given rise to 39 global goals included in the following table.\n## Statement of Non-Financial Information\n\n### Sustainability Report 2022\n\nI.

Thus, it promotes initiatives that contribute to bringing about a more just, equal and healthy society, and, in particular, to achieving the SDGs, notably those relating to Affordable and clean energy (SDG 7) and Climate action (SDG 13), through specific lines of action focused on universal access (SDG 7.1), increasing renewable energy (SDG 7.2) and developing measures to improve energy efficiency (SDG 7.3) using tools such as fostering innovation (SDG 9), education (SDG 4), protection of biodiversity (SDG 15), gender equality (ODS 5) in particular, and reduced inequalities (SDG 10) in general, which essentially entails protecting disadvantaged groups. Iberdrola defends the role played by the SDGs and Agenda 2030 as a global social compact, because global problems such as climate change and the pandemic call for global solutions and agreements.\n\nIberdrola has linked its business and sustainability strategy to the Sustainable Development Goals (ODS) since they were set in 2015, and in 2018 it approved an update of its Corporate Governance System, which was mainly intended to formalise the Iberdrola group\u2019s commitment to the SDGs, underscoring the group\u2019s contribution to achieving them with the social dividend generated through its business activity.\n\nIn December 2020 Iberdrola reformulated its Governance and Sustainability System structuring it around ESG standards aligned with its sustainable development strategy and its social dividend, which cemented the company\u2019s position at the forefront of best international corporate governance practices.\n\nThe SDGs thus inspired or are included as a fundamental element in the following areas:\n\n- **By-Laws**\n- **Purpose and Values of the Iberdrola group** and **Code of Ethics**\n- **Environmental policies.**\n- **Social commitment policies.**\n- **Policies and rules relating to Corporate Governance.**\n\nUltimately, this is an attempt to see that all Stakeholders participate in the social dividend generated by the company\u2019s activities, or shared value, which is the sum of all the economic, social and environmental impacts that a company generates through its activity, within the environment in which it does business.\n\nThe General Sustainable Development Policy introduces the principles governing the various corporate policies relating to sustainable development. Section I.3 \"Policies and commitments\" describes the content and focus of these policies.\n\nThe company\u2019s commitment to contribute to the SDGs is supervised by its governance bodies. Thus, the Sustainable Development Committee of the Board (the composition and duties of which are described in the \u201cCorporate Governance\u201d section of chapter IV.2), is vested with the power to, among other things, \u201cMonitor the group\u2019s contribution to the achievement of the SDGs\u201d.\n\n\nOur main focus: SDGs 7 and 13\n\nIberdrola focuses its efforts on the SDGs where its contribution is most significant: the supply of affordable and non-polluting energy (Goal 7) and climate action (Goal 13). This commitment forms part of its governance model and of the sustainable management of the company, and is formalised in objectives tied to the remuneration of the management team: the shareholders at the 2017 General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting approved a long-term incentive plan linked to their contribution to the achievement of these two goals. At the 2020 General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting, the Board of Directors approved a new long-term remuneration plan (Strategic Bonus 2020-2022) linked to both economic/financial performance (changes in Net Profit, Financial Strength and Total Shareholder Return) and the contribution to the UN 2030 Agenda and the SDGs. In relation to the latter point, these objectives refer to the fight against climate change, the drive for sustainability in the supply chain and the commitment to equal pay for men and women, which contribute to SDGs 3, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14 and 15.\n\nThe table below summarises how the company contributes to achieving these goals and their associated targets.\n\n| Our main focus: SDGs 7 and 13 |\n|--------------------------------|\n| **Electricity for All programme:** 11 million beneficiaries were reached at the end of 2022.

Environmental\nIberdrola has always had a firm commitment to the environment, focusing its activities on the construction of an energy model in harmony with nature and with human beings, in which the reduction of emissions, the conservation, protection and promotion of biodiversity, and the sustainable and efficient use of resources are integrated into all its activities and processes.\n\nAt the operational level, the decarbonisation of the company\u2019s activities is associated with the start-up and operation of emissions-free power generation facilities as well as supplementary initiatives like the replacement of equipment using ozone layer-reducing substances, the operation of almost 980,000 m2 of offices and work centres in accordance with the highest sustainability and efficiency standards, and the gradual replacement of the group\u2019s fleet, which currently has more than 13,500 industrial vehicles, by an emissions-free fleet. Along these lines, Iberdrola was the first Spanish company to join the EV100 initiative, intended to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles, as Iberdrola has made a commitment to electrify its entire vehicle fleet and to facilitate recharging by its employees in Spain and the United Kingdom by 2030.\n\nThe reduction of indirect emissions is also implemented through Iberdrola\u2019s commitment to the supply of green energy, products and services to its customers and the gradual decarbonisation of its supply chain. To this end, in 2022 it joined the SteelZero initiative of The Climate Group, which brings together organisations committed to speeding up the transition to a Net Zero steel industry.\n\nClimate action is supported by a strong commitment to the protection of nature, jointly tackling the threefold environmental crisis (climate, biodiversity and overexploitation of resources).\n\nEfficient use of natural resources to approach the energy transition is another great challenge faced by Iberdrola and the energy sector as a whole. In particular, Iberdrola pays special attention to water resources, due to their environmental and social implications, and makes efforts to make rational and sustainable use of water and face the risks associated with its scarcity.\n\nThe company also works with its supply chain and other players in its value chain on the development of circular production systems that decrease the pressure on the available resources. For example, in 2022 Iberdrola and FCC launched EnergyLOOP to lead the recycling of wind turbine blades on an industrial scale, one of the greatest medium- and long-term challenges in the sector.\n\nLoss of biodiversity is critical for Iberdrola, as the company interacts with different ecosystems and species within a broad geographic scope. Aware of the urgent need to stop and reverse the unprecedented loss of biodiversity, and in response to demands of the scientific community, Iberdrola has launched the 2030 Biodiversity Plan, which applies to the entire Iberdrola group and sets out its commitment to have a net positive impact on biodiversity by 2030. The plan covers the impact of the group\u2019s activities on ecosystems and species throughout the life cycle, taking into account the supply chain and creating economic and social value through ecosystemic services.\n\nInnovation is the lever that enables Iberdrola to approach all these challenges and launch the relevant action plans to benefit from opportunities as they arise. Innovation will make it possible to find solutions to currently unsolvable problems, as well as find more efficient ways to carry out the activities currently performed.\n\nConsidering these priorities, the company has set the following environmental goals:\n## II.

Fight against climate change and protection of biodiversity\n\n- Iberdrola with nature\n- Environmental governance and management\n- Reduction of emissions\n- Sustainable use of resources and the circular economy\n- Protection of and action for biodiversity\nIberdrola with nature\n\nAn energy model in harmony with nature and human beings\n\nThe preservation of the planet and the well-being of people are priorities that Iberdrola includes in its business strategy and business model. Nature is the foundation of our economy, and our well-being and progress would be compromised without a robust, healthy and functional environment. This is why decades ago Iberdrola made a firm commitment to the environment, focusing its activities on building an energy model in harmony with nature and with human beings and that would be competitive, resilient, based on local sources, and a source of sustainable development. In short, a model that allows value to be created without putting the future of new generations at risk.\n\nThe group is committed to developing a sustainable energy model where the reduction of emissions, the conservation, protection and promotion of biodiversity, and the sustainable and efficient use of resources are integrated into all its activities and processes. This is a model in which Iberdrola is a leader and is based on using renewable energies, smart grids, efficient energy storage and driving the electrification of demand as an energetic vector for competitive and efficient decarbonisation.\n\nTo ensure that the group\u2019s activities are carried out in harmony with nature, Iberdrola works on three fronts that, together, address its main potential impacts:\n\n- **Climate action plan**: establishes the strategy, work plans and goals for reducing emissions and combating climate change.\n- **Circular economy plan**: aims to achieve the sustainable use of resources by increasing the life of its assets and reducing the use of raw materials and the generation of waste.\n- **Biodiversity plan**: sets out the strategy, programmes, targets and mechanisms to include the conservation of biodiversity in the decision-making process, increase actions regarding conservation and restoration, and support the transformation to halt and reverse the loss of biodiversity.\n\nThe companies of the group regularly review and update the action plans associated with each line of work.\nEnvironmental governance and management\n\nIberdrola\u2019s commitment to the environment and sustainable development is embodied in its Governance and Sustainability System which meets ESG criteria and is intended to ensure that the Company\u2019s Purpose and Values are achieved and that its business goals and objectives are reached.\n\nEnvironmental policies\n\nThe environmental policies formally define and establish the Company\u2019s decisive response to the challenges, objectives and goals posed by climate change, preservation of the environment and the loss of biodiversity, while helping to identify and take advantage of the opportunities arising from the energy transition. They are therefore the expression of Iberdrola\u2019s commitment, shared by all its stakeholders, to create an integral business value that takes into account and respects the natural and environmental capital on which its activities are based.\n\nThese environmental policies, which are in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, are as follows:\n\nSustainable Management Policy\n\nIberdrola implements and promotes a sustainable energy model, with its actions aimed at contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Its activities are therefore designed so that they are environmentally sustainable, competitive, with high quality of service, that generate shared value, that respect human rights, and that promote the use of energy. The instruments used to reduce the environmental impact associated with its operations include an ambitious climate action, focusing on the conservation and protection of biodiversity, improving the circularity of its activities and its suppliers, promoting the rational and sustainable use of water, and avoiding or mitigating polluting emissions and their effects on human health.\n\n\u25a0 GRI 3-3\n\nEnvironmental Policy\n\nIberdrola\u2019s Environmental Policy sets out the principles for developing a sustainable model that respects nature, biodiversity and historical heritage and that promotes the conservation, protection and promotion of the development and growth of natural heritage through innovation and Stakeholder engagement. It therefore implements a common environmental management model for the group, which applies the precautionary principle and the principle of continuous improvement, places the environment at the centre of the decision-making process, and is in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nThe policy also defines three high-priority lines of action, namely: the circular economy, natural capital and biodiversity protection. All of these pillars are essential to achieving fully sustainable activity in harmony with nature.\n\nBiodiversity Policy\n\nThe Biodiversity Policy establishes the principles of conduct for implementing a business model in harmony with nature so that its activities protect and promote the development and growth of natural assets. In this policy, Iberdrola makes a formal commitment to ending and reversing the loss of biodiversity, and to generating a net positive impact on biodiversity in the context of its operations and activities. This Biodiversity Policy establishes four lines of action for these purposes: protect biodiversity and ensure the sustainable use of natural capital; identify, quantify and continuously assess the impacts and dependencies of the group\u2019s activities; work with Stakeholders; and enhance, raise awareness and communicate internally and externally with transparency.\nClimate Action Policy\n\nThis policy establishes the framework for Iberdrola\u2019s strategy and business model, which is in line with the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda, in the fight against climate change. Through this policy Iberdrola is committed to continue assuming a leadership position (directly and by establishing alliances), promoting awareness (impacts, challenges and benefits of its achievement) and contributing to a carbon neutral and sustainable future.\n\nFor more detailed information, see section \"I.3. Climate action and TFCD\".\n\nEnvironmental Management System\n\nThe commitments made in the various environmental policies mentioned above are embodied in the Iberdrola group\u2019s Environmental Management System. This system enables the alignment of the environmental dimension within the group\u2019s sustainability model, integrating the SDGs and coordinating the mechanisms for measuring and assessing the group\u2019s environmental performance in terms of the life cycle, including the concepts of circular economy and natural capital in the group\u2019s management.\n\nThe group\u2019s Environmental Management System establishes a common, homogeneous, integrated and environmental framework that is a benchmark for all of the organisations and facilitates the development of an ongoing diagnosis of the company\u2019s environmental behaviour at each of its management levels.\n\n---\n\n(1) Avangrid, Inc. is 81.5% owned by Iberdrola, S.A.\n(2) Neoenergia, S.A. is owned indirectly by Iberdrola, S.A. with 50% +1 share.\nCorporate Environmental Footprint\n\nTo gauge the group\u2019s environmental performance, Iberdrola calculates its Corporate Environmental Footprint (CEF), which is a multi-criteria measure of environmental performance from a life cycle perspective (ISO/TS 14072:2014 standard).\n\nThe Corporate Environmental Footprint is part of the company\u2019s environmental management model, the ultimate goal of which is to bring the environmental aspect into line with the company\u2019s sustainability model, integrating the universality of service, safety, competitiveness, energy efficiency and the reduction of the company\u2019s environmental impact, all from a life cycle perspective.\n\nThe calculation of the Corporate Environmental Footprint at Iberdrola has meant that the Group has been able to:\n\n- Demonstrate transparency and consistency in environmental management.\n- Improve the identification of opportunities to reduce its environmental impact.\n- Drive innovation and business capabilities that seek continuous improvement in environmental management.\n- Obtain recognition by third parties of Iberdrola\u2019s position and achievements, including the fight against climate change, the destruction of the ozone layer, and the depletion of natural resources.\n\nConsistent with this line of work, Iberdrola took part in the European Rules Electricity Environmental Footprint (REEF) project, which developed the Environmental Footprint (EF) product rules for the electricity sector, and will make it possible to have common rules for calculating the industry\u2019s EF.\n\nFor more information, see Iberdrola\u2019s Environmental Footprint.\n\nCertifications\n\nIberdrola\u2019s environmental management system is rooted in international procedures and standards that are audited by prestigious independent agencies. The company currently holds the following environmental certifications:\n\n- **ISO 14001-2015** This standard covers activities consisting of the product generation, transmission, distribution and marketing, office management and general services. In particular, more than 80% of its energy was generated at certified facilities in 2022.\n- **Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS).** The group\u2019s thermal power generation plants hold certificates under this standard.\n- **ISO 14064-2018.** Iberdrola verifies its greenhouse gas emissions under this standard.\n- **ISO TS 14072-2014** under which Iberdrola verifies its Corporate Environmental Footprint. It is the only company in the industry to have obtained this certificate.\n- **ISO 20121. Sustainable Event Management.** Under this standard, Iberdrola certifies the most important events for shareholders and investors, i.e. the General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting, presentations of results and Investor Day.\n\nMore information is available online, in the Certifications and Verifications section of the website.\n\nReserves and insurance coverage for environmental risks\n\nIberdrola also has insurance policies that cover environmental risks. The main types of corporate insurance policies that the company has obtained with environmental coverage are:\n\n- Environmental Liability Insurance.\n- Civil Liability Coverage for Sudden Accidental Pollution in the general civil liability policy.\nReduction of emissions\n\nIberdrola is a global leader in the energy transition and the fight against climate change within the energy sector. Its ambitious decarbonisation targets place it among the most advanced companies in this regard.\n\nFor more information about the Company\u2019s management with respect to climate change, see chapter \"I.3. Climate action\".\n\nIntensity of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions\n\n- **GRI 305**  \n- **SASB IF-EU-110a.1**  \n- **IF-EU-110a.3**\n\nThe intensity of CO\u2082 emissions is calculated based on direct emissions from the production facilities\\(^9\\) divided by the group's net output, including steam.\n\nThe following table shows the intensity of emissions.\n\n- **GRI 305-4**\n\n| CO\u2082 equivalent emissions to be verified in 2023 (t) | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Specific emissions from global mix (Kg CO\u2082/MWh)   | 88   | 96   | 98   |\n| Specific emissions from global mix (Kg CO\u2082/t)\\(^10\\) | 0.210| 0.316| 0.376|\n\nIn 2022, CO\u2082 emissions per MWh generated remained among the lowest among domestic and international energy companies, and continue to follow the downward path set out in our climate action plan.\n\nInventory of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions\n\nThe inventory (with data available as of the date of approval of this report) is given below.\n\n| CO\u2082 equivalent emissions to be verified in 2023 (t) | Spain | United Kingdom | United States | Brazil | M\u00e9xico\\(^11\\) | IEI | Total |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------|----------------|---------------|--------|--------------|-----|-------|\n| Scope 1: Direct emissions                         | 4,215,912 | 39,373         | 1,375,464     | 105,872| 6,139,830    | 50,668| 11,927,119|\n| Scope 2: Indirect emissions                       | 960,030  | 427,292        | 225,440       | 239,689| 15,588       | 11,343| 1,879,381 |\n| Scope 3: Other indirect emissions                 | 4,171,351 | 8,696,626      | 10,546,585    | 1,382,395| 16,277,529  | 939,491| 42,013,976|\n\n\\(^9\\) See \u201cDirect greenhouse gas emissions.

The latter parameter reflects the particular operating conditions of some of our plants in Mexico, which Iberdrola operates as an Independent Power Producer (IPP) under the auspices of the Mexican Federal Electricity Commission (Comisi\u00f3n Federal de la Electricidad) (CFE). Under these conditions, Iberdrola believes that the IPP plants do not comply with the requirement set out in the GHG Protocol regarding \u201cfull authority to introduce and implement operating policies at the operation\u201d in order to be included in Scope 1.\nNeoenergia\u2019s Termopernambuco plant, Termope, did not enter into operation in 2022. This resulted in a dramatic drop in direct emissions in Brazil (-89%), which significantly contributed to a drop of more than 10% in the group\u2019s scope 1 emissions.\n\nIberdrola\u2019s inventory of emissions is verified by AENOR in accordance with UNE ISO 14064-1:2018 for the direct and indirect emissions from all of its activities.\n\nThe verified information is available in the Greenhouse Gas Inventory (Carbon Footprint) section of the corporate website.\n\n**Direct greenhouse gas emissions. Scope 1 (per GHG Protocol)**\n\nDirect emissions are emissions from GHG sources owned or controlled by the company. They include:\n\n- Emissions that result from the consumption of fuel and that are produced by owned facilities that generate electrical power.\n- Emissions of methane (CH\u2084) and nitrous oxide (N\u2082O) associated with fuel consumption.\n- Emissions from non-generation (gas storage) facilities.\n- Fugitive emissions of methane (CH\u2084) (storage and transport of natural gas).\n- Fugitive emissions of sulphur hexafluoride (SF\u2086) (distribution networks, substations, generation plants, etc.).\n- Fugitive emissions of coolant gases.\n- Emissions from facilities that provide services to buildings (fuel consumption).\n- Emissions from mobile combustion sources associated with road transport of employees with fleet vehicles for work purposes.\n\nThe emission factors used to calculate each of these emissions are obtained from official sources.\n\nThe following two tables show the changes in Scope 1 emissions from production facilities and other facilities (offices, vehicle fleets, etc.).\n\n| GRI 305-1 | SASB IF-EU-110a.1 |\n|-----------|-------------------|\n\n**CO\u2082 emissions at Scope 1 production facilities (t CO\u2082 eq)**\n\n|                      | 2022     | 2021     | 2020     |\n|----------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Thermal generating plants | 8,421,306 | 9,175,358 | 9,220,435 |\n| Cogeneration         | 2,839,174 | 3,515,703 | 3,250,773 |\n| Other emissions      | 85,876   | 63,101   | 47,656   |\n| **Total**            | **11,346,356** | **12,754,162** | **12,518,864** |\n\nStationary combustion emissions, from generation, account for more than 99% of total Scope 1 emissions.\nSASB IF-EU-110a.1\n\n- Gross global Scope 1 emissions are: 11,927,119 tCO\u2082 eq.\n- Percentage covered under emissions-limiting regulations: 95% (Only Europe is subject to emissions-limiting regulations).\n- Percentage of gross global Scope 1 GHG emissions covered under emissions-reporting regulations: 100%.\n- Iberdrola reports 100% of its emissions as it is regulated in all countries where it operates.\n\nOther Scope 1 emissions (t CO\u2082 eq)\n\n| Source of emission factors | 2022 |\n|-----------------------------|------|\n| CH\u2084 and N\u2082O emissions from combustion (Non-renewable generating plants)\u00b9\u00b2 | 46,143 |\n| CH\u2084 Fugitive Emissions (Gas storage and transport) | 237,645 |\n| SF\u2086 Fugitive Emissions (Electricity distribution) | 76,726 |\n| Emissions in buildings (Fuel consumption) | 72,777 |\n| Emissions from mobile combustion (Fleet vehicles) | 104,628 |\n| Other emissions (Gas storage, coolant gases) | 42,844 |\n| Total | 580,763 |\n\nFor more information, see the climate action section of the corporate website.\n\nIndirect greenhouse gas emissions. Scope 2 (per GHG Protocol)\n\nIndirect emissions are those emissions deriving from the company\u2019s activity but generated by other entities, including emissions from the generation of electricity acquired for the company\u2019s consumption. These emissions are:\n\n- Emissions associated with the consumption of electrical power during shutdowns of the thermal, renewable and nuclear plants, and during pumping at the hydroelectric plants.\n- Emissions associated with electricity consumption in the group\u2019s buildings.\n- Emissions associated with network losses during the distribution and transmission of electricity to third parties.\n\nCO\u2082 is calculated by applying the emission factor of the generation mix of the respective country:\n\n- Spain: Red El\u00e9ctrica de Espa\u00f1a\n- United Kingdom: DEFRA\n- United States: U.S. Energy Information Administration\n- M\u00e9xico: SEMARNAT \u00b9\u2075\n- Brazil: Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation for Brazil\n\n\u00b9\u00b2 Only emissions associated with owned generation are included.\n\u00b9\u00b3 IPCC: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\u00b9\u2074 MITECO: Ministerio de Transici\u00f3n Ecol\u00f3gica / EPA: Environmental Protection Agency (United States).\n\u00b9\u2075 SEMARNAT: Secretary for the Environment and Natural Resources in Mexico.\nIberdrola continues to reduce its indirect emissions, in particular energy emissions in buildings, due to its increased use of green energy. 100% of the electrical power consumed by offices in the United Kingdom and Spain was renewable in 2022.\n\n**GRI 305-2  \u25a0  SASB IF-EU-110a.2**\n\n| Scope 2 emissions (t CO2 eq) | 2022       | 2021       | 2020       |\n|-----------------------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Emissions associated with network losses | 1,142,181  | 1,830,631  | 1,407,845  |\n| Emissions associated with consumption of electric energy during shutdowns and pumping | 713,674    | 310,100    | 451,671    |\n| Emissions associated with the electricity consumption in buildings | 23,526     | 21,253     | 23,138     |\n| **Total**                  | **1,879,381** | **2,161,984** | **1,882,654** |\n\n**Other indirect greenhouse gas emissions.

New elements are thus included each year in the calculation of its Scope 3, indirect emissions that result from the company\u2019s activities at sources not owned or controlled by it. They include the following:\n\n- Emissions (due to fuel consumption) from electrical power generation facilities used in production for third parties. (GHG Protocol Category 3).\n  - Emissions associated with the transport of employees for work purposes (hired and private vehicles, aircraft and trains). (GHG Protocol Category 7).\n  - Emissions associated with the supply chain.

Therefore, in 2019 Iberdrola defined its circular economy model, which includes the entire value chain from suppliers to customers, along with its operations.\n\nBased on this circular economy model, in 2022 Iberdrola approved Circular Economy Plan 2030, which specifies various goals in line with its sustainable energy model.\n\nFour levers will be available to achieve these goals: the four Rs (redesign, reduce, reuse, and recycle).

IF-EU-140a.3.**\n\nWater is a basic and irreplaceable natural resource in many of Iberdrola\u2019s activities. The company's awareness of this dependency and of the risks arising from water shortages has led it to set a goal of ensuring its increasingly responsible use of this resource.\n\nThe group\u2019s main actions for a more sustainable use of water are:\n\n- Continually improving processes at facilities to reduce consumption and impact.\n- Implementing and controlling ecological flows as required by government authorities at hydroelectric generation reservoirs.\n- Conducting awareness-raising campaigns to achieve a more efficient and responsible use of sanitary water by employees at offices.\n\n- **GRI 303-1 303-2**\n\nThe water cycle needed to generate power at Iberdrola's thermal generation plants is based on the following three phases:\n\n- **Withdrawal**: performed within regulatory limits.\n- **Use**: Use in cooling and auxiliary services of plants.\n- **Return to the environment**: the quality of effluent discharged into the environment is always within the required limits and even improving on them compared to the values of water withdrawn.\n\nEnsuring compliance with the law and seeking methods to minimise the risk of spills applies to all of Iberdrola\u2019s facilities, including generating plants, renewables facilities and distribution substations.\n\nTo avoid the risk of polluting discharges, with a possible negative impact, Iberdrola has:\n\n- Consolidated Environmental Management Systems: ISO 14001 and EMAS certificates, in which possible anomalies and incidents are managed, establishing plans to minimise spillage risks, by implementing predictive, preventive and corrective actions that ensure the proper condition of the water.\n\nWater consumption and discharges by the facilities in 2022 were within the limits indicated by the relevant comprehensive environmental permit for each facility, and no anomalies were detected that might materially affect the water resources or associated habitats.\n\n- **GRI 303-3 303-4**  - **SASB IF-EU-140a.1.**\n\nThe following table gives total water consumption, considered to be the difference between total water withdrawn and water discharged, with a breakdown of total water withdrawal by the group by source and water stress area. The areas are classified according to the *Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas*.\n\n---\n\n22 Iberdrola has changed its methodology to calculate water consumption, including two aspects that had not been considered until now: contribution of rainwater and contribution of water to customer processes. The failure to consider these two aspects was affecting the figures for the Almaraz nuclear plant, reducing its reported water consumption, and cogeneration, increasing water consumption.

consumption\n\n**GRI 302**\n\nThe Iberdrola group optimises the use of energy throughout its entire value chain (production, transmission, distribution, marketing and end use), contemplating energy efficiency from a three-fold perspective:\n\n- As an electricity generator and distributor, it seeks to improve efficiency by introducing the most advanced technologies, equipment and digitalisation.\n- As an energy consumer, Iberdrola promotes the ongoing improvement of energy efficiency across all its activities (offices and buildings, mobility, etc.).\n- As a supplier of energy solutions, the company informs, promotes and supplies comprehensive efficiency solutions aligned with the emission reduction strategy, thereby contributing to more efficient energy use by consumers, while encouraging the reduction of the environmental impact of their energy consumption habits.\n\nEnergy consumption within the organisation\n\n**GRI 302-1**\n\nEnergy consumption within the organisation (internal consumption) includes energy consumption at all Iberdrola group facilities, buildings and offices, and is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Energy consumption within the organisation (GJ) = Fuel consumption + Energy purchased} \\\\\n\\text{Energy sold (non-renewable) - Steam sold}\n\\]\n\nThe fuel consumption figure in terms of energy (GJ), obtained by directly measuring the fuel used at each facility based on its lower heating value (LHV):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Consumption(GJ) = Consumption of fuel (kg) x PCI (MJ/kg) /1000}\n\\]\n\nThe value of energy purchased or sold is obtained by direct measurement at the facilities, buildings and offices.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Consumption(GJ) = \\sum building / facility consumption (MWh) x 3.6 GJ/MWh}\n\\]\nEnergy consumption

the unprecedented decline in biological diversity, which the scientific community universally considers to be a direct result of the impact of human activities, entail grave environmental, economic and social risks. This requires urgent action to revert the loss of biodiversity.\n\nGiven the location of our infrastructure and their interaction with the territory, Iberdrola has believed for more than fifteen years that biodiversity is a material issue for its Business Model, and for this reason places respect for biodiversity and ecosystems in a key place within its business strategy.\n\nSince 2007, Iberdrola has had a Biodiversity Policy which forms part of its \"I.2. Governance and Sustainability System\". In this policy, which was strengthened in 2021, Iberdrola commits to assuming a position of leadership in the fight against the loss of biodiversity and in generating a positive net impact on biodiversity from its activities.\n\nThese commitments involve integrating biodiversity into strategic planning, managing risk through continuous assessment of impacts and dependencies throughout the life cycle, applying the mitigation hierarchy (avoid, mitigate, restore and offset) in all our activities, avoiding the placement of new infrastructure in protected areas, implementing biodiversity action plans, working together with Stakeholders, and encouraging awareness and communication. It also entails promoting, along with its Stakeholders, a social culture in which biodiversity is valued, preserved, restored and sustainably used, maintaining ecosystem services, favouring a healthy planet, and providing essential benefits for all.\n\nIberdrola supports ambitious objectives in the negotiations of the new global framework of the Convention on Biological Diversity approved in Montreal in December 2022. The Biodiversity Plan 2030, approved in October 2022 after being presented to the company\u2019s corporate bodies, is aligned with the goals approved in the Global Biodiversity Framework. Of particular importance is Goal 15, relating to the reporting of impacts and biodiversity impacts covered by Iberdrola in this report and in its Biodiversity Report. Moreover, Iberdrola is already working with the Task Force of Nature related Financial Disclosure (TNFD) and WBCSD to evaluate the draft recommendations and provide feedback.\n\nIn addition to the Biodiversity Policy, Iberdrola has the following mechanisms to integrate the protection and conservation of biodiversity within management, and for it to be taken into account in decision-making processes:\n\n- Biodiversity Policy\n- Comprehensive Risk Control and Management System\n- Environmental Management System of the group\n- Tools for evaluating impacts and dependencies\n- Biodiversity Plan\n- Environment and biodiversity committees\nObjectives and Biodiversity Plan 2030\n\nAt Iberdrola, we have strengthened our commitment to nature and set ourselves the goal of having a positive net impact on biodiversity by 2030, i.e. the year by which our activities have contributed to preserving and improving biodiversity.\n\nObjective 2025: No net deforestation\n\nAs part of its actions to achieve this goal by 2030, Iberdrola also commits to ensuring that its activity does not generate net deforestation by 2025. This commitment applies both to direct actions and to actions in the group\u2019s supply chain.\n\nBiodiversity Plan 2030\n\nTo achieve this ambitious goal, Iberdrola has launched the Biodiversity Plan 2030 (the \u201cPlan\u201d), which applies to all of the Iberdrola group\u2019s facilities and activities, and which has three areas of action: measure, act and transform.\n\nThis approach is aligned with the Science-Based Targets for Nature (SBTNs) and its vision of the Framework for Action \u201cAR3T1\u201d and with the landmark pillars provided by the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD).\n\nThe Biodiversity Plan 2030 is a continuation of years of work on the protection and preservation of biodiversity, and its integration into the strategic planning and decision-making of the group. The commitments and procedures derived from this Plan are:\n\ni. conservation hierarchy;\nii. equal compensation for impacts (i.e. with the same type of habitat and species affected);\niii. application of solutions based on the preservation of nature; and\niv. supply chain involvement.\n\nAll of them, together with other measures, constitute adequate tools to guarantee the achievement of the objectives of the Plan in 2030.\n\nInteraction with biodiversity\n\nMain impacts and dependencies\n\n\u25a0 GRI 304-2\n\nIberdrola identifies impacts and dependencies stemming from the interaction of these activities on biodiversity and natural capital, in order to avoid, minimise, remedy and/or offset these impacts and dependencies. Iberdrola has been working on developing and implementing tools to identify, quantify and assess the impacts and dependencies of its activities on natural capital since 2012. The identification of these impacts and dependencies is an iterative process. Below are some of the information sources and tools used:\n\n- Corporate Environmental Footprint\n- Assessments of environmental impact at new projects\n- Impact surveillance, monitoring and re-evaluation programmes\n- Matrix of impacts and dependencies by technology developed in the Natural Capital and Energy Working Group\n- Matrix of materiality of activities with regard to drivers of biodiversity loss\n- Results of pilot natural capital assessment projects at Iberdrola\u2019s facilities.\n\nIn this regard, in 2022 Iberdrola continued work on the pilot projects to quantify the net effect of our activities on biodiversity at several of our facilities in Spain, Brazil, the United Kingdom and Mexico, using international benchmark methodologies and obtaining the initial results of the projects.\n\nIdentification of dependencies\n\nCarrying out operations and maintenance activities requires, in addition to raw materials, the services that nature provides. By identifying these dependencies, we are able to assess those services and plan actions to prevent their modification and to protect and preserve them. An analysis of the group\u2019s activities makes it possible to identify dependencies on the following ecosystem services:\n\n- Waterway maintenance service, through the hydrological cycle. The water cycle makes it possible to recover river flows, which is necessary to produce energy at hydro plants and for cooling processes at thermal plants.\n- Climate regulation service, which is obtained through nature by means of the long-term storage of carbon dioxide in soils, plant biomass and the oceans. This service is important for all generation facilities.\n- Terrain stabilisation and erosion control. Vegetation on slopes prevents avalanches and landslides. This service is important for hydroelectric plants and transmission and distribution grid facilities.\n- Protection against floods and storms, through the buffer provided by vegetation during such events. This service is important for hydroelectric plants and grid facilities.\n\nIn addition, there are also dependencies on abiotic resources, the most important of which are:\n\u2022 Water. This resource is the source of production at hydroelectric plants, and it is necessary for cooling at thermal plants.\n\u2022 Mineral and non-mineral (gas and uranium) resources as fuel in power generation at thermal plants.\n\u2022 Gas as a product served to customers and users of gas networks.\n\n**Identification of impacts**\n\nActivities and operations that may have impacts during the different phases of the life of facilities are identified in order to avoid, minimise and appropriately correct such potential impacts, as shown in the figure below:\nBased on these actions, the potential significant impacts on biodiversity arising from the group\u2019s activities, products and services are in turn identified:\n\n| Potential impacts |\n|-------------------|\n| **Construction stage** | **Operation and maintenance stage** |\n| Change in land use | Habitat and species loss |\n| Changes to the landscape | Electrocution |\n| Ecosystem fragmentation | Electrocution, trapping |\n| Habitat alteration | Variation in water quality |\n| Species displacement | Fires |\n| Increased greenhouse gases and climate change | Collisions |\n| Air, soil or water pollution | Discharges/spills into water |\n| Soil degradation |\n\n**GRI 304-1**\n\n**Facilities in protected spaces or high biodiversity-value areas**\n\nThe areas in which Iberdrola conducts its activities serve as habitats for a variety of flora and wildlife, some of which are under some form of protection. This is mainly due to the fact that the construction work was performed prior to the issuance of the declarations of protection by the public authorities. This is the case of certain hydroelectric plants in Spain. There are also facilities for which \u2013 after an analysis of the alternatives, giving priority to avoiding protected areas, and after an environmental assessment process in which the mitigation hierarchy was applied \u2013 the competent authorities authorised the project. Such authorisation is based on the consideration that while the protected areas or high biodiversity-value areas could not be avoided, the preventive and palliative measures prevented the activities from having significant impacts on the protected habitats and species.\n\nTherefore, following the impact assessment process, it was determined that the presence of such facilities in protected spaces or in high biodiversity-value areas was compatible with the protected elements, with the consequent implementation of measures to prevent, mitigate and compensate possible adverse effects.\nThe following table shows the Iberdrola facilities within or adjacent to protected spaces or in high biodiversity-value areas:\n\n| Facility                        | Surface area inside PS or HBV | Surface area inside PS | Adjacent facilities | Type of protection

to the prevention of effects on them - all the more so if they are protected.\nIberdrola has identified threatened species included on the IUCN Red List and on the national and regional lists of the areas in which it operates that potentially could be affected by our facilities. It also conducts species monitoring programmes and research projects at many of its facilities with a view to learning more about their patterns of behaviour and incorporating this knowledge into its operations (see indicators GRI 304 and GRI 304-3).\n\n### IUCN Red List Classification\n\n| Classification          | No. of species |\n|-------------------------|----------------|\n| Critically endangered (CR) | 15             |\n| Endangered (EN)         | 69             |\n| Vulnerable (VU)         | 121            |\n| Near threatened (NT)    | 116            |\n| Least concern (LC)      | 1,865          |\n\n### Action for biodiversity\n\nIn its *Biodiversity Policy*, Iberdrola establishes its priority lines for action, which are integrated in management of the operational units in action programmes and specific actions. These are:\n\n- Protecting biodiversity and making sustainable use of natural capital, adopting a conservation hierarchy, integrating into its management the best practices along the entire lifecycle and promoting actions in favour of regenerating and conserving natural heritage.\n- Continuously identifying, quantifying and evaluating the impacts and the dependencies of the Group\u2019s activities on natural capital, with a focus on biodiversity during the entire lifecycle of facilities, by promoting research and improving knowledge of the ecosystems in the environments of the territories in which it operates.\n- Partnering with Stakeholders, considering their needs and expectations regarding biodiversity in order to integrate these needs and expectations in action plans, and participating in research projects.\n- Commitment to raising awareness and reporting on the importance of biodiversity and internally and externally communicate the impact of our activities and actions for the preservation of biodiversity.\nIberdrola engages in more than 800 activities for the protection of biodiversity each year and publishes its *Biodiversity Report* which includes many of these activities, on a regular basis.\n\n**Tackling the drivers of biodiversity loss**\n\nThe analysis of the impact of the group\u2019s activities on these drivers enables Iberdrola to take the measures required to prevent or minimise them. The drivers of biodiversity loss identified by the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) that can be tackled by Iberdrola are analysed below, as are the measures taken to prevent and minimise the impact of its activities.\n\n**Changes in land use**\n\nIn a context of increased energy demand and decarbonisation, it is necessary to build new clean energy facilities, which must be environmentally friendly. This infrastructure often causes changes in land use and potential habitat loss, displacing species.\n\nThe Biodiversity Plan 2030 intensifies the company\u2019s efforts to integrate the search for opportunities to make the generation of renewable energies compatible with other uses and improve biodiversity in those territories in which it operates.\n\nThe Plan also reinforces the work done by the company to implement the mitigation hierarchy (avoid, reduce, mitigate, and compensate as a last option) in all project phases, from the design and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) processes to decommissioning after operation.\nMost impacts resulting in diversity loss can be prevented in the design phase, for which reason we support knowledge of the area as the best tool to prevent or minimise effects on the environment. To properly select a site, Iberdrola avoids locating new infrastructures in protected areas (including World Heritage sites, national protected areas, Nature 2000 Network, and the respective International Union for the Conservation of Nature (UICN) categories, as well as unprotected areas of high biodiversity value, unless there are no alternatives or the only alternatives are less compatible with the environment. If significant impacts are identified during the evaluation process, the project is modified to the extent possible, and the best available techniques and any measures identified as necessary are employed to correct and minimise these impacts. Stakeholders are involved and consulted with throughout the entire design process, which makes it possible to incorporate good construction practices, going beyond the applicable legal requirements in each case. Once this process has ended, and during construction, Iberdrola continues to work with stakeholders, seeking to ensure that the environmental impact is as low as possible, restoring the affected areas and offsetting residual impact.\n\nIberdrola works to ensure that new infrastructure projects are a shelter for biodiversity while preserving local jobs. One example is photovoltaic plants in Spain, which have gone from being agricultural land to becoming biodiversity reservoirs thanks to the measures taken.\n\nHabitat and species loss\n\n- **GRI 304-3**\n\nA proper habitat is essential for ensuring the successful survival of local species, for which reason Iberdrola implements specific programmes and actions to avoid, reduce, restore and offset effects on habitats and species at its infrastructure, as well as to monitor their interactions in order to remedy the impacts. It also promotes volunteer programmes that contribute to reversing the loss of biodiversity in ecosystems. The most noteworthy actions and programmes carried out in 2022 are listed below. More information can be found in Iberdrola\u2019s *Biodiversity Report*.\n\nHabitat conservation, restoration and compensation programmes\n\nIberdrola is committed to preserving and restoring forest ecosystems. For this reason, in 2020 it created the Trees Programme in 2020 for forest biodiversity and ecosystems in order to promote the conservation and planting of 20 million trees by 2030. Since its launch, the group has promoted the planting of 2.5 million trees.\n\nOf particular note is the work carried out in Brazil in recent years, where conservation and regeneration activities have been carried out on more than 8,975 hectares and monitoring and conservation actions on more than 18,400 hectares in Permanent Preservation Areas. Activities in 2022 include a continuation of the creation of the Biodiversity Corridor in order to establish connectivity between the forest areas of Igua\u00e7u National Park (PNI) and the Direct Influence Areas (AID) of the Lower Igua\u00e7u Hydroelectric Plant, in the environs of the reservoir. Conservation activities have been carried out on 1,135 hectares as well as planting on 50 hectares to date. The corridor will comprise more than 3,000 hectares. Work has also continued to develop the Permanent Preservation Areas of Corumb\u00e1, Telesp\u00edres and Itapebi. 25,000 trees were also voluntarily planted in partnership with Fundaci\u00f3n SOS Mata Atl\u00e2ntica, as part of the Florestas do Futuro Programme, in the municipality of Marab\u00e1 Paulista.\nIn the United Kingdom, more than 520,000 trees were planted in 2022 in the Kilgallioch, Mark Hill, Hare Hill, Black Law, Halsary and Glen App wind farms to improve habitats, provide benefits to wildlife, and to offset the construction of wind farms. Restoration work was also carried out on the land taken up by the landline cable at the East Anglia One offshore wind farm, where more than 1,600 trees were planted, 35 ha of grassland were sown, and 3,500 linear metres of hedges were recovered.\n\nIn Spain, monitoring works continued on nearly 2,000 hectares of voluntary reforestation, and an additional 57 hectares were planted in 2022 in Toledo and Ciudad Real.\n\nIn Mexico, the more than 25 hectares already planted in 2019 at the La Venta III wind farm continued to be maintained.\n\nIberdrola also promotes the restoration of other ecosystems. In 2022, work continued on the Habitats Management and Monitoring Plan with respect to the wind farms in Scotland, covering a total area of more than 10,000 hectares.\n\nIberdrola also works to ensure that new infrastructure projects are a shelter for biodiversity while preserving local jobs. This is exemplified by photovoltaic plants in Spain, as, for example, the creation of a new flora reserve to preserve orchids and other singular species at the N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa photovoltaic plant and the measures to encourage the settlement of species such as the lesser kestrel, vegetation management through sheep, and the promotion of ecosystemic services and local jobs, such as the placement of beehives at several of the photovoltaic plants during certain months of the campaign.\n\n**Fauna and flora species protection and conservation programmes**\n\nIberdrola is working to minimise the impacts of its facilities on fauna and is taking actions to foster the protection and conservation thereof. Special attention has been paid to the effects of our windfarms and grids on fauna, particularly birdlife. Numerous actions have been taken in this regard, from adapting supports \u2013 more than 123,000 in Spain since 2018 \u2013 to implementing new bird protection methodologies, such as the installation of biological distancers to dissuade *Fumaria rufus* from building nests on distribution network poles in Brazil. Work continues to be carried out to reduce the risk of wind farm impact, implementing innovative detection and stoppage measures for wind farm turbines when birds and bats fly by, such as the installation of artificial intelligence surveillance cameras and deterrents such as painted blades and the placement of eye-patterned vinyls, among others.\n\nSignificant fauna and flora protection actions were taken at the T\u00e2mega hydroelectric plant in Portugal, including the installation of 5 bat shelter boxes, reaching a total of 55 boxes in late 2022 and the restoration of 13 fish egg-laying sites. Reproduction work within the river mussel reproduction centre at the T\u00e2mega Environmental Interpretation and Awareness-Raising Centre also advanced by 26% in 2022. The cumulative total of the reproduction work is 63%.\n\nWildlife protection materials were also installed at the substation transformer and other substation equipment at onshore wind farms in the United States to minimise the risk of wildlife incidents and plant shutdowns.\n\nIn the implementation of new projects, there are numerous activities to conserve and improve the habitats of threatened or unique species. In France, birds were protected through actions to fight the depredation of sea birds by carrion crows in Cap Fr\u00e9hel at the Saint-Brieuc offshore wind farm. Measures to protect sea life, particularly sea mammals and sea turtles, are implemented at offshore wind farms in the United States. The purpose of the actions is to protect such species as *Balaenoptera borealis*, *Balaenoptera musculus*, *Balaenoptera physalus*, *Caretta caretta*, *Chelonia mydas*, *Dermochelys coriacea*, *Eretmochelys imbricata*, *Eubalaena glacialis*, *Lepidochelys kempii* y *Physeter macrocephalus*. \nWildlife tracking and monitoring programmes\n\nIberdrola carries out programmes to track threatened species or habitats that may be affected by its activities, in order to evaluate the success of its corrective measures, identify possible impacts and implement new measures to reduce such impacts where necessary. In addition to the tracking of birdlife and chiroptera at the group\u2019s wind farms, measures are underway to monitor fish and water bodies so as to protect the water environment in Spain, in addition to monitoring programmes with respect to herpetofauna, ichthyofauna and mastofauna at the hydro plants in Brazil, monitoring of feline species at the combined cycle plant in Altamira and benthic and marine mammal monitoring at offshore wind farms.\n\nVegetation management programmes\n\nIberdrola applies the best techniques to minimise effects in the form of soil loss due to erosion and acidification. These techniques include maintaining the vegetation cover at photovoltaic plants and refraining from using herbicides as well as avoiding the mass cutting of trees for street cleaning work related to fire protection lanes.\n\nProgrammes to foster knowledge and research for habitat and species conservation\n\nIberdrola is committed to supporting knowledge and research as key measures to protect and conserve biodiversity. Along these lines, the company continued in 2022 to support research such as the work carried out through the Coralizar Project on the effects of climate change on coral reefs and the Flyways Project to monitor wading and migratory birds, some of which are at risk of extinction, in northeastern and southern Brazil.\n\nIn Spain, studies on the evolution of biodiversity were carried out at several photovoltaic plants, the accounting framework for diversity was developed to monitor the group\u2019s Biodiversity Plan 2030, and work was done on the assessment of the natural capital at several facilities. The Migra Project also continued, the objective of which is to study the migratory movements of birds in Spain, with the launch of a project with the Migres foundation to analyse actions for the recovery of ospreys in Spain. Work is also under way to conserve habitats and species, such as the protection of feline species and mangroves in Mexico.\n\nIn addition, Iberdrola actively participated in the Montreal Biodiversity Summit, COP15, in the working groups of the National Commission of the Environment (CONAMA), and promoted conferences such as the one on biodiversity and offshore wind held on World Oceans Day through Scottish Power Renewables and in partnership with the UN Compact and the UICN, as well as conferences on ornithology, and has also sponsored the international conference of the International Association for Impact Assessment (IAIA21), among other activities.\n\nClimate change\n\nAll information on Climate Action can be found in chapter \"I.3. Climate action.\"\nPollution\n\nEutrophication and eco-toxicity are problems derived from pollution. Iberdrola applies the precautionary principle and its environmental guidelines include preventing water and soil pollution through spillage or dumping.\n\nTo this end, pollution prevention programmes have been implemented within all organisations of the group, through actions to improve the safety and containment measures to prevent harm. These planned actions include building tanks to collect oil in the event of a mass spillage at substations and transformation centres, the insulation of retaining troughs, and the installation of containment barriers in sensitive environments.\n\nInvasive species\n\nInvasive species are animals, plants, or other organisms that develop outside their natural area of distribution, in habitats that are not their own or in an unusual abundance, causing alterations in ecosystem richness and diversity.\n\nControl of these species is fundamental for the equilibrium of ecosystems. Iberdrola contributes to reducing these species both in the operation of its facilities (vegetation management and zebra mussel control programmes) and through dedicated volunteering actions.\nIII. Social\nIn the social dimension, Iberdrola focuses on continuous improvement of its engagement with its various Stakeholders and management of their expectations, as well as on respect for Human Rights in all its activities and those of its partners in the value chain.\n\nIberdrola works on creating and maintaining quality jobs. Its pillars in employee management are equality of opportunity, non-discrimination and talent development and management, without forgetting the concern for the health and safety of all its workers.\n\nIberdrola seeks to continuously improve the quality of the products and services offered to its customers through digitalisation and sustainability, developing solutions that take its customers\u2019 actual needs into account and provide them with increased independence.\n\nFinally, in its commitment to the generation of value for all stakeholders, Iberdrola collaborates in the development of the communities in which it has a presence through various initiatives channelled through its subsidiaries or investees and its foundations in different countries.\n\nIn its commitment to continuously improve its relations with its stakeholders and management of their expectations and needs, Iberdrola has set the following goals as part of its sustainability roadmap:\n\n| GOALS | METRIC | 2022 | 2025 | 2030 | Related SDGs |\n|-------|--------|------|------|------|--------------|\n| SOCIAL | Presence of women in relevant positions | % women | 26.1 % | 30 % | 35 % | 6 |\n| | Presence of women in positions of responsibility | % women | 34 % | 35 % | 36 % | 6 |\n| | Equal pay external certification | Equal pay certification | In progress | 5 |\n| | Accidentality rate (own employees) | TRIR (reduction vs 2021) | -6.4 % | -10 % | -21 % | 3 8 |\n| | Employee training | Hours per employee (annual) | 67.9 h | > 55 h | > 55 h | 4 5 8 |\n| | Quality of supply | Reduce the Global SAIDI (vs 2019-21 period avg) | -4 % | -10 % | - | 9 |\n| | Smart Grids | % HV & MV grid | 76 % | 83 % | - | 9 |\n| | Installed charging points | Thousands | 34.4 | 110 | 400 | 7 9 13 |\n| | Digital customers (with a registered user in digital channels) | % of total commercial customers | 66.12 | 73 | 80 | 3 9 13 |\n| | Beneficiaries of the \u201cElectricity for all\u201d program | Millions of beneficiaries (cumulative) | 11 | 14 | 16 | 7 8 9 |\n| | Beneficiaries of the foundations programs | Millions of annual beneficiaries | 5.7 | 8 | 10 | 1 7 8 |\n| | Corporate volunteering | No of annual volunteers (thousands of employees and comparisons) | 17 | 15 | 18 | 2 10 13 |\n| | Purchases from local suppliers | % of total purchases | 87.1 % | \u2265 80 % | \u2265 80 % | 16 |\n| | Purchases from sustainable suppliers | % of total purchases | 91.5 % | \u2265 85 % | \u2265 85 % | 16 |\n| | Inclusion and diversity solutions | Number of solutions | 29 | 30 | - | 10 |\n| | Human Rights Due Diligence procedure | Continuous review | - | - | - | 7 11 12 |\n| | Formal Stakeholder Engagement Process | Keep increasing the deployment of the scope of the Stakeholder Engagement Process | - | - | - | 17 |\n| | Cybersecurity assessments | Number of annual assessments or external verifications | 1,919 | 2,000 | 2,000 | 8 9 17 |\n| | Cybersecurity education and training | Number of annual hours | 75,722 | 63,000 | 68,000 | 4 8 9 |\n\n1 31/12/2024\n2 Referred to logic terminals.\nIII.1. Protection of human rights\n\n- Iberdrola\u2019s commitment to human rights\n- Human rights due diligence system\nIberdrola\u2019s commitment to human rights\n\nGRI 407 408 409\n\nIberdrola has a firm commitment to the defence of human rights, and has a set of tools that ensure and promote the protection of and respect for people, in order to prevent, mitigate and redress any negative impact on human rights.\n\nTo achieve this, the company\u2019s practices are aligned with:\n\n- the Principles underlying the United Nations Global Compact,\n- the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (GPBH),\n- the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises,\n- the Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and the Social Policy of the International Labour Organization,\n- the conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO) (including convention 169 concerning indigenous and tribal peoples), and\n- the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) approved by the United Nations.\n\nIberdrola\u2019s commitment to human rights is formalised in its Policy on Respect for Human Rights, approved by the Board of Directors in 2015 and last revised in December 2022. This policy establishes the mandatory principles of conduct for all the group\u2019s professionals, as well as the need to have the governance procedures and systems required to ensure respect for human rights in relation to the company\u2019s business, the countries where it operates, and its value chain.\n\nThrough this policy, the company has made the following commitments, among others, associated with international human rights standards:\n\n- To respect human rights, including the labour rights recognised in domestic and international law, as well as comply with international standards in those countries in which human rights legislation has not reached an adequate level of development.\n- To reject child labour and forced or compulsory labour or any other form of modern slavery and to respect freedom of association and collective bargaining, as well as non-discrimination, the freedom of movement within each country, and the rights of ethnic minorities and of indigenous peoples in the places in which it does business.\n- To respect the right to the environment of all communities in which it operates, considering their expectations and needs and understanding access to energy as a right related to and linked to other human rights.\n- To advance a culture of respect for human rights and promote awareness-raising in this field among its professionals within all companies of the group, and especially at those where there may be a higher risk of violation of such rights.\n\nTo guarantee compliance with these commitments, Iberdrola has established the adequate governance and management structures to ensure that duties and responsibilities in this area have been assigned.\nThe Company has also defined an overall human rights due diligence framework with the aim of better integrating all issues relating to human rights into a single system.\n\nThis system is in turn based on the Governance and Sustainability System and on the Control Model of the Company based on three lines of defence (prevention, monitoring, and human rights management assessment). It is a process of continuous review that seeks to promote the implementation of the UNGPs, adjusted for the size of the company and the diversity and particularities of the facilities in the various countries. (For more information, see the: \"Human rights due diligence system\" section of this chapter).\n\nThe cross-dimensional nature of the due diligence system is assured through specific management policies for significant human rights issues. The Policy on Respect for Human Rights of the Iberdrola Group is thus reflected in various policies and operational procedures that apply across all group companies, as well as in non-integrated investees over which the Company has effective control, within legal limits.\n\nOther policies and standards that directly affect or are related to the company\u2019s commitment to human rights have also been approved: Regulations of the Board of Directors and Regulations of the Sustainable Development Committee, Code of Ethics and Suppliers\u2019 Code of Ethics, General Sustainable Development Policy, Stakeholders Engagement Policy People Management Policy; Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy; Recruitment and selection policy; Knowledge Management Policy; Corporate Risk Policies and Senior Management Remuneration Policy, Cybersecurity Risk Policy, Corporate Security Policy, Environmental policies: Sustainable Management Policy, Environmental Policy, Biodiversity Policy y Climate Action Policy.\nHuman rights risk map\n\n- **GRI 407-1 408-1 409-1**\n\nIberdrola has a human rights risk map that covers both the country in which the group operates and those from which it obtains its supplies.\n\nThe map is updated on a regular basis through independent external specialists. Unlike other generic indices on the market, it allows the risks specific to the energy sector to be weighted and supplemented with the particular characteristics of Iberdrola\u2019s activities, providing results more closely aligned with the company\u2019s reality.\n\nThe results of the risk map are cross-checked with the list of the main locations of operation to identify those facilities where there may be a greater risk of human rights violations.\n\nIberdrola carries out a human rights risk analysis at 100% of its main locations of operation (259 locations of operation). The result of this analysis in 2022 showed that 60% of these locations, in the United States, Brazil, Mexico and Greece, present possible risks in one or more of the following human rights issues: labour conditions; environmental impact; occupational safety and health; public safety; indigenous peoples; and lands and property.\n\nLikewise, Iberdrola evaluates 100% of its main providers of general supplies and fuels regarding compliance with certain corporate social responsibility principles established in their contracts, which consider human rights among other aspects. The results of this analysis are included in the \u201cSuppier social assessment\u201d section of this report.\nHuman rights due diligence system\n\nIberdrola understands the Human Rights Due Diligence System as an ongoing process intended to identify and manage the risks and impacts associated with the performance of all phases of its operations (planning, construction, operation, maintenance, and closure of electricity and energy sector facilities), considering the geographic and social context and the characteristics of its supply chain.\n\nAs a result of a broad definition of human rights, the due diligence system is based on various subsystems and their procedures (e.g., Compliance, Health and Safety, Purchases, and Cybersecurity, among others), which manage the matters for which they are responsible.\n\nThe implementation of the due diligence system ensures the identification of actual and potential impacts on human rights, the integration of the conclusions of this analysis and relevant action, follow-up on the company\u2019s responses, and communication of the way in which negative consequences are dealt with.\n\nIdentification of impacts\n\nIdentification of impacts is the first step in the implementation of the system. The methodology employed for this purpose adopts the UNGP recommendations and allows for the evaluation of potential impacts, significant issues, and issues of priority regarding human rights.\n\n1. Potential impacts, understood as those impacts that might be caused by the very nature of the business and the countries in which the company operates, as well as other additional factors. According to the risk map, the areas of potential impact and the Stakeholders that might be affected would be the following:\n\nAreas of potential impact and rights-holding stakeholders\n\n| Rights holders | Areas of personal impact |\n|----------------|--------------------------|\n| Workers        | Working conditions       |\n|                | Occupational safety and health |\n|                | Trade union freedoms     |\n|                | Forced labour and modern forms of slavery |\n|                | Child labour             |\n|                | Equality and non-discrimination |\n|                | Privacy                  |\n|                | Universal access         |\n| Client/users   | Adequate standard of living |\n|                | Land and property        |\n|                | Public safety            |\n|                | Rights of indigenous peoples |\n|                | Environmental impact     |\n| Local communities | Rights of indigenous peoples |\n|                | Environmental impact     |\n2. **Relevant impacts** for the company, determined on the basis of the severity, reach, and possibility of remediation, as well as their likelihood and the extent of the company\u2019s connection to them. In accordance with these criteria, the main relevant human rights impacts for Iberdrola pertain to:\n\n- Labour practices (including the supply chain).\n- Local communities and the rights of indigenous peoples (including the environment).\n- Cybersecurity and information privacy.\n- Citizen insecurity and labour practices in the hiring of security services.\n\n3. **Priority impacts**, for which an action plan is established based on their significance.\n\nAfter identifying the potential impacts, Iberdrola triggers measures to prevent and mitigate them, which are horizontally integrated across all levels of the company.\n\n- **GRI 2-25**\n\nHowever, even valid risk prevention systems are unable to prevent adverse impacts in all cases. For this reason, when the due diligence system detects an actual negative impact, mitigation plans are implemented to reduce the magnitude of the impact. In those cases in which this is not fully possible, remedial action is required. Iberdrola implements **remedial actions or measures** to ensure that victims and affected people have access to an effective remedy through legitimate processes and active cooperation. Remedial actions are intended to restore one or more of the affected rights, returning the affected people to the situation prior to the impact or, if this is not possible, reestablishing it as much as possible through various types of remedy.\n\nAlong these lines, Iberdrola has taken certain actions to prevent and mitigate its main human rights impacts.\n\nAs regards its **employees**, the company has worked, for instance, to ensure that their labour conditions provide them with a decent wage, a safe workplace that takes their mental health into account, as well as respect for diversity, inclusion, non-discrimination and equality of opportunity. These measures are described in the \u201cCommitment to quality employment\u201d, \u201cA safe work environment\u201d and \u201cDiversity and inclusion\u201d sections of this report.\n\nIn the area of Labour Practices, Iberdrola has also taken action to ensure that the labour practices adopted in its **supply chain** make it possible to prevent or mitigate the impacts identified. Thus, the company has integrated various factors to ensure respect for human rights in the various stages of its engagement with its suppliers, together with other support and training initiatives for their improvement. Both types of measures are described in the chapter \u201cIII.5. Promotion of socially responsible practices in the supply chain\u201d.\n\nWithin Labour Practices, other relevant issues are modern slavery and forced labour, which are some of the most serious human rights impacts that may arise, both regarding company employees and those in its supply chain. The group pays special attention to the potential risk of forced labour, due to its seriousness and to the fact that ScottishPower is bound by the UK Modern Slavery Act and Iberdrola Australia is bound by the Commonwealth Modern Slavery Act. For this reason, in 2022 the company modified its Policy on Respect for Human Rights to specifically state its commitment on this matter. Iberdrola also worked to better understand and assess this risk and incorporate its management into the good practices already existing within the group, in particular those arising from Australia and the United Kingdom.\n\nLocal communities are other stakeholders on whom Iberdrola\u2019s activities can have potential or actual impacts. The company has taken various actions to prevent and/or mitigate, including measures to reinforce safety at power grids, ensure that the displacement of populations respect the affected parties\u2019 rights, guarantee responsible supply that takes into account the rights of communities in access to natural resources, and, finally, respect the rights of indigenous peoples and ethnic minorities in accordance with applicable law. These measures are specified in the \u201cIII.6. Contribution to the well-being of our communities\u201d section, as well as in this chapter of the report.\n\nThe hiring of security services with potential impacts on the physical safety of communities is another significant risk identified by Iberdrola. The company has a Corporate Security Policy, as well as various procedures to ensure that its implementation is compatible with the applicable regulations. It has also specified protocols of conduct for all the activities provided by the Security Division. This management approach goes hand in hand with other actions, as well as with a significant effort in training for own and subcontracted personnel performing security activities, as described later in this chapter.\n\nIberdrola has also launched several initiatives pertaining to the potential impacts that may affect the customers and users of its services. In this context, cybersecurity and information privacy are a priority, which the company manages with a unique governance model, specific technical and organisational techniques in each business and area, and a data protection management system, among other actions. Each of them is described in more detail in the \"Cybersecurity and information privacy\" chapter.\n\nThe company also considers supply quality and universal access to energy as another area that could produce various impacts in terms of human rights, which have been worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic, the latest increase in energy prices due to the rise in commodity prices, and other international factors. The main measures implemented by Iberdrola in this area are described in the \u201cIII.6. Contribution to the well-being of our communities\u201d chapter.\n\nIn addition to these actions to manage specific impacts on human rights, Iberdrola has developed a wide range of management measures that are generally integrated into the relevant functions and internal processes across the group. Examples include the establishment of incentives associated with sustainability and responsible fiscal conduct (see \"IV.1. Governance, transparency, and stakeholder engagement\" section), training and qualification in human rights (described in this chapter), as well as the analysis of indices and rankings and participation in multiplayer initiatives relating to human rights that make it possible to identify trends and integrate lessons learned.\nFinally, in accordance with the UNGP, Iberdrola has also implemented a system to monitor the due diligence measures adopted, allowing for examination of the way in which the company has responded to an impact, and whether this response served to prevent and mitigate it and the extent to which it did so.\n\nTo achieve this goal, regular assessments are carried out through internal monitoring of all relevant human rights information, independent experts are consulted, and quantitative and qualitative indicators are used to specify potential improvement actions. This monitoring is based on internal and external sources of information, including ethical mailboxes and channels for complaints and grievances, among others. The Company\u2019s Human Rights Report summarises the methodology to conduct this monitoring, as well as the main conclusions reached (See section 3.4).\n\nComplaint and grievance mechanisms\n\n- **GRI 2-25**\n\nIberdrola has developed mechanisms to file complaints and grievances in accordance with the UNGP, to face any potential negative consequences early, and carry out remedial actions where applicable.\n\nThese mechanisms allow the affected parties to convey their concerns, complaints and grievances to the company, and also play a key role in monitoring the effectiveness of the measures previously implemented to mitigate and/or remedy impacts.\n\nThe main mechanisms are the ethical mailboxes available online and on the intranet, on-site complaint channels, corporate inboxes, and judicial and/or administrative complaints, among others.\n\nThere is a procedure in place to classify, monitor, and report complaints and reports with a potential impact regarding human rights, which facilitates the classification of the complaints received through the different channels and ensures that all cases are resolved.\n\nThe information related to human rights complaints and grievances received in the area of Compliance are described in the chapter on \"Ethics and Integrity\" and those relating to workplace discrimination of company employees in indicator GRI 406-1. Complaints and grievances relating to human rights are specified in the \"Social Assessment of Suppliers\" section as it is a case pertaining to a contractor.\n\nThose relating to the Environment are reported in the \"II. Environmental\" chapter and in the \"III.6. Contribution to the well-being of our communities\" section, while those on Cybersecurity and Information Privacy are included in indicator GRI 418-1. Finally, those relating to Social and Economic Compliance are reported in indicator GRI 2-27.\n\nThis report also provides some examples of remedial actions carried out during the year to respond to the complaints and grievances that required this type of response. These actions are described in the \"Population displacement management\", \"Social impact assessments\" and \"Development programmes for local communities\".\nProgress and results\n\nIberdrola\u2019s achievements in human rights management in 2022 include:\n\n- Modification of the *Governance and Sustainability System* to attribute to the Sustainable Development Committee the power to regularly report on human rights to the Board of Directors regarding the measures and procedures adopted by the group to implement and monitor the policy on respect for human rights.\n- Specific inclusion in the *Policy on Respect for Human Rights* of the company\u2019s commitment to preventing modern forms of slavery and also requiring this of its suppliers.\n- Update of the human rights risk maps in operations and countries of supply based on the specific methodology implemented.\n- Communication and reporting on advances in the due diligence system is one of the key pillars of an effective due diligence system, for which reason accountability on human rights management was increased in 2022 by means of Iberdrola\u2019s first *Human Rights Report*, which was externally assured by an independent third party.\n- Incorporation of specific modern slavery issues to analyse this risk in the registration of new suppliers.\nIII.2. Stakeholder engagement\n\n- Stakeholder engagement\nIberdrola\u2019s Stakeholder Engagement Policy \u2013approved by the Board of Directors in February 2015 and last amended in December 2021\u2013 emphasises that \u201cit is not possible to achieve the social interest and develop a responsible and sustainable business model without the strong engagement of the Company\u2019s Stakeholders, which are defined as those groups and entities whose decisions and opinions have an influence on Iberdrola and who, at the same time, are affected by the Iberdrola group\u2019s activities\u201d. The value chain comprised of Iberdrola\u2019s businesses means that there is a large number of these groups, for which reason the company has decided to group them into eight different categories that constitute its Stakeholders.\n\nThe initial identification and selection of Iberdrola\u2019s Stakeholders was carried out through processes of internal reflection conducted by the management team. The Stakeholder Engagement Policy later ratified the Stakeholder categories described in the preceding section in 2015 and subsequent updates.\n\nOn this basis, for the proper management of each of the Stakeholders, Iberdrola\u2019s various areas and businesses identify different subgroups that they deem relevant for more specific treatment.\nApproach to Stakeholder engagement\n\nIberdrola has a responsible, sustainable and resilient business model that puts Stakeholders at the centre of its decisions. The company\u2019s objective is thus to build relations of confidence with the various Stakeholders, as well as to deepen their participation, engagement and collaboration.\n\nThe By-Laws, the Purpose of the Iberdrola group and the various corporate policies express the company\u2019s focus on the creation of shared sustainable value for Stakeholders related to our business activities and our institutional reality in view of the commitments made in the Code of Ethics.\n\nIn this regard, the Stakeholder Engagement Policy further develops this business philosophy and establishes five objectives and seven principles of conduct, which serve as a guide for all the group\u2019s professionals to act and engage with Stakeholders.\nIberdrola has decisively driven compliance with its Stakeholder Engagement Policy (mentioned above), through a Global Stakeholder Engagement Model based on the AA1000 Stakeholder Engagement Standard 2015 (AA1000SES 2015), the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles 2018 (AA1000AP 2018) standard, and in its four principles of inclusiveness, materiality, responsiveness and impact.\n\nAmong other objectives, this Model seeks to systematise Stakeholder relations throughout the Iberdrola group, in all countries and businesses, and to create a corporate culture with respect to the significance of dialogue with the Stakeholders for more sustainable performance by the company. The Model constitutes a process of continuous improvement in and of itself, as shown below:\n\nThis process is implemented in the management of Iberdrola\u2019s eight Stakeholder group in the five main countries and at most of the Generation and Sustainable Energy facilities, as well as in the various geographic areas of the Networks business.\n\nIt should be noted that the Model addresses the concept of impact from three different points of view: the impact of reputational risks on Iberdrola; the impact of the action plans on Stakeholders; and the impact of significant events on Stakeholders. This last aspect was recently introduced in the Model, taking into account the latest reporting trends and standards. The ultimate goal is to enhance positive impacts and minimise/mitigate those that are more negative for Stakeholders and the company itself.\n\n**Relationship channels, significant topics and best practices**\n\nIberdrola keeps the relationship channels with its Stakeholders updated and makes continuous efforts to identify the issues that are most important to each of them. An analysis of these issues shows that, while there are issues exclusive to each geographical area, most are common to Iberdrola\u2019s five main countries. The company also identifies best practices in relation to Stakeholders, which are shared by the entire group.\n\n---\n\n32 The By-Laws state that \u201cthe Company\u2019s corporate website its presence on social media and its digital communication strategy generally are channels of communication serving the Stakeholder Engagement Policy\u201d\nSet out below is a summary of the most important Stakeholder engagement channels, both face-to-face and online, and the main global issues detected, both generally among all Stakeholders and specific to each Stakeholder group. Also included is a best practice example for each of the main countries in which Iberdrola does business:\n\n### Significant general channels and issues for all Stakeholders\n\n| GENERAL CHANNELS |

Stakeholders: Regulatory entities, Society and Environmental. The most significant issues of interest refer to regulatory compliance, the economic and social impact of the facilities on local communities, and environmental impacts and the mitigation thereof.\n\n### Best practices by country\n\n**Spain**\n\n**Special Stakeholder Engagement Plan for the Duero River Basin (Castilla y Le\u00f3n)**\n\nOver the past two years, Iberdrola has developed a special Engagement Plan for the area surrounding its facilities in the Duero river basin, the purpose of which has been to strengthen relations with Stakeholders in the area. This Plan is based on a process of active listening and has allowed Iberdrola to gain an in-depth understanding of the expectations of the main players in the area, and to explain in detail the technical management of the reservoirs by our company. This initiative has been a beneficial exercise in communication with local and regional authorities, business associations and local groups (fishermen, sports clubs, irrigation users, etc.). Iberdrola has therefore launched various initiatives related to sustainable mobility (such as the installation of recharging points), the commitment to the environment and the fight against climate change (reforestation in various municipalities), and sports activities (hiking).\n\n**People-centred employee networks**\n\nScottishPower\u2019s employee networks are created and managed with a real drive and interest in bringing people together, since their different backgrounds and experiences make the teams stronger. Supported by ScottishPower and run entirely by employees, the growing number of networks have helped to build the business and also to attract and retain diverse talent and to create an open and supportive workplace where everyone can grow. There are currently several specific networks, including those related to professional development, LGBT, gender, parenting and care, climate, multi-ethnicity, people with disabilities, etc.\n\n**United Kingdom**\n\n**Campaigns for active listening and public dissemination of projects**\n\nCommunity information and involvement work is carried out by specialised public outreach teams for each of AVANGRID\u2019s Network Business projects. The community is therefore given a voice and a communication channel is created through which the needs and expectations of the Stakeholders on the different projects are identified. This allows important issues to be addressed at an early stage in order to avoid potential obstacles in the future and achieve positive results. The different public outreach campaigns include face-to-face meetings with the community, distribution of information brochures, website, surveys and billboards, among other activities.\n\n**United States**\n\n**Public safety awareness campaign in relation to the electricity grid**\n\nNeoenergia companies launched the Safe Community Programme in 2022, which focuses on the safety of the population through proper use of electricity. The campaign aims to improve how people coexist on a daily basis with the distribution network through awareness-raising actions. These actions are based on identifying the main causes of accidents involving the grid and will be carried out mainly at schools, community organisations, social institutions and companies. They promote training and conferences, including the distribution of accident prevention bulletins. As a result, the number of accidents and fatalities fell considerably during the year.\n\n**Brasil**\n\n**Responsible and sustainable partner company**\n\nIberdrola Mexico carries out various social and environmental projects that are of common interest to all stakeholders. These programmes most notably include Luces de Esperanza, which brings electricity through solar power to rural communities that do not have an electricity supply; Impulso STEM, which encourages women to pursue STEM careers; and Huertos Comunitarios, which seeks food self-sufficiency, among other programmes. To enhance the connections with our stakeholders, the Sustainable Partnerships Programme was created with the aim of strengthening this relationship, especially among our customers, through volunteering, workshops and webinars. All of these programmes have a positive impact on the communities, and significantly improve the public\u2019s knowledge and opinion of the Company.\n\nIberdrola\u2019s response to all of these issues is reflected not only in the various indicators of this Statement of non-financial information. Sustainability report, but also in the various Annual reports of the Company. The corporate website and the websites of the businesses and the foundations also contain information in this regard.\n\n---\n\n33 In the case of the cogeneration plants, the main Stakeholder group is \u2018Customers\u2019, for whom the most significant issue is customer satisfaction and experience.\nSimilarly, this *Statement of non-financial information. Sustainability report* includes Iberdrola's main impacts on its various Stakeholders, in line with the \u201csocial dividend\u201d concept established by Iberdrola's *Governance and Sustainability System*, understood as \u201cthe direct, indirect or induced contribution of value that its activities represent for all Stakeholders\u201d.\n\nIn recent years, Iberdrola has launched numerous measures to strengthen internal culture regarding the importance of stakeholder engagement throughout the group. These measures include the global working group called the *Iberdrola Stakeholders\u2019 Hub* and the internal dissemination of ten guidelines on how to relate to and engage with its Stakeholders.\n\nThe methodology described in the preceding sections enables the company to identify material issues through direct sources. This analysis is completed with analysis through indirect sources, such as the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DSJI), the Carbon Disclosure Project, the Materiality Analysis, etc., described in the \u201cDefining report content\u201d section.\n\nConsidering all of the foregoing, Iberdrola has a complete Stakeholder management system, subject to a process of continuous improvement, which allows it to increasingly engage all of the groups with which it relates and to encourage their participation in all of the company\u2019s decisions. This is shown by the fact that Iberdrola achieved the highest rating in the \u201cstakeholder engagement\u201d section of the DJSI index in 2022, for the third year in a row.\n\n---\n\n34 Iberdrola prepares an annual Management Report on Iberdrola\u2019s Stakeholder Relations, which summarises issues of interest detected within the various communication channels, as well as the company\u2019s response through action plans.\nIII.3.

This policy also aims to foster the personal and professional growth of all individuals that are part of the group\u2019s workforce, making them participants in its successful business enterprise and guaranteeing them dignified and safe employment in a diverse and inclusive environment.\n\nThis policy is further developed in the following specific policies:\n\n- Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy\n- Recruitment and selection policy\n- Knowledge Management Policy\n- Occupational Safety and Health Risk Policy\n- Senior Management Remuneration Policy\n\nObjectives\n\nIberdrola has identified as the following especially significant issues in relations with its employees:\n\n- Culture: the strengthening of a group corporate culture.\n- Recruitment and hiring of professionals: developing a global framework for the homogenisation of recruitment and hiring procedures at the Group\u2019s companies.\n- Training: the implementation of an integrated training management system.\n- Diversity: raising the awareness of our workforce with respect to diversity.\n- Design of an employment value proposition for the recruitment, hiring, promotion and retention of talent, based on competitive remuneration and a diverse, inclusive work environment, fostering work-life balance and the professional growth of the group\u2019s workforce.\n\nOur workforce\n\nThe group has 40,721 employees at year-end 2022, with the following breakdown by country.\n\n---\n\n35 Policy included as a section within the Corporate Risk Policies.\nGRI 2-7\n\nEmployees\n\n| Country       | 2022  | 2021  | 2020  |\n|---------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Spain         | 9,702 | 9,727 | 9,594 |\n| United Kingdom| 5,755 | 5,708 | 5,563 |\n| United States | 7,579 | 7,349 | 7,031 |\n| Brazil        | 15,406| 15,058| 12,814|\n| Mexico        | 1,305 | 1,296 | 1,307 |\n| IEI           | 974   | 817   | 818   |\n| **Total**     | 40,721| 39,955| 37,127|\n\nThe distribution by types of employment and contract is reflected in the following table:\n\nEmployees by type of employment and contract\n\n| By employment type | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|--------------------|------|------|------|\n| Full-time          | 30,676| 29,753| 27,298|\n| Part-time          | 436  | 919  | 1,189|\n| **Total**          | 31,112| 30,672| 28,487|\n\nDistribution by gender, age and professional category is reflected in the table below:\n\nEmployees by gender, age and professional category\n\n| By gender | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|-----------|------|------|------|\n| Men       | 31,112| 30,672| 28,487|\n| Women     | 9,603 | 9,283 | 8,640|\n| **Total** | 40,721| 39,955| 37,127|\n\nGRI 405-1\n\nThe figures in the table reflect the number of employees at year-end 2022, regardless of the type of work day. The average number of contracts is not reported because there is an insignificant change with respect to contracts at the end of the year owing to the high percentage of full-time permanent contracts and low turnover. To perform statistical analysis regarding labour costs, it is recommended to use the number of employees in terms of Full Time Equivalents (FTEs): 35,923 in financial year 2020, 39,788 in financial year 2021 and 40,237 in financial year 2022.\n\nWe do not have employees working non-guaranteed hours.\n\nThis table represents individuals who identify as men or women, so the figures segmented by gender may not coincide with the total because of people who identify as another gender or who choose not to disclose this information.\n\nThis table represents individuals who identify as men or women, so the figures segmented by gender may not coincide with the total because of people who identify as another gender or who choose not to disclose this information.\nEmployees by category and age group (%)\n\n| Category                        | 2022  | 2021  | 2020  |\n|---------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| **Leadership**                  |       |       |       |\n| Up to 30 years old             | 0.04  | 0.08  | 0.06  |\n| Between 31 and 50 years old    | 3.67  | 4.69  | 5.02  |\n| Over 50 years old              | 1.88  | 2.48  | 2.57  |\n| Total                           | 5.59  | 7.25  | 7.65  |\n| **Qualified Technicians**       |       |       |       |\n| Up to 30 years old             | 6.62  | 5.63  | 5.37  |\n| Between 31 and 50 years old    | 25.67 | 23.68 | 23.81 |\n| Over 50 years old              | 8.50  | 8.17  | 8.72  |\n| Total                           | 40.79 | 37.49 | 37.90 |\n| **Skilled workers and support personnel** |       |       |       |\n| Up to 30 years old             | 11.79 | 12.39 | 11.89 |\n| Between 31 and 50 years old    | 32.43 | 32.13 | 30.32 |\n| Over 50 years old              | 9.39  | 10.74 | 12.24 |\n| Total                           | 53.62 | 55.27 | 54.45 |\n| **Total**                       | 100   | 100   | 100   |\n\nEmployees with disabilities\n\n| Category | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|----------|------|------|------|\n| Men      | 452  | 453  | 366  |\n| Women    | 252  | 234  | 188  |\n| Total    | 704  | 687  | 554  |\n\nInformation on ethnic diversity is included in the Iberdrola *Diversity and Inclusion Report*.\n\n**Non-employee workers**\n\n- **GRI 2-8**\n\nIberdrola encourages the use of technology in renewable and smart grids, which allows for progress in the energy transition towards cleaner energy. It does so in part with the support of third-party specialists (contractor personnel), whose main jobs include those characteristic of Iberdrola\u2019s own activity: operation and maintenance, as well as inspections at technical facilities, activities regarding preparedness and emergency response. They can also carry out maintenance work not characteristic of Iberdrola\u2019s main activity (maintenance of administrative buildings). Activities include support to nuclear operation, mechanical, electrical and usage maintenance, onshore and offshore wind farm construction activities, solar and cogeneration facilities, civil works, electromechanical assembly, and startup. General services include staff for industrial cleaning, decontamination, painting, and civil works. There are staff for IT, administrative, surveillance, and training support. As regards security, there are physical security, radiological control, and fire protection personnel.\n\nAt some companies, we also have workers from Temporary Employment Agencies, who usually carry out short-term jobs, helping to cover the positions of workers on leave or due to an occasional increase in work, usually administrative work. They can also provide specialised work required for a specific project, such as transmission, distribution and renewables.\nAt year-end 2022 there were 53,401 non-employee workers (221 of whom are part-time workers), broken down as follows:\n\n### Non-employee workers\n\n|                      | 2022     |\n|----------------------|----------|\n| Contractors          | 53,033   |\n| Temporary employment agencies | 368      |\n| **Total**            | 53,401   |\n\n### Salary\n\n#### Average salary by professional level\n\n| Iberdrola (EUR) | Includes: Fixed salary Variable Supplements | Includes: Fixed salary Variable Supplements | Includes: Fixed salary Variable |\n|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                 | 2022                                        | 2021                                        | 2020                                        |\n| Leadership      | 150,832                                     | 126,126                                     | 120,891                                     |\n| Qualified technicians | 65,808                                     | 57,472                                     | 55,863                                     |\n| Skilled workers and support personnel | 34,763                                     | 30,194                                     | 32,773                                     |\n| **Total average salary** | 53,792                                     | 47,307                                     | 48,038                                     |\n\n#### Average salary by age group and gender\n\n| Iberdrola (EUR) | Men | Women | Total |\n|-----------------|-----|-------|-------|\n|                 | Fixed salary Variable | Fixed salary Variable | Fixed salary Variable | Fixed salary Variable | Fixed salary Variable | Fixed salary Variable | Fixed salary Variable | Fixed salary Variable |\n|                 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n| Up to 30 years old | 31,898 | 25,273 | 23,994 | 31,426 | 26,391 | 26,093 | 31,779 | 26,391 | 24,451 |\n| Between 31 and 50 years old | 48,825 | 42,242 | 43,650 | 55,832 | 49,474 | 51,371 | 50,452 | 43,921 | 45,509 |\n| 51 or older      | 86,979 | 78,584 | 77,943 | 81,837 | 70,885 | 69,766 | 85,754 | 76,722 | 76,054 |\n| **Total average salary** | 53,100 | 46,529 | 47,232 | 56,020 | 49,857 | 50,679 | 53,792 | 47,307 | 48,038 |\n\n#### Entry-level wage vs. legal minimum wage (%)\n\n|                | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|----------------|------|------|------|\n| Spain          | 110.0| 126.1| 107.7|\n| United Kingdom | 100.0| 100.1| 101.8|\n| United States  | 118.0| 123.5| 128.7|\n| Brazil         | 124.0| 138.9| 141.7|\n| Mexico 40      | 278.0| 312.1| 399.3|\n\nAs a general principle of conduct of its human resources management model, Iberdrola promotes respect for the human and labour rights recognised in domestic and international law, guaranteeing a decent job and a living wage.\n\n---\n\n40 In Mexico, the minimum wage is generally not used as a reference for market wages; it is applied to penalties imposed by the labour authority, fines and limits on tax deductibility.\nStable labour environment\n\nRecruitment and selection: new hires\n\n- **GRI 202 401-1**\n\nIberdrola considers talent to be key factor in ensuring the organisation\u2019s success each day. For this reason, all of the companies forming part of the Iberdrola group work together to attract, select, empower and retain their professionals, whose performance, knowledge and skills are aligned with the company\u2019s purpose, values and current and future needs.\n\nThe group has specific policies approved by the Board of Directors that regulate recruitment activities (such as the Recruitment and selection policy and the Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy), as well as a broader recruitment and selection process applied at the global level. This process also relies on local practices in order to ensure that the best talent is attracted and selected in line with the needs of each specific territory and is adapted to the specific legal system.\n\nIn 2022, in keeping with the reality of the global social context following the COVID-19 pandemic, Iberdrola engaged in various activities to attract, select, empower and retain the best and most diverse talent pool across its various territories. These actions include the following:\n\n- The Iberdrola International Graduate Programme was launched in 2022. It is aimed at recent graduates starting their professional careers, and its goal is to create an international pool of graduates to meet future needs across the group. This 2-year programme includes a development plan structured in a number of rotations, accelerating the acquisition of knowledge and the learning curve. 164 vacancies were offered globally in 2022, 75% of which had been filled by professionals by the end of the year.\n\n- Attendance at job forums and holding talks and conferences, both in person and virtually, to share the values of our company with students and encourage them to take part in our selection processes. Iberdrola also has a presence at leading universities, taking part in talent groups, round tables and specialised forums.\n\n- A global campaign to recruit profiles for the offshore wind farm renewables business was launched in 2022 to incorporate experienced professionals so as to develop new international projects in the United Kingdom, the United States, Brazil, Spain and Asia Pacific, as well as the European market. 3,600 candidates applied through this campaign.\n\nWe have also continued with the following projects:\n\n- Agreements with prestigious universities such as Comillas Pontifical University, Universidad de Salamanca, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Yale University, Strathclyde University, Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco and Hamad Bin Khalifa University.\n\n- Training programmes at the company. A combined total of 198 vocational students and 798 university students have begun their training at Iberdrola Espa\u00f1a, ScottishPower, AVANGRID, Neoenergia, Iberdrola M\u00e9xico and Iberdrola Energ\u00eda Internacional.\n\n- International scholarship programmes for master\u2019s studies. In 2022, Iberdrola awarded 33 scholarships for master\u2019s degree studies in the company\u2019s areas of interest, and 10 more scholarships are still to be awarded in Brazil.\n\n- Encouraging the use of internal employee channels to promote opportunities for internal promotion and international mobility: in 2022, 43.6% of published vacancies were filled internally.\nAll of these initiatives form part of the activities that Iberdrola performs to attract and select talent.\n\nThe lesser degree of representation of women in the labour market, for certain technical profiles, makes it difficult to achieve gender parity in new hires. These limitations are specific to the energy sector, for which reason Iberdrola is engaging in numerous activities to promote an interest in technical studies among school-age girls. Some examples of these initiatives are:\n\n- **STEAM alliance for female talent.** *Girls for science:* Iberdrola Espa\u00f1a has joined this initiative of the Ministry of Education and Vocational Training, which includes, among other activities, promoting teacher\u2019s training in these areas, STEAM projects for education institutions, and the creation of a quality stamp for companies and entities that engage in activities to promote these disciplines.\n\n- **Eureka!,** a five-year educational programme sponsored by AVANGRID, aimed at girls from low-income families, minorities, and those who would be the first to go to university in their family (in partnership with *Girls Inc.*, a programme for young women with an interest in STEM careers).\n\n- In the United Kingdom, ScottishPower partners with *Forth Valley College* to design an online programme with useful educational resources so that students can receive the best STEM training.\n\n- In Brazil, the *Escola de electricistas* for women seeks to encourage women to join the industry through learning programmes in theory and practice.\n\n- Iberdrola M\u00e9xico has developed the STEM Promotion Programme with the Institute for Renewable Energy (IER) at Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico (UNAM) and Universidad Tecnol\u00f3gica de los Valles Centrales de Oaxaca (UTVCO), seeking to encourage the study of engineering among Oaxaca youth, particularly young women.\n\nThe principles described in the \u201cDiversity and equal opportunity\u201d and \u201cNon-discrimination\u201d sections of this report apply both to remuneration and to the selection of professionals. The current collective bargaining agreements at the companies of the Iberdrola group ensure equality in starting wages for men and women.\n\n### New hires\n\n|                  | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|------------------|------|------|------|\n|                  | Men  | Women| Men  | Women| Men  | Women|\n| **By age, in numbers** |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Up to 30 years old | 1,440| 700  | 1,814| 562  | 1,308| 387  |\n| Between 31 and 50 years old | 1,567| 723  | 1,932| 552  | 1,462| 412  |\n| Over 50 years old | 182  | 77   | 136  | 58   | 99   | 54   |\n| **Total number out of total workforce** | 3,189| 1,500| 3,882| 1,172| 2,869| 854  |\n| **By age, in %** |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Up to 30 years old | 25.64| 36.90| 32.47| 33.86| 26.19| 26.91|\n| Between 31 and 50 years old | 8.11 | 12.40| 10.40| 9.88 | 8.73 | 7.92 |\n| Over 50 years old | 2.95 | 4.10 | 2.09 | 2.85 | 1.47 | 2.70 |\n| **Total % out of total workforce** | 10.25| 15.62| 12.66| 12.63| 10.07| 9.87 |\n\n---\n\n41 This table represents individuals who identify as men or women, so the figures segmented by gender may not coincide with the total because of people who identify as another gender or who choose not to disclose this information.\n\n42 Of the total turnover reported in Mexico, 46 were temporary positions of union personnel, which is governed by the union contract with SUTERM, and due to the nature of the temporary employment itself there are discharges and subsequent returns of the same worker.

The parties rely on negotiation as the main form of establishing mutual rights and duties. Trade union negotiations are part of the labour relations management model at group companies, and collective bargaining agreements are established to reflect modern and advanced labour practices, while respecting the regional characteristics and areas of activity of the various group companies and seeking to go beyond compliance with legal requirements.\n\nIn this regard, the Company has significant experience in trade union relations and has worked with these entities in accordance with the ethical and transparent principles that guide good negotiation practices, which has resulted in reaching collective bargaining agreements.\n\nGenerally speaking, the collective bargaining agreements of the Iberdrola group apply to all employees working under an employment relationship and for the account of the companies of the group, regardless of the type of contract entered into, the professional group to which they are assigned, their occupation or the job performed.\n\n\\textsuperscript{47} This table represents individuals who identify as men or women, so the figures segmented by gender may not coincide with the total because of people who identify as another gender or who choose not to disclose this information.\nHowever, issues relating to corporate organisation, the law of each country or even the practices and customs in each country lead to certain groups being expressly excluded from the scope of collective bargaining agreements (for example, executive officers in Spain are not covered by the agreement). In most situations the working conditions of these employees are determined by collective bargaining agreements covering all other employees or by personal contracts based on individual bargaining (e.g. salary, benefits, etc.), with all other conditions based on the collective agreement itself. In the case of Brazil, Neoenergia has a national Human Resources Policy for those cases in which employees may not be covered by collective bargaining agreements, on which the premises of this policy are applied until an agreement is reached with the local trade union.\n\nThis is why there is not 100% coverage, as indicated in the table below:\n\n| Personnel covered by a collective bargaining agreement, by region |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **No. of employees** | **%** | **No. of employees** | **%** | **No. of employees** | **%** |\n| Spain | 8,475 | 87.4 | 8,578 | 88.2 | 8,383 | 87.4 |\n| United Kingdom | 3,480 | 60.5 | 3,680 | 64.5 | 3,674 | 66.0 |\n| United States | 3,486 | 46.0 | 3,504 | 47.7 | 3,438 | 48.9 |\n| Brazil | 15,406 | 100 | 15,092 | 100 | 12,808 | 100 |\n| Mexico | 371 | 28.4 | 349 | 26.9 | 348 | 26.6 |\n| IEI | 394 | 40.5 | 178 | 21.8 | 261 | 31.9 |\n| **Total** | **31,612** | **77.6** | **31,381** | **78.5** | **28,912** | **77.9** |\n\nThere are 9 collective bargaining agreements in Spain, 2 in the United Kingdom, 11 in the United States, 37 in Brazil, 10 in Mexico, y 4 in the other countries of Iberdrola Energ\u00eda Internacional.\n\n**GRI 402-1**\n\nThe different organisational changes and significant events are formally reported in compliance with the various legal provisions applicable at both the global and local level, as well as any applicable terms of the collective bargaining agreements with regard to the labour relations of the group companies. The minimum periods for giving notice, if they apply, range from less than one week to a maximum of four weeks in the main countries in which the group operates.\n\n**Benefits**\n\n**GRI 401-2**\n\nIberdrola offers a number of benefits to its employees, including:\n\n- Life insurance\n- Medical insurance\n- Disability insurance\n- Maternity/paternity leave\n- Pension fund\n- Remuneration in the form of company shares\nDiversity and inclusion\n\nGovernance model\n\n- GRI 405\n\nIberdrola has demonstrated its commitment to diversity and inclusion, and aims to reflect as faithfully as possible the diversity of the communities of which it is part. The company seeks to strengthen individual capabilities based on the firm belief that each person brings a special and unique talent that enriches everyone. This commitment is shared with the Stakeholders with whom the company interacts directly or indirectly: employees, partners, shareholders, suppliers, and customers.\n\nTo achieve a truly inclusive workplace, it is crucial to take action regarding the company culture, for which reason diversity is integrated in the corporate values and conduct that define the way in which the leaders and employees of Iberdrola conduct themselves.\n\nWith this goal in mind, the organisation has a robust governance system that specifies and promotes the diversity and inclusion strategy, and has specific mechanisms that guide actions in this area, such as, for example:\n\n- **Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy**: seeks to create a good environment that facilitates and promotes equality of opportunity, non-discrimination, diversity, and inclusion for the professionals in group companies, consequently seeking a human resources management model committed to professional excellent and quality of life.\n\n- **Boards of Directors Diversity and Member Selection Policy**: its purpose is to ensure that proposals for the appointment of Company directors ensure a diversity of skills, knowledge, experience, origin, nationality, age and gender within the composition thereof.\n\n- **Global Diversity and Inclusion Committee**: Executive committee seeking to propose, promote, and coordinate the company\u2019s Diversity and Inclusion positioning in line with the group\u2019s strategy, and to involve the Senior Management of each of the subsidiaries in these issues.\n\nTo guarantee a discrimination-free work environment, and in line with the **Code of Ethics**, the Group is explicitly committed to not discriminate by reason of any condition (gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, origin, or any other characteristics not related to the requirements to perform the job) and has procedures to prevent conduct that violate this standard.\n\nIn addition to the global guidelines, the companies of the group have additional policies and mechanisms to expand their commitment and adjust to country requirements.\n\n**Strategy and Commitments**\n\nTo ensure proper coordination in the execution of the strategy established by the group, a common working framework has been defined that considers the organisation\u2019s current and future needs and those of the communities in which it operates. Its scope focuses on gender, age, disability, origin, sexual orientation, and war veterans, although the goal is to encompass all individual characteristics.\n\nThe group promotes diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) through initiatives focused on talent, culture, customers, and social contribution, partnering with its employees and other Stakeholders to achieve an inclusive, innovative and sustainable energy future for all.\nThe group published its ESG commitments at the 2022 Capital Markets & ESG Day, as described in section \"I.4. Our ESG+F proposal\". In the Social pillar, goals have been included that drive diversity and inclusion and contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda, as mentioned in the \"Targets ESG Social\" section, including diversity and inclusion goals like women in leadership positions and positions of responsibility, inclusive solutions for our customers, the Electricity for All Programme, strong social activities with vulnerable groups through our Foundations and volunteers, as well as with our suppliers, emphasising local purchases and the robust sustainability and ESG policies and practices.\n\nApart from the global goals, these commitments are supplemented at the country level, taking into account the social context.\n\nIberdrola has worked with major institutions for years, joining the United Nations Global Compact in 2002, and continues to support UN WOMEN, the UN body that supports progress towards equality between women and men. It also supports the European Round Table for Industry (ERT), acting in the working group that seeks to give greater visibility and support and connect large companies in this regard.\n\n**2022 performance**\n\nThe management of diversity and inclusion is seen not only as an urgent issue of equity or fairness, but also as an opportunity for value creation from different perspectives. In this context, the company launched its annual work plan under the motto \u201cOur differences make our strength\u201d, the main activities of which include:\n\na. Global Diversity and Inclusion function: Creation of a global organisational structure to articulate D&I commitment across the organisation.\n\nb. Creation and implementation of an internal index to measure subsidiaries\u2019 performance in this area, identifying strong points and opportunities for improvement, so as to guide action and share internal best practices. Review of processes aimed at ensuring a discrimination-free work environment, taking into account the requirements of the market indices.\n\nc. Review of alliances and partnerships with external entities that promote D&I to maximise results and continue to influence social change.\n\nd. Identification of opportunities to improve in Human Resources processes and more robust data management - evaluation of the internal procedures to reach the goals set and systematisation of D&I metrics.\ne. Strengthening of internal communications and celebration of significant dates, through activities that seek to raise awareness, foster dialogue, make role models from minority groups more visible, and ensure the commitment of the workforce. There is a full week of D&I activities at the main geographical locations.\n\nf. Training programmes mainly focusing on promoting inclusive leadership and providing the knowledge to value individual differences.\n\nTo the company\u2019s commitment are added: Employee activities in the corporate volunteering programme, through various D&I initiatives and the work of the foundations (ScottishPower Foundation, AVANGRID Foundation, Fundaci\u00f3n Iberdrola M\u00e9xico, Instituto Neoenergia, and Fundaci\u00f3n Iberdrola Espa\u00f1a) to promote equality of opportunity in access, education, and the job market, particularly for vulnerable people.\n\nResults\n\nIberdrola has been committed to diversity and inclusion for many years, leading to specific events and recognition:\n\n- Iberdrola has been included once again in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, the only European utility to be included in its 23-year history. Its social score increased in the following areas: Gender Pay and Workforce Breakdown.\n- Bloomberg recognised Iberdrola for the fifth year in a row by including it in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI) of organisations committed to equality between women and men.\n- The Workforce Disclosure Initiative (WDi) recognised Iberdrola for its various initiatives to promote a high-quality work environment among its employees.\n- Iberdrola was named one of the 25 leading companies in terms of sustainability worldwide by Global 100\n- In the field of gender diversity: Iberdrola is a leader among IBEX-35 companies, with 43% en female representation on the Board of Directors. Moreover, at the end of 2022, women occupy 26.1% of leadership positions at Iberdrola, with 34.0% of positions of responsibility held by women\n- Improved procedures to protect customers at risk of exclusion or in vulnerable situations so as to promote energy access for the most disadvantaged groups: Implementation of inclusive channels of communication and development of services to meet the specific needs of our diverse customers.\n- Strengthening of social contribution: purchases from sustainable suppliers. Support to 600,000 athletes, doubling the number of partnerships with National Federations, reaching a total of 32 partnerships since 2016. The Iberdrola Supera 2022 Awards to the best projects launched in Spain in favour of gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment through sport donated \u20ac300,000 across its six categories. In 2022 alone, 16,877 volunteers took part in the Corporate Volunteering Programme.\n\nIn addition, due to the considerable impact of local context on the management of diversity and inclusion, the group\u2019s companies implement many other activities at the various geographical locations:\n### Main diversity and inclusion activities in 2022\n\n#### Spain\n\n| Activity                                                                 | Description                                                                 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1st Diversity Week, encouraging reflection, dialogue and commitment among the workforce. | Development of new training resources: Appropriate treatment of people with disabilities and inclusive leadership in an immersive format. |\n| Renewal of our commitment to #CEOPorLaDiversidad Alliance, whose mission is to bring the CEOs of the main Spanish companies together in a common and innovative vision of D&I. | 67 families benefited from the Family Plan, the goal of which is to facilitate the social and work integration of children with disabilities who are relatives of employees. |\n\n#### United Kingdom\n\n| Activity                                                                 | Description                                                                 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| External awards / recognitions: SUSE Inclusive Employer, Promoting Diversity Award - Large Employer, Carer Positive, Disability Confident and Armed Forces Covenant accreditations. | All employees covered by the parent coaching programme, providing support to employees who are preparing for or back from parental leave. |\n| Creation of the 7th affinity group for employees: SPARC (ScottishPower Are Recognising Capabilities).

Of the grievances already closed, none ended in a written warning and 12 ended in dismissals as a result of improper action relating to human rights. In addition, three complaints were received in Spain concerning the right to organise. The Human Resources area is in charge of taking the appropriate disciplinary action.\n\n- **GRI 406-1**\n\n| Incidents of discrimination reported (no.) | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|-------------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Iberdrola total                           | 50   | 29   | 34   |\n\nAlthough there has been an apparent increase in the number of claims alleging discrimination, this does not have a correlation with the actual number of cases.\nWork-life balance and labour disengagement policies\n\nIberdrola promotes a work-life balance, as well as co-responsibility in the performance of family obligations, providing measures for looking after family members and children, maternity leave and breastfeeding benefits.\n\nThe most recent organisational dynamics and the implementation of new technologies promote organisational efficiency, but at the same time blur the boundaries between work and private life. As indicated in the People Management Policy, the group has made it a priority to ensure that its professionals can fully enjoy their personal lives in a way that is compatible with their work.\n\nThis Policy therefore establishes guidelines that allow employees to effectively separate their personal and work life, with special attention paid to disconnection from digital devices, without favouring or discriminating against those professionals.\n\nThe uninterrupted schedule in Spain and Mexico is noteworthy of mention, with the company being the first IBEX-35 company in Spain to establish this type of shortened workday. Flexible hours, remote working and out-of-office work have also been implemented. Other measures that are applied locally include the freedom for employees to choose the most appropriate workplace depending on their function and measures to control overtime, switching off lights and computers after certain working hours.\n\nAs a result of COVID-19, and to ensure safety, productivity and expectations in unprecedented circumstances, the importance of communication between all levels of the Company was emphasised. This has resulted in a more flexible working environment and hybrid and/or remote job positions. In addition, policies to care for the health of employees were improved and actions to promote quality of life and the well-being of its professionals were expanded. All this was carried out while ensuring the quality of the essential service for the community provided by Iberdrola 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, despite COVID-19.\n\n\u25a0 GRI 401-3\n\nParental leave and return to work\n\n|                          | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|--------------------------|------|------|------|\n|                          | Men  | Women| Men  | Women| Men  | Women|\n| Employees entitled to parental leave (No.) | 31,112 | 9,603 | 30,672 | 9,283 | 28,486 | 8,640 |\n| Employees entitled to parental leave (%) | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 |\n| Number of employees taking parental leave | 1,102 | 452 | 977 | 366 | 743 | 332 |\n| Number of employees who returned to work after parental leave ended | 1,260 | 355 | 1,135 | 327 | 830 | 264 |\n| Number of employees who returned to work after parental leave ended and who were still employed after 12 months | 1,141 | 216 | 970 | 268 | 825 | 272 |\n| Return-to-work rate | 96.9 | 78.4 | 94.8 | 89.3 | 97.2 | 79.5 |\nDefending salary equality\n\nIberdrola facilitates and promotes equality of opportunity, non-discrimination, diversity, and inclusion for Group professionals through its *Equal opportunity and reconciliation policy*, which calls for equal pay for men and women for equal work and a wage review with uniform criteria for both genders. The current collective bargaining agreements at the companies of the Iberdrola group ensure equality in starting wages for men and women.\n\nThe total average salary of men and women at Iberdrola is quite similar. The ratio of men\u2019s average salary to that of women is 94.8% in 2022, taking into account fixed and variable salary and salary supplements.\n\nThe salary gap in 2021 and in 2020 was 93.3% and 93.2% respectively, taking into account that average salary, composed of base and variable salary, was used for the calculation thereof in 2020.\n\nThe underlying cause of the salary gap in certain age groups is the smaller presence of females within the staff, a common situation in the energy sector, and which is more pronounced in management and technical positions.\n\nTo mitigate this reality, Iberdrola is working in the following areas:\n\n- On equitable professional development through the implementation of specific training plans for women.\n- On including new generations and promoting STEM careers in groups within the industry with a higher minority representation.\n- On promoting scientific careers among youth and women students, who will go on to form part of the talent pool that Iberdrola will access in the future.\n- On promoting measures of work-life balance that equally benefit men and women, so that they can exercise co-responsibility in family duties and thus establish the conditions required for parity.\n- On gradually increasing the presence of women in positions of responsibility. As regards Iberdrola\u2019s current situation, positions of responsibility held by women in 2022 rose to 34.0%, compared to 33.7% at the close of the prior year.\n\nAs regards leadership and other positions reporting to the Board of Directors or its committees, the percentage of women in significant positions increased by year-end 2022 to 26.1% compared to 24.4% at the close of the prior year.\n\n\u25a0 GRI 405-2\n\n### Average salary by age group and gender\n\n| Iberdrola (EUR) | Salary men/Salary women | (Salary men \u2013 Salary women) / Salary men |\n|----------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n|                | Includes: Fixed salary Variable Supplements | Includes: Fixed salary Variable Supplements | Includes: Fixed salary Variable Supplements | Includes: Fixed salary Variable Supplements | Includes: Fixed salary Variable Supplements |\n| 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n| Up to 30 years old | 101.5 | 95.8 | 92.0 | 1.5 | -4.4 | -8.7 |\n| Between 31 and 50 years old | 87.5 | 85.4 | 85.0 | -14.4 | -17.1 | -17.7 |\n| 51 or older | 106.3 | 110.9 | 111.7 | 5.9 | 9.8 | 10.5 |\n| Total | 94.8 | 93.3 | 93.2 | -5.5 | -7.2 | -7.3 |\n\n*In 2021 there was internalisation of core network services in Brazil (approximately 2,300 contracted employees), which is reflected both in average salary of skilled workers and support personnel as well as in the total average salary.*\nSafe work environment\n\nThe safety and health of people is a top priority for the Iberdrola group and therefore strongly influences how all its activities are designed and carried out. This commitment forms part of the group\u2019s vision and values, and is formally set out in the Occupational Safety and Health Risk Policy approved by the company\u2019s Board of Directors, the basic goals of which are to:\n\n- Achieve a gradual reduction in accident rates at the Iberdrola group\u2019s businesses.\n- Continue to improve safety conditions at work and make workplaces increasingly healthier.\n- Promote a culture of excellence and coordinate global preventive actions at the group\u2019s companies.\n\nOccupational Health and Safety Management System\n\n\u25a0 GRI 403 403-1\n\nThe Iberdrola group has implemented Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems with different scopes (country subholding, businesses), which allows it to comply with both current legal provisions in the territories in which it operates and with the ISO 45001:2018 international standard.\n\nAll staff, workplaces and activities under Iberdrola\u2019s control are covered by these systems, which ensure that all requirements of the ISO 45001:2018 standard and local legal obligations in this regard are covered.\n\nThe systems rely on a number of tools to meet these requirements:\n\na. prevention plans\nb. operating procedures\nc. management standards\n\nIn which the following are perfectly defined and identified:\n\na. duties and responsibilities\nb. applicable policies\nc. targets and indicators\nd. desirable goals and resource requirements\n\nAll of the above aims to comply with local and international health and safety regulations in the company\u2019s different areas of operation, including aspects such as management of employees and interested parties, leadership and commitments, policies, responsibilities, consultation with employees, planning, identification of hazards and opportunities, legal requirements, resources, skills, communication, document management, operations, change management, purchasing, performance evaluation, management review, emergency response measures, ergonomic and psychosocial risk management, continuous improvement, etc.\nIn recent years, the Iberdrola group, through its various subsidiaries and businesses, has also implemented specific management and prevention measures in connection with COVID-19 focusing on the protection of individuals and groups, as well as mental and emotional health tools for its employees.\n\nExamples of these measures include adjustment of sanitary, communication, cleaning and disinfection measures; adjustment of spaces and compliance with safety distances in the new COVID-19 environment; the establishment of prevention protocols; monitoring infected and recovered persons on a biweekly basis; launching awareness campaigns; distributing questionnaires to identify and assess psychosocial risk factors; creating specific well-being and early intervention programmes and applications; proposing physical activity challenges for employees; and providing a number of training resources, including a course on managing psychosocial factors for mental health, face-to-face workshops on emotional management, online workshops on personal well-being at work, the M\u00e1s Apoyo programme, the COVID-19 helpline and the quality of life week.\n\nWorkers covered by the occupational health and safety management system\n\n\u25a0 GRI 403-8\n\nThe Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems are designed in accordance with current legal and regulatory requirements and apply to the entire workforce, contractors, suppliers and visitors to protect their health and safety.\n\nInformation on incidents is collected, assessed and reported based on the procedures established by law and internal company regulations. Certification under the ISO 45001:2018 management system is a tool used to ensure uniformity with regard to the methodology for implementing these protocols.\n\nIn general, all employees are covered by the occupational health and safety system in their respective locations. However, there may be exceptions in certain locations as a result of specific local norms. In Brazil, steps continue to be taken for 100% of the employees to be included in the scope of the ISO 45001 certification. Although 75% of employees at Iberdrola Energ\u00eda Internacional are covered by the management system, it does not reach the minimum number of employees to certify management systems in many of the countries in which it has a presence.\n\n| Coverage of the health and safety management system (own personnel) | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Employees covered by occupational health and safety management system | 40,141 | 99 | 38,913 | 97 | 35,471 | 96 |\n| Employees covered by an occupational health and safety management system subject to internal audit | 40,092 | 98 | 38,857 | 97 | 35,466 | 96 |\n| Employees covered by an occupational health and safety management system subject to third-party audit or certification | 32,103 | 79 | 29,561 | 74 | 26,692 | 72 |\nMain elements of the health and safety systems\n\n| Is there a system? | Spain | United Kingdom | US | Brazil | Mexico | IEI |\n|-------------------|-------|----------------|----|--------|--------|-----|\n| Reference regulation | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Scope | Law 31/1995 | UKHS-GSP-SMS2008 Health & Safety Legal Register - Lists all the Legal Requirements | Only for offshore wind | Decree Law 5454/43 - Consolidation of Labour Laws | None | Depending on the country |\n| Certification | ISO 45001 | ISO 45001 | ISO 45001 | ISO 45001 in | ISO 45001 | ISO 45001 |\n| Are there formal risk identification procedures? | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Are there action plans linked to risks? | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Are there formal procedures for giving notification of hazards? | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Are there policies and procedures for withdrawing from situations that may cause injuries, ailments or illness? | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Are there processes for investigating work-related incidents? | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n\nHazard identification, risk assessment and incident investigation\n\n\u25a0 GRI 403-2\n\nA process has been established to identify occupational safety and health hazards, which includes the evaluation and prevention of occupational risks, in all the countries in which Iberdrola operates. The procedures established by standardised institutions are followed in each country, as well as those under the ISO 45001 standard. To manage this process, tools such as the following are used:\n\n- Workplace risk assessment questionnaires.\n- Regular risk assessments.\n- Regular assessments identify the information needed for the annual review of the occupational health and safety management systems, and are used to develop action plans to mitigate risk.\n- Safety inspections.\n- Information sessions, regular training for employees identified as at risk, etc.\n- Internal and external audits to ensure the effectiveness of their processes.\n- Expanded analysis of causes that affected other systems in order to apply the findings and prepare preventive and corrective actions to eliminate the causes of the event.\n- Comprehensive assessment of low- and medium-potential incidents, investigation reports for incidents with high potential or major consequences. All with a view to determining corrective actions and lessons learned.\nIberdrola has and promotes the use of mechanisms to enable its employees, partnering companies and other personnel affected to report any identified occupational health and safety hazards. These mechanisms include various communication channels such as: telephone hotlines, computer applications, ethics mailboxes, etc., but under no circumstances may these communications lead to reprisals or adversely affect an employee, given that they are part of Iberdrola\u2019s preventive culture. All new employees are informed of this possibility, both in their orientation courses and in the safety manual and instructions given prior to accepting the job position.\n\nIn line with this prevention culture, workers are always instructed to not proceed with work, or give priority under any circumstance to performing any task that involves a risk without having the means and knowledge needed to mitigate or eliminate the effects of the risk. Hence, at all locations, employees have the right to speak out and to stop work or refrain from working if they feel that a situation is unsafe. Lastly, when an incident is reported in any country, an investigation is carried out on the possible root causes and contributing factors. In addition, general procedures are implemented to monitor and complete the corrective actions resulting from the investigation (through the hierarchy of controls stemming from applicable law).\n\n\u25a0 GRI 403-7\n\nOne of the Iberdrola group\u2019s pillars of action is to promote the health and safety of its employees. This includes strict compliance with labour law, integrating occupational safety at all levels of the hierarchy, and the use of systems to mitigate any impact on occupational health and safety.\n\nThese systems include the evaluation of occupational risks (including psychosocial risks), providing theoretical and practical courses, carrying out regular health exams, designing mechanisms to detect possible negative impacts on the health of staff, and implementing specific plans to mitigate the negative impacts of work on health and safety.\n\nThis internal procedure must also be implemented by all partnering companies to manage the health and safety of their contractors. This includes pre-qualification, selection, approval, supervision and management of contractors to reduce risks and ensure the well-being of the employees.\n\nOccupational health services\n\n\u25a0 GRI 403-3\n\nIberdrola has occupational risk prevention policies that include regular legal assessments, hygiene measurements, internal and external audits, ISO 45001 management system controls, health monitoring, and accredited medical services.\n\nThese programmes include professional occupational health services, advice and support to effectively manage occupational health and safety risks, absence management, drug and alcohol testing, health monitoring, international travel assistance, sick leave management, first aid, rehabilitation, specialist health counselling, overseas employee services, overseas business travel health assessment, voluntary medical exams, employee self-referrals, early intervention, specialist support services, wellness programmes, mental health programmes, skills development programmes and healthy eating programmes. These services are protected by medical confidentiality and files are kept in such a way so as to guarantee the confidentiality of the information contained in the files.\nWorker participation, consultation and communication on occupational health and safety\n\n\u25a0 GRI 403-4\n\nThe Iberdrola group companies strive to implement a culture of communication, consultation and participation on topics relating to occupational health and safety. This is achieved through the dissemination of prevention plans, the creation of joint and collective occupational health and safety committees (with regular meetings), the provision of formal and informal channels for consultation by employees, training plans on occupational risk prevention, general communication and consultation procedures, panels of qualified employees, strategic safety meetings, the use of the corporate intranet, and other media such as magazines, display screens at the plant, etc. On this basis:\n\nIn Spain, there is a Central Occupational Health and Safety Committee.\n\nIn the UK, there is a Health and Safety Governance Committee, as well as executive teams, a Health and Safety Department, and Health and Safety Forums.\n\nIn the United States, the company has employee-qualified panels and a Strategic Safety Board that meets on a monthly basis.\n\nBrazil has Health and Safety Committees, as does Mexico, which has a Health and Safety Committee. Iberdrola Energ\u00eda Internacional (IEI) has committees that vary from country to country.\n\n| Own staff represented on safety and health committees (%) | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Spain                                                    | 96.2 | 95.9 | 97.1 |\n| United Kingdom                                           | 100.0| 98.2 | 100.0|\n| United States                                            | 100.0| 100.0| 100.0|\n| Brazil                                                   | 100.0| 100.0| 95.1 |\n| Mexico                                                   | 99.1 | 100.0| 85.9 |\n| IEI                                                      | 0.7  | 0.0  | 12.4 |\n| Iberdrola total                                          | 96.7 | 96.9 | 95.1 |\n\nWorker training on occupational health and safety\n\n\u25a0 GRI 403-5\n\nIberdrola Espa\u00f1a has training courses that cover the needs regarding information and training on and awareness of occupational risks at the workplace.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, new employees are invited to a corporate introduction event and are introduced to a number of senior executives who present various aspects of Iberdrola\u2019s business. They are also offered training on the Health and Safety Management System, along with technical and operational training and assistance from experts in the field and suppliers.\n\nIn the United States, employees at AVANGRID receive technical and safety training through a combination of fieldwork, classroom instruction and online training.\nIn Brazil, employees at Neoenergia receive training on the hazards, risks and controls associated with each job function, and are not allowed to perform the work until they demonstrate the skills and knowledge necessary to do so safely.\n\nIn Mexico, a training plan is established based on the performance evaluation.\n\nAt Iberdrola Energ\u00eda Internacional (IEI), all employees take specific health and safety training courses.\n\n**Promotion of health among workers**\n\n- **GRI 403-6**\n\nThe Iberdrola group has established various procedures, measures and programmes to ensure better occupational health and well-being of its employees. This includes human and material resources, functions and responsibilities in the medical, monitoring and control areas.\n\nIn addition, there are flu vaccination campaigns, programmes for promoting health and preventing diseases such as colon cancer, prostate cancer, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes and glaucoma, as well as recommendations for healthy diets, access to physical exercise and seasonal vaccination campaigns.\n\nAt Iberdrola Espa\u00f1a, Occupational Medicine activities fall within the scope of the Prevention Service. Employees are offered a comprehensive benefits package that includes medical, dental and vision coverage. These benefits are also extended to the immediate family members of employees. In addition, the company assists in providing external medical therapies and treatments.\n\nAt the international level, access to medical services is managed by the Human Resources divisions. These benefits include doctor\u2019s visits, surgery, hospitalisation, medical exams and dental care.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, two strategic initiatives were launched to improve the mental health of employees, along with a plan to prevent and reduce physical problems at the workplace.\n\nFurthermore, in Brazil there are outsourced contracts for flu vaccination, doctor\u2019s visits and screening services through a health plan, prevention campaigns and access to benefits from physical exercise.\n\nTwo specific programmes to promote health were developed at Iberdrola Mexico: Total-pass (benefit to promote the physical activity of personnel members) and Cuadro M\u00e9dico (an electronic medical file database containing the medical examinations and recommendations from the doctor at the plant).\n\nIn the other countries, the Iberdrola group offers campaigns and programmes to promote health, as well as psychosocial risk assessments and psychological support to employees.\nInjury and

The main goal is for the training offering to cover strategic priorities, adapting to all group companies.\n\nOngoing learning is a key element for promoting innovation, competitiveness and the progress of Iberdrola\u2019s professionals. For this reason, Iberdrola has a solid training model that reaches all of its professionals in all categories. This firm commitment to training translated into more than 2.7 million employee training hours in 2022. Along these lines, we continued to strengthen our ongoing learning culture through initiatives like \u201cKeep Learning\u201d, which promotes employees\u2019 active involvement in their training.\n\nIt includes the following activities:\n\n\u2022 The Group\u2019s companies continued to adjust training plans and actions to the social and economic context to meet employee needs.\n\n\u2022 Training activities were carried out in Spain in 2022 in connection with our company\u2019s current activity and strategic orientation, focusing on key aspects of digitalisation, particularly through the use of Multiplayer spaces with Digital Twins, which provide greater autonomy in content creation, shortening the student\u2019s learning curve and improving the benefits from the training. Special efforts were made in actions with senior talent, through contrast activities at the Networks business, in order to transfer the technical knowledge of more experienced professionals while sharing good practices.\n\n\u2022 In the United Kingdom, face-to-face training resumed in 2022 after the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions, including the new awareness-raising programme on security for the Networks business, and training in frequency converters for the technicians in the Renewables business who will face the growth of the solar business.\n\n\u2022 In 2022, the LinkedIn Learning offering continued to expand in the United States by means of training courses designed to reinforce development programmes and initiatives, e.g., the Engineering Development Program and Unconscious Bias Training. Furthermore, training in \u201cHow to have difficult conversations\u201d was launched, and resources were expanded to help leaders to manage teams remotely.\n\n\u2022 In Brazil, language programmes, integration for new employees, MBA/Postgraduate courses, actions focusing on skills, as well as mandatory technical training are being offered, covering strategic lines in our business, face-to-face and remotely, through the incorporation of more digital tools.\n\n\u2022 Mexico is using new learning methodologies, such as gamification, which have made it possible to significantly reinforce training in D&I, through the LinkedIn Learning catalogue, and in languages, through the Go Fluent platform.\n\n\u2022 Due to geographic and linguistic dispersion, Iberdrola Energ\u00eda Internacional has opted for online training, through multilanguage platforms like Learning Light and LinkedIn Learning.\nProfessional Development Programmes\n\nAt the Iberdrola group, we will continue to train and develop our employees in accordance with the commitments specified in the model designed by the company in 2019. The behaviours are inspiring guidelines for professionals to act at each stage in their professional career.\n\nLocally, the implementation of the model continues to be strengthened through various training, development, and internal communication initiatives.\n\nIn Spain, several activities have continued due to their success and popularity, including \u201cDevelopment Conversations\u201d. Interviews in digital format with leaders in various fields, in line with our values and principles of conduct, focusing on STEM professionals in 2022. Training itineraries based on our principles designed in LinkedIn Learning, \u201cAn idea in 5 minutes\u201d \u2013 development videos with well-known speakers in areas of expertise relating to business and general issues aligned with our principles. Team Leader Programme, with a four-year modular structure that is based on our principles. \u201cThe change show\u201d \u2013 internal videos where employees who are a leaders in each of the principles recount their first-hand experiences and challenges. There was work in 2022 on \u201cSimplifying to be agile\u201d and \u201cEmpowering to grow\u201d.\n\nAll these resources are available to employees on a self-development platform structured around the behavioural principles, while the Savia programme offers training courses based on their needs.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the self-assessment process continued so that all employees have a clearer vision of where they stand in relation to each of the six principles, including areas to be developed and suggested training activities.\n\nIn the United States, the behaviours have been reinforced in the various learning tools and through internal communications, as well as through the design of LinkedIn Learning pathways. A system of questions was created for the selection processes that is in line with the behavioural model and adapted to the different levels.\n\nIn Mexico, in addition to the internal communication initiatives, there have been several \u201cTED Talks\u201d, an online conference format with internal leaders in each of the six behavioural principles. Each leader gave a live talk where they shared their challenges and professional experiences related to each principle, providing a space for questions and dialogue with those attending.\n\nIn Brazil, several internal communication initiatives are being developed, as well as the \u201cletters of recognition\u201d programme, linked to each of the six principles of behaviour, the aim of which is for leaders and employees to be able to make acknowledgements by sharing these letters, by email, WhatsApp, Yammer or LinkedIn.\n\nPromoting an environment where our employees can manage their own growth and development is a priority for Iberdrola. To this end, in 2022 we continued to work globally to support our future leaders in their development journey, as well as our established leaders, with multiple initiatives that seek to offer opportunities to develop their skills. These are some of the global talent initiatives: IB Talent Talks, conversations between established company leaders and high-potential employees in the early stages of their careers. Leader for a Day Training: a work day in which a high-potential employee shadows an experienced executive to experience situations that facilitate learning and the development of leadership skills. Global Talent Mentoring Program, described below, is a mentoring programme aimed at high-potential professionals. Leadership Academy: we offer our professionals access to specific leadership development resources in partnership with Coursera. Finally, the Experts Academy is aimed at very experienced specialist employees, with knowledge groups in 3 strategic areas: Cybersecurity, Smart Grids, and Smart Solutions.\nMentoring Programmes\n\nMentoring programmes \u2014 which involve pairing up an employee with a long professional career or specific knowledge and a less experienced employee or an employee who needs to broaden their knowledge in a specific area \u2014 facilitate the ongoing training of employees, strengthen a collaborative culture, and promote the exchange of ideas and knowledge.\n\nThe following initiatives were carried out across the group:\n\nThe second global Digital Mentoring programme was completed in May 2022. This initiative seeks to contribute to the digital transformation process at Iberdrola by connecting employees who need support in innovation and digital transformation projects with others who have previous experience in these areas. In this second year, more than 2,500 hours were dedicated to the programme, with a participant satisfaction rating of 4.9 out of 5.\n\nThe initiative also contributes to the company\u2019s inclusion strategy by connecting employees of different generations, genders and cultures. In this second year, 44% of the 94 pairs were from different countries, and 47% from different generations. Because of its success and popularity, the programme has been strengthened within the development offering, and was held for the third time in October 2022.\n\nTwo new global mentoring initiatives were also added in 2022:\n\n- **Women in leadership mentoring Program**: its purpose is to boost these women\u2019s careers, providing them with leadership role models, strengthening their networking, and contributing to their preparation to take on greater professional challenges. It was launched as a pilot programme with 14 pairs, connecting high-potential female workers with executives in senior positions across the Group. User satisfaction was 4.9 out of 5.\n\n- **Global Talent Mentoring program**: with a similar goal as the previous programme, targeting high-potential employees, and it also seeks to speed up their development by providing them with training and leadership role models. 26 pairs took part, spending more than 560 hours in the sessions.\n\nBoth through local and global initiatives, skills have been developed relating to the strategic needs of the business, including: new technologies, knowledge management, transformative leadership, change management, resilience, and diversity and inclusion.\n\nProgrammes to support transition\n\nAt the Iberdrola group, we are committed to our professionals throughout their careers, and in those cases in which a career transition is necessary, we provide programmes to support transition, to facilitate continued employability as well as career-end management.\n\nIn Spain, qualification plans are carried out on a planned basis, both in terms of training and of methodologies, anticipating new production and/or environmental needs (greater digitisation, green jobs, etc.) This allows workers to have the knowledge to remain at excellent levels of internal employability.\n\nBoth in the United States and in the United Kingdom, outplacement services are offered through a partner company that assists employees to identify and prepare their next professional move. It is a tailor-made service that adapts to the employee\u2019s specific needs to benefit as much as possible from opportunities for employment.\n\nIberdrola Energ\u00eda Internacional has developed a transition and support programme, comprising a set of techniques worked on together with the employee in three fundamental aspects: improving the employability of their profile through training; defining a job search strategy; and assistance in an enterprise of self-employment, should the employee so desire.\nProgrammes for skills management and lifelong learning\n\n\u25a0 GRI 404-2\n\nThe Iberdrola group is convinced that professional development helps the company achieve its results and makes the organisation more efficient, by equipping employees with the skills and competencies they need to perform their work efficiently today, while preparing them to undertake greater responsibilities and challenges down the line.\n\nAll of Iberdrola's training and development activities are based on the 70% experience / 20% relationships / 10% training learning model.\n\n- Iberdrola has various programmes aimed at high-potential professionals, including the MBA in the Global Energy Industry, which is offered by Comillas Pontifical University in Madrid and Strathclyde University Business School in Glasgow. This is a global programme that lasts two and a half years, in which professionals from Spain, the United States, the United Kingdom, Brazil and Mexico, and other locations take part. In 2022, this programme was carried out for the fifth time, and more than 130 employees have been trained since it launched in 2017.\n\n- Iberdrola has an extensive training and development catalogue for professionals pursuing a career in management. In 2022, the latest global programme was held in partnership with IMD, in an online format, intended for professionals with technical degrees, in order to provide them with the required behavioural skills and techniques. Leading employees on various topics were also identified to share their knowledge with the rest of employees through various internal channels.\n\n- Iberdrola offers its technical specialists, middle managers and some of its executives a global development model based on the group's Behavioural Principles Model, which makes it possible to specify individual development plans based on areas for improvement and opportunities for growth.\n\nSpecific training for executives\n\nFor its management team, Iberdrola has for years been carrying out a number of development programmes in partnership with the best internationally recognised schools and institutions:\n\n- Energising Leadership Programme, an advanced management programme offered by ESADE Business School.\n\n- NEXUS, in collaboration with IMD, which offers training resources such as round-table discussions for C-level executives from around the world, and the \u201cFirst 90 Days\u201d programme, which seeks above all to support employees who take on critical management positions during the change phase.\n\n- The offering of regular digital Masterclasses and lectures was broadened for the entire global management team in 2022. The classes were taught online by globally recognised experts discussing strategic and current topics, with the participation of approximately 1000 professionals.\n\nA major evaluation and update of the programme catalogue was carried out in order to keep them in line with the company\u2019s strategic needs and the state of the art.\n\n2022 saw the first School of Leadership Alumni Event (SOLAE) - a meeting of alumni employees who took part in Global Leadership School Programmes. This event was a great opportunity to share learning, strengthen ties, and convey the Company\u2019s strategic priorities and vision for the future.\nAt the local level, training initiatives for executives have also been adapted in many cases to the online format.\n\n- In Spain programmes such as Leadership in change processes and Strategic people and team leadership were offered. The Lead your Personal Effectiveness and Leader Communication programmes also continue. As a result of the 2021 evaluation, several programmes targeting managers were offered in 2022, focusing on the key areas identified.\n- In the United Kingdom there is a continuation of the Advanced Leadership: Leaders of Leaders and the Leadership Mastery Programme: New Senior Leaders, designed on the basis of the needs identified in the organisation, as well as the Introduction to Management programme for team leaders, and the Connected Leaders Community initiative.\n- In the United States, there are several training programmes for the management team, such as the Purpose-Driven Leaders programme, in partnership with Yale University, the Leadership Essentials programme for new team leaders, and the Advanced Management People: Leading People programme. All reinforced by the AVANGRID Mentoring programme.\n- Brazil has expanded its Lidera for the various executive levels with Lidera Gerentes and Lidera superintendentes, following the results of the recent evaluation. The new format is provided by the renowned Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Dom Cabral, which implements innovative training methodologies through its international teachers.\n- Mexico has the ADN del l\u00edder programme for the entire management team, including an executive version for senior management. Negotiation workshops were also offered to the management team.\n\n### GRI 404-1\n\n#### Hours of training by professional category and gender\n\n| Hours of training | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|-------------------|------|------|------|\n|                   | Men  | Women| Men  | Women| Men  | Women|\n| Leadership        | 62,387 | 26,979 | 85,078 | 31,054 | 77,415 | 30,563 |\n| Qualified technicians | 444,229 | 223,312 | 440,433 | 207,835 | 352,221 | 171,403 |\n| Skilled workers and support personnel | 1,730,249 | 244,663 | 1,449,663 | 183,248 | 1,178,017 | 160,035 |\n| **Total**         | 2,236,865 | 494,955 | 1,975,175 | 422,140 | 1,607,653 | 362,000 |\n| **Average hours of training by average personnel** | 32.2 | 35.3 | 41.5 | 39.1 | 38.9 | 39.8 |\n| Leadership        | 43.4 | 41.5 | 46.0 | 42.6 | 38.8 | 38.0 |\n| Qualified technicians | 93.0 | 74.1 | 80.9 | 56.5 | 71.8 | 51.3 |\n| Skilled workers and support personnel | 72.7 | 52.4 | 66.8 | 47.3 | 58.5 | 43.1 |\n\nThe specific training varies according to the diverse professional profiles of the staff, not according to gender.\n\nThe high numbers of training hours received by skilled workers and support personnel, 85% of whom are men, explains the difference in average hours between men and women.\n\n---\n\n62 This table represents individuals who identify as men or women, so the figures segmented by gender may not coincide with the total because of people who identify as another gender or who choose not to disclose this information.\n\n63 Data recalculated with respect to the figures published in 2020 and 2021, based on the standard of average personnel.\nEmployees receiving performance and career development reviews\n\n\u25a0 GRI 404-3\n\nAs indicated in Iberdrola\u2019s People Management Policy, employee performance evaluations, and communication of the results to the employees evaluated, are considered essential aspects for their professional development. Some of the basic principles of conduct relating to this aspect and described in the policy are:\n\n- Perform regular evaluations of the performance of the professionals of the Group\u2019s companies based on objective standards.\n- Communicate the results thereof to the employees evaluated, so as to favour their professional development, contributing to the creation of a feedback culture.\n\nAt the Iberdrola group, employees are included in formal performance review processes, which vary based on professional category and level of responsibility, as well as the country in which the employees are located.\n\nEmployees can be reviewed through two types of processes, according to professional category and the level of responsibility relating to their position.\n\nLeadership\n\n- Goals review (\u201cWhat\u201d): measurable, quantifiable and specific goals to be achieved over the course of the review period, relating to the goals of the Company.\n- Performance review (\u201cHow\u201d): review of conduct during achievement of the goals, which must be aligned with the Iberdrola group\u2019s mission and purpose.\n\nQualified technicians, skilled workers and support personnel\n\n- Performance review (\u201cHow\u201d): employees are reviewed on the basis of a number of personal competencies, which must be aligned with the Iberdrola group\u2019s mission and purpose.\n\nThese processes are based on a corporate tool that allows management of the Human Resources processes relating to the review. In this way, all users involved in these processes (employee, evaluator and Human Resources team) can work globally in real time. Furthermore, the main advantage of this tool is that it makes it possible to standardise and unify the focus and the applicable guidelines and criteria.\n\n| Employees with performance reviews (%) | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|----------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Men (%)                                |      |      |      |\n| Leadership                             | 94.4 | 93.7 | 93.5 |\n| Qualified technicians                   | 84.9 | 86.7 | 90.0 |\n| Skilled workers and support personnel   | 73.5 | 65.5 | 70.0 |\n| Average men                            | 78.6 | 74.2 | 78.0 |\n| Women (%)                              |      |      |      |\n| Leadership                             | 93.3 | 95.0 | 94.7 |\n| Qualified technicians                   | 83.6 | 85.9 | 89.8 |\n| Skilled workers and support personnel   | 60.0 | 59.6 | 67.0 |\n| Average women                          | 76.3 | 77.3 | 81.6 |\n| Average Iberdrola                      | 78.0 | 74.9 | 78.8 |\n\nEmployees hired in the last quarter of the year are not eligible for the performance evaluation for that year.\nIII.4. Quality and safety for our customers through innovation and digitalisation\n\n- Innovation and digital transformation projects\n- Our commitment to our customers\n- Competition\n- Cybersecurity and information privacy\nInnovation and digital transformation projects\n\nToday Iberdrola is the utility company of the future thanks to its ongoing commitment to innovation, as shown by the fact that it has been recognised as the private utility company that invests the most in R&D worldwide, according to the European Commission\u2019s ranking.\n\nIberdrola invested a total of 363 million euros in R&D in 2022, a 7% increase over 2021. The R&D efforts within the Iberdrola group are organised around five main pillars, which in turn are aligned with the fundamental vectors of transformation of the energy industry, decarbonisation of generation, promoting the use of smart grids and the electrification of demand:\n\n- **Disruptive technologies** that are increasingly efficient, sustainable and environmentally friendly, enabling optimisation of facilities and processes. Green hydrogen, innovative renewable energy, sustainable mobility, energy storage, smart grids, the electrification of heat, and the recycling of clean technology components will contribute to industrial transformation, with a focus on sustainability, green and affordable energy, and employment.\n- **New products and competitive services** that meet customers\u2019 needs, with more personalised content and offerings.\n- **Digitisation and automation in all businesses and processes**, with the introduction of new technologies such as blockchain, big data, the Internet of Things, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, etc.\n- **Innovation with start-ups, entrepreneurs and suppliers**, intended to develop partnerships and new, disruptive business models, encourage the exchange of knowledge, and act as a driving force among its partners.\n- **A culture of innovation and talent**. Iberdrola promotes a culture of innovation through the transfer of knowledge, the attraction of talent and the encouragement of the entrepreneurial spirit. The Universities Programme, Iberdrola U, involves the development of various initiatives with academia, such as endowed chairs, R&D projects, student training, in-house training and young entrepreneurs.\n\nThis year\u2019s highlights include the **inauguration of the largest green hydrogen plant for industrial use in Europe**, located in Puertollano, with an electrolyser capable of producing 3,000 tonnes of renewable H2 per year. This pioneering plant will generate 100% green hydrogen with zero CO2 emissions thanks to the use of 100% renewable sources. In addition, the first **Innovation Week** was held at the Global Smart Grid Innovation Hub, a week dedicated to analysing the role of electricity grids in the energy transition. All of these activities are included in the new **Iberdrola Innovation Report 2020-2022**, along with other significant R&D initiatives and projects carried out in recent years.\n\nSome of the innovative initiatives are set out below, classified by major category:\nRenewable energy\n\nImproved efficiency at wind farms, photovoltaic plants and hydroelectric facilities.\n\nThere has been continued development of Big Data techniques for the MeteoFlow Forecasting System to obtain weather forecasts. Along these lines, there has also been continued development of tools like CHiNOOK to account for climate variability, including solar variability, and Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF), optimising their performance. The implementation of WRF-Hydro for hydrological forecasting has also been optimised. There has also been progress in calculating theoretical solar and wind production capacity in the ENERPREDIC project. In the operations area, there has been work on developing new solutions to improve the efficiency of the tools of the DOMINA system. As regards wind power, the RECURSO project has devised a methodology for the hybridisation of wind farms \u2014 both those operational and under development \u2014 with photovoltaic power. With regard to solar power, progress has been made in analysing the variability of the horizontal resource using ground stations, incorporating the spatial variability of solar radiation. Also noteworthy of mention is the company\u2019s participation in Next Generation Earth Modelling Systems (NEXT GEMS), which explores these lines of work in depth by applying high-performance computing (HPC) and Earth-system Models. In the area of maintenance, work continues on the ASPA system, an artificial intelligence methodology that allows the theoretical behaviour of the wind turbine to be simulated at all times through a digital model. Lastly, the AEROEXTENS and DIAGNOSGRE projects provide new knowledge on the behaviour of wind turbines in terms of machine control strategies. As regards grid integration, the THIRTIES project aims to optimise decentralised voltage control and a system of joint participation at the point where services are provided. In addition, storage solutions have been studied in the ALMACENLAD battery project. Also noteworthy of mention is the study on the possibility of installing floating photovoltaic sites on hydroelectric power plant reservoirs. This work has been brought together in the HIBRIDAR project.\n\nImprovements in the field of circular economy\n\nDuring 2022 there was analysis of the needs for future capacity, the best location and the best technologies to make it possible, including reversible variable-speed turbines and lower-cost penstocks (NEWPUMPING project). These improvements, together with the digitalisation of management and hybridisation, will improve the management of all renewable generation. In this regard, two projects stand out \u2014 HYDROSMART and HYDRODEMAND \u2014, which supplement the development of these lines of work. The other two projects related to pumped capacity that have been launched are HYDROSES and AVANHID.\n\nImprovement in innovation in offshore wind farm projects\n\nThe ROMEO and FLAGSHIP projects are still underway, and MEGAWIND, a project focusing on methods for welding joints on foundations, has been launched. With regard to floating offshore wind power, the MARINFLOAT project, which aims to implement a portfolio of projects in Spain, has continued to carry out bird and marine mammal studies, environmental impact studies, metoceanic studies and theoretical studies of the terrain.\n\nImprovement in new lines of work\n\nResearch has been carried out into new technologies for the recycling and recovery of wind turbine blade waste; in agrovoltaics, which is based on the combination of renewable energy with agricultural and livestock energy; new developments in photovoltaic solar power generation have been analysed to optimise the use of solar resources in the NUEVASOLAR project, through new solar panel technologies, dry cleaning methods for panels and new more efficient structures; the ECOSIF project was launched to study the metal structures that support the panels to find the best solutions depending on the type of soil.\n\nIn relation to promoting a culture of innovation, the YO SOY INNOVADOR and the Renewables Digital Evolution Plan (2018-2022) initiatives launched in previous years have continued.\nClean generation technologies\n\nEfforts in the generation area focused on digitalisation, operational flexibility and efficiency, reduction of environmental impact, and improved safety at the facilities during 2022:\n\nIn the field of nuclear power, work continues on integrating digital tools and processes that contribute to maintaining the high levels of safety, reliability and efficiency of the power plants in a clear commitment to digital transformation. In this regard, the COATI project was launched for the development of software to enable the implementation of specific loading plans for spent fuel elements, which caught the interest of potential users. In addition, 3D models are being used to simulate critical processes such as container loading, along with the use of augmented reality and virtual reality. Licensing for the new fuel also continues, and various tasks are being carried out in relation to its validation process and use at the Cofrentes nuclear power plant.\n\nIn the field of thermal generation, the company continues to develop the lines of work established and to expand on the digital transformation of the power plants to adapt them to the new operating scenarios with low pollutant emissions, and to the growing demands for efficiency, flexibility and speed of response. Within the framework of emissions reduction, the pioneering REDEMIS project was successfully completed and achieved exceptional results in reducing start-up times and CO2, NOx and CO emissions. Work was also completed on the SIRO project, which involved technological development based on artificial intelligence and other digital technologies, and aimed to develop and validate a robotic inspection system for generators. Progress also continued on the FLAGSHIP project, which aims to develop advanced simulation and optimisation tools for operating combined cycle power plants, creating digital twins of the facilities that allow actual simulations of off-design scenarios.\n\nIn the area of energy management, the aim is to bring greater flexibility to the electricity system. With this objective in mind, a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) was created to provide services as an aggregator of distributed energy resources \u2014 for both generation and consumption \u2014 that can be managed from our control system to then be managed in the electricity market. Work also continued on the Flexener Project, where new technologies are being researched in the areas of generation, storage and even demand for the integration of a 100% renewable, flexible and robust electricity system. New voltage control strategies for transmission grids are being developed to find a solution to the technical challenges of voltage control with renewable generation. The company also continues to participate in European projects such as Posytyf, which analyses from a theoretical approach the contribution of renewable technologies to providing services for balancing and controlling voltage through Virtual Power Plants. It also collaborates in the BeFlexible project, which aims to design an ecosystem that not only provides the technology and helps to increase participation in flexibility markets, but also facilitates appropriate coordination between all players involved in providing services to the distributor, with a special focus on the consumer. Green hydrogen is also being promoted and applications are being developed, for example in the FEDECOM project, to enable the smart integration of electrolysers into the system to help build and manage an increasingly complex renewable energy mix.\nRetail - New projects and services\n\nInnovation is essential in retail activities, in order to offer customers the products and services best suited to their needs, which rapidly evolve. Thus, in 2022 Iberdrola worked on:\n\nNew initiatives to improve customers\u2019 experience:\n\nWork continued on new functionalities integrated into the Iberdrola Customer Apps. The alerts and personalised consumption notifications have therefore been updated, and tips have been included to help our customers save money and allow them to move towards more sustainable consumption patterns. All of this is done using data analytics and predictive models. At the level of self-consumption facilities, the entire process can be traced so that customers understand their situation at all times. In addition, integration with the Consumption Monitor has evolved to provide more real-time information. Lastly, there was the launch of the Solar Communities solution, which is a fully digital format from the moment it is contracted.\n\nNew products and functionalities:\n\n- In relation to the distributed generation solution for self-consumption, known as Smart Solar, the Solar Cloud service was incorporated, where residential customers can use their surplus energy to reduce the bills of other points of supply owned by the same customer. In turn, this service allows energy surpluses to be carried over to other months where they can be offset against the bill for the residence. It also allows for incorporating a storage system. The first Smart Solar communities have also been enabled, through which neighbouring customers receive 100% renewable energy and savings on their bills. Iberdrola also created a Solar Communities website so that customers can contract this service online.\n\n- With regard to Smart Home, the Advanced Smart Assistant was developed, which is a comprehensive energy management system based on AI that is capable of autonomously managing all Smart Solutions that customers have in their homes. This generates added value on each of the solutions, and savings on the customer\u2019s bill, both through the optimisation carried out by the assistant itself, and through personalised messages and recommendations that the user will receive.\n\n- Smart Mobility most notably includes the boost given to the deployment of high-power stations in the public charging network that will facilitate intercity travel in electric vehicles, enabling vehicles to charge more than 200 km in 5 minutes. In addition, the launch of the global charging point management system, or EVA Platform, will provide technological support for the deployment of charging points that Iberdrola intends to undertake in the countries in which it operates. In the last year, the company led a project to develop the first Mediterranean Corridor for heavy road transport that is 100% electric. In the field of micro-mobility, the electrification of transport in urban areas also involves promoting Personal Mobility Vehicles (PMVs) such as bicycles, scooters or electric motorbikes. Iberdrola has also promoted the Net-Zero MAR Alliance, a non-profit collaborative platform that aims to \u201caccelerate\u201d the decarbonisation and electrification of the maritime sector in Spain. The company also collaborates on proposals with municipal councils and urban developers, proposing solutions that have an impact on citizens.\n\n- Smart Clima is committed to the refurbishment and energy efficiency of buildings, providing solutions for energy savings and the decarbonisation of both single-family homes and buildings. The proposal consists of a final turnkey product that combines different solutions: efficient electrical air conditioning and heating with heat pumps, steps taken towards the thermal insulation of the house (fa\u00e7ades, roofs, windows), energy supply and optimal maintenance of equipment. It is therefore able to provide customers with simplicity, quality and ways to cut costs.\n\u2022 The aim of the Industrial Decarbonisation team is to completely electrify and decarbonise production processes in the industrial sector. The most important technologies to be able to carry out this electrification include heat pumps, electric boilers and thermal storage. This has led to the launch of projects like that of the AN Group, which consists of implementing an industrial heat pump at the Vicolozano factory. Iberdrola is also promoting the development and implementation of heating and cooling networks in Spain with the aim of decarbonising heating, cooling and hot water systems in cities using renewable energy sources.\n\nSmart grids\n\nIn 2022 i-DE Smart Grids augmented the strategic Global Smart Grids Innovation Hub (GSGIH) project, a pioneering centre and global leader in smart grid innovation. The GSGIH closed the year with more than 90 partners, and a dynamic organisation based on multidisciplinary working groups in which an open, transparent and streamlined innovation model is developed with the industrial innovation ecosystem. The GSGIH ended the year with the launch of a new laboratory, the Innovation Data Space (IDS), to promote artificial intelligence and advanced data analytics. The centre hosted its first Innovation Week, a week dedicated to analysing the role of electricity grids in the energy transition, which brought together young talent, partnering companies, universities and institutions. The GSGIH also had a presence at ENLIT and in various media and social networks, communicating the importance of innovation in electricity grids to society.\n\nIn general, work is carried out in accordance with the New Low Voltage Grid model, enhancing the digitalisation of the grid with various projects such as installing the firmware of the new smart CN with high added value functionalities and providing the smart transmission centre with advanced sensors, which enables anomalies to be detected, and faults and incidents to be anticipated; as regard the active operation of the LV grid, the most notable projects include the eLVIS project, a low-voltage control system, the management of incidents through mobility applications, and the Technical Supply Management project, which provides new grid calculation and simulation capabilities.\n\nAt the European level, the BeFlexible project was launched, the main objective of which is to increase the participation of prosumers in order to increase the flexibility of the electricity system. Work continued on the ONENET project, which focuses on developing new customer-centric flexibility tools, with an open, streamlined architecture based on the concept of an interoperable network of platforms with coordinated operation. There was also the successful completion of the COORDINET project, which involved companies and institutions from ten countries to provide a favourable framework to facilitate the participation of all agents. Work continued on the FLEXENER project, the main objective of which is to research new simulation technologies and models in the areas of renewable generation, storage systems, flexible demand management and operation of the distribution network. In the field of network integration, work on the second phase of the Caravaca BESS project continued. There was completion of the FLEXIPOWER project, with the goal of achieving the integration of various battery energy storage systems (BESS) in operation, as an alternative to reinforce the weak areas of the grid with photovoltaic generation. Progress has also been made in the DSO-DTR project, with the completion of the first pilot programmes and the launch of a project to improve line sensor technology, which gives information on the actual capacity at any given time depending on meteorological variables and network operation.\n\nIn Spain, work continues on the new smart substation, through the development of a comprehensive substation control system in accordance with international standards, thus achieving a sustainable facility. In the field of cybersecurity, the TrueValSec project was completed in 2022 with the aim of designing the security mechanisms used at the different levels of communication in the electric metering infrastructure of Smart Cities. The SEC2GRID project was also approved to\ndevelop new smart electronic devices for an electricity distribution grid that is more secure against cyber-attacks. Progress was made on the project for the digital substation model so as to improve efficiency through the automation of monitoring and remote operation. This project includes developing the cloud platform for managing and viewing the new sensors distributed throughout the grid through easily integrated IoT protocols. The scope of the new processes associated with the STAR+ project continue to be expanded, and LV incidents are detected and diagnosed without needing to receive a call from the customer, thus resolving the incident in less time through smart diagnostics.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, various projects in the digital and data management area should be noted, such as Digi-GIFT, which looks at developing an interoperable data exchange platform; Predict4Resilience, which aims to develop actionable forecasts of extreme weather events weeks in advance; and TWINe, which looks at deploying a digital twin of the entire network. In the field of heating, the Flexible Heat project will maximise the flexibility of domestic heating to reduce and smooth peak demand, and the Heat Balance project will assess different thermal storage solutions that can be part of heating networks. Projects are also being developed to electrify rail transport and transform railway stations into connected multi-energy centres.\n\nIn Brazil, grid innovation aims to transform the customer experience, providing efficient and personalised digital channels, contributing to the expansion of smart grids, and supplying electricity efficiently, sustainably and economically. Work is being carried out in areas such as security, improving the automation of grid maintenance, modernisation of information infrastructure, standardisation of processes, preservation of network assets, and increased reliability and control, etc. Noteworthy is the GODEL project, the aim of which is to identify and reduce technical and commercial losses, and the Digital Connection project, which focuses on transforming the customer experience through smart solutions such as the Remote Virtual Assistant (RVA).\n\nIn the United States, there is continue implementation of smart technologies like smart meters (AMI), automating substations and circuits, and implementing advanced distribution management systems (ADMS) and distributed energy resource management systems (DERMS). All this allows control of operations in real time and improves grid reliability.\n\nIberdrola Innovation Middle East, Iberdrola\u2019s technology hub in Qatar, is developing various initiatives such as developing devices for real-time thermal monitoring of the grid and predicting faults or analysing the grid\u2019s capacity to accommodate distributed energy resources. In addition, work is being carried out on designing an Adaptive, Smart Building Energy Management System, and the application of a cyber-secure transactional energy framework to design, operate and manage smart and connected communities.\n\nGreen Hydrogen\n\nIberdrola has made progress in consolidating the use of Green Hydrogen to decarbonise other sectors (industry, transportation, et.).\n\nThe IPCEI seal was obtained during the year for the construction of the next phases of the Puertollano I, Puertollano II, Palos de la Frontera I and Palos de la Frontera II hydrogen projects. The Puertollano I Project (20MW electrolyser) will generate 1,200 tonnes of green hydrogen to be incorporated within ammonia generation processes. In addition, with regard to the decarbonisation of mobility, the first phase of the new Barcelona hydrogen plant has begun commercial operation, making it possible to supply hydrogen to 24 TMB buses.\nAt the national level, two industrial research projects are being led: the **ATMOSPHERE** project, which aims to develop new technologies for storage, generation and safety in green hydrogen plants, and the **AVOGADRO** project, which aims to develop an advanced hydrogen refuelling system for mobility applications. At the international level, there was a decision to participate in the **FEDECOM** project, which will develop tools for optimising the Puertollano and TMB plants, in the **AMBHER** project, which will work on MOF storage systems and ammonia synthesis, and in the **HYLICAL** project, which will work on new hydrogen liquefaction technologies.\n\nLastly, construction began on the **1.25 MW green hydrogen plant for IFF in Benicarl\u00f3**, where all grey hydrogen will be replaced by green hydrogen currently used in manufacturing perfumes.\n\n**Iberdrola Ventures - Perseo**\n\nIberdrola Ventures - PERSEO is the start-up programme created by Iberdrola in 2008 with \u20ac200 million in funding in order to encourage the development of a dynamic ecosystem of start-ups and entrepreneurship in the energy sector. The programme focuses on new technologies and business models that allow for improvements to the sustainability of the energy model through greater electrification and decarbonisation of the economy.\n\nSince its creation, the programme has channelled investments of more than **\u20ac125 million in start-ups in the energy sector worldwide**. Its base of more than 36 million consumers and more than 60 GW of installed capacity have allowed Iberdrola to provide the start-ups with a sizable \u201creal-life laboratory\u201d that is aiding the technological and commercial development of the companies. The major achievements in 2022 include:\n\n- **Pilot projects**: In 2022 there were more than 25 pilot projects with start-ups in technological areas like IoT, robotics and batteries, as well as in areas like network construction and maintenance, hybridisation of land use (agrovoltaics), electric mobility, and energy efficiency.\n- **Challenges**: In 2022 Iberdrola brought 10 challenges to the start-up community in areas like renewable generation, onshore and offshore wind energy and photovoltaic energy; energy efficiency and decarbonisation in sectors like data centres, agriculture, and farming; and operation and maintenance of power grids and their protection against natural disasters.\n- **Investment**: There was the launch of a new \u20ac300 million Venture Capital Fund, Seaya Andr\u00f3meda Sustainable Tech Fund I FCR, in partnership with other investors, to invest in European technological scale-ups related to sustainability, the energy transition, and the electrification of the economy.\n- **\u201cVenture Builder\u201d**: Perseo continued the initiative launched in 2020 for investing in and creating (from scratch) electrification and the circular economy businesses \u2014 in areas such as the recycling of photovoltaic modules, wind-turbine blades and batteries \u2014 and in sectors resistant to decarbonisation, such as industrial heat production and heavy transport. The initiative has led to the organisation of the companies **C2Nature**, a platform to generate CO2 credits through the promotion of highest-quality projects, and **EnergyLoop**, a company created with FCC to lead the recycling of renewable facility parts, with the initial goal of recovering wind turbine blade parts.\n\nPerseo also invested in **Basquevolt**, an initiative launched in 2022 to start a leading solid-state battery production line in Europe.\n\nMore information about the R&D&i projects in which the Iberdrola group is participating can be found in the **Innovation** in our business section of the corporate website.\nOur commitment to our customers\n\nSupply quality\n\n\u25a0 GRI EU 28 \u25a0 SASB IF-EU-550a.2\n\nQuality of service and its ongoing improvement is one of the fundamental goals of Iberdrola\u2019s activity. A quality-evaluation system and the implementation of rigorous internal and external processes enables the achievement of objectives linked to this ongoing improvement. Moreover, all the distribution companies have regulatory incentives or penalties linked to improvement in the quality of supply. By the end of 2022, the Group\u2019s Networks business improved its supply quality levels (compared to 2021) in all the countries in which it is present.\n\nIberdrola monitors the quality of the service provided in the various countries, measuring it on the basis of the frequency and duration of interruptions in supply. However, the measurements in each country are made according to different standards following the respective legal or regulatory requirements.\n\nIndicators used to measure the frequency of interruptions in supply\n\n| Indicators of frequency of interruptions | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|-----------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Spain 64 NIEPI                          | < 0.9| < 0.9| 1    |\n| United Kingdom CI                       | 32.4 | 37.3 | 36.6 |\n| United States SAIFI                     | 1.3  | 1.4  | 1.4  |\n| Brazil FEC                              | 4.6  | 5.1  | 5.1  |\n\n- The Installed Capacity Equivalent Interrupt Number (N\u00famero de interrupciones equivalentes de la potencia instalada) (NIEPI) is used in Spain.

The most significant studies by country are:\n\nIn Spain, in the Electricity Production and Customers Business, there are various indicators for measuring users\u2019 satisfaction level, including the Detailed Satisfaction Study. Once a year, it measures overall satisfaction with the service received by the customer and offers detailed information about attributes such as agility, training, and handling of channels, clarity of the invoice, claims management, quality of supply, price competitiveness and electronic billing, whether for large customers, companies, small businesses or residential customers. In 2022, for the eighth consecutive year, overall satisfaction exceeded a score of 7 out of 10.\n\n---\n\n65 Quality data for Spain (NIEPI and TIEPI) include commercially sensitive information.\n66 The value reported for 2021 does not exclude specific exceptional events (force majeure), as, at the closing date for this Report, the data had not been officially confirmed by the regulator.\nThe company also has a **Voice of the Customer Measurement Programme**, which allows satisfaction surveys to be performed in a transactional manner (immediately following an interaction) at various key times in the customer relationship, while also analysing unstructured information through the use of text analytics and machine learning. All of the foregoing enables more agile detection of customers\u2019 opinions and the prioritisation and implementation of improvements. This programme measures and analyses factors in the following principal areas:\n\n- Attention to the Telephone Channel\n- Attention to the Customer Service Points\n- Attention to the Digital Channels (Web/App)\n- Use of products and services\n\nMost of the studies use the NPS (Net Promoter Score) index, which ranks the recommendations made by Iberdrola\u2019s customers. This index highlights points received for customer service and the use of products and services.\n\nRegarding the Networks Business, calls are made periodically to customers who have contacted the company, giving them the opportunity to complete a satisfaction survey about the service that was provided. These results are used for the Customer Satisfaction Index and to detect and resolve problems with the service.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, customer satisfaction is measured by a number of internal and external studies conducted by the Customer Insight department. These analyses include various satisfaction surveys that vary in frequency from monthly to annually.\n\nAt the external level, the key comparative studies measuring the satisfaction of ScottishPower\u2019s customers as compared to its competitors\u2019 customers are Uswitch, Which? (with annual surveys) and the UK-CSI study, which is published twice per year. These studies analyse specific areas, such as customer billing, campaign follow-up and complaints. ScottishPower received an overall customer-satisfaction rating of 60.7% in the Uswitch survey, improving in the categories of renewable services, energy efficiency, mobile apps and the installation of smart meters. In *Which?* it received a score of 55 out of 100. In UK-CSI, its satisfaction indicator was 66.5 out of 100.\n\nThe most significant internal analysis is *Pulse*, which is performed monthly and measures confidence, loyalty, ease of use, value, etc. Based on this analysis, measures are being implemented to improve the handling of customer complaints. Several thousand customers also participate in the TalkEnergy panel, which gathers information on important topics and prepares action plans.\n\nIn the regulated business, the scores reported in the Broad Measure of Customer Satisfaction (BMCS) study conducted by Ofgem (the British electricity market regulator) were used as an indicator to set the regulatory incentive. The index is calculated on the basis of a survey that covers all customers who requested customer service, and takes into consideration various aspects of the service that the customers received. The scores received by the distributors SP Manweb, SP Distribution and SP Transmission in 2022 were 9.18, 9.09 and 8.26 out of 10, respectively.\n\nIn the United States, the subsidiaries of AVANGRID measure perception of the service and customer satisfaction through telephone surveys. In 2022 the AVANGRID companies obtained an overall score of: RG&E 80.4%; NYSEG 84.7%; CMP 87%; UI 89%; CNG 88%; SCG 89%; and BGC 93%.\nIn Brazil, the Brazilian Association of Electric Power Distributors (Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Distribuidores de Energia El\u00e9trica - ABRADEE) carries out a satisfaction study known as the Perceived Service Quality Satisfaction Index (ISQP) based on an evaluation of performance in the following areas: operational excellence, economic/financial management, customer assessment, social responsibility and management quality. The ISQP is obtained through evaluations made by customers through the surveys administered by Instituto Innovare. Neoenergia received a score of 69.6% for overall satisfaction in 2022.\n\nThe ratio of complaints received in the main markets where the company operates is given below.\n\n| Complaints received | 2022 |\n|---------------------|------|\n| Spain               |      |\n| Liberalised market  | 1.73 |\n| Regulated market    | 1.37 |\n| United Kingdom      |      |\n| Liberalised market  | 6.10 |\n| Regulated market    | 0.17 |\n| United States       |      |\n| Regulated market    | 0.03 |\n| Brazil              |      |\n| Regulated market    | 1.30 |\n| Other countries     |      |\n| Liberalised market  | 3.00 |\n\nThe total number of complaints received in the Networks Business (regulated market) in 2022 was 375,105, and 683,581 in the Electricity Production and Customers Business (deregulated market). Average response times were 7.3 and 8.2 days respectively.\n\nIn the Networks business, complaints are resolved by the deadline established in the legislation in each country. There are also control mechanisms, such as quality audits and the strict reporting requirements established by regulatory entities.\n\nThe complaints resolution rate in the Electricity Production and Customers Business in 2022 was 89.1% in Spain, 88.9% in the United Kingdom, and 86.7% in the rest of Europe.\n\n**Responsible communication**\n\n**Marketing communications**\n\n- **GRI 417**\n\nIberdrola goes beyond regulatory compliance in its advertising and marketing communications, and adopts mechanisms and voluntary codes that ensure such communications are transparent and truthful. The *Code of Ethics* also applies in this area for all employees regardless of their area of responsibility.\n\nIberdrola not only complies with applicable advertising practices codes in all locations, but has also implemented internal approval procedures to ensure that all advertising material presented to society is in accordance with responsible advertising practices.\nGRI 417-3\n\nIncidents of non-compliance concerning marketing, advertising, promotion and sponsorship (No.)\n\n|                                | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|--------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Resulting in a fine           | 41   | 13   | 15   |\n| Resulting in a warning        | 0    | 0    | 0    |\n| Relating to voluntary codes   | 0    | 0    | 0    |\n| Total incidents               | 41   | 13   | 15   |\n\nThe 41 reported incidents took place in Spain, representing 0.01% of incoming claims, and were for the most part connected to administrative errors.\n\nInformation on and labelling of electricity sold\n\nGRI 417-1\n\nRegarding labelling, Iberdrola informs its customers about the sourcing of the energy placed on the market and its associated environmental impact, generally through its electricity bills and other commercial communications, and always abiding by assurance standards and the format required by the various national agencies (CNMC in Spain, Ofgem in the United Kingdom, ANEEL in Brazil, etc.).\n\nInformation on customer complaint mechanisms and communication channels is included in the \u201cStakeholder engagement\u201d section.\n\nThe table below shows the information and labelling incidents that took place in 2022.\n\nGRI 417-2\n\nInformation and labelling incidents (no.)\n\n|                                | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|--------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Resulting in a fine           | 1    | 3    | 0    |\n| Resulting in a warning        | 0    | 0    | 0    |\n| Relating to voluntary codes   | 0    | 0    | 0    |\n| Total violations              | 1    | 3    | 0    |\nHealth and safety of customers and of the general population\n\n\u25a0 GRI 416\n\nUsers\u2019 safety is of paramount importance to Iberdrola. For this reason, it makes information and training available to the various emergency services and law enforcement services in order to explain the conflicts that they may encounter during the performance of their work and how to act in situations involving electrical risks.\n\nAll stages of the life-cycles of electricity and gas (planning, production activities, transmission and distribution, marketing) are closely regulated because these products are essential to the country\u2019s economy and improve the quality of people\u2019s lives.\n\nAt all stages, alignment with each country\u2019s environmental and labour regulations is essential to minimise possible operational risks (operation of generation plants, electrical risks and risks associated with the handling of gas, etc.). In addition, in the planning and marketing stages, public participation (through social and political representatives) and communication with consumers are two other key factors for protecting public health and safety.\n\n\u25a0 GRI 416-1\n\nAll processes required for the supply of electricity and gas at all stages as described above ensure that these products arrive at the consumer with an appropriate level of assurance for their health and safety. The impact on health and safety of 100% of the significant product and service categories is assessed to improve them.\n\nThe following table lists incidents in terms of impacts of products and services on the health and safety of customers. There were 68 incidents leading to fines in 2022, all in the United States, due primarily to alleged violations of federal safety regulations for facilities. A non-monetary penalty was also imposed.\n\n\u25a0 GRI 416-2\n\n| Incidents stemming from non-compliance with regulations or voluntary codes regarding health and safety (No.) | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Resulting in a fine | 67 | 42 | 0 |\n| Resulting in a warning | 1 | 6 | 0 |\n| Relating to voluntary codes | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Total incidents | 68 | 48 | 0 |\nGRI EU25\n\nFurthermore, as described above, the construction, operation and maintenance of electric infrastructure involves certain risks, which may at times give rise to incidents affecting people outside of the company. In most of the cases detected, the incidents are related to third parties working without safety measures in the areas around the distribution facilities, as well as accidental contacts with the network.\n\nThe following table shows the accidents of this kind that occurred during 2022. Nine of these accidents (including one death) occurred in the United Kingdom; five in Spain (including three deaths); 13 in the United States (one death); and 112 (including 31 deaths) in Brazil. Year after year, significant work has continued in the areas of awareness-raising and training for the general public in order to reduce these numbers as much as possible.\n\n| Accidents involving persons not belonging to the company (No.) | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Accident victims                                              | 139  | 190  | 124  |\n| Fatalities                                                    | 36   | 48   | 39   |\n\nThe claims listed in the following table have been filed against companies of the group on these or other similar grounds not involving injuries and have given rise to legal proceedings in the respective jurisdictions. At year-end 2022, 26 legal proceedings had been resolved or were pending in Spain, 56 in the United States and 80 in Brazil.\n\n| Annual legal proceedings (No.) | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|--------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Resolved and pending, stemming from these accidents            | 162  | 234  | 212  |\n\nElectromagnetic fields\n\nHistorically, the possible influence of electrical and magnetic fields on human health has been the subject of a certain amount of public debate. However, the various studies performed in this regard have identified no detrimental effects on human health for the maximum emission figures established by applicable law. Iberdrola, following the precautionary principle, applies the rules in this regard and has shown itself willing to work with the public authorities in adopting such preventive or mitigating measures as may be deemed appropriate to avoid risks or harm to health.\n\nIn 2022 one complaint connected to electromagnetic fields (EMF) was received in Spain. It should be pointed out that electromagnetic field levels of facilities in Spain, be they transformation centres, lines, or power substations, are far below legal limits, which in turn were set, with an extremely wide safety margin, by the Recommendation of the Council of European Communities of 12 July 1999 (1999/519/CE), which was transposed in Spain by RD 1066/01 of 28 September, and was also ratified in Spain by the Ministry of Health and Consumption and by the Royal Academy of Exact, Physical, and Natural Science.\n\nThe values of the electric and magnetic fields generated by facilities are measured on a regular basis by means of two reports, which are audited by AENOR.\n\n67 The 2021 figures increased over the prior year as a result of the easing of restrictions on mobility relating to the pandemic.\nEducation on the safe use of electricity\n\nTo ensure consumers\u2019 health and safety, it is very important to inform them of and educate them on safety guidelines for using electricity.\n\nIberdrola thus uses the group\u2019s websites to provide recommendations and information to consumers on the safe use of electricity and gas, as well as guidelines to follow in case of an electrical accident. It also publishes informational booklets on the potential risks of electricity that affect its proper use and promotes informational and educational campaigns on safety measures and energy savings for the general public.\n\nDepending on the location and its level of exposure to adverse weather conditions or other external contingencies, Iberdrola also provides information and recommendations on actions to take in the event of an emergency.\n\nCompetition\n\n\u25a0 GRI 206\n\nAs provided in the Code of Ethics, the group undertakes to compete fairly in the market and not to engage in advertising that is misleading or denigrates its competitors or third parties.\n\nThe group also undertakes to obtain information from third parties in accordance with regulations, to promote free competition for the benefit of consumers and users and to encourage transparency and free market practices, as set out in the group\u2019s General Sustainable Development Policy.\n\nAt the country level, each of the country subholding companies endeavours to ensure strict compliance with legal provisions on separation of activities and, in many jurisdictions, the applicable internal regulation goes beyond what is required by law, significantly reinforcing measures to prevent any unfair competitive practices stemming from the lack of separation between liberalised and regulated businesses.\n\nThe liberalised head of business companies also have specific controls to avoid any type of anti-competitive practices, particularly in areas like advertising campaigns directed towards individuals and price manipulation.\n\nPending cases\n\n\u25a0 GRI 206-1\n\nNo case was recorded in 2022.\nCybersecurity and information privacy\n\nCompanies in the energy sector rely on a technological infrastructure, both physical and digital, to support their processes and operations. Growing reliance on technology, highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, can expose businesses to a range of risks, which, if exploited, could disrupt operations, harm assets, put people\u2019s safety at risk, undermine the organisation\u2019s ability to deliver reliable energy services, or expose the company to penalties or third-party liability.\n\nAs a leader in innovation and smart grids, Iberdrola attaches strategic importance to cyber-resilience, and in 2015, the Board of Directors approved a Cybersecurity Risk Policy, pledging to introduce the necessary measures for promoting a robust cybersecurity culture throughout the Group by encouraging the secure use of cyber-assets, and strengthening the capacity to detect, prevent, defend against, and respond to cyberattacks or cybersecurity threats.\n\nIts scope of application includes not only information and communications systems and technologies, but also the protection of industrial control systems and smart grids, whether operated by its own personnel or supported by third-party operations and services.\n\nThe Policy builds on a set of cybersecurity rules underpinned by the Global Cybersecurity Framework which, in turn, is further developed by the Global Incident Response Framework and the Global Assurance Framework and other cybersecurity regulations focused on the different aspects of cybersecurity threat.\n\nTo lead the deployment of the Policy throughout the Group, Iberdrola has appointed a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), who reports to senior management. The CISO is responsible for defining, leading and supervising the cybersecurity strategy throughout the Group, as are the CISOs of the various country subholding companies to ensure the implementation of the Policy in each country, taking into account the regulations and legislation applicable in their territory. The global CISO and the CISOs of each country subholding company regularly report to the audit and risk supervision committees of their respective boards of directors, which are tasked with supervising this risk.\n\nThe Iberdrola group\u2019s defined cybersecurity risk strategy and global framework are focused on integrating cybersecurity in all strategic and operational decisions of the company and on taking it into account beginning with the design of new projects and processes, and is supported by the following pillars:\n\n**Governance:** Iberdrola adopts a risk management approach to cybersecurity and uses the three lines of defence model to assign functions and responsibilities in managing cybersecurity risks, ensuring a coordinated approach and appropriate segregation of duties.\n\nThe Corporate Cybersecurity Risk Policy assigns responsibility for cybersecurity risk management to the businesses and corporate areas (first line of defence) and entrusts the CISO of Corporate Cybersecurity (second line of defence) with establishing the necessary governance, coordination and supervisory mechanisms to ensure adequate treatment of cybersecurity risks throughout the Group, taking into account the high interconnectivity of the networks and systems.\nIn this regard, Business Information Security Officers (BISOs) have been appointed in IT and in each business, and are responsible for establishing and rolling out the necessary action plans in their respective areas of competence. A Global Cybersecurity Committee has been established to ensure proper coordination and alignment.\n\n**Cybersecurity culture:** Iberdrola believes it is essential to promote a strong cybersecurity culture throughout the group, ensuring that all employees at all levels of the organisation have the training and knowledge necessary to minimise exposure to cybersecurity risks, including an understanding of risks and internal regulations and access to tools that allow for proper protection. The cybersecurity training programme covers the entire workforce, and includes annual training initiatives, simulated phishing campaigns and ad-hoc training for technical groups or those exposed to specific risks. The Board of Directors also receives specific cybersecurity training, which is also included in the orientation programme for new directors.\n\n**Risk management:** The company\u2019s various businesses and divisions define, implement and prioritise the necessary technical or organisational measures based on an analysis of cybersecurity risks in their respective areas of responsibility, focusing on systems that support critical infrastructure and essential services, personal data and other sensitive information, as well as other business-critical processes. To this end, there is a global risk methodology and a global framework of capabilities, supported by a governance, risk and compliance (GRC) system, which includes measures for controlling identities and access, the protection of communications, equipment and systems and the secure design and development of new projects, as well as the management of supply chain related cybersecurity threats. All of this is set out in multi-year cybersecurity master plans, specific to each Business and to IT, which are approved and supervised by the Cybersecurity Committee, and whose effectiveness is monitored through a global cybersecurity dashboard. Proactive threat and vulnerability scanning programmes are also in place, including mechanisms such as scheduled and regular vulnerability scanning activities, ad-hoc security reviews (penetration tests, Red Teams, etc.), system audits in the context of auditing financial statements, critical infrastructure or the General Data Protection Regulation, and the review of cybersecurity ratings through specialised market services, allowing potential risks to be anticipated. The cybersecurity measures extend to the protecting our customers, suppliers and other Stakeholders against possible risks of social engineering attacks that impersonate our brand.\n\n**Resilience:** With a view to minimising the impact on the business and on the continuity of essential services, Iberdrola has implemented technology (SIEMs/SOCs) and global and local cybersecurity incident response teams (CSIRTs), which operate 24x7 and act as a point of contact to ensure the successful detection and management of security threats, vulnerabilities and incidents. Iberdrola\u2019s global CSIRT is a member of the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST). Furthermore, operational continuity and recovery procedures for cybersecurity incidents are planned, deployed and tested in the different technological areas (IT/OT). The necessary coordination mechanisms at the global level are outlined in the Global Cybersecurity Incident Response and Crisis Management Framework, which is regularly tested by organising and participating in cyber exercises and crisis simulations. As a complementary measure, the Iberdrola Group has a global cyber-insurance programme to mitigate the financial risks of a possible incident or security breach.\nAssurance: As a listed company and operator of an essential service, the Iberdrola Group is subject to strict security regulations in the various countries in which it operates (GDPR, SOX, NIS, PIC, NERC, etc.) and undergoes regular external audits, which include the evaluation of cybersecurity controls on critical systems and assets covered by those regulations. Beside complying with externally imposed obligations, Iberdrola has deployed an enhanced assurance programme for critical systems and assets that support essential operational processes of its businesses at the global level, aimed at identifying potential vulnerabilities and prioritising and focusing protection and supervision measures in the area of cybersecurity.\n\nPartnerships: Iberdrola actively partners with law enforcement agencies, government agencies, product and service providers, other companies and industry expert groups to continuously reinforce and improve its own cybersecurity capabilities and help improve the cyber resilience of the energy ecosystem as a whole. Iberdrola has co-chaired the World Economic Forum\u2019s working group on Cyber Resilience in the Electricity Industry since it was established in May 2018.\n\nGRI 418\n\nWith regard to information privacy, Iberdrola pays special attention to ensuring the privacy of the personal information of the group\u2019s Stakeholders. For this purpose, the company follows a Personal Data Protection Policy approved by the Board of Directors and conforming to the European Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Its purpose is to ensure the right to the protection of data of all individuals dealing with companies belonging to the group, ensuring respect for the right to dignity and privacy in processing of the personal data, and particularly to establish the common principles and guidelines to govern the group regarding the protection of data, ensuring compliance with applicable law on this topic in all countries in which the group is present.\n\nIberdrola has chosen to handle privacy with a holistic focus, the goal of which is to integrate privacy and data protection within the management system and the culture of the company. Responsibility for the protection of personal data lies with the businesses and corporate functions, organisations that process this data, under the coordination and supervision of the Data Protection Officer, with the support of the Legal Services.\n\nDuring financial years 2018 and 2019 the Iberdrola group developed and implemented a data protection management system in order to ensure systematic compliance over time with the GDPR, the Binding Corporate Rules and the personal data protection laws of each of the EU countries in which the group is present.68\n\nThis management system has been reviewed within the framework of continuous improvement, through the development of an external evaluation plan. This 3-year plan began in the last quarter of 2019 and ended in December 2021, encompassing all European Union countries in which the retail business is present, as well as the United Kingdom, the United States and Mexico. The second cycle of external evaluation began in the first quarter of 2022 and will end in 2024, consolidating the model and its gradual expansion to new geographical areas. The Iberdrola group deals with a large volume of personal data in its day-to-day activities, and given its international nature, international transfers of data among its various companies occur on a daily basis. Recommendations 01/2020 on measures that supplement transfer tools and Recommendations 02/2020 on essential guarantees issued by the European Data Protection Board in mid-2021 have been taken into consideration in adapting the procedures and methodologies on international data transfers, including the new standard contractual clauses, and in developing the methodology for the impact assessment of international data transfers.\n\n68 Resolution of the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency dated 15 December 2020. Available at www.iberdrola.com\nIn addition, as regards international transfers between group companies, on 15 December 2020 the Spanish Data Protection Agency issued a decision approving the *Binding Corporate Rules of the Iberdrola group*, one of the mechanisms established in the GDPR to carry out international transfers of personal data within a group of companies. The approval of these rules has been the culmination of another of the steps implemented by the group to ensure full respect for the fundamental rights to privacy of data subjects in all of the countries in which it operates, not limited to European companies directly subject to the GDPR, but also to all other territories.\n\nThe table below shows substantiated complaints regarding breaches of violations of privacy and losses of customer data.\n\n| GRI 418-1 | SASB IF-EU-550a.1 |\n|-----------|-------------------|\n\n| Incidents relating to privacy (No.) | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| From regulatory entities           | 124  | 115  | 100  |\n| From other sources, substantiated  | 3    | 17   | 54   |\n| Total substantiated complaints     | 127  | 132  | 154  |\n\nOf the complaints received from regulatory bodies, 49 occurred in Spain, 67 in the United Kingdom, seven in Portugal and one in Italy. Of those having another origin, there were two in Spain and one in the United States.\n\nIn 2022, there were 10 cases of information leak or loss, with no sensitive data involved, five of which took place in Spain, and one in each of the following countries: Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, and Portugal.\nIII.5. Promotion of socially responsible practices in the supply chain\n\n- Description of the supply chain\n- Sustainable management of the supply chain\nDescription of the supply chain\n\n- **GRI 2-6**\n\nThe Iberdrola group\u2019s supply chain is managed through two different processes:\n\n- The procurement of material and equipment and the contracting of works and services, which is the responsibility of the Group\u2019s Purchasing and Services Division.\n- The procurement of fuel, which is handled by the Wholesale and Retail Business.\n\nBoth processes are guided by the same principles embodied in the *Corporate policies* and the *Code of Ethics*. However, each of them has specific characteristics in their various phases: registration and classification of suppliers, bidding process, execution of contracts, monitoring of contractual terms, and quality control.\n\n**Procurement of material and equipment and contracting of works and services**\n\nThe mission of the group\u2019s Purchasing and Services Division is to establish the strategy and procedures for and to supervise the purchasing of equipment and material (other than fuel), as well as works and services contracts and insurance programmes (other than life and casualty, health and pension insurance) for the entire Iberdrola group, meeting the strategic goals established by the Board of Directors and respecting at all times the company\u2019s *Governance and Sustainability System*:\n\nThe purchasing process is periodically audited both internally and by external entities, with no non-conformities having been identified during the financial year. Recommendations and opportunities for improvement that arise during these reviews are analysed and put into place in order to maintain continuous improvement in the processes.\n\nIberdrola placed orders with more than 19,000 suppliers during 2022. A breakdown of the economic and geographic volume is set out in the following table:\nGeneral supply of equipment, materials, works and services (millions of euros)\n\n|                | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|----------------|------|------|------|\n| Spain          | 2,711| 2,405| 2,070|\n| United Kingdom | 1,334| 1,225| 1,484|\n| United States  | 3,360| 3,031| 2,790|\n| Brazil         | 2,143| 1,400| 1,283|\n| Mexico         | 439  | 395  | 507  |\n| IEI            | 1,546| 967  | 360  |\n| **Total**      | 11,533| 9,424| 8,494|\n\nIn 2022, the volume of purchases grew by 22% to \u20ac11,533 million as a result of the increase in volumes invoiced by suppliers related to offshore wind projects in Europe and the United States, onshore wind in Spain, the United States and Australia, and investments in electricity distribution networks in Spain, the United States, the United Kingdom and Brazil.\n\n**Procurement of fuel**\n\nIberdrola dedicated more than \u20ac6,233 million to the procurement of natural gas and uranium in 2022. Uranium is procured in Spain and only through Empresa Nacional del Uranio (Enusa). Natural gas is procured on the domestic and international market, mainly through long-term commercial relationships with approximately 27 large suppliers and wholesale market operators. These purchases are for the production of electricity (mainly in Mexico and Spain).\n\n**Procurement of fuel (millions of euros)**\n\n|                | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|----------------|------|------|------|\n| Coal           | 0    | 0    | 0    |\n| Natural Gas    | 6,140| 4,639| 2,204|\n| Uranium        | 93   | 55   | 55   |\n| **Total**      | 6,233| 4,694| 2,259|\n\n**Spending on local suppliers**\n\nIberdrola follows a local supplier strategy for its strategic contracting that has allowed for the creation of indirect employment and the maintenance of a strong industrial fabric in the geographical areas in which it does business.\n\nThe following table shows the percentage volume of purchasing from local suppliers:\n\n---\n\n69 Volume billed during the financial year.

This amount represents 96% of the total amount awarded to the different suppliers making up the Iberdrola group's supply chain. Of this amount, \u20ac16,287 million (91.5% of the total) was awarded to suppliers surpassing the above mentioned level of sustainability.\n\nIt should be noted that in 2022, the objectives relating to the increase in purchases from key suppliers evaluated as \u201cadequate\u201d were met and that improvement plans were introduced and monitored for those suppliers that did not achieve the minimum scores established by Iberdrola when they were awarded the contracts from the beginning of 2020 to the end of 2022. Therefore, improvement plans were sent to 912 suppliers of the group during this period and the result of this initiative has been that 57% of them have improved their level of sustainability to the level of \u201cadequate\u201d.\n\nNot only is the supplier motivated by this model to improve its profile by taking actions that promote excellence in business management, but the Purchasing Division team is also incentivised through quantifiable objectives to choose those companies showing good performance in sustainability or making a commitment to improve.\nFactors evaluated for supplier classification\n\nIberdrola verifies that its suppliers\u2019 actions are in line with the policies, principles and responsibilities of the group.\n\nThe requirements for classifying suppliers are:\n\n| REQUIREMENTS TO BE QUALIFIED AS A SUPPLIER |\n|-------------------------------------------|\n| Supplier\u2019s acceptance of the code of ethics |\n| This contains the ethical principles that they must accept before entering into their contractual relationship. |\n| Comply with the legislation of each country in which it operates |\n| Compliance with the applicable legislation in each of the countries in which the Iberdrola Group carries out its activities. |\n| Stability |\n| Evidence of a stable financial situation, that there is no credit risk. |\n| Sustainability |\n| Environmental performance. Human rights, ethics, SDGs, etc. |\n| Third party liability |\n| For certain contracts, a third party liability insurance policy appropriate to the needs will be required. |\n\nFuel purchasing is also subject to the general principles of Iberdrola\u2019s sustainable development policies, which are intended to encourage suppliers to engage in activities that are socially responsible, respectful of the environment and preventive of occupational risks.\n\nIberdrola carries out an internal evaluation of its main fuel suppliers in accordance with economic, logistical, environmental and social standards. The aspects evaluated include: the existence of an environmental policy, information regarding CO\u2082 emissions, emission reduction initiatives, energy efficiency, biodiversity conservation, occupational health and safety, equal opportunity, human rights and ethical behaviour (anti-bribery and anti-corruption practices).\n\nIn 2022 no communication was received through the company\u2019s ethical mailboxes resulting in the cancellation of any contract or order for reasons related to human rights, corruption, labour practices or environmental practices.\nSupplier environmental assessment\n\n- **GRI 308**\n\nAlignment in Purchasing and in supplier management with respect to the environment and sustainability\n\n### ALIGNMENT IN PURCHASING AND IN SUPPLIER MANAGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY\n\n| Internal Procurement Mechanisms | External Supplier Mechanisms |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Pruchasing Policy** | **Code of Ethics** |\n| Sets out principles on the environment that suppliers must follow and sustainable and responsible management in the Iberdrola group\u2019s supply chain | Includes environmental principles.

Fuel suppliers with a certified environmental management system represented 73.91% of those evaluated.\n\nAll major suppliers of general goods and equipment (both new and existing) and fuel are assessed in accordance with environmental and sustainability criteria.\n\n- **GRI 308-2**\n\nNo supplier with a significant negative environmental impact has been detected. Furthermore, Iberdrola does not have major suppliers located in areas with water stress.\nSupplier social assessment\n\n- GRI 414 414-1 414-2 407-1 408-1 409-1\n\nThe contracting terms of the group for purchasing equipment, material, works and services, include specific supplier corporate social responsibility clauses based on the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the conventions of the International Labour Organization, the principles of the Global Compact, and compliance with the Code of Ethics. For fuels, the company aims to include these clauses as new contracts are signed.\n\nDuring the term of the contract, the supplier must allow Iberdrola to review the level of compliance with the principles established in the contracts, and if non-compliance is detected and corrective plans are not adopted, the company reserves the right to cancel the contracts.\n\nAll major suppliers of general goods and equipment and of fuel are assessed under this management approach and considering their material risks in relation to human rights and negative social impacts. These risks are mitigated and managed through the quality processes in place and the regular audits carried out by each business unit. This strategy has been reinforced in 2022 with a global campaign of social audits of key general goods suppliers to ensure compliance with the group's ESG criteria and to validate the supplier assessment model. By year-end 2022 a total of 42 social and sustainability audits had been carried out on the Group\u2019s main suppliers at the global level.\n\nBased on the Iberdrola group\u2019s risk map for 2022 drawn up by BHR (a specialised consulting firm), and taking into account the suppliers of goods and services from countries identified in 2022 as being at high risk of human rights violations, the following risks may emerge:\n\n- in connection with the risk to freedom of association and collective bargaining, in 1.5% of the volume of purchases made in 2022,\n- in connection with child labour, in 0% of the total volume of purchases made in 2022, and\n- in connection with forced labour, in 1.5% of the total volume of purchases made.\n\nWith regard to fuel supplies, no purchases were made in countries where there is a risk of violation of the rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining, child labour and forced labour.\n\nThere was no identification in 2022 of any contracting with suppliers that has generated incidents relating to freedom of association, collective bargaining, or the use of child or forced or compulsory labour, nor is there evidence of receiving complaints on these grounds.\n\nHowever, in Brazil a labour complaint was filed by a former employee of the supplier EPS RR Construtora, against this company and Neoenergia Elektro for secondary liability as the contractor. Among other issues, the former employee claimed that he had suffered degrading conditions in the housing where he stayed for 2 months, considering that this housing/home did not have the necessary infrastructure. The contract with the supplier was terminated and the proceedings are being monitored.\n\nNo suppliers with a material negative social impact have been detected, and no incidents were reported through the channels established for this purpose that resulted in the cancellation of orders or of contracts with the group\u2019s suppliers due to negative social impacts.\nIn 2021 a potential risk associated with complaints of forced labour was identified in the Xinjiang region of China linked to polysilicon producers supplying polysilicon to solar module manufacturers. Although this risk does not directly affect the group\u2019s direct suppliers, it does affect the value chain for photovoltaic technology. Since then Iberdrola has promoted scrupulous compliance with the Iberdrola group\u2019s Suppliers\u2019 Code of Ethics among all suppliers potentially exposed to this risk. To this end, Iberdrola has successfully required the inclusion of specific clauses to mitigate the risks of forced labour or modern slavery for all affected suppliers with which it has signed supply contracts. In addition, the necessary clauses have also been included in contracts for the supply of PV panels to give the company the right to perform social and sustainability audits, both for module manufacturers and third party companies in their supply chains, to ensure the quality and traceability of the components. The Iberdrola group also actively participates, along with the manufacturers themselves, in the main industry-led initiatives, such as Solar Power Europe and WindEurope, with the aim of establishing common standards and tools that allow objective evidence to be obtained that human rights have been respected throughout the process of manufacturing the equipment used in these projects.\n\nEvaluation of supplier risks\n\nIberdrola ensures the evaluation of supplier risk during the procurement process, as set forth in the Purchasing Policy. In particular, the following risks are identified: Credit risk, fraud risk, cybersecurity risk, sustainability risk, operational risk, risks related to human resources and tax risk.\n\nReview of the provision of general supplies in countries presenting a risk of corruption\n\nIn order to analyse the risk of corruption in procurement, the company uses the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index 2021 (TI CPI 2021)\\(^1\\) as a source to classify countries according to their level of risk.\n\nThe volumes of purchasing in countries classified according to said index based on their level of risk of corruption are set out in the following table:\n\n| Corruption risk\\(^2\\) | % of 2022 general supply purchases in countries on the CPI Index 2021 |\n|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Purchasing in countries classified as low-risk | 74.7 |\n| Purchasing in countries classified as medium-risk | 2.1 |\n| Purchasing in countries classified as high-risk | 23.2 |\n\nBrazil and Mexico are the main countries classified by the aforementioned TI CPI 2021 as having a high risk of corruption and in which there have been purchases from registered suppliers. The purchasing volume is directly related to Iberdrola\u2019s presence and investment efforts in these countries, and is consistent with its practice of promoting the local industrial fabric.\n\nIberdrola has not made any significant purchase of general supplies from suppliers located in tax havens.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Latest available at the date of preparation of this report.\n\n\\(^2\\) Low-risk: country index \u2265 60 / Medium-risk: 59-50 / High-risk: < 50 on a scale from 0 (perception of high levels of corruption) to 100 (perception of low levels of corruption).\nReview of the provision of fuel supplies in countries presenting a risk of corruption\n\nAn analysis of the purchases of fuel shows the following ratios in 2022:\n\n| Corruption risk73 | % provisions of fuel in 2022 in countries included in the CPI 2021 index |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Provisions of fuel in countries classified as low-risk | 58.9 |\n| Provisions of fuel in countries classified as medium-risk | 1.0 |\n| Provisions of fuel in countries classified as high-risk | 40.1 |\n\nAccording to the aforementioned TI CPI 2021, Mexico and Brazil are the main countries with a high risk of corruption in which fuel has been purchased from registered suppliers. However, the company believes that the calculation should exclude these two countries because these purchases are made in strongly regulated environments that require contracting with state-owned companies. Excluding both countries from the calculation, the percentage of fuel purchasing in at high-risk countries would decrease to 0%.\n\n73 Low-risk: country index \u2265 60 / Medium-risk: 59-50 / High-risk: < 50 on a scale from 0 (perception of high levels of corruption) to 100 (perception of low levels of corruption).\nIII.6. Contribution to the well-being of our communities\n\n- Access to energy\n- Support to local communities\n- Fiscal responsibility\n- Contributions to society\n- Foundations\n- Iberdrola and the Global Compact\nAccess to energy\n\nThe Sustainable Development Policy approved by the company\u2019s Board of Directors embraces the promotion of universal access to the power supply, with environmentally sustainable, economically assumable and socially inclusive models, as a basic principle of conduct in the creation of sustainable value. In addition, it attends to customers who are economically disadvantaged or in any other situation of vulnerability, establishing specific procedures of protection and collaborating in providing ongoing access to electric power and gas supply according to the policies established by the competent government authorities in each case.\n\nAccess to energy for off-grid customers\n\nThe companies of the Neoenergia group have continued to develop rural electrification programmes, undertaken jointly with government authorities, as an instrument for the social inclusion and development of rural homes not served by electric utilities. In 2022, the funds allocated to these programmes totalled \u20ac88 million (478 million Brazilian reais) in consolidated terms for the group.\n\nGlobally, Iberdrola has launched the Electricity for All Programme in response to the call of the international community to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services. Iberdrola has set the ambitious goal of providing electricity to 16 million persons who currently lack it by 2030.\n\nFor more information, see the \u201cElectricity for All\u201d Programme section of the corporate website.\n\nAccess for vulnerable customers\n\n\u25a0 SASB IF-EU-240a.4.\n\nThe companies of the group have procedures to protect customers at risk of exclusion or in vulnerable situations so as to facilitate access for the most disadvantaged groups: Iberdrola\u2019s measures in this regard include a lengthening of collection periods and making payment terms more flexible, so as to prevent the suspension of electric and/or gas supply due to non-payment of bills by users who are economically disadvantaged or who have been declared vulnerable due to reasons of age, health, disability or other reasons. In some countries such as Spain (with a subsidised electricity rate, called the Bono Social de Electricidad) and Brazil, there is a special, differentiated rate for low-income customers, offering them advantageous prices and special terms.\n\n| Initiatives to improve the access of vulnerable customers and communities to electricity |\n|-----------------------------------------------|\n| **Country** | **Initiative** |\n| Spain | Subsidised Rate (Bono Social), agreements with the regional governments to avoid the suspension of service for vulnerable customers. |\n| United Kingdom | Warm Home Discount |\n| United States | Energy Assistance Programs |\n| Brazil | Subsidised Electricity Rate (Tarifa Social de Energia El\u00e9trica) |\n| Italy | Subsidised Rate (Bonus sociali) |\nInformation regarding disconnections and subsequent reconnections in accordance with the Electric Utilities Sector Supplement of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is shown in the following table:\n\n| GRI EU27 | SASB IF-EU-240a.3 |\n|----------|-------------------|\n\n### Residential disconnections (no.)\n\n|                      | 2022     | 2021     | 2020     |\n|----------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Paid up to 48 h after disconnection | 1,121,446 | 958,886  | 779,851  |\n| Paid between 48 h and one week after disconnection | 150,132   | 155,758  | 120,257  |\n| Paid between one week and one month after disconnection | 210,530   | 212,944  | 164,689  |\n| Paid between one month and one year | 175,311   | 199,878  | 131,316  |\n| Paid after more than one year | 44       | 15       | 91       |\n| Outstanding and unclassified | 0        | 5,958    | 17,267   |\n| **Iberdrola total** | **1,657,463** | **1,533,439** | **1,213,471** |\n\n### Residential reconnections following payment of unpaid bills (No.)\n\n|                      | 2022     | 2021     | 2020     |\n|----------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Less than 24 h after payment | 1,415,594 | 1,213,785 | 996,700  |\n| Between 24 h and one week after payment | 185,838   | 184,014  | 111,383  |\n| More than one week after payment | 80,103    | 89,025   | 97,078   |\n| Unclassified | 0        | 5,582    | 14,020   |\n| **Iberdrola total** | **1,681,535** | **1,492,406** | **1,219,181** |\n\n### Support to local communities\n\n#### Development programmes for local communities\n\n| GRI 413 |\n|---------|\n\nIberdrola engages in various activities to avoid, mitigate and offset the potential socio-economic impacts of its facilities. These are identified in the context of impact assessments and consultation processes with the affected communities, and are discussed with the various stakeholders and local authorities.\n\nThe activities cover different areas, such as the protection of biodiversity and the recovery of spaces; use of the ecosystemic services generated at the plants; improved communication, water supply, and waste management infrastructure; the implementation of public lighting systems; the creation of direct and indirect jobs; scholarships, training courses for professionals; activities to support entrepreneurs, etc.\n\n---\n\n74 In 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, service shutdowns for non-payment were suspended before gradually resuming in 2021 and 2022.\n\n75 Data were reclassified in 2022 to adjust the report to the indicator.\nMoreover, there are supplementary sponsorship and patronage activities to improve the well-being of the communities in which we have a presence.\n\nGiven the size and significance of these local social and economic development programmes, they are carried out by various organisations, subsidiaries, and institutions within the group, on a supplementary basis:\n\n- By subsidiaries or investees, within their respective purviews.\n- By the group\u2019s foundations in the case of sponsorship and patronage activities (Fundaci\u00f3n Iberdrola Espa\u00f1a, ScottishPower Foundation in the United Kingdom, AVANGRID Foundation in the United States, Instituto Neoenergia in Brazil, and Fundaci\u00f3n Iberdrola M\u00e9xico). More information can be found in the \u201cFoundations\u201d section of this chapter.\n\n**Social impact assessments**\n\n- **GRI 413-1 413-2**\n\nEnvironmental Impact Assessment studies prior to the construction of facilities include a Social Impact Assessment in accordance with current law in each of the countries, and must be approved by the competent public authorities. In countries with indigenous communities, a Social Impact Study specific to these communities is always included.\n\nThese evaluations include an analysis of potential impacts on human rights, such as the right to a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, through an evaluation of the natural environment. In this evaluation, the environmental impacts of such factors as emissions, leaks, waste, fires, effects on local biodiversity, changes in land use, changes in the aesthetics and quality of the landscape, restricted access to water and forest resources, etc. are assessed. Regarding the fundamental right to enjoy a social order or an adequate standard of living, the analysis includes an evaluation of the social and economic environment, considering demographic aspects such as population changes in nearby municipalities; their historical and cultural heritage; increased demand for jobs in certain sectors; and the deterioration or development of basic infrastructure elements, such as roads or railroad networks, etc.\n\nApplicable law ensures consultation with and the participation of both the interested parties and the government administrations during the performance of these impact studies. Moreover, the project documentation is subject to public review for a period of time that varies according to applicable law in each country.\n\nIn addition to these legal requirements, Iberdrola has implemented the Stakeholders Relations Model as well as a specific Recommendations Guide for Conducting Public Consultations. All these mechanisms contribute to ensuring that the viewpoints of the Stakeholders consulted will be taken into account in defining the future project.\n\nFinally, impact studies specify the preventive and corrective or compensatory measures required to mitigate the issues identified.\n\nAlmost 100% of the company\u2019s main locations of operation are thus subject to these types of activities, focused on meeting the needs of its Stakeholders, especially in local communities.\nConsultation processes with local communities\n\nIn order to better manage and mitigate the impact on the communities in which the group has a presence, Iberdrola has a Guide for the implementation of good practices in relations with local communities, which ensures that public consultation processes are in line with UNGP recommendations.\n\nTo implement this guide, areas have a digital tool that facilitates the management and documentation of consultations with communities. Both tools promote better management of the process, thus making it possible to efficiently monitor the steps set forth in the action, mitigation and remediation plans with respect to any impact in the vicinity of the facilities.\n\nEnergy planning (energy sources, technology and long-term needs) is carried out by governmental authorities; this is the institutional area in which the various Stakeholders can participate in accordance with the mechanisms established in each country. Once the most appropriate infrastructure is selected, the viewpoints of the affected communities are taken into account through consultation processes, which vary depending on the country and the type of facility.\n\nIn addition, during the planning development phase of each project, relations are established with local communities, authorities, and any other stakeholders that may be relevant to the project, and dialogue channels are established with them. These channels supplement those available in the Environmental Management System allowing Stakeholders to send their concerns, complaints, requests for information or any other kind of request to minimise impacts in the area.\n\nManagement of population displacements\n\nDuring the planning phase for new projects, Iberdrola evaluates the land that will potentially be occupied, choosing the land that involves the least displacement of people who either reside in the immediate area or whose economic activities will be affected. In the event of displacement, Iberdrola and the relevant government authorities review the economic, environmental and social consequences of the projects, and jointly hold consultations with the local communities to adopt suitable corrective measures. In addition, in the case of indigenous communities, pathways of dialogue are established with the participation of the government and of various organisations representing them, to report on the projects with the required transparency and integrity.\n\n\u25a0 GRI EU22\n\nIn the construction of the T\u00e2mega hydroelectric complex (Portugal), detailed socio-economic studies have been conducted for several years on the possible affected dwellings. Studies included a prior assessment, taking into account the needs of each of them and examining possible relocations to houses with similar characteristics. A total of 59 dwellings were ultimately identified, of which only 50% were permanent residences. The identification of displacements as necessary and the respective financial compensation were made in accordance with the law on expropriations in Portugal and the methodology implemented regarding the management and definition of displacements and potential economic damages. In addition, in partnership with the Portuguese government and the municipalities, as approved in the Socio-economic Action Plan, financial compensation of \u20ac1.4 million was determined in addition to the compensation provided in the expropriation process, making it possible to improve the relocation conditions of the affected families and maintain their customs and traditions. As of year-end 2022, eight families in the Upper T\u00e2mega area are awaiting relocation. To date, \u20ac0.8 million of the \u20ac1.4 million approved in the Economic Compensation Plan has been paid.\nAs for the United Kingdom, 23 economic displacements took place as a result of several repair works associated with the East Anglia One offshore wind farm. In addition, 61 fishermen (70 vessels) were affected by a geophysical survey campaign as part of the East Anglia Three project. This type of economic displacement has also taken place in France, affecting 55 fishermen (17 vessels). The affected parties received financial compensation in all cases.\n\nImpact on local communities and the rights of indigenous peoples\n\n\u25a0 GRI 411 411-1\n\nIn applying the Code of Ethics and the corporate policies (especially the Policy on Respect for Human Rights), Iberdrola and its employees commit to respect both the rights of ethnic minorities and the internationally recognised rights of indigenous peoples, in accordance with applicable law and the obligations set out in Convention 169 of the International Labour Organization (ILO).\n\nPresence of the company in indigenous territory, incidents and projects implemented\n\nThe company has a presence in four countries where there are indigenous communities (Brazil, Mexico, the United States and Australia). As year-end 2022, the company only has facilities in territories belonging to indigenous communities in two of them (Brazil and Mexico), as shown in the table below. As for Australia, the entire territory is attributed to aboriginal populations, which are distributed across the country, including the states in which Iberdrola operates.\n\nIn environments with indigenous communities, Iberdrola encourages business activities to be carried out with respect for different cultural identities, traditions and environmental wealth, as many times these communities depend on natural resources for their subsistence.\n\nTherefore, it has channels of dialogue with these communities and their representatives, as well as for the participation of the government, in order to report on the progress of projects with due transparency and integrity.\n\nNonetheless, despite the management performed, these communities can at times be directly or indirectly affected at certain facilities. For this reason, the Company promotes ethical practices to prevent conflict and generate mutual benefits.\n\nThe Company currently has the following facilities in territories with the presence of indigenous communities:\n\n| Country | Facility | Indigenous community |\n|---------|----------|----------------------|\n| Mexico  | Topolobambo II combined cycle | In the Ahone municipality: El Chalate, Juricahui, Bajada de San Miguel, Nuevo San Miguel, San Miguel Zapotitlan, Zapotillo Uno, Choacahui and La Tea. In the El Fuerte municipality: T\u00e9roque Viejo, El Carricito, La Ladrillera, El Bajio, Las Higueras de los Natoches, La Loma, El Ranchito, 2 de Abril, La Cruz, La Linea and J\u00fapere. |\n|         | Tamazunchale combined cycle | In the municipality of San Mart\u00edn Chalchicuautla, the Lalaxo and Ocuitzapooyo and Bordones communities; in the municipality of Matlapa, the Terrero Colorado, Chalchocoyo and Nexcuayo communities; in the municipality of Tampac\u00e1n, the El Refugio, Las Vegas, El Ojital, Huexco aand Mixcota communities; in the municipality of Tamazunchale: Palictla, Cuixcuatitla, El Tepetate, and Barrio la Vega Cuixcuatitla. |\n|         | Dos Arbolitos wind farm | Zapotec community |\n|         | Bii Nee Stipa wind farm | Zapotec community |\n|         | Mexico Ecological Parks | Juchit\u00e1n de Zaragoza |\n| Brazil  | Subesta\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00c1guas Belas, Estado de Pernambuco | FULNI-\u00d3 community, in the city of \u00c1guas Belas |\n|         | Coelba Networks in Banza\u00e9 | Kiriris, Tux\u00e1 and Truk\u00e1 (Bahia) |\nAs regards incidents with these communities, as of the closing date of this report, three lawsuits were under way with respect to the Brazilian electricity distribution company Coelba relating to indigenous rights, seeking compensation for the use of the right of way of the electricity grids on community lands of the Kiriris, Tux\u00e1 and Truk\u00e1 communities. So far, only the action regarding the Kiriris indigenous people community was adjudicated, which is now in the appeal stage. The other two actions are in the investigatory phase, awaiting judgement.\n\nIberdrola also carries out various projects with indigenous communities, as described below:\n\nIn Mexico, the \u201cLuces de Esperanza\u201d (Lights of Hope) project is being developed with indigenous communities, offering solar power electrification solutions to rural communities without electricity. In 2022, more than 400 persons benefited, and 115 homes in Oaxaca were electrified. Moreover, the \u201cHuertos Comunitarios\u201d (Community Gardens) project has been carried out in four towns in the state of San Luis Potos\u00ed as part of the \u201cEnerg\u00eda por el Campo\u201d (Energy for the Countryside) programme. The project seeks the self-reliance of these communities by growing certain food, equipping families to care for their gardens, promoting the cultivation of healthy food, and supporting the local economy.\n\nIn the United States, even though there is no asset of the company within the territory of an indigenous community, the Blue Bird solar project, in Washington state, is in the vicinity of the Yakama Nation reservation, in an area in which this community has traditionally lived and moved. For this reason, the company has conducted an exhaustive evaluation of the cultural resources that might be affected by its activity. Based on this evaluation, which has now been completed, various activities have commenced to protect the resources in accordance with state requirements. The implementation of these activities will be completed in 2023. In addition, Iberdrola has conducted exploration surveys in the states of Arizona and New Mexico to evaluate the wind and solar energy potential of various locations within tribal reservations. These activities are performed from the very beginning in coordination with the local communities.\n\nFinally, there were no incidents relating to the violation of the rights of employees from indigenous communities in the group during 2022.\n\nCitizen insecurity and labour practices in the hiring of security services\n\n- **GRI 410**\n\nThe Corporate Security Policy approved by Iberdrola\u2019s Board of Directors and the specific procedures adopted by the Corporate Security Division for each situation and country are compatible both with international human rights standards and the laws of the countries where the company is present.\n\nThe protocols of conduct are defined and implemented in all activities and services provided by the Corporate Security Division, with a Quality Management System that has been certified since 2003 under ISO 9001 and externally reviewed each year by AENOR in the countries where it has been implemented in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of this standard, as well as with the standards of the management system.\nSecurity and monitoring services providers are hired in accordance with the purchasing policy, model and procedures in effect. The Corporate Security Division is responsible for setting the technical specifications and standards to be met by such suppliers in order to be hired, in terms of physical security, resources, training and cybersecurity, as well as the assessment thereof during the performance of their contract. This assessment is performed annually in order to identify areas for improvement.\n\nBoth the company\u2019s personnel and that of subcontractors are qualified for their duties and enhance their knowledge through a rigorous training plan, which is continually assessed and monitored.\n\n\u25a0 GRI 410-1\n\n| Security personnel trained in human rights | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|-------------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Own personnel (No.)                       | 225  | 194  | 187  |\n| Own personnel trained in human rights (No.)| 187  | 150  | 175  |\n| Own personnel trained in human rights (%)  | 83.1 | 77.3 | 93.6 |\n| Subcontracted personnel (No.)              | 1,218| 1,166| 1,228|\n| Subcontracted personnel trained in human rights (No.) | 925 | 850 | 865 |\n| Subcontracted personnel trained in human rights (%) | 75.9 | 72.9 | 70.4 |\n\nFiscal responsibility\n\n\u25a0 GRI 207-1 207-2 207-3\n\nIberdrola has a Corporate Tax Policy that sets out the Group\u2019s tax strategy, based on ensuring compliance with applicable tax regulations, excellence and the commitment to applying good tax practices and transparency, seeking appropriate coordination of the tax practices followed by the Group\u2019s companies to prevent tax risks and inefficiencies in the implementation of business decisions.\n\nThe Corporate Tax Policy conforms to the corporate and governance structure and applies to all companies of the Group over which Iberdrola has effective control, within the legal limits, without prejudice to the autonomy of the listed subholding companies, as provided by the group\u2019s corporate governance.\n\nThe Board of Directors of Iberdrola S.A. is tasked with designing, evaluating, approving and permanently reviewing the Governance and Sustainability System, and particularly with approving and updating corporate policies, including the Corporate Tax Policy. The Board of Directors is also responsible for preparing the tax strategy and approving investments or transactions that area particularly important for tax purposes due to the size or nature thereof.\n\nThe Corporate Tax Policy is publicly available on the Group\u2019s corporate website.\nFiscally responsible behaviour\n\nThe Corporate Tax Policy defines the main principles of conduct, including:\n\n- Compliance with tax regulations in each of the countries and territories in which the Group companies operate, paying the taxes that are due. All tax-related decisions are based on a reasonable interpretation of applicable law in close connection with the group\u2019s activity.\n- The prevention and reduction of significant tax risks, ensuring that taxes bear an appropriate relationship to the structure and location of activities, human and material resources, and the group\u2019s business risks.\n- The strengthening of the relationship with tax authorities based on respect for the law, fidelity, reliability, professionalism, cooperation, reciprocity and good faith.\n- The provision of information to the management decision-making bodies on the main tax implications of the transactions or matters submitted to it for approval, when they are a significant factor in making a decision.\n- Envisaging the taxes that the group\u2019s companies pay in the countries and territories in which they operate as the principal contribution to sustaining public expenditures, and therefore as one of their contributions to society.\n\nBy application of these principles, the companies of the Group assume the following good tax practices, among others:\n\n- Not to use artificial structures unrelated to the Group\u2019s business for the sole purpose of reducing its tax burden nor, in particular, enter into transactions with related entities solely to erode the tax basis or to transfer profits to low-tax territories.\n- Avoid opaque structures for tax purposes, which are understood as structures calculated to prevent knowledge by the competent tax authorities of the party ultimately responsible for the activities or of the ultimate owner of the assets or rights involved.\n- Not to create or acquire companies resident in countries or territories deemed by Spanish law to be tax havens or included on the EU blacklist of non-cooperative jurisdictions, with the sole exception of those cases in which it is obliged to do so in the case of an indirect acquisition in which the company resident in a tax haven is part of a group of companies being acquired, in which case, the provisions of the Procedure for the Creation or Acquisition of Equity Interests in Special Purpose Entities Domiciled in Tax Havens, approved by the Board of Directors, must be taken into account.\n- Follow the recommendations of the good tax practices codes implemented in the countries in which the companies of the Group do business, taking into account the specific needs and circumstances of all the companies making up the Group.\n- Cooperate with the competent tax authorities in the detection of and search for solutions regarding fraudulent tax practices of which the Company is aware that may be used in the markets in which the Group\u2019s companies have a presence, as well as provide as quickly as possible any significant tax-related information and documentation requested by the Tax Authorities in the exercise of their authority and within the appropriate scope, encouraging agreements and compliance findings during the inspection procedures.\n- Make the necessary whistleblower channels available to anyone who wishes to report any conduct that may involve any wrongdoing or conduct contrary to the law or to the Governance and Sustainability System, including the rules of conduct set forth in the Code of Ethics that are also applicable to tax-related activities.\n\nThe fiscally responsible behaviour of all companies of the Iberdrola group forms part of the General Sustainable Development Policy, which contemplates basic principles of conduct that must be respected. Iberdrola\u2019s tax policy is guided by the Purpose and Values of the Iberdrola group and the Code of Ethics, and is based on a commitment to ethical principles, good corporate governance, transparency and institutional loyalty.\n\nThe companies of the group share the principles reflected in the Purpose and Values of the Iberdrola group and the Code of Ethics, and see the social dividend as the contribution of direct, indirect or induced sustainable value that its activities represent for all Stakeholders.\nTax governance and risk management\n\nResponsibility\nThe Board of Directors of Iberdrola, S.A., through its chairman, the chief executive officer and the management team, fosters the monitoring of tax principles and good tax practices. Likewise, the respective boards of directors of the country subholding companies are responsible for ensuring compliance with the Corporate Tax Policy at the country level.\n\nControl and monitoring\nTaxation is not static and is subject to continuous revision, which requires the Corporate Tax Policy to be constantly reviewed in order to reflect the best practices in this area, with the last update taking place in December 2022.\nTo achieve efficient control and correct compliance with tax governance requirements, the applicable tax laws and the principles of the Corporate Tax Policy are monitored at all levels.\nThe Company's Global Tax Division approves and periodically reviews guidelines for the evaluation and management of tax risk applicable to all companies of the Group. It is also the body responsible for tax compliance within the Company, in coordination with the Company\u2019s Compliance Unit.\nFurthermore, the head of business companies report to the country subholding companies regarding the level of compliance with the Corporate Tax Policy, and in turn, the Audit and Compliance Committees of the country subholding companies report to the Audit and Risk Supervision Committee of Iberdrola S.A. Finally, the Audit and Risk Supervision Committee of Iberdrola, S.A. reports its findings to the Board of Directors.\n\nRisk management and compliance\nIberdrola proactively seeks to ensure compliance with tax provisions and to prevent and reduce significant tax risks. To this end, it has a robust tax risk prevention model in line with best tax governance practices, which is duly monitored, updated and aligned with applicable legal requirements.\nIn this regard, in 2019 Iberdrola was the first Spanish company to obtain certification of a tax compliance management system in accordance with the requirements established in the UNE 19602 standard, issued for a period of three years. Iberdrola was also the first company to renew its certification for a new three-year period in 2022, having obtained a satisfactory audit of its tax compliance system for the fourth year in a row.\nIn addition, among other measures, Iberdrola has objective standards applicable to all the Group's companies for classifying transactions based on their tax risk. In this regard, the Group prohibits the creation or acquisition of companies resident in tax havens, for which reason none of the active companies it controls are resident in tax havens as defined by applicable law (Royal Decree 1080/1991) or in territories classified by the European Union in its blacklist as non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes.\n\nStakeholder engagement in tax matters\n\nIberdrola, S.A. adheres to the Code of Good Tax Practices approved on 20 July 2010 by the full Forum of Large Businesses (Foro de Grandes Empresas), established on 10 July 2009 at the behest of the National Tax Administration Agency (Agencia Estatal de Administraci\u00f3n Tributaria). Iberdrola\u2019s commitment to compliance with, further development and implementation of the Code extends to any other good tax practices that stem from the recommendations of the Code in effect at any time, even if not expressly set forth in the Corporate Tax Policy. The Group is also committed to compliance with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises in tax matters.\nWithin the framework of the Code, since financial year 2015 Iberdrola, S.A. has voluntarily submitted to the Spanish tax authorities an Annual Tax Transparency Report for companies adhering to the Good Tax Practices Code, which includes detailed information on the Group\u2019s taxation. This report is currently the most important tool for cooperative relations with the Tax Authorities.\nFurthermore, Iberdrola has voluntarily prepared its annual Report on Tax Transparency of the Iberdrola Group since 2019. Our commitment to society. This report sets out all significant issues from a tax standpoint and will be prepared again in 2023. The report contains the Country by Country Report for the previous year presented in the same terms as those submitted to the Spanish Tax Authorities. This report is publicly available on the corporate website.\nFinally, Iberdrola makes available to its Stakeholders specific ethics mailboxes, which constitute tools to report conduct that could involve improper conduct or conduct contrary to law or to the internal rules or procedures, including those relating to taxes.\nThe taxes paid are presented in the following table:\n\n| Tax contribution (\u20ac millions) | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|-------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Company contributions         | 3,255| 3,125| 2,938|\n| Contributions due to third-party payments | 4,203| 4,711| 4,537|\n| Iberdrola consolidated total  | 7,458| 7,836| 7,475|\n\nTax contributions in 2022 decreased compared to the previous year. However, it remains at the average contribution level of recent years.\n\nIn this regard, while the amount of own contributions charged to the income statement increases with respect to the previous years, contributions due to third-party payments decrease.\n\nThe increase in own contributions is mainly recorded for Corporate Tax, and is mainly due to the fiscal effect in Spain of income from judgements favourable to Iberdrola.\n\nThe amount of contributions due to third-party payments has decreased mainly due to tax refunds received from various government administrations corresponding to overpayments of taxes in previous years due to the tax mechanisms themselves and changes in the tax rates applicable to indirect taxes, like value added and similar taxes.\n\n| Tax contribution

effective rate is mainly due to the impact of the change in the rate applicable to deferred tax balances following the change in the tax rate to 25% from April 2023.\n\n**United States of America:** The effective rate is very similar to the nominal rate (federal plus state). The deviation in the nominal rate is due (i) on the one hand, to tax credits associated with the renewables business (\"PTCs\") as well as investment credits (\"ITCs\"); and (ii) on the other hand, to the restatement of deferred tax balances to the prior year-end state tax rate (\"DT true-up\") as well as the restatement of the valuation according to the potential future application of tax credits (\"valuation allowance\").\n\n**Brazil:** The effective rate is below the nominal rate mainly due to the (optional) application of the presumptive profit regime in the taxation of some of the companies, the payment of interest on equity and the existence of the SUDENE tax incentive.\n\n**Mexico:** Changes in exchange rates, considering that dollarised accounts are presented, and the existence of certain accounting and tax differences (provisions, deferred income, inflationary effect, valuation of derivatives and recognition differences in fixed assets and the depreciation rates thereof) justify the difference between the nominal and effective rate.\n\n**Other countries:** The differential compared to nominal rates is due to accounting standards for capitalisation of tax loss carryforwards and the subsequent application thereof, considering that the tax consolidation regime does not apply in all cases.\nContributions to society\n\nIberdrola has selected the Business for Societal Impact B4SI model to measure and assess business contributions to the community due to its broad international recognition. It is considered the most highly valued standard for measuring the results and impacts of social programmes, both for the company and for the community. This standard only recognises projects that involve voluntary contributions for social or environmental protection ends, for non-profit purposes, and that are not restricted to groups related to the company.\n\nIberdrola has used the model as a basis to report its contributions to society in 2022.\n\n| Contribution to the community in 2022 (thousands of \u20ac) |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| **By category**                                         |\n| Specific contributions                                  | 4,188 |\n| Community investment                                    | 38,270 |\n| Initiative aligned with the business                    | 6,291 |\n| Management costs                                        | 3,166 |\n| **By type of contribution**                             |\n| Cash contributions                                      | 47,428 |\n| Staff time                                              | 603   |\n| In-kind contributions                                   | 718   |\n| Management costs                                        | 3,166 |\n| **By area of contribution**                             |\n| Socioeconomic development of the community              | 5,137 |\n| Energy sustainability                                   | 3,969 |\n| Art and culture                                         | 3,724 |\n| Education and training                                  | 6,962 |\n| Cooperation and community service                       | 19,342 |\n| Other                                                   | 9,615 |\n| Management costs                                        | 3,166 |\n| **Total**                                               | 51,916 |\n\nThis amount is equal to 1.2% of net profits for the year.\n\n---\n\n77 Contributions made mostly to non-profit organisations and foundations but also to universities, government administrations, etc., provided that they meet the aforementioned B4SI Model standards.\nFoundations\n\nScottishPower Foundation, AVANGRID Foundation, Fundaci\u00f3n Iberdrola M\u00e9xico, Instituto Neoenerg\u00eda and Fundaci\u00f3n Iberdrola Espa\u00f1a represent Iberdrola\u2019s commitment to the sustainable development of the countries in which it does business. Pursuant to the Master Plan, the foundations have updated their mission, vision and values to include the contribution to the SDGs among their purposes and principles.\n\nIberdrola uses various indicators to measure the results achieved through its community support programmes.\n\nTraining and Research Area\n\nThis work area focuses on young students, supporting their undergraduate, technical or language studies and providing opportunities for those with fewer resources and/or disabilities. It also includes calls for assistance for research, most notably including the first year of the Energy for Future programme, an international programme in collaboration with the European Commission led by postdoctoral researchers in the energy sector. There are also research grants and scholarships in restoration and conservation in partnership with prestigious museums, such as the Museo del Prado and the Bilbao Fine Arts Museum. These initiatives contribute to the attainment of specific objectives of SDG 4: Quality Education.\n\nThe INSPIRA II and REACTIVA Green Economy training programmes ended in December 2022. These programmes were co-financed by the European Social Fund, the Youth Employment Initiative and the Castilla-La Mancha Autonomous Community, under the regional section of the Operational Youth Employment Programme of this community in Castilla-La Mancha, with the aim of helping young people at risk of exclusion between ages 16 and 30 rejoin the education system and/or obtain training in various areas of the electricity sector.\n\nIn addition, in partnership with various universities, Iberdrola is promoting the representation of women in STEM careers in all of the countries where it is present. This is the case of the STEM Women Chair of Fundaci\u00f3n Iberdrola Espa\u00f1a together with the Pontificia de Comillas University and Empresa Municipal de Transportes de Madrid (EMT), and the Empieza por Educar scholarships, which seek to help five young graduates in the STEM field to have a positive impact on the education system.\nBiodiversity and Climate Change Area: conservation of birds, habitats and ecosystems\n\nThis work area partners with public institutions and entities devoted to the protection of the environment and birdlife, contributing to the achievement of the specific objectives of SDG 13: Climate Action, and 15: Life on Land. Among other initiatives, Iberdrola supports habitat conservation work, such as its Military Shooting Ranges reforestation programme in Spain known as \u201cBosque Defensa Iberdrola\u201d, through which more than 90 hectares have already been reforested in almost four years. In addition, Iberdrola is carrying out multi-annual cooperation efforts with SEO Birdlife and supporting land and marine habitats through the projects being carried out at the foundations in Scotland (restoration of seagrass and oysters), Brazil (coral restoration), the United States (river water conservation) and Mexico (conservation of the Ca\u00f1\u00f3n de Fern\u00e1ndez state park).\n\nArt and Culture Area: programmes for lighting, restoration and support to museums\n\nThis area partners with cultural entities, prestigious museums, public institutions and religious entities to promote culture, as well as to restore and preserve the artistic heritage, favouring local development. These actions directly impact Goals 8: Economic growth, and 11: Sustainable cities and communities.\n\nThere are two very important sections within this area. Through the lighting programme, lighting interventions are carried out with respect to important historic-artistic heritage sites in order to foster local development and sustainable tourism. Some of the lighting projects in Spain include the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, the Monastery of Guadalupe, the Cathedral of Sig\u00fcenza, the Talavera de la Reina Bridge, the archaeological remains of the mills of Campo de Criptana, and in Brazil lighting has been provided for the Guarany Theatre, located in the municipality of Triunfo-Pernambuco in Brazil. In addition, the restoration programme helps conserve and preserve artistic and cultural heritage. Numerous restorations have been carried out with the Museo Nacional del Prado and the Museum of Fine Arts of Bilbao.\n\nAt all of the foundations, workshops, programmes and free visits are also provided with the aim of outreach to promote culture, highlight cultural heritage and create new and exciting learning opportunities.\n\nSocial Action Area\n\nThis work area partners with non-profit organisations, foundations and development agencies to promote social and humanitarian projects aimed at the most vulnerable people and that contribute to achieving the specific objectives of SDGs 1: End poverty; 3: Good health and well-being; 5: Gender equality; 7: Affordable and clean energy; and 10: Reduced inequalities.\n\nThe Social Programme of the Foundations is implemented in five countries with the support of projects that promote overcoming child poverty, supporting the inclusion of people with disabilities, improving the quality of life of persons who are seriously ill and supporting women, always prioritising attention to the most vulnerable groups. The more significant partnerships include: Down Syndrome Foundation, Proyecto Hombre, Ciudad Joven, Save the Children, Upacesur.\n\nIn addition to the social programmes, Fundaci\u00f3n Iberdrola M\u00e9xico is carrying out a multi-year project named \u201cUrological Brigades\u201d to contribute to the well-being of low-income women who have complex urological problems by providing them with surgery.\n\nThe AVANGRID Foundation has been partnering for five years with the National Disaster Response Association and with the American Red Cross with respect to an emergency grant project to support the impact of the humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe ScottishPower Foundation, in addition to its various projects aimed at health and well-being, is engaging in a project to secure and equip a space dedicated to a community food centre throughout the year, offering free, healthy food to the local community.\nIberdrola and the Global Compact\n\nIberdrola has been a member of the Global Compact since 2002, making commitments to support, promote and disseminate its ten principles regarding human rights, labour practices, the environment and the fight against corruption, both internally and within its area of influence, and to contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. The company has continued to further develop the policies proposed by the Compact, which it has made public through its Statement of Non-Financial Information, Integrated Report and ESG+F Information, and its corporate website.\n\nSince 2004, the company has belonged to the Red Espa\u00f1ola del Pacto Mundial (Spanish Global Compact Network) as a founding member, and has prepared annual progress reports on compliance with the principles of the Compact, which are publicly available on the website of the Red Espa\u00f1ola del Pacto Mundial and on the website of the UN Global Compact.\n\nIberdrola engaged in the following activities in connection with the Global Compact during 2022:\n\n- Submission of the Progress Report 2021 on compliance with the principles of the Compact, rated at the highest level for this type of report (\u201cGC Advanced\u201d).\n- Attendance at the 2022 General Assembly of the Red Espa\u00f1ola.\n- The company was identified as LEAD company for its high levels of commitment as Participants in the United Nations Global Compact, and was the only Spanish company to have received this recognition.\n- Active participation in the main platforms and initiatives at the global level, including:\n  - The Caring For Climate commitment to promote the adoption climate change solutions and help shape public policy, of which Iberdrola has been a leading partner since its inception.\n  - The Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C in support of the goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.\n  - 2039 Net Zero objectives approved.\n  - The CEO Water Mandate initiative to encourage sustainable practices in the use of water.\n  - The UN Global Compact CEO Study 2022 initiative.\n  - Iberdrola is a signatory to the Women\u2019s Empowerment Principles, which aim to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment in the workplace, marketplace and community.\n- In addition, within the framework of the milestones of the multilateral agenda, the following activities should be noted:\n  - Very active involvement in the discussions and activities of the Think lab on Just Transition, including activities and documentation linking this topic to the business sector, financing, climate change mitigation and adaptation.\n  - Participation in activities and meetings linked to the United Nations General Assembly and Climate Week NYC, most notably including the UN Private Sector Forum 2022.\n  - Participation in the UN Oceans Conference held in Lisbon.\n  - Participation in the United Nations Climate Change Conference, better known as COP 27, held in Sharm el Sheik (Egypt).\n  - Participation in the World Biodiversity Summit (COP 15), held in Montreal, Canada.\n\nIn 2023 Iberdrola will continue to actively participate in the activities of the Red Espa\u00f1ola del Pacto Mundial in a manner similar to the past years, and sponsor climate action activities at a global level.\nIV. Governance\nIberdrola\u2019s governance model is one of its distinctive traits and the cornerstone of its commitment to sustainability.\n\nStarting with the composition and structure of its governance bodies, in line with corporate governance best practices, and continuing with the internal management and control systems for the risks to which the group is exposed, the entire system is built on the basis of regulatory compliance, robustness, coordination, and the assumption of responsibilities at all levels.\n\nAlong these lines, the company has been selected for the ninth consecutive year as one of the most ethical companies in the world by the Ethisphere Institute.\n\nThis commitment to compliance also extends to its fiscal strategy, based on ensuring compliance with applicable tax provisions, excellence and a commitment to applying good tax practices, adjusted to the group\u2019s corporate and governance structure.\n\nAs part of its commitment to maintaining a governance model in line with best market practices, Iberdrola has set itself the following goals:\n\n| GOALS | METRIC | 2022 | 2025 | 2030 | Related SDGs |\n|-------|--------|------|------|------|--------------|\n| GOVERNANCE | Corporate governance practices (best) | Maintain | \u2713 | \u2713 | \u2713 | 5 16 17 |\n| | Independent Members in the Board of Directors | Over 50% | \u2713 | \u2713 | \u2713 | 16 |\n| | Women in the Board of Directors | At least 40% | \u2713 | \u2713 | \u2713 | 16 |\n| | Diversity in the Board of Directors | Promote | \u2713 | \u2713 | \u2713 | 16 |\n| | Independent external certification or validation of the compliance system | Obtain/maintain (yearly) | \u2713 | \u2713 | \u2713 | 16 |\nIV.1. Good governance, transparency and Stakeholder engagement\n\n- Corporate governance\n- Ethics and integrity\n- Public policies\nCorporate governance\n\nThe Governance and Sustainability System constitutes the internal regulation of Iberdrola. The set of rules on corporate governance is based on best practices and international standards and positions Iberdrola as a leader in this area. The corporate governance rules of the decision-making bodies and internal committees establish their rules of operation, ensuring compliance with and implementation of the Purpose and Values of the Iberdrola group.\n\nAn independent and plural Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors focuses its activity on defining and supervising the general guidelines by, among other things, establishing the group's policies and strategies and supervising the general development of the policies, strategies and guidelines by the country subholding companies and by the head of business companies.\n\n\u25a0 GRI 2-16\n\nFor more detailed information regarding the composition, operation and activities carried out by the governance bodies of the Company, see the Activities Report of the Board of Directors and of the Committees thereof. This Report describes issues of crucial interest dealt with during the year.\n\nA brief description of the composition and activities of the committees of the Board of Directors can be found in section C.2.1. of the Annual Corporate Governance Report.\n\nSelection and nomination of the members of the highest governance body\n\n\u25a0 GRI 2-10\n\nThe appointment, re-election and removal of directors is within the purview of the shareholders at the General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting.\n\nVacancies that occur may be filled by the Board of Directors on an interim basis until the next General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting, whereat the shareholders confirm the appointments or elect the persons who should replace directors who are not ratified, or the vacant positions are withdrawn.\n\nTo this end, the Board of Directors Diversity and Member Selection Policy ensures that proposals for the appointment of directors are based on a prior and objective analysis of the needs of the Board of Directors. The Diversity and Inclusion Policy also contains principles and guidelines that must be taken into account for these purposes.\n\nThe Board of Directors has a diverse and balanced composition in terms of the genders, nationalities and professional profiles of its members\nThe Appointments Committee advises the Board of Directors regarding the most appropriate configuration of such body and on aspects like the size of and balance among the various classes of directors existing at any time and the personal and professional requirements that the candidates must fulfil. For such purpose, the Committee reviews the structure of each body on a regular basis. Independent directors are appointed on the basis of a proposal of the Appointments Committee, while the other appointments require a report of such Committee.\n\nIn any event, the Board of Directors, and the Appointments Committee within the scope of its powers, will endeavour to ensure that the candidates submitted to the shareholders at a General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting for appointment or re-election as directors, as well as the directors appointed directly to fill vacancies in the exercise of the power of the Board of Directors to make interim appointments, are respectable and qualified persons, widely recognised for their expertise, competence, experience, qualifications, training, availability and commitment to their duties.\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors must be irreproachable professionals, whose professional conduct and background are aligned with the principles set forth in the Code of Ethics and with the corporate values contained in the Purpose and Values of the Iberdrola group.\n\nIf the Board of Directors deviates from the proposals and reports of the Appointments Committee, it shall give reasons for so acting and shall record such reasons in the minutes.\n\nIn addition, the selection of candidates shall endeavour to ensure that the composition of the Board of Directors is diverse in the broadest sense and balanced as a whole, such that decision-making is enriched and multiple viewpoints are contributed to the discussion of the matters within its purview. To this end, the selection process shall promote a search for diverse candidates with knowledge and experience in the various countries in which the group does or will engage in activities. The directors must also have sufficient knowledge of the Spanish and English languages to be able to perform their duties.\n\nIn turn, the Board has entrusted to the Appointments Committee the responsibility of ensuring that when new vacancies are filled or new directors are appointed, the selection procedures are free from any implied bias entailing any kind of discrimination, particularly due to gender.\n\nCollective knowledge of highest governance body\n\n- GRI 2-12 2-17\n\nThe Company has a programme to provide directors with training and updates in response to the need for professionalisation, diversification and qualification of the Board of Directors.\n\nIn addition to the training materials and sessions for all directors, the Sustainable Development Committee has a specific training plan in the area of sustainability, ESG requirements, and corporate social responsibility.\n\nFirstly, an Orientation Programme covering aspects such as the business and organisational model of the Company and its group, the corporate governance structure and its ownership, and the Governance and Sustainability System is made available to new members of the Board of Directors through the directors\u2019 website.\nDirectors also receive continuous training regarding significant issues relating to the Iberdrola group and its businesses, as well as the environment in which they operate, which are supplemented by reports, articles and other information of interest, all of which are made available to the directors through the directors\u2019 website, which has a specific section and a blog dedicated to training.\n\nThis website also facilitates the performance of the directors\u2019 duties, incorporating documents deemed appropriate to prepare for meetings of the Board of Directors and its committees based on the agenda, as well as presentations shown during the meetings.\n\nIn this regard, a space is used at meetings of the Board of Directors to present financial, legal, geopolitical, and current issues of interest to the Iberdrola directors.\n\nThe Sustainable Development Committee also has a regular training plan that ensures that knowledge is updated with the latest trends in sustainable development, ESG requirements and corporate social responsibility, the main compliance risks, as well as best practices in corporate governance in international markets.\n\n### Training and informational sessions during 2022\n\n| Board of Directors                                                                 |

As a result of this process, the company develops and adopts ongoing improvement plans designed to implement the specific measures that contribute to continue perfecting corporate governance practices. A summary of this process can be found in section C.1.17 of the *Annual Corporate Governance Report 2022*. \nIdentifying, managing and evaluating economic, environmental and social impacts\n\n\u25a0 GRI 2-12\n\nThe Board of Directors of Iberdrola is structured as described in chapter \"I.1 About Iberdrola\", and its consultative committees assist it in its task of supervising the management of the company's economic, social and environmental performance. This includes both the supervision of the risks and opportunities generated by the group's activities and compliance with international principles, codes and standards applicable to the tasks for which it is responsible. The Board of Directors and its consultative committees perform periodic evaluations of the aforementioned aspects of the group's performance, drawing for such purpose on external information of interest thereto, with the assistance of external independent advisers, and on information provided to them by the rest of the organisation itself, primarily through periodic appearances of the group's officers.\n\nThese appearances are reported in the Activities Report of the Board of Directors and of the Committees thereof.\n\n\u25a0 GRI 2-13 2-17\n\nThe Sustainable Development Committee has supervised the company's conduct in the area of sustainability, corporate reputation, corporate governance and compliance. The general secretary and secretary of the Board of Directors, the director of Compliance, the director Innovation, Sustainability, and Climate Change, and the director of ESG have appeared on a recurring basis. The heads of the various areas have also been invited to make presentations at meetings during which issues within their purview have been discussed.\n\nPursuant to the corporate and governance structure specified in the Governance and Sustainability System, and particularly in the Policy for the Definition and Coordination of the Iberdrola Group and Foundations of Corporate Organisation, the implementation, monitoring and supervisions of the group's sustainable development strategy is the responsibility of its various companies, and is performed by the various committees handling sustainable development and reputational duties, while respecting the principles of subsidiary and decentralised management.\n\nRemuneration policies\n\n\u25a0 GRI 2-17 2-19 2-20\n\nAs provided in the By-Laws and the Regulations of the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors, at the proposal of the Remuneration Committee, is the body with power to set the remuneration of directors within the overall limit set by the By-Laws and in accordance with law, except for such remuneration as consists of the delivery of shares or of options thereon or which is indexed to the price of the shares, which must be submitted to the shareholders for approval at the General Shareholders' Meeting. The Remuneration Committee is a consultive committee chaired by an independent director (the first vice-chair and lead independent director) and made up mostly of independent directors.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee is responsible for evaluating the level of achievement of the targets to which variable annual and multi-annual remuneration is linked and for submitting it to the Board of Directors for approval.\nAs a result of the group\u2019s commitment to sustainability, the long-term incentive plan (2020-2022 Strategic Bonus) approved by the shareholders at the 2020 General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting includes objectives linked to the fight against climate change, notably the acceleration of the emissions reduction objectives. This commitment is aligned with the goal of reducing overall emissions intensity, which contributes to SDGs 7 and 13, by 2030. Other objectives linked to the long-term incentive plan relate to increasing the number of suppliers that adhere to sustainable development policies and standards and eliminating the wage gap.\n\nPursuant to the By-Laws, the Company will annually allocate as an expense an amount equal to a maximum of two percent of the group\u2019s consolidated profit during the preceding financial year for the following purposes:\n\na. To remunerate the directors both for their status as such and for any executive duties, based on the positions held, dedication and attendance at meetings of the corporate decision-making bodies.\n\nb. To maintain a fund to cover the obligations incurred by the Company with respect to pensions, the payment of life insurance premiums and the making of severance payments to former and current directors.\n\nThe allocation, with a maximum limit of two percent, can only accrue if the profit from the preceding financial year is sufficient to cover the requirements of the legal reserve and other mandatory reserves and if the shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend of at least four per cent of the share capital with a charge to said financial year.\n\nRegardless of the provisions of the preceding sections, the remuneration of the directors may consist of the delivery of shares or options thereon, as well as remuneration linked to the value of the Company\u2019s shares, subject always to the approval of the shareholders acting at a General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting.\n\nStakeholders\u2019 engagement in remuneration\n\n\u25a0 GRI 2-20\n\nThe Annual Director Remuneration Report for financial year 2021 was approved in a consultive vote by the shareholders at the General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting held on 17 June 2022, which had a quorum of 72.13%.\n\nThe Annual Director Remuneration Report for financial year 2022 will be submitted to a consultative vote of the shareholders at the General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting to be held in 2023.\n\nShareholder engagement\n\nIberdrola is a pioneer in encouraging shareholder engagement as one of the fundamental pillars of its corporate governance strategy, with the General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting being the shareholders\u2019 main channel for participation in corporate life.\n\nThe 2022 General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting was held physically at the corporate headquarters, with shareholders and their proxy representatives having the ability to attend remotely, and initiatives to continue fostering participation include:\n1. Proactive delivery of proxy and remote voting cards to shareholder registered with OLA Shareholders\u2019 Club or who provided their email address for this purpose.\n2. Inclusion of a QR code in the proxy and absentee voting cards sent by Iberdrola to facilitate electronic participation.\n3. Expansion of the channels for remote participation for shareholders and proxy holders to send images of their cards through new instant messaging systems.\n4. Prize draw for 10 electric bicycles among shareholders voting or granting proxies through the corporate website\u2019s participation portal or the telephone channel.\n5. Commemorative gifts at shareholder information desks opened by Iberdrola to facilitate participation before the General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting.\n6. New financial incentive: an engagement dividend of \u20ac0.005 (gross) per share was paid to all shareholders who were entitled to participate, conditional upon reaching a quorum of at least 70% of the share capital and the approval of the corresponding amendment to the By-Laws to establish this incentive.\n\nAs a result of these measures, the General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting held on 17 June 2022 achieved a quorum of 72.13% of share capital (22.18% present and 49.95% by proxy), compared to 65.83% at the 2021 General Meeting, with all resolutions proposed by the Board of Directors being approved by a broad majority.\n\nSince 2016 the Basque Government (through the state-owned company Ihobe) and AENOR certify that the management of Iberdrola\u2019s General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting meets the standards for the environmental sustainability of events in the Basque Country (Erronka Garbia) and the ISO 20121 standard on sustainable event management, respectively.\n\nThe company has implemented several specific channels of communication to promote accessibility, the understanding of information, and ultimately the engagement of the shareholders, including the following:\n\na. **Shareholder\u2019s Office.** From the call to the General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting through the end thereof, the shareholders can rely on the support of the Shareholder\u2019s Office (Oficina del Accionista), which is in permanent contact with those shareholders who have voluntarily entered their names in its database, and provides a specific service to minority shareholders for the organisation of presentations and events prior to the General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting.\n\nb. **OLS Shareholders\u2019 Club.** An open and permanent channel of participation between the company and shareholders who are interested in monitoring the company\u2019s evolution on an ongoing basis.\n\nc. **Investor Relations Office.** Responds on a regular and personalised basis to the questions of analysts and qualified institutional investors in equities, fixed-income securities and socially responsible investments.\n\nd. **Relations with shareholder associations and institutional shareholders.** Both shareholder associations and institutional shareholders may request meetings with representatives of the company through the Investor Relations Division.\n\ne. Last, the **Governance and Sustainability System** makes provision for the ability of the Board of Directors or its chairman or the Executive Committee to authorise the first vice-chair and lead independent director or other directors to engage in dialogue with specific shareholders on issues relating to corporate governance and sustainable development.\n\n---\n\n**The Shareholder Engagement Policy is one of the main pillars in the corporate governance strategy**\nAnnual total compensation ratio and annual total compensation percentage increase ratio\n\nIberdrola\u2019s Corporate Governance Model provides for the existence of a holding company, Iberdrola S.A., and for country subholding companies in the main countries in which it does business, as shown in the \u201cCorporate and governance structure, ownership and legal form\u201d section of the chapter and described on the Company\u2019s website.\n\nThe main countries in which the Iberdrola group does business are Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States, Brazil and Mexico, where the compensation remuneration ratios are set forth in the table below.\n\n| Country | Highest level of remuneration | Annual total compensation ratio | Annual total compensation percentage increase ratio |\n|---------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n|         |                               | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n| Spain   | Director                       | 23.34  | 23.85  | 24.35  | 0.12   | -4.20  | 0.00   |\n| United Kingdom | CEO                  | 19.94  | 22.18  | 18.56  | -1.23  | 7.31   | -2.71  |\n| United States | CEO                  | 11.14  | 12.53  | 1.24   | N/A    | 11.16  | N/A    |\n| Brazil  | Director                       | 29.02  | 28.57  | N/A    | 0.90   | N/A    | 0.29   |\n| Mexico  | CEO                            | 23.84  | 29.08  | 24.21  | -0.89  | -31.77 | N/A    |\n\nAt the consolidated level, the total annual remuneration ratio for the highest-paid employee in the organisation with respect to the median total annual compensation of all employees (including the highest-paid individual) was 30.13.\n\nEthics and integrity\n\nPolicies and protocols\n\n| GRI 205 2-23 |\n\nThe Compliance System of the group\u2019s companies is structured around: (i) certain regulations approved by the Board of Directors of Iberdrola, S.A., which form part of the Governance and Sustainability System; and (ii) supplementary regulations developed and approved by the Compliance Unit, pursuant to the powers vested therein by the Regulations of the Compliance Unit, which prepares and approves supplementary regulations that are also binding for all of the group\u2019s employees.\n\n---\n\n78 Spain: Iberdrola, S.A.; Iberdrola Espa\u00f1a; Iberdrola Energ\u00eda Internacional.

For the purpose of developing the Crime Prevention Policy, the companies of the group have implemented a set of measures making up the Crime Prevention Programme, which has been implemented at each country subholding and head of business company, all within the framework of the process of review and adjustment to the most recent changes to the Spanish Criminal Code following the introduction of criminal liability for legal entities, without prejudice to the legal provisions applicable in any other jurisdiction in which the company does business.\n\nTo implement these Crime Prevention Programmes, there is a regular evaluation of the risks of committing criminal acts that might ultimately be alleged against the various companies of the group based on their activities, as well as an identification of existing controls and the establishment of new controls for the prevention thereof.\n2. The Compliance Unit and the compliance divisions regularly update the compliance risk map following the guidelines established in the Compliance Risk Evaluation Guide established by the Compliance Unit, as well as an identification of the likelihood of each risk occurring and the impact that this would have.\n\nThese risk maps are drawn up based on an inventory of homogeneous risks for the boundary of the Group using a common methodology. The risks to be assessed are grouped into the three categories in which the compliance function has been assigned the following competences: (i) crime prevention; (ii) separation of activities; and (iii) securities market, as shown in the table below:\n\n| Risks                                      | Crime prevention | Separation of activities | Securities market |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|\n| Corruption and fraud                       | Scope            |                          | Market abuse      |\n| Money laundering and terrorist financing    | Effective separation |                        | Inadequate custody of information |\n| Market abuse                               | Brand image      |                          | Information to the regulator |\n| International sanctions                    | Costs for common services |                  | Updating records |\n| Scams                                      | Management independence |                      |                   |\n| Permits, licences and authorisations       | Commercially sensitive information |                |                   |\n| Fraud against public authorities and social security | Independent monitoring |                |                   |\n| Punishable insolvencies                    | Network access   |                          |                   |\n| Intellectual and industrial property       | Price discrimination |                      |                   |\n| Smuggling                                  |                  |                          |                   |\n| Unfair trade practices                     |                  |                          |                   |\n| Distortion of public information           |                  |                          |                   |\n| Data prevention                            |                  |                          |                   |\n| Cybercrime                                 |                  |                          |                   |\n| Business secrecy                           |                  |                          |                   |\n| Occupational risk prevention               |                  |                          |                   |\n| Workers\u2019 rights                            |                  |                          |                   |\n| Obstructing external monitoring            |                  |                          |                   |\n| Safety at facilities, the environment and public health |                  |                          |                   |\n| Consumer protection                        |                  |                          |                   |\nEach compliance division analyses whether there are signs of these risks in their respective country subholding companies, head of business companies and in each of the corporate and business areas. With the information obtained, a compliance risk map is prepared for each entity, which is updated on a regular basis, identifying the main controls in the scope of the group to mitigate such risks and, if necessary, proposing improvement actions to strengthen the effectiveness of these controls.\n\nAlthough Iberdrola, S.A. and the other Spanish companies are not subject to Law 10/2010 on anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing (the \"Money Laundering Act\") and, therefore, this Act and the formal and administrative obligations imposed thereunder on certain groups do not apply to them, the risk of perpetration of money laundering offences is contemplated as part of the Crime Prevention Programme of such companies.\n\nHowever, Iberdrola Inmobiliaria, S.A.U. is subject to the Money Laundering Act due to the nature of its activities, and therefore, in addition to the aforementioned preventive controls, this company has implemented additional specific controls primarily aimed at preventing this type of crime. By way of example, the company has approved rules like the Procedure to Prevent Money-Laundering and Terrorist Financing, Contract Approval Endorsements, the Leased Assets Billing Procedure and Payment Order Validation monitoring.\n\n**Communication and training related to anti-corruption rules**\n\nTraining and communication are two fundamental pillars of the Compliance System to ensure that all of its professionals are aware of and comply with the *Code of Ethics*.\n\nWithin this context, the Compliance Unit and the compliance divisions plan their training and communication activities on an annual basis in collaboration with the corresponding human resources and communications divisions.\n\nCorporate policies, including the *Anti-Corruption and Anti-Fraud Policy* and the *Crime Prevention Policy*, as well as the *Code of Ethics*, are available on the corporate website and on the employee portal.\n\nThe protocols and other procedures approved by the Compliance Unit are available on the employee portal and are circulated by email to all departments where these procedures may be applicable.\nThe table below shows the training hours associated with the various training activities carried out in 2022.\n\n| Country       | Leadership | Qualified Technicians | Skilled workers and support personnel | Total |\n|---------------|------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|-------|\n| **Spain**     | 680        | 4,209                 | 3,407                                  | 8,296 |\n| **United Kingdom** | 8          | 300                   | 75                                     | 383   |\n| **United States** | 352        | 3,149                 | 4,323                                  | 7,824 |\n| **Brazil**    | 407        | 2,025                 | 7,437                                  | 9,869 |\n| **Mexico**    | 12         | 130                   | 94                                     | 236   |\n| **IEI**       | 1,545      | 10,374                | 15,367                                 | 27,286|\n| **Iberdrola total** | 1,545      | 10,374                | 15,367                                 | 27,286|\n\n| Country       | Number of employees trained | Percentage of total workforce | Number of employees trained | Percentage of total workforce | Number of employees trained | Percentage of total workforce |\n|---------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| **Spain**     | 680                         | 68.3                          | 508                         | 43.6                          | 517                         | 43.2                          |\n| **United Kingdom** | 8                      | 2.3                           | 14                          | 1.7                           | 673                         | 87.3                          |\n| **United States** | 352                     | 100.0                         | 330                         | 100.0                         | N/Av                        | N/Av                          |\n| **Brazil**    | 407                         | 100.0                         | 379                         | 97.7                          | 338                         | 96.3                          |\n| **Mexico**    | 12                          | 12.0                          | 38                          | 40.4                          | 109                         | 100.0                         |\n| **IEI**       | 1,545                       | 67.8                          | 1,313                       | 45.3                          | 1,679                       | 57.7                          |\n| **Iberdrola total** | 1,545                   | 67.8                          | 1,313                       | 45.3                          | 1,679                       | 57.7                          |\nMonitoring\n\nGrievance mailboxes of the group\n\n- **GRI 2-26**\n\nOne of the basic elements of the Compliance System are the detection and/or monitoring mechanisms allowing for verification of the effectiveness of the controls and prevention activities carried out at the group. These mechanisms include the ethics mailboxes for professionals, which are tools that can be used to make queries or report conduct that may involve the commission of any improper conduct or any act contrary to law or the rules.\n\nThe group also has suppliers\u2019 ethics mailboxes. These mailboxes are communication channels to enable the suppliers of the group, as well as any companies that they subcontract, their respective employees and companies that have participated in a tender, to report conduct that might entail (i) violation by any group professional of the Governance and Sustainability System, the *Code of Ethics* or applicable law, or (ii) the commission by a supplier, its subcontractors or the respective employees thereof of any act contrary to law or to the provisions of the section of the *Code of Ethics* applicable to suppliers within the framework of their business relations with the group. These mailboxes are available in the purchasing portal of the website.\n\nThe group also has a shareholders\u2019 ethics mailbox. This mailbox represents a channel of communication through which shareholders can report conduct that might involve a breach of the company\u2019s *Governance and Sustainability System* or the commission by any professional of the group of an act contrary to the law or to the rules of conduct of the *Code of Ethics*. This mailbox is available on the group\u2019s corporate website, specifically within the interactive system provided for the shareholders known as \u201cOLS \u2013 Shareholder\u2019s Club\u201d.\n\nResponse and remediation plans\n\n- **GRI 205-3**\n\nA total of 2,938 communications were received through the ethics mailboxes in financial year 2022, of which 1,551 were queries and 1,387 were complaints. Of the 1,387 complaints received, 885 were accepted for processing. In 5% of the cases of complaints allowed to proceed, some type of disciplinary measure was taken upon a showing that there had been improper conduct or conduct contrary to the *Code of Ethics*. Of the total of 885 complaints that were accepted for processing, 433 were classified as having a potential impact on human rights.\n\nInformation regarding the existence of cases of corruption during the financial year\n\nThe Company confirmed the existence of one case of corruption reported through the ethical mailboxes during financial year 2022. After the relevant internal investigation, it was found that a Neoenergia employee had solicited financial consideration from a customer in exchange for providing improper preferential treatment in the terms of a contract. The employee was dismissed in application of the internal disciplinary regime.\n\nIn March, the company learned of a complaint filed with the Romanian Organised Crime and Terrorism Investigation Department (DIICOT) pursuant to which it was confirmed that an investigation had commenced based on a complaint filed by Eolica Dobrogea SRL, C-Tech SRL, Corneliu Dica and Ms Ceausescu against Iberdrola, S.A., Iberdrola Renovables Energ\u00eda, Iberdrola Renovables Internacional, Iberdrola Renovables Rumania, and ED1.\nDIICOT is a division of the Romanian public prosecutor\u2019s office in charge of investigating organised crime. This decision from DIICOT only confirms that the complaint was filed and that the work of investigation will commence. It is important to bear in mind that, at this point, no formal accusation has been made against any company personnel or any of Iberdrola\u2019s companies.\n\nProceedings from prior years with an impact on the financial year.\n\nThe Iberdrola group has been working with the courts to clarify the circumstances relating to the hiring of the company Cenyt by some group companies in order to enforce any liabilities that may arise and to defend its good name and reputation.\n\nAfter a long investigation by Central Investigative Court no. 6 of the National High Court, neither Iberdrola, any of the companies of its Group, nor any directors or officers thereof have been found liable in any respect. No Group company is being investigated as part of these proceedings, in which Iberdrola, S.A appeared as an aggrieved party.\n\nIn these proceedings, the chair of the Board of Directors and the other directors and executives, current and former, of Iberdrola, S.A. who had been investigated at any point during the proceedings were all acquitted, with the exception of a former head of security at the company who is no longer associated therewith, and with respect to which an application for dismissal filed with this Court is currently pending resolution. The action for disclosure of trade secrets filed by the Company against another former executive, who is no longer associated therewith and who used to work in the accounting department, is also pending resolution.\n\nAfter a review and analysis of the internal processes performed with the help of independent experts and pursuant to the group\u2019s Governance and Sustainability System and Compliance has not revealed any violation of the internal control systems or of the Code of Ethics or of any other rules or procedures in the engagement of the company Cenyt by certain companies of the Group, without prejudice to the reputational impact of these events on Iberdrola, S.A. or on the companies in its Group.\n\nIn the Castile and Le\u00f3n Wind Farm matter, arising from the claim filed by the Anti-Corruption Division of the Public Prosecutor\u2019s office for alleged crimes committed in obtaining approvals for the building of wind farms in Castile and Le\u00f3n between 2004 and 2009, Investigative Court no. 4 of Valladolid issued an order to commence Oral Proceedings in November 2021, pursuant to which:\n\n1. It orders the commencement of oral proceedings against, among other individuals and as pertains to Iberdrola, three officers of the group, two of whom are no longer associated therewith, for alleged commission of the continuing offence of bribery, requiring each to provide a \u20ac130 million bond. Iberdrola Renovables Energ\u00eda provided three corporate guarantees, each in the amount of \u20ac130 million, as a personal bond payable upon demand, to cover the monetary penalties that might apply, thus lifting the freeze on the accused officers\u2019 assets.\n\n2. Alt orders the commencement of oral proceedings against Iberdrola Renovables Castilla y Le\u00f3n (IBERCYL) for subsidiary civil liability, in the amount of \u20ac11,257,500, jointly and severally with the Castile and Leon Government. IBERCYL initially challenged the measure imposed, which was denied by Order of 18/11/2022. with respect to which IBERCYL filed an appeal for reconsideration (recurso de reforma), which has not yet been decided. As of today, no security has yet been provided.\nPublic policies\n\nRelations with regulatory entities and social institutions\n\n\u25a0 GRI 415\n\nIberdrola has two kinds of relationships with regulatory entities:\n\n- Relationships geared towards contributing to the enactment of efficient regulatory provisions allowing for the development of a competitive market in activities that are not subject to a natural monopoly, and sufficient remuneration for regulated businesses. To that end, there is a continuous and constructive dialogue where information, knowledge and positions are exchanged. Iberdrola is thus acquainted with the concerns and proposals of regulatory entities and provides them with its own positions in the legitimate defence of its interests and those of its shareholders and customers.

Financial\nFor Iberdrola, ESG issues are integrated into its strategy and operations and are therefore directly linked to its financial performance. This approach, which the company calls ESG+F, is reflected in its activities and business model. Thanks to this consistency between growth and financing strategy, the company has direct access to the capital market and is a recognised leader as an issuer of green and sustainable financial instruments.\n\nThis commitment is reflected in the inclusion within the group\u2019s ESG objectives of two objectives relating to the financing strategy that will enable the company to continue to lead the green bond and sustainable financing market.\n\n| GOALS                  | METRIC                        | 2022 | 2025 | 2030 | Related SDGs |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------|------|------|------|--------------|\n| SUSTAINABLE FINANCE    |                               |      |      |      |              |\n| Green financing frameworks | Annual review and update (if applicable) | \u2713    | \u2713    | \u2713    | 3 6 7 10 15 |\n| ESG financing          | % of ESG financing            | 82%  |      |      | 3 6 7 11 14 |\nV.1.

An example of this, Iberdrola\u2019s strategic commitment to a sustainable, safe and competitive energy model that makes it possible to fight climate change has resulted in more than \u20ac140,000 million of investments over the last 20 years. This activity, measured for financial year 2021, has generated a total annual employment impact of some 400,000 direct, indirect and induced jobs worldwide, contributing more than \u20ac37,000 million to global GDP annually, and making a total annual tax contribution, including direct and indirect taxes, of more than \u20ac15,300 million.84\n\nGRI 201-1\n\nDirect economic value generated, distributed and retained (\u20ac millions)\n\n| Iberdrola consolidated total | 2022 | 2021 | Reference to Financial Statements |\n|-----------------------------|------|------|----------------------------------|\n| Revenue (+)                 | 53,949 | 39,114 | Note 3785 Revenue |\n| Other operating income (+)  | 602 | 705 | P&L85 Other operating income (excluding grants) |\n| Results from equity accounted investees (+) | 261 | 34 | Note 15a85 Positive results from equity accounted companies |\n| Finance income (+)          | 1,009 | 1,114 | Note 4285 Finance income (without including capitalised finance expenses and income (excluding capitalised interest expense and discounting of provisions to present value) |\n\nDirect economic value generated 55,821 40,967\n\n| Supplies (-)                | 33,750 | 22,052 | Note 3885 Supplies |\n| External services (-)       | 3,550 | 2,878 | P&L85 External services (excluding donations) |\n| Losses from equity accounted investees (-) | 115 | 72 | Note 15a85 Negative results from equity accounted investees |\n| Shareholders (-)            | 1,295 | 799 | SCF86 Dividends paid |\n| Minority interests (-)      | 721 | 467 | P&L85 Non-controlling interests |\n| Interest on subordinated debt (-) | 169 | 94 | SCF86 Subordinated perpetual bonds |\n| Finance expenses from lease liabilities (-) | 2,928 | 2,157 | Note 4285 Financial expense (excluding Financial Restatement of Provisions) |\n| Employee remuneration (excluding company social security costs) (-) | 2,995 | 2,684 | Note 3985 Staff costs (excluding employer's social security and activated staff costs) |\n| Payments to government administrations (-) | 3,255 | 3,125 | SNFI-SR Fiscal responsibility |\n| Community investments (verified according to the LBG Model) (-) | 52 | 58 | SNFI-SR Contributions to society |\n\nEconomic value distributed (-) 48,830 34,386\n\nEconomic value retained (=) 6,991 6,581\n\nDuring the period, Iberdrola made gross investments totalling 10.730 million87.\n\n---\n\n84 PwC study \u201cEconomic, social and environmental impact of Iberdrola worldwide\u201d (based on 2021 data).\n85 Consolidated income statement\n86 Consolidated statement of cash flows\n87 Total amount includes all investments involving cash outflows or debt assumed.\nFinancial assistance received\n\nFinancial assistance received by the Iberdrola group is shown in the following table on a consolidated basis:\n\n\u25a0 GRI 201-4\n\n| Financial assistance (\u20ac millions) | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|-----------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Capital subsidies                 | 1    | 8    | 8    |\n| Operating subsidies               | 18   | 6    | 3    |\n| Investment tax credits\\(^{88}\\)   | 0    | 0    | 0    |\n| Production tax credits\\(^{89}\\)   | 209  | 164  | 135  |\n| Assistance for other items included in the GRI Protocol | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| **Iberdrola total**               | **228** | **178** | **146** |\n\n\u25a0 GRI 203\n\nIn addition to the direct economic impacts that occur as a result of the cash flows that are generated, the Iberdrola group also induces additional effects or indirect economic impacts such as those described below:\n\n\u25a0 GRI 203-2\n\nFrom an economic standpoint, the expansion of electricity systems drives the regional economy in the region where it occurs and creates employment opportunities, contributing to economic and social enhancement.\n\nThe positive effects at the local level include, among others, improvement of the economy and employment (direct and indirect), revitalisation and repopulation of underpopulated rural areas, generation of fees, taxes and duties at the different stages of activity and areas of operation, training of professionals, support of local communities through various sponsorship initiatives, promotion of economic development, and improvement in the quality of life through electrification, energy efficiency projects, waste revaluation, etc. For example, the Sikuli programme in Mexico to promote social entrepreneurship.\n\nLikewise, and at a general level, renewable projects help to reduce the overall CO2 emissions of the energy mix of the country where they are implemented, contributing to the decarbonisation not only of the region where they are located, but also of the country and the planet as a whole, thus helping to curb global warming and supporting each country\u2019s decarbonisation targets. In addition, the Challenge Resilience and Challenge Fires projects have been launched to work with start-ups to find innovative solutions for distribution infrastructure.\n\nPotentially negative effects, which the company seeks to avoid, can be considered to include the following:\n\n- Environmental risks, which may give rise to undesirable consequences for the environment, such as spills and improper emissions, or waste management.\n- The impact on terrain of the facilities, especially large ones, and the possible negative effects (during construction or operation) on traditional activities, particularly in the rural environment, such as ranching, hunting or fishing.\n\n\\(^{88}\\) Investment tax credits.\n\\(^{89}\\) Production tax credits.\nGRI 203-1\n\nDuring the construction and operation of its facilities, Iberdrola also carries out certain infrastructure activities that are unrelated to its facilities, but rather that are intended to meet the needs of the social environment, resolving existing shortcomings in the local communities.\n\nA summary of these projects with strong social impact during 2022, is provided below:\n\n- Improvement of paths and walkways, leading to a better quality of life for residents in the surrounding area.\n- In the United Kingdom, there are continuing activities to improve various infrastructure and to make landscape improvements for the enjoyment of people near the various production centres. The Networks Business in the United Kingdom has developed the Little Kerse project, in the total amount of \u00a3389,000, thus completing the last project financed by the Green Economy Fund. A campaign to provide advice and support to vulnerable local communities in their path towards Net Zero has been launched through the Net Zero Transport Fund.\n- In Brazil, the Quilombola culture programme is of particular note, especially the construction of the headquarters of the Quilombos de Santa Rosa Community Association, intended to serve as a direct communication channel to convey information, give support to the community, and answer questions. Moreover, in 2022 the Energy Museum opened again, through the restoration of a historic building in Pelourinho, Salvador (BA), in which it is intended to bring the world of energy closer to society and promote knowledge of this world.\n- In Mexico, an annual social contribution is made to the communities surrounding the projects. It is based on the following criteria: culture, sport, health, education and social development. In parallel, repairs are made to the roads used for on-site Operation and Maintenance tasks, and by local residents. The Ricardo Flores primary school in Lalaxo was also repaired.\n- Finally, there is the partnership with Hydrographic Confederations and other entities in Spain, especially those focused on environmental issues, to enable various activities near hydroelectric reservoirs by adjusting flows at certain times.\n\nCompliance with laws and regulations\n\nGRI 2-27\n\nInformation on significant non-monetary sanctions and fines due to non-compliance with laws or regulations is presented below:\n\n| Significant instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Significant instances for which non-monetary sanctions were incurred (no.) | 22   | 24   | 18   |\n| Significant instances for which fines were incurred (no.) | 261  | N/Av.| N/Av.|\n| Total                                                        | 283  | N/Av.| N/Av.|\nOut of the total significant incidents for which non-monetary sanctions were incurred (22 incidentes) one took place in Spain, 12 in Brazil, one in the United States, and eight pertain to Iberdrola Energ\u00eda Internacional. 101 resulted in fines in Spain, 69 in the United States, 131 in Brazil, and one in Mexico.\n\n### Fines for instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\n| 2022 | No. | Monetary value (\u20ac) |\n|------|-----|-------------------|\n| Fines paid, imposed during the financial year | 201 | 4,101,055 |\n| Fines paid, imposed in previous financial years | 81 | 1,762,217 |\n| Total | 282 | 5,863,272 |\n\nIn Brazil, 10 fines totalling \u20ac118,644 were imposed during the financial year, and 21 fines totalling \u20ac933,082 imposed in previous financial years were paid, all of them imposed on the Networks Business, for infringement proceedings related to state and municipal taxes as well as for various consumer protection-related matters.\n\nIn the United States, 35 fines totalling \u20ac3,566,113 imposed were imposed and paid during the financial year, \u20ac3,135,094 of which were imposed on the Networks Business for a fine pertaining to the final settlement of a violation of the Connecticut Order to proactively and directly contact customers to provide them with information regarding the COVID-19 Payment Program.\n\nNote 44 of the 2022 Consolidated Annual Financial Report provides detailed information on the significant contingent assets and liability of the Iberdrola group relating to those judicial and extrajudicial disputes in the ordinary conduct of business (which may be disputes with suppliers, customers, administrative or tax authorities, private citizens, environmental activities, or employees). The opinion of the Iberdrola group\u2019s legal advisors is that the outcome of these disputes will not significantly affect its financial situation.\n\n### ESG Finances\n\nIn keeping with its sustainable business model, Iberdrola is positioned as one of the world\u2019s leading and pioneering business groups in ESG financing. This has the threefold objective of (i) aligning its financial strategy with its purpose, values and investment strategy, (ii) optimising the cost of its debt, and (iii) diversifying its sources of financing, transforming sustainability into both an end and a means to the financial strength it pursues and which characterises it.\n\nIberdrola demonstrates this commitment to ESG financing in the various regions in which it operates and through the different instruments and formats it uses to finance itself.\n\nThe ESG financing subscribed by the IBERDROLA Group in 2022 amounts to \u20ac9,512 million, with the group\u2019s ESG Financing portfolio totalling \u20ac48,473 million. The breakdown by product is as follows:\nESG Financing of the group 2022\n\n|                      | New financing 2022 | Portfolio at year-end 2022 |\n|----------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Green**            |                    |                           |\n| Bonds                | 6,017              | 26,956                    |\n| Bank loans           | 3,237              | 17,668                    |\n| Multilateral loans   | 991                | 2,857                     |\n| Loans with development banks and ECAs | 1535 | 2,666 |\n| Structured financing | 254                | 3,389                     |\n| **Sustainable**      |                    |                           |\n| Credit facilities    | 3,495              | 21,517                    |\n| Loans                | 2,500              | 15,272                    |\n| Commercial paper programmes | 995 | 1,245 |\n| **ESG total**        | 9,512              | 48,473                    |\n\nGreen finance transactions\n\nThe group has signed new green finance transactions in 2022 in the total amount of \u20ac6,017 million. This brings the total amount of green finance at the end of 2022 to \u20ac26,956 million.\n\nThe differentiating feature of this financing is the commitment to use the funds obtained for projects with a positive impact on the environment, including renewable energy, expansion and digitalisation of electricity transmission and distribution grids, researching new, more efficient technologies, and the smart mobility projects in which Iberdrola invests. The company also commits to provide annual reports, through various indicators, on the environmental return generated by these projects, so that investors can be aware of their level of contribution to the environmental improvement achieved.\n\nThe funds secured through all of these operations have gone towards financing or refinancing investments in projects that meet certain environmental and sustainable development criteria, as described in the relevant Green Financing Frameworks of Iberdrola, AVANGRID and Neoenergia. These Frameworks are aligned with the Green Bond Principles (\u201cGBP\u201d) established by the International Capital Markets Association (ICMA) and have the Second Party Opinion of a renowned international expert regarding their alignment with the GBP in all cases.\n\nGreen bonds\n\nIn the capital markets, Iberdrola is the world\u2019s leading private group in terms of green bonds issued. The company issued its first green bond in 2014, and since then has intensified its financing through this type of instrument, with many more issues and in various areas: both public and private issues, involving senior and subordinated debt (hybrid bonds) issued by the Corporation or other subsidiaries (AVANGRID green bonds and Neoenergia green debentures and all other companies under these sub-groups).\n\n---\n\n90 Including 100% of green financing with partners, in the amount of \u20ac2,416 million.\n91 Iberdrola Framework for Green Financing, AVANGRID Framework for Green Financing and Green Finance Framework do Grupo Neoenergia.\nAs a Corporation, Iberdrola engaged in four new green bond issues in 2022, three of them for senior debt and a fourth one structured as a bond whose yield is linked to the price of Iberdrola\u2019s shares (equity-linked):\n\n- In March, \u20ac1,000 million of 10-year bonds were issued, and which were allocated to the financing of the St. Brieuc (France) and Baltic Eagle (in Germany) wind farm plants, both under construction.\n- In November, there was an issuance of \u20ac1,500 million, structured into two tranches: \u20ac750 million for a six-year term and \u20ac750 million for a 10-year term. The funds obtained from both transactions were allocated to the financing of renewable assets (mainly photovoltaic solar energy) in Spain and other European countries.\n- In November there was another issue in the amount of \u20ac450 million, which was drawn down in December. This is a five-year bond linked to the price of Iberdrola\u2019s shares. The funds obtained were allocated to financing the investment plan for the Networks business in Spain during the 2021-2023 period.\n\nAt AVANGRID, Central Maine Power issued a green mortgage bond in July in the amount of US$125 million (\u20ac118 million). The funds obtained were allocated to Networks projects.\n\nAt Neoenergia, Neoenergia Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Brasilia, Neoenergia Celpe and Neoenergia Elektro issued three green debentures in July in the combined total amount of R$950 million (\u20ac169 million). The funds obtained were allocated to Networks projects.\n\nAt year-end 2022, Iberdrola has a total of 19 current green bonds issued by the Corporation in the total amount of \u20ac14,197 million. The Green Financing Returns Report contains information and details on all outstanding financing during 2022.\n\nIn addition, Iberdrola, through its subsidiary AVANGRID and several of its subsidiaries, has green bonds outstanding in the US market in the combined amount of US$2,850 million (\u20ac2,678 million) aimed at financing renewable and distribution projects in the United States. Information and details on this financing is described in the AVANGRID 2022 Sustainability Report.\n\nNeoenergia and its subsidiaries also have green financings outstanding on the capital markets, totalling R$4,445 million (\u20ac793 million), earmarked for financing renewable and transmission or distribution projects in Brazil. Information and details on this financing is described in the Sustainability Report.\n\n**Bank loans**\n\nIn the banking market, Iberdrola received the first green loan obtained by an energy company in 2017, which was followed by other green transactions. In 2018 Iberdrola M\u00e9xico, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Iberdrola, executed the first green corporate loan in Latin America for US$400 million, which was used to refinance the company\u2019s renewables assets in Mexico. In May 2022 Iberdrola M\u00e9xico extended the maturity of this green loan for an additional year, until May 2024.\nMultilateral loans\n\nWith regard to multilateral green loans, in May 2019, Iberdrola obtained its first green loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and since then has continued with the signing of a number of corporate green loans. These public institutions have their own standards for evaluating projects and for allocating green instruments. All of the assets financed by these institutions are also included as projects capable of green financing within the framework of Iberdrola\u2019s green financing.\n\nIn 2022, the Corporation signed four green loans with the EIB totalling \u20ac893 million:\n\n- \u20ac53 million to partially finance the building of a 20 MW industrial facility for the production of green hydrogen through water hydrolysis, to manufacture ammonia. This loan also financed a 100 MW photovoltaic plant, a battery storage system, and a number of supplementary facilities.\n- \u20ac550 million, for the development of a portfolio of wind farm and photovoltaic solar projects located in Spain.\n- \u20ac220 million, to modernise, automate and adapt distribution networks to the electrification of consumption.\n- \u20ac70 million, for the development of a 188 MW portfolio of photovoltaic solar projects located in Portugal.\n\nIn 2022, Coelba, a member of the Neoenergia Group, increased its green financing with a \u201cSuper Green Loan\u201d from the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, in the amount of R$550 million (\u20ac98 million) to finance improvements to and the expansion of transmission networks and their digitisation.\n\nFurther details on these green operations and their sustainability returns can be found in Report on Green Financing Returns. Further details on these green operations and their sustainability returns can be found in Neoenergia Sustainability Report (for transactions carried out by Neoenergia and subsidiaries).\n\nLoans with development banks and ECAs\n\nIn April 2022, Iberdrola signed a loan for \u20ac35 million with the Spanish Official Credit Institute (ICO) to partially finance, together with the EIB, the building of 20 MW industrial facilities for the generation of green hydrogen through water hydrolysis, to manufacture ammonia. These loans also finance a 100 MW photovoltaic plant, a battery storage system, and a number of supplementary facilities.\n\nIberdrola has continued to diversify its sources of financing, establishing new trade relations with Export Credit Agencies (ECAs). These Credit Agencies have insurance policies that assure very high percentages of the financings, thus enabling Iberdrola to diversify its sources of financing and reduce the consumption of risk with banking institutions.\n\nIberdrola has thus carried out two operations totalling \u20ac1,500 million in 2022:\n\n- In April 2022, Iberdrola signed a green loan for \u20ac1,000 million with Banco Santander. This loan is secured by the Danish Export Credit Agency EKF to finance goods of interest to Denmark. The funds will go towards onshore and offshore wind farms with Vestas or Siemens Gamesa turbines. The wind farms are included in various European countries.\n\u2022 In October 2022, Iberdrola signed a \u20ac500 million green loan with:\n  \u2022 Caixabank for \u20ac250 million.\n  \u2022 BNP Paribas for \u20ac250 million.\n\nThe loan is guaranteed by the Spanish Export Credit Agency CESCE, with backing from the Spanish government, and falls within its green policy, to finance investments to help to mitigate climate change. The loan will be used for investment in photovoltaic and wind renewables, batteries and transport networks in Portugal, the United Kingdom and Poland.\n\nAll of the assets financed by these institutions are included as projects capable of green financing within the framework of Iberdrola\u2019s green financing.\n\nMore details on these green operations and their sustainability returns can be found in the Report on Green Financing Returns (for financing by the Corporation).\n\n**Structured finance**\n\nIn 2020 Iberdrola signed its first green Project Financing through its 63.55%-owned subsidiary Iberdrola Renovables de la Rioja, S.A., provided by BBVA in the amount of \u20ac23.3 million, to refinance 12 wind farms in La Rioja, which was repaid in 2022.\n\nIn 2021 Iberdrola signed two green Project Finance agreements through its subsidiaries Parques E\u00f3licos Alto Layna, S.L.U and Energ\u00edas Renovables Ibermap, S.L., 20% owned subsidiaries of Iberdrola, provided by BBVA in the amount of \u20ac106\\(^2\\) million, and by BBVA, Banco Santander and BNP in the amount of \u20ac191.8\\(^3\\) million, respectively, to refinance wind farms in Spain.\n\nMore details on these green loans and their sustainability returns can be found in the Report on Green Financing Returns.\n\nIn 2022 AVANGRID increased its financing under the form of Green Tax Equity Investment by $271 million (\u20ac254 million) through two new transactions, Lundhill and the Amendment to the Aeolus VIII portfolio, with Tax Equity Investment investors. Information and details on these financings is described in the AVANGRID 2022 Sustainability Report.\n\n**Financial transactions linked to the achievement of sustainable objectives**\n\nThe group has also formalised other financing agreements with the ESG label. These are sustainable financings that, rather than earmarking funds, link certain elements of the instrument to sustainability metrics or the achievement of strategic objectives aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These include the group\u2019s loans to manage and optimise its liquidity, called commercial paper, a very short-term financing instrument.\n\nAs in the case of green financing transactions, the financial transactions linked to the achievement of sustainable objectives are also certified by an independent expert in terms of the established metrics and their alignment with targets established with the company\u2019s sustainable strategy and with the Sustainability-Linked Loan Principles (SLLP).\n\n---\n\n\\(^2\\) Outstanding balance of the Alto de Layna loan at 31/12/2022: \u20ac86 million. The Parques E\u00f3licos Alto de Layna loan had a Second Party Opinion from G-Advisory. Parques E\u00f3licos Alto de Layna is a company in which Iberdrola owns a 20% interest.\n\n\\(^3\\) Outstanding balance of the Energ\u00edas Renovables Ibermap loan at 31/12/2022: \u20ac126 million. The Energ\u00edas Renovables Ibermap loan had a Second Party Opinion from G-Advisory. Energ\u00edas Renovables Ibermap is a company in which Iberdrola owns a 20% interest.\nCredit facilities linked to sustainable objectives\n\nAt year-end 2022, Iberdrola, through the Corporation and AVANGRID, has a number of credit facilities in the aggregate amount of \u20ac15,272 million, with the cost linked to achieving sustainable objectives. The main objectives established in these credit facilities are associated with environmental and social KPIs:\n\n- \u20ac2,500 million sustainable syndicated credit facility and \u00a516,000 million bilateral credit facility, the maturities of which were extended in 2022 by an additional year until 2027:\n  - Environmental KPI: intensity of CO\u2082 emissions, measured in grams per kilowatt hour produced (g/kWh).\n  - Social KPI: percentage of women in leadership positions.\n- \u20ac1,500 million sustainable syndicated credit facility:\n  - Environmental KPI: Renewable capacity installed within the group.\n  - Social KPI: number of people in developing countries benefiting from electricity access.\n- \u20ac5,300 million sustainable syndicated credit facility:\n  - Environmental KPI: intensity of CO\u2082 emissions, measured in grams per kilowatt hour produced (g/kWh).\n\nIn 2022 a new and innovative facility was signed in the amount of \u20ac2,500 million, linked to the company\u2019s water footprint through two sustainability indicators:\n\n- Environmental KPI: amount of water consumed by the Group in its own or controlled production facilities and not returned to the environment, measured in cubic metres (m\u00b3) per gigawatt hour (m\u00b3/GWh) of energy produced.\n- Environmental KPI: rating assigned to Iberdrola by the independent agency CDP Water.\n\nIberdrola is aware of the importance of water usage in the management of its activities, and wants to significantly contribute to SDG 6: \u201cClean water and sanitation\u201d.\n\nFurthermore, in 2021 AVANGRID extended the maturity and limit of the syndicated credit facility signed in 2018 until 2026 and up to US$3,575 million respectively, maintaining the initial indicator that requires reducing CO\u2082 emissions.\n\nBank loans linked to sustainable objectives\n\nIn 2022 Iberdrola signed bank loans in the aggregate amount of \u20ac995 million, linked to the following indicator relating to water management:\n\n- Environmental KPI: amount of water consumed by the Group in its own or controlled production facilities and not returned to the environment, measured in cubic metres (m\u00b3) per gigawatt hour (m\u00b3/GWh) of energy produced.\n\nIn addition, in 2021 Iberdrola obtained the first loan in the European energy sector linked to a reduction in water consumption, in the amount of \u20ac250 million. The loan includes an incentive linked to meeting certain circular economy objectives.\nESG commercial paper\n\nOn 15 April 2021 Iberdrola formalised the update of its framework programme for the issuance of short-term notes in the Euromarket (ECP), increasing the maximum outstanding limit to \u20ac5,000 million (from the previous figure of \u20ac3,000 million) and incorporating the sustainable label linked to the achievement of three objectives associated with the areas of the ESG strategy:\n\na. Environmental: intensity of CO2 emissions, measured in grams per kilowatt hour produced (gr/kWh) (contribution to SDGs 7, 13).\n\nb. Social: Percentage of women in positions of leadership in the company (contribution to SDG 5).\n\nc. Governance: Implementation of the eleven recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (\u201cTCFD\u201d) (contribution to SDG 16).\n\nTaxonomy\n\nThis section complies with the reporting obligations established by Article 8 of EU Regulation 852/2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investments, supplemented by Delegated Regulation 2139/2021, which determines eligible activities with respect to climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives, and in accordance with Delegated Regulation 2178/2021, which develops the reporting methodology.\n\nUnder this regulatory framework, companies are required to report their eligibility and alignment through three economic indicators; as a percentage of turnover, investment and operating expenditure.\n\nIn 2022 the reporting obligations led to the publication of the eligibility percentage (which had already been reported at year-end 2021), and, for the first time, of the percentage alignment for the three economic indicators and for all the activities carried out by the company.\n\nEvaluation of eligibility, compliance with substantial contribution criteria, no significant harm, and existence of social safeguards\n\nThe activities carried out by the Iberdrola group companies have been evaluated with respect to the mitigation objective for purposes of eligibility and alignment. Thus, no amounts have been assigned to the climate change adjustment goal to avoid double accounting.\n\nThe first step is to determine which of the Iberdrola group\u2019s activities are eligible for purposes of the regulation. Eligible activities are those that could potentially contribute to one or more of the EU\u2019s environmental goals, and are described in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139.\nAnalysing the activities carried out by the Iberdrola group, and taking as a reference the descriptions included in Annexes I and II of the Delegated Regulation, the list of eligible activities of the Iberdrola group is as follows: 3.1 Manufacture of hydrogen, 4.1 Electricity generation using photovoltaic solar technology, 4.3 Electricity generation from wind power, 4.5 Electricity generation from hydropower, 4.9 Transmission and distribution of electricity, 4.1 Storage of electricity, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, and 7.6 Energy Efficiency, Installation, maintenance and repair of: charging stations for electric vehicles in buildings, instruments and devices for measuring, regulation and controlling energy performance of buildings, and renewable energy technologies.\n\nThe second step is to analyse how each activity does or does not meet the substantial contribution requirements.\n\nFor an activity to be considered aligned it must satisfy the technical criteria of substantial contribution to an environmental objective. For these purposes, Iberdrola has assessed compliance with these criteria for each head of business company, which has been documented in the company's records.\n\nThe third step is to assess how each activity meets, or does not meet, the criteria of no harm to other environmental objectives. The design of these criteria established by the delegated regulation is generally based on compliance with European regulations and/or standards for different environmental aspects. In order to assess and document compliance with these criteria at each head of business company, many of which operate in non-EU countries, the group has developed a methodology based on transferring requirements to surveys, which has enabled the work to be carried out in a homogeneous manner throughout the group. Each head of business company has assessed its compliance and has documented and evidenced its findings.\n\nThe fourth and final step is the assessment of the existence of sufficient social safeguards in the context of performing the activities. A similar approach to the no harm assessment has been followed and, based on an analysis using surveys and the group's existing human rights due diligence mechanisms, the existence of social safeguards has been satisfactorily documented. In this regard, worthy of note is the publication in 2022 of the group's first report on Human Rights, which provides extensive explanations on this issue.\n\nFinally, in order to ensure consistency between the assessment of criteria and actual performance, an analysis of the disclosure of the following indicators has been carried out: GRI 2-27 Compliance with laws and regulations; GRI 205-3 Confirmed incidents of corruption and actions taken; GRI 406-1 Incidents of discrimination and corrective actions taken; GRI 418-1 Substantiated complaints concerning breaches of customer privacy and losses of customer data; GRI 416-2 Incidents of non-compliance concerning the health and safety impacts of products and service; GRI 417-2 non-compliance cases related to product and service information and labelling (fines or penalties); GRI 417-3 Incidents of non-compliance concerning marketing communications (fines or penalties).\n\nThe conclusion is that no inconsistencies can be deduced between the content of these indicators and the assessment of the no injury or de minimis safeguards criteria.\n\nThe criteria applied to calculate the eligibility and alignment percentages are described below.\n\n---\n\n94 This heading includes the following products sold:\nSmart Home: control of the energy consumption of each household appliance, changes in consumption and advice on how to save on bills.\nSmart Mobility: solution for charging electric vehicles with 100% renewable energy. Installation of a charging point, electric contract with zero CO2 emissions and control from mobile phone with the Smart Mobility Home App.\nSmart Solar: complete solar solution, with installation and maintenance of solar panels so that customers can generate their own electricity.\nCalculation of percentage alignment\n\nTo calculate the percentages of alignment with the climate change mitigation objective, rigorous work was carried out in 2022 at the activity and country level to analyse whether the eligible activities\n\n- Substantially contribute to achieving one or more of the six environmental objectives, in accordance with articles 10 to 16;\n- To do no significant harm to the achievement of the other five environmental objectives (principle of do no significant harm), in accordance with article 17;\n- Meet the requirements on minimum workplace safety and human rights at the company level (social protections), in accordance with article 18.\n\nThe basis to calculate alignment percentages is the eligibility calculation, taking the same denominator, but including in the numerator only the applicable revenues, investments or expenses corresponding to the eligible activities that meet the alignment criteria established by the regulations.\n\nIt is important to note that vertically integrated companies in the electricity sector carry out various activities, all of which are necessary for the operation of the electricity value chain.\n\nSome of these activities, like the generation of electricity through wind or photovoltaic technology, or electricity transmission and distribution, are considered eligible in application of Delegated Regulation 2039/2021. However, the sale of electricity to end customers is not considered eligible.\n\nFrequently, when a company both generates electricity and sells it to final customers, there is an inter-company transaction by which the retail activity purchases the electricity from the generation activity.\n\nIn accordance with accounting rules, revenues from the sale of electricity to end customers are part of the consolidated turnover, and the effect of the intra-group transaction is removed in the consolidation process.\n\nIberdrola believes that, in order to most accurately reflect the alignment of its operations with the EU sustainable activities Taxonomy, the numerator in the income ratio should include sales from the renewable production business. Otherwise, the ratios would describe a company that, despite demonstrating an extremely high percentage of its investments and operational expenses in line with the taxonomy, would have an extremely low percentage of income alignment on a permanent basis.\n\nRevenues from Generation of electricity from renewable sources is considered in the numerator, and corresponds to that indicated in Note 37-Revenue, included in the Annual Financial Information of Iberdrola S.A. and its subsidiaries.\n\nConsidering all the above, to ensure the consistency between the reality described by the income ratio and that described by the investment ratio and the operating expenses ratio, the information given in this section has been provided as follows:\n\nCalculation of the percentage of eligible turnover\n\nThe proportion of eligible Turnover referred to in Article 8(2a) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 is calculated as the share of net turnover resulting from products or services, including intangibles, associated with economic activities that are eligible according to the taxonomy (numerator), divided by the net turnover (denominator) as defined in Article 2(5) of Directive 2013/34/EU.\nTurnover includes revenue recognised in accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 1, paragraph 82(a), as adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1126/2008.\n\nTherefore, for the calculation of the eligibility percentages corresponding to the consolidated Iberdrola group, and included in the table above:\n\n- The numerator includes the sum of the Turnover (group 70 ledger accounts of the Spanish General Accounting Plan) of the activities of the companies/subgroups that are eligible and,\n- The denominator corresponds to the Iberdrola group\u2019s total amount of turnover.\n\nIn this turnover ratio, the company includes all the income associated with the main activity, considering that it contributes to the turnover.\n\nCalculation of the percentage of eligible CapEx\n\nThe eligible CapEx ratio referred to in Article 8(2b) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 is calculated as the numerator divided by the denominator; the denominator being the additions to tangible and intangible assets during the relevant financial year before depreciation, amortisation and any new valuations, including those resulting from revaluations and impairments, for the relevant financial year, excluding changes in fair value. The denominator also includes additions to tangible and intangible assets resulting from business combinations.\n\nFor non-financial companies applying International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by Regulation (EC) No 1126/2008, CapEx should cover costs that are recognised according to:\n\na. IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment, paragraph 73(e)(i) and (iii);\nb. IAS 38 Intangible Assets, paragraph 118(e)(i);\nc. IAS 40 Investment Property, paragraph 79(d)(i) and (ii) (for the cost model);\nd. IFRS 16 Leases, paragraph 53(h)\n\nLeases that do not give rise to the recognition of a right to use the asset are not accounted for as CapEx.\n\nThe numerator, on the other hand, includes the part of the fixed asset investments included in the denominator that:\n\na. Relates to assets or processes that are associated with eligible economic activities;\nb. Forms part of a plan to expand the economic activities aligned with the taxonomy or to enable economic activities eligible under the taxonomy to be brought into line with the taxonomy in the future (\u201cCapEx plan\u201d) under the conditions specified in the second paragraph of this point 1.1.2.2 (relating to the \u201cCapEx plan\u201d);\nc. Relates to the purchase of production from economic activities aligned with the taxonomy and individual measures that enable the targeted activities to become low-carbon or achieve greenhouse gas reductions, in particular the activities listed in points 7.3 to 7.6 of Annex I of the Annexes to the Delegated Act, as well as other economic activities listed in the Delegated Acts adopted pursuant to Articles 10(3), 11(3), 12(2), 13(2), 14(2) and 15(2) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and provided that those measures are implemented and operational within 18 months.\nTherefore, for the calculation of the eligibility percentages corresponding to the consolidated Iberdrola group, and included in the table above:\n\n- The numerator includes only the CapEx aggregation of the activities of the companies/subgroups considered eligible and,\n- The denominator corresponds to the Iberdrola group's total CapEx, which includes investments (on an accrual basis with current or future disbursement) in intangible assets, investments in property, plant and equipment, investments in rights-of-use assets, and investments. CapEx includes the work carried out by the company for its fixed assets and capitalised financial expenses.\n\nFor the purpose of reporting the CapEx and OpEx ratio, purchases of assets necessary to carry out a particular eligible aligned, eligible and non-eligible activity have been included.\n\n**Calculation of the percentage of eligible OpEx**\n\nThe eligible OpEx ratio referred to in Article 8(2)(b) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 is calculated as the numerator divided by the denominator; the latter including non-capitalised direct costs associated with research and development, building renovation measures, short-term leases, maintenance and repairs, as well as other direct costs related to the day-to-day maintenance of tangible fixed assets, by the company or a third party to whom activities are outsourced, and which are necessary to ensure the continuous and efficient operation of those assets.\n\nIn addition, non-financial companies that apply national GAAP and do not capitalise right-of-use assets are required to include leasing costs in OpEx.\n\nThe numerator, on the other hand, includes the part of the operating expenses included in the denominator that:\n\n- Relates to assets or processes associated with eligible economic activities including training and other human resource adaptation needs, and non-capitalised direct costs representing research and development;\n- Forms part of the CapEx plan to expand the economic activities that are eligible in accordance with the taxonomy or to enable economic activities eligible under the taxonomy to be aligned with the taxonomy within a pre-defined timeframe, as set out in the second paragraph of this point 1.1.3.2 (relating to the \u201cCapEx plan\u201d);\n- Relates to the purchase of production from economic activities aligned with the taxonomy and individual measures that enable the targeted activities to become low-carbon or achieve greenhouse gas reductions, as well as individual building renovations, as identified in the Delegated Acts adopted pursuant to Articles 10(3), 11(3), 12(2), 13(2), 14(2) or 15(2) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and provided that those measures are implemented and operational within 18 months.\n\nTherefore, for the calculation of the eligibility percentages corresponding to the consolidated Iberdrola group, and included in the table above, for the OpEx indicator the denominator includes the OpEx accounts that meet the criteria specified by the regulations.\n\n- The numerator includes only the CapEx aggregation of the activities of the companies/subgroups considered eligible and,\n- The denominator corresponds to the Iberdrola group's total CapEx, which includes investments (on an accrual basis with current or future disbursement) in intangible assets, investments in property, plant and equipment, investments in rights-of-use assets, and investments. CapEx includes the work carried out by the company for its fixed assets and capitalised financial expenses.\nFor the purpose of reporting the CapEx and OpEx ratio, purchases of assets necessary to carry out a particular eligible aligned, eligible and non-eligible activity have been included.\n\nFinally, the controls that ensure the homogeneity of currencies, accounting criteria and the avoidance of duplicate amounts or intercompany balances are the controls carried out during the process of preparing the audited consolidated financial statements of the Iberdrola group. In addition, Registration and Presentation controls have been included in the files prepared to obtain the data referring to the Taxonomy.\n### Proportion of turnover from products or services associated with economic activities that comply with the taxonomy/disclosure for 2022\n\n| Economic activities | Code | Absolute turnover (\u20ac thousands) | Proportion of turnover (%) | Substantial contribution criteria | No significant harm criteria (\u201cDo no significant harm\u201d) |\n|---------------------|------|---------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n|                      |      |                                 |                           | Climate change mitigation (%)    | Climate change adaptation (%) | Adaptation to climate change (Y/N) | Water and marine resources (Y/N) | Circular economy (Y/N) | Pollution (Y/N) | Biodiversity and ecosystems (Y/N) | Minimum guarantees (Y/N) | Proportion of the turnover that complies with the taxonomy (%) | Proportion of the turnover that complies with the taxonomy (%) | Category (enabling activity) (E) | Category (transitional activity) (T) |\n| A.

Scope of information\nIntroduction on the scope of information\n\nIberdrola has followed the GRI recommendations for defining the boundary of this report, taking into account the entities over which it has control, those over which it has significant influence, and those activities that are significant for the group from the economic, environmental and social standpoint.\n\nFor purposes of this report, the following terms have the meanings set forth below:\n\n- \u201cIberdrola\u201d or the \u201ccompany\u201d: the Spanish company Iberdrola, S.A., parent company of the Iberdrola group.\n- \u201cIberdrola Group\u201d or the \u201cgroup\u201d: Iberdrola (as parent company) and the group of subsidiaries over which Iberdrola has the power of control or joint control.\n- \u201cMinority-owned companies\u201d (or \u201cinvestees\u201d): the group of companies in which Iberdrola has a percentage interest but not the power to exercise control. At these minority-owned companies Iberdrola promotes the policies approved within the group through the governance bodies of such companies and includes information on those considered significant in terms of sustainability.\n\nThe document Consolidated Financial Statements, Consolidated Management Report, and Audit Report for financial year 2022 lists all of the companies in which Iberdrola has direct or indirect ownership interests.\n\nInformation boundaries of this report\n\nTime scope\n\n- GRI 2-3\n\n2022.

The supply to these markets has not been considered as an activity in the wholesale market.\n\n96 With regard to co-controlled subsidiaries, such as companies owning nuclear generation assets, in addition to installed capacity and production indicators, other indicators are reported where considered relevant.\n3. Environmental information on sales activities in Germany is not consolidated, because it is not yet integrated into the corporate systems as at the date of preparation of this report. It will be included in future reports to the extent the systems collect this information. These activities are not considered to be material in the context of the group.\n\n4. It includes the activities of hydroelectric, wind and solar generation. Environmental information on construction projects is not included, except in the area of biodiversity.\n\n5. Any reference to the 7th Collective Bargaining Agreement includes the following companies at 31 de diciembre de 2022: Iberdrola, S.A., Iberdrola Espa\u00f1a, S.A.U., Iberdrola Generaci\u00f3n, S.A.U., Iberdrola Generaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1a, S.A.U., Iberdrola Generaci\u00f3n Nuclear, S.A.U., Iberdrola Clientes, S.A.U., Iberdrola Operaci\u00f3n y Mantenimiento, S.A.U., i-DE Redes El\u00e9ctricas Inteligentes, S.A. (Sociedad Unipersonal), Iberdrola Infraestructuras y Servicios de Redes, S.A.U., Iberdrola Renovables Energ\u00eda, S.A.U. and Iberdrola Ingenier\u00eda y Construcci\u00f3n, S.A.U.\n\n6. The environmental performance of solar activities is not included in Brazil.\n\n7. Renewables activities in Cyprus are included in Greece.\n\n8. Activities related to the Saint Brieuc offshore facility, currently under development, as well as Aalto Power's assets.\n\n9. Activities are not significant from the environmental standpoint. Labour information is included in the information for the United States.\n\n10. Other countries: Bulgaria, Qatar, Netherlands, Japan, South Africa, Norway, Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam, Morocco. In social information relating to people (excluding salary remuneration data), Belgium, Qatar, Hungary, Japan, Latvia, Romania, Singapore, Vietnam, Taiwan, Sweden and South Korea are reported. These countries are not included in the environmental information or the other social information as the activities are not considered relevant in terms of sustainability.\n\nAt affiliate nuclear plants, the percentage interest held by Iberdrola in each of them is used to consolidate environmental performance data: Vandell\u00f3s (28%); Almaraz (52.69%); Trillo (49%) and Asc\u00f3 (15%). For social information, on the other hand, because of the structure of the available information systems, nuclear plants are consolidated according to the percentage interest held by Iberdrola in the economic interest grouping created for that purpose; such interest is 51.44% in the case of Trillo-Almaraz and 14.59% in the case of Asc\u00f3-Vandell\u00f3s. A 50% share of the environmental and social data corresponding to the activities of Nuclenor, S.A. is applied according to the participation method.\n\nSummary of the information boundaries by country\n\nFollowing the GRI recommendation, the information in this report is structured by country. The table below shows the structure of information by country applied to the boundaries described above:\n\n| Structure of information by country in this report |\n|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Report boundary (Iberdrola Total) = Iberdrola, S.A., controlled subsidiaries and co-controlled affiliates considered to be significant for sustainability purposes. |\n| Spain |\n| United Kingdom |\n| United States |\n| Brazil |\n| Mexico |\n| IEI Germany, Australia, France, Greece (includes Cyprus), Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania |\n| (*) IEI also includes Belgium, Bulgaria, Qatar, Japan, Latvia, Singapore and Vietnam in the social information relating to people. |\n| Global boundary (consolidated Iberdrola Total) = report boundary plus the information of affiliates consolidated by the equity method that are not considered significant for purposes of this report. |\n| Information reflected in the corporate boundary of the Consolidated Financial Statements. |\nLimitations on the scope of information\n\nIberdrola believes that this report reflects the economic, environmental and social performance of the company in a reasonable and balanced manner, on the understanding that the exceptions to the scope of the report described in the table \u201cSignificant countries and activities for the Iberdrola group in terms of sustainability and included in the 2022 reporting boundary\u201d do not significantly alter the consolidated indicators and therefore do not affect the reader's assessment of the company's performance.\n\nExplanatory footnotes are added in case a particular indicator could not be compiled in accordance with the reporting boundary.\n\nSignificant changes to the organisation and its supply chain\n\n- **GRI 2-3 2-6**\n\nChanges in activities and/or in operations\n\nIn the course of their business, the various subsidiaries and affiliates of Iberdrola have engaged in transactions that change the composition of their assets in 2022, including the following:\n\n- In the Retail Business, the largest complex in Europe for green hydrogen for industrial use has been built. The plant has a capacity of 20 MW of electrolyzers and is fed from a 100 MW photovoltaic solar plant with 20 MWh of battery storage capacity. The complex will supply green hydrogen to produce green fertilisers at the Fertiberia plant.\n- In the Renewables Business, the following notable corporate transactions were carried out during the year:\n  - In the United States, AVANGRID Renewables restructured Vineyard Wind, LLC in a joint venture with Copenhagen Infrastructure (CIP). After the operation, AVANGRID Renewables owns 100% of lease area 534, housing the Park City Wind (804 MW) and Commonwealth Wind (1,200 MW) projects, and CIP owns 100% of lease area 522.\n  - In Australia, Iberdrola Renovables Australia acquired the rights to the Mount James wind farm (1,000 MW) in Queensland, a region which the company believes will play a significant role in achieving the objective of decarbonising the country\u2019s economy.\n  - In the United Kingdom, an agreement has been reached for the purchase of seventeen photovoltaic solar energy projects, with an aggregate capacity of more than 800 MW. Contracts have been concluded, separately, with the companies Elgin Energy, the owner of 12 projects, and Lightsource BP, which controlled the rest.\n  - In Poland, Iberdrola has concluded a preliminary agreement for the acquisition of two wind farms and six photovoltaic plants, a total of 98 MW, with the company Augusta Energy sp. z o.o., a joint venture of Greenvolt\u2019s subsidiary V-ridium Power Group and the asset manager KGAL.\n\u2022 In Brazil, Neoenergia has reached an agreement for the exchange of assets with Eletrobras. In the exchange, the company will receive 49% of the Dardanelos hydroelectric plant, and will come to hold 100% of the share capital, consolidating the plant as a major asset. It will also include 0.04% of Coelba, Cosern, and Afluente distributors. Eletrobras will receive 51% of the shares in the Teles Pires hydroelectric plant and 51% of the shares in Baguari. The exchange will occur in 2023.\n\n\u2022 In Germany, Iberdrola has signed an agreement with Energy Infrastructure Partners (EIP) for the sale of 49% of the Wikinger offshore wind farm, in which Iberdrola will retain a 51% majority share.\n\nIn addition, in January 2023 Iberdrola Renovables Energ\u00eda, S.A. and its subsidiary Iberenova Promociones, S.A. have signed a framework agreement to co-invest in renewable assets in Spain, contributing to accelerating the country\u2019s decarbonisation. The agreement includes the acquisition by NBIM Iberian Reinfra AS (NBIM Iberian), a member of the group headed by Norges Bank, of a 49% share in the capital of several Iberdrola Group companies that own onshore wind and photovoltaic solar projects in Spain. The total project portfolio of these companies totals 1,265 MW (137 MW of which are already operating and 1,128 MW of which are under development). Once NBIM Iberian acquires these shares, Iberenova Promociones and NBIM Iberian will contribute their respective shares in the project owners to a holding in which each company will also hold respectively a 51% and 49% capital share.\n\nIberdrola Renovables Energ\u00eda will continue to retain indirect control over the project owners and manage the development of non-operational projects until they commence commercial operation and, and the Iberdrola Group will continue to provide the operation and maintenance services required for the operation thereof. The agreement provides that the parties can expand it to other renewable assets in addition to those making up its initial boundary perimeter in Spain or in other countries.\n\nChanges in capital structure\n\nThe shareholders acting at the General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting of Iberdrola held on 17 June 2022 approved two increases in capital by means of a scrip issue in order to once again implement the Iberdrola Retribuci\u00f3n Flexible, optional dividend system, implementing the first increase in capital in July 2022 and the second in February 2023. To offset the dilutive effect of the capital increases and to maintain earnings per share, a capital reduction was implemented in July 2022 under the terms approved at the aforementioned Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nChanges in supply chain\n\nNew market conditions, mainly affected by the war in Ukraine, have driven the raw materials market upwards. This has particular impact on the gas chain due to the high prices of this raw material in Europe, as well as the increase in the purchase prices of new equipment, materials and works.\nVI.2. Defining report content. Materiality Analysis\nIberdrola directly identifies material aspects for its Stakeholders and for the company itself, by preparing its own materiality study, with the advice of an independent outside firm, based on in-house and outside sources.\n\nIberdrola has evolved in the methodology of this study this year, taking into account the recommendations of the GRI standards and considering the contents of the latest draft standards published by EFRAG. This methodological evolution maintains the dual materiality approach applied in the past, and thus considers both the impacts that the company might have on the economy, the environment and people, including human rights, and the (positive and negative) impacts that a material issue might have on Iberdrola.\n\nThe methodology applied, which is described below, considers the nature of the industry in which the company operates, the activities it performs, the policies that it applies in the field of sustainable development, long-term objectives, particularly ESG objectives, and its engagement with its Stakeholders. It is described in three phases: identification of material issues, evaluation of external impacts, and evaluation of internal impacts.\n\n1. Identification of material issues\n\nDuring this phase, different sources of information were analysed to obtain a list of potential issues, e.g. issues that might pose a risk to the company (negative impact) or constitute an opportunity (positive impact), both for stakeholders (external impact) and for the Company (internal impact) over a time period of one to three years. The sources of information used included:\n\ni. Internal sources of information including documents like the Statement of Non-Financial Information - Sustainability Report 2021, the Integrated Report, the Iberdrola\u2019s Corporate Policies, the corporate website...\n\nii. External sources of information included the latest public reports from major influencers, including the European Commission, the World Economic Forum, and the International Energy Agency.\n\nThe issues identified as significant in the Iberdrola global stakeholder engagement model were later analysed, cross-comparing these issues with the sustainability aspects already identified.\n\nThese sources have led to a list that brings together the results of the sources of information used (internal, external, and Global Stakeholder Engagement Model).\n\n2. Evaluation of external potential impacts (non-financial materiality)\n\nTo evaluate external potential impact, external and internal sources were used, as in the identification phase, and the following steps were taken:\n\ni. The potential impacts and opportunities for each of the previously identified material issues were identified, considering at this point the main Stakeholders affected.\n\nii. An impact assessment scale was defined, based on EFRAG recommendations as well as on the GRI standards, considering the potential severity and associated likelihood.\n\niii. To calculate severity and likelihood, preferentially qualitative judgments based on the sources used were applied.\n3. Evaluation of internal potential impacts (financial materiality)\n\nTo evaluate internal potential impact, preferential internal sources were used, and the following steps were taken:\n\ni. The potential impacts (risks and opportunities) for each of the previously identified material issues were identified.\n\nii. An impact assessment scale was defined, based on EFRAG recommendations as well as on the GRI standards. The same negative impact and opportunities scale was used as in the analysis of external impact.\n\niii. The organisations in charge of managing the risks and opportunities identified analysed them, documenting their conclusions by means of structured surveys.\n\niv. Finally, the results of all the above were consolidated and standardised. This consolidation included, as additional information, the evaluation in the Global Stakeholder Engagement Model, which is widely deployed in the group and is informed by areas and businesses.\n\nAs a result of all the above, it is concluded that the material issues continue to be those identified in previous years, namely the following 18 issues:\n\n- **GRI 3-2**\n\nAll material issues identified are listed in the \"GRI Content Index\" section of this chapter, and the information presented on each material issue can be found in the corresponding chapter of this report.\nGRI 2-12\n\nThe Board\u2019s Sustainable Development Committee oversees the process and results of the materiality study of which this report is part, and informs the Board of Directors, which prepares this Statement of Non-Financial Information, containing the list of material issues shown in the figure above, on 22 December 2022.\n\nMore detailed information on the most relevant issues for the company's stakeholders can be found in the \"Stakeholder Engagement\" section.\nVI.3.
