Our full assurance statement can be found in the appendix of this report.\nA Letter from our President and CEO \u2013 Hassane El-Khoury\n\nThe challenges of the last two years have certainly been daunting; yet despite the ongoing battle against the pandemic, volatile geopolitical events and the unpredictable supply chain constraints, I am encouraged by so many companies, including onsemi, that are diligently solving the biggest challenges and transforming industries while continuing to emphasize the commitment to create a better world for tomorrow.\n\nonsemi is committed to developing strategies and programs to address global climate change \u2013 including introducing methods to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and our impact on air, water and waste. In addition, onsemi is developing technology and semiconductor products that enable our customers to achieve their own sustainability goals. Our strategy delivers intelligent power and sensing solutions for the sustainable ecosystem including electric vehicles, energy infrastructure, factory automation and advanced safety applications.\n\nTo address our carbon footprint, we have pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040. Net-zero emissions require an ambitious 1.5\u00b0C target aligned with climate science for emission reductions across a company\u2019s full value chain, and further, ensures direct emissions will not contribute to a global temperature rise exceeding 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial times.\n\nWe have set one of the most ambitious goals in our industry and with this commitment we will surpass the Paris Agreement\u2019s goal by a full decade. While it\u2019s aggressive, we know that it\u2019s the right thing to do for us, for our customers and for generations to come.\n\nSince celebrating my first-year anniversary with onsemi, I have taken time to reflect upon our accomplishments \u2013 and while there is a lot to be proud of, I keep coming back to the same conclusion: onsemi is made up of the smartest and brightest minds from all around the world. Our employees, and the ongoing contributions from each one, are our greatest asset \u2013 and together, we will continue to create innovative technologies and positively change the world as we know it.\n\nI am proud to share that onsemi was awarded eight accolades for 2021 including being listed on Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America for the fourth consecutive year. In 2022 \u2013 for the seventh consecutive year, we were named one of the World\u2019s Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere; for the fifth consecutive year, we were named part of Barron\u2019s 100 Most Sustainable Companies; and for the third consecutive year, one of Newsweek\u2019s America\u2019s Most Responsible Companies \u2013 to name a few. While I am incredibly humbled by these accomplishments; we are not done.\n\nThrough 2022 and beyond, we will continue to focus on sustainable manufacturing \u2013 concentrating on emissions reduction, energy and water conservation, material optimization and recycling. We will also continue to focus on sustainable products as we innovate and introduce technologies that enable reduced global energy use while supporting our customers to meet and exceed global energy efficiency standards. And we will continue to drive sustainable practices to challenge and enable employees to embody our values and act sustainably in both work and personal aspects as we believe that every action counts in contributing to the greater good.\n\nAt onsemi, we are one team working together with our customers and partners for a better tomorrow. Together, we are solving the world\u2019s greatest challenges through technical innovation and delivering leadership products for sustainable outcomes. We understand that even the smallest actions can make a positive and meaningful difference. I believe deeply in this company\u2019s future and our employees who are passionately committed to doing what\u2019s right \u2013 today, tomorrow and for decades to come.\n\nHassane El-Khoury\nPresident and CEO, onsemi\n2021 was an exciting year for onsemi. The company went through a massive transformation and started to focus on a winning strategy relative to its business operations. In addition, onsemi committed to be net-zero by 2040. Why did onsemi choose this goal?\n\nFor years, onsemi has had a dedicated CSR team guiding our practices around the triple bottom line \u2013 people, planet, and profit. The company has won many accolades over the years for our continued commitment to ESG initiatives. However, we know that addressing global climate change is the challenge of our time. As average temperatures rise, climate science finds that acute hazards such as heatwaves and floods are growing in frequency and severity, and chronic hazards, such as drought and rising sea levels continue to increase at alarming rates. These acute and chronic hazards have a significant impact on human development and economic productivity, including supply chain disruptions, damage to owned operations and endangerment, death or injury to people in impacted communities. At onsemi, we\u2019re creating a future we want to live in. We understand that the contributions we make today can have an impact on the world tomorrow. We knew we needed to address climate change more directly and strategically, thus our net zero goal was born.\n\nHow does this goal support the fight against climate change? How is this goal different than some of the other commitments in the semiconductor industry?\n\nonsemi\u2019s net zero by 2040 goal demonstrates leadership in addressing climate change by focusing on how we can make a difference. Our goal aligns with the Paris Agreement and ensures direct emissions will not contribute to a global temperature rise exceeding 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial times. Climate scientists have determined that warming above 1.5\u00b0C can have profound impacts on our planet, including loss of biodiversity, ocean acidification and impacts on agriculture yields. Our net-zero goal differs from some of the other commitments in the semiconductor industry by prioritizing deep decarbonization in our operations and investment in renewable energy before purchasing carbon offsets. Most companies have a commitment to be carbon neutral which allows them to continue to emit as much as they would, like as long as they purchase carbon offsets equal to the amount they emit. At onsemi, we feel it\u2019s important to address the root cause. We don\u2019t want to use a Band-Aid on a bullet hole and instead define a concrete plan that ensures our actions are solving the problem at hand.\n\nWe understand the big picture goal \u2013 net-zero by 2040 \u2013 but can you tell us how onsemi plans to get there? What are some of your short-term goals?\n\nWe realize this is a big commitment and we are taking the time to build a solid roadmap to ensure we achieve this goal. We acknowledge we still have a lot of work to do \u2013 Rome was not built in a day! In 2021, we focused on vetting the correct goal and strategy for our business. We worked with BSR, a global nonprofit that works with companies to develop sustainable business strategies and solutions, to develop this goal and build our strategy. Additionally, we took time to educate our internal teams and ensure they understand how this goal will impact them \u2013 whether they are in global supply chain, finance or product development. We also needed to ensure we had the correct team in place to lead this strategy. Now that we have built this strong foundation, we are mapping out our roadmap to 2040 and determining what annual targets are needed to meet our goal. Additionally, we are preparing to commit to the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) and plan to do so by the end of 2022. Our SBTi commitment ensures our goals are based on the latest climate science and will prevent the worst effects of climate change.\n\nWe also acknowledge that this goal is hyper-focused on emissions and the environmental side of ESG. We are working with our internal teams to develop more granular goals around topics like diversity, equity and inclusion, supplier selection, employee learning and development, data security, anti-corruption, water and waste management and global giving to ensure we are incorporating the social and governance sides of ESG within our strategy.\n\nonsemi has many products that support a more sustainable future. Can you tell us about a technology you\u2019re excited about?\n\nAt onsemi, we provide intelligent sensing and power solutions to help our customers solve the most challenging problems and create cutting-edge products for a better future. Our intelligent power technologies accelerate automation and enable efficient power production, distribution and consumption in the automotive and industrial sectors. Silicon carbide (SiC) is a key component of next-generation semiconductors that provides sustainable technical benefits and improves system efficiency in many applications, including electric vehicles (EVs), EV charging and energy infrastructure. SiC supports the electrification of the automotive industry and allows for lighter and longer-range electric vehicles.\n\nIn 2021, we completed our acquisition of GT Advanced Technologies Inc. (GTAT), a producer of SiC. onsemi customers will benefit from GTAT\u2019s extensive experience in crystalline growth as well as its impressive technical capabilities and expertise in the development of wafering ready SiC. We intend to scale and accelerate GTAT\u2019s development of SiC to assure customers\u2019 supply of critical components and further commercialize intelligent power technologies.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nWe have a long journey ahead, but we have a great group of leaders and employees that are passionate and able to help us meet our goals. Whether it\u2019s investing in infrastructure to help us reduce our emissions at the facility level, designing cutting-edge technologies to help our customers improve sustainable efficiencies in their products or ensuring our internal workforce consists of diverse talent, we strive to keep ESG top of mind in everything we do at onsemi. Our annual sustainability report will give an in-depth look at our achievements thus far and highlights the key performance indicators we are tracking to ensure we are achieving our goals. We are looking forward to what\u2019s to come and invite you to follow along on this journey \u2013 we know it will be one exciting ride! To learn more, please visit onsemi.com/tomorrowtoday.\nAt onsemi, we understand that we cannot solve tomorrow\u2019s problems with yesterday\u2019s thinking. We employ innovative thinking that delivers cutting-edge technology to solve the world\u2019s most challenging problems. Our products and technologies enable our customers to deliver on the promise of a more sustainable future.

Committing to a Responsible Business\n   - Ethics and Compliance\n   - Supply Chain Management\n   - Fair Treatment\n   - Information Protection\nIn 2021, onsemi announced our goal to be net-zero by 2040. This commitment will guide how we operate our business over the coming years and is essential to ensuring we operate in a socially thoughtful and environmentally responsible manner. This goal reaffirms our commitment to our planet and requires that we take fundamental responsibility for its well-being. Our actions today can have a lasting impact on our planet and people for generations to come. We want that impact to be positive and plan to achieve this by being a net zero company.\n\nOur net-zero goal is one of the most ambitious goals among our competitors within the semiconductor industry with $5-10B annual revenue. This net-zero commitment will surpass the Paris Agreement\u2019s goal by a full decade. We will be using 2022 as our baseline year and will base all reduction targets off our total emissions in this year.\n\nOur emissions data is verified by a third-party company, Trucost, a subsidiary of S&P Global, is a leader in carbon and environmental data and risk analysis. Our full assurance statement can be found in the appendix of this report.\n\nIn addition, our corporate social responsibility team works closely with our environmental health and safety (EHS) and facilities teams to ensure processes and frameworks are in place to measure our progress against our net-zero goal. Our annual Sustainability Report will be a key resource for tracking our progress.\n\nNet-Zero Commitment\n\nWe are implementing an aggressive strategy to reach this goal. Our strategy is categorized into three pillars:\n\n**Capitalize on Efficiencies**\n- Further investments in facilities, processes and equipment to increase energy efficiency\n- Explore opportunities to mitigate process gas usage\n- Identify areas where improved efficiencies can reduce raw material, fuel and resource usage\n\n**Transition to Renewable Energy**\n- Transition to an emissions-free renewable energy portfolio\n- Commit to 50% renewable energy by 2030 and 100% renewable energy by 2040\n- Join the Clean Energy Buyers Alliance to support the rapid transition to a cleaner energy future\n\n**Purchase Offsets and Influence**\n- For non-electricity emissions that cannot be eliminated, over the long-term, onsemi will purchase certified offsets equal to the amount of such emissions\n- Green-E and Gold Standard certified offsets are most credible and will be prioritized\n- Leverage our Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) membership to engage supply chain stakeholders on emissions reductions\nProtecting our Planet and Environment\n\nOur promise for a brighter tomorrow\n\nEmissions and Energy Consumption\nWater and Waste Management\nEnvironmental Compliance\nProduct Stewardship\nWe are dedicated to reducing our energy consumption and overall carbon footprint in alignment with our net-zero by 2040 goal. As stated in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report, it is unequivocal that human activities related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. This warming has created widespread and rapid changes around the world that include rising sea levels, melting glaciers and more frequent extreme weather events. Climate change is undeniable, and the main driver of climate change is human-based activities.\n\nIncreasing energy demands and GHG emissions are driving a global mandate for energy efficiency and reduced emissions, including the replacement of fossil fuels by clean alternative energy sources. Government regulations for improved energy efficiency in countries such as the U.S., United Kingdom, France and China are further enforcing this mandate. Fortunately, our comprehensive portfolio of intelligent power and sensing technologies is designed to minimize power consumption and improve energy efficiency. Examples of these products include solar inverters, efficient motors for fans, HVAC units, power tools, power conversion (as a part of the shift toward renewable energy), electric cars and products that assist with the transition from coal to renewables.\n\nAt onsemi, we take climate change seriously. For years, we have taken steps to reduce GHG emissions and energy consumption throughout the company\u2019s operational footprint. We measure and report Scope 1 and 2 emissions at our manufacturing sites along with select categories of Scope 3 emissions. We know that what gets measured is managed. Our Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) management team has implemented policies and procedures to ensure our manufacturing sites are reporting accurate and complete data on a quarterly basis as it relates to emissions and energy consumption. To keep our carbon accounting cohesive across all operational activities, onsemi reports all emissions on a carbon dioxide equivalent basis (CO\u2082e).\n\nEmissions and Energy Consumption\n\nScope 1 Emissions\n\nScope 1 emissions are direct emissions from company-owned and controlled resources. Some examples of Scope 1 emissions include emissions from fuels used in heating or furnaces and process emissions from process chemicals used in industrial processes.\n\nonsemi directly emits GHG emissions from fabrication and assembly and test locations. We work to eliminate Scope 1 emissions by:\n\n- Installing efficient manufacturing technologies.\n- Exploring eliminating nonessential fluorinated gases and using alternative gases.\n- Exploring the installation of abatement devices that treat the exhaust of gases used in semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nEmissions and Energy Consumption\n\nScope 1 Emissions\n\nTotal Scope 1 GHG Emissions (metric tons of CO\u2082e)\n\n| Year | Total Scope 1 GHG Emissions |\n|------|-----------------------------|\n| 2021 | 2,485,870                   |\n| 2020 | 2,173,461                   |\n\nScope 1 Process Gases by Type (metric tons of CO\u2082e)\n\n| Gas Type | 2021 | 2020 |\n|----------|------|------|\n| Carbon Dioxide (CO\u2082) | 17 | 17 |\n| Tetrafluoromethane (CF\u2084) | 45,499 | 32,012 |\n| Nitrous Oxide (N\u2082O) | 29,722 | 33,153 |\n| Sulfur hexafluoride (SF\u2086) | 979,767 | 920,932 |\n| Nitrogen trifluoride (NF\u2083) | 1,262,444 | 1,083,020 |\n| Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) | 715,545 | 658,844 |\n\nPlease note that each category is shown on an independent scale.\nScope 2 Emissions\nScope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy. For our purposes, this means our purchased electricity. onsemi indirectly emits GHG emissions from electricity purchased for manufacturing.\n\nWe work to reduce Scope 2 emissions by:\n\u2022 Increasing energy efficiency in our manufacturing processes, buildings and operations.\n\u2022 Exploring investments in renewable energy projects around the globe.\n\nScope 3 Emissions\nScope 3 emissions are indirect emissions that occur in the value chain of the company, including both upstream and downstream emissions. Some examples of Scope 3 emissions include business travel, emissions our suppliers create making the products we purchase, employees commuting and emissions from the transportation of our products to the end-user.\n\nCurrently, onsemi only tracks Scope 3 emissions related to our business travel. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen a significant reduction in our business travel-related emissions over the past two years. As the world continues to open up, we expect that figure to increase. Additionally, we expect to have a full Scope 3 inventory completed in 2022.\n\nWe will work to reduce our Scope 3 emissions by:\n\u2022 Collaborating with suppliers to assist them in tracking and managing their own Scope 1 and 2 emissions.\n\nTotal Scope 2 GHG Emissions (metric tons of CO\u2082e)\n\n| Year | Emissions |\n|------|-----------|\n| 2021 | 762,790   |\n| 2020 | 774,849   |\n\nTotal Scope 3 GHG Emissions (Business Travel) (metric tons of CO\u2082e)\n\n| Year | Emissions |\n|------|-----------|\n| 2021 | 817       |\n| 2020 | 1,565     |\n\nEnergy\nEnergy efficiency is central to the success of our products and operations. Along with our products, which help to reduce energy consumption, we regularly implement energy conservation and consolidation projects. Our total energy consumption in 2021 was 1,781,685 megawatt hours (MWh).\n\nAs part of our strategy to achieve net-zero by 2040, we will investigate and invest in renewable and clean energy options in the future. We are exploring options to help us transition to 50% renewables by 2030 and 100% renewables by 2040.\n\nTotal Energy Consumption (megawatt hours)\n\n| Year | Consumption |\n|------|-------------|\n| 2021 | 1,781,685   |\n| 2020 | 1,216,419   |\n\nEnergy Consumption by Source (megawatt hours)\n\n| Source          | 2021       | 2020       |\n|-----------------|------------|------------|\n| Natural Gas     | 173,332    | 166,546    |\n| Diesel Fuel     | 4,335      | 8,357      |\n| Town Gas        | 25,422     | 24,304     |\n| Heavy Oil       | 24,734     | 24,923     |\n| Liquefied Natural Gas | 664.346 | 1,240      |\n\n2021 Total Energy Consumption 1,781,685 MWh.\nHigh purity water is a necessity for semiconductor manufacturing, as it is used in delivering chemicals, washing wafers and many other operations within the fabrication process such as scrubbing the exhaust of our systems to reduce pollution. When the process is complete, the water used in these processes is discharged to waste treatment facilities as non-hazardous industrial waste; most water is supplied to our facilities by third-party resources who report water withdrawal from groundwater or surface water.\n\nTo identify and avoid negative water-related impacts, there are many tools and methodologies used throughout our facilities, including laboratory analysis of both incoming and outgoing water from a facility. This analysis allows for the continued production of high-purity water and ensures against potential negative impacts regarding water waste discharge.\n\nAnother assessment used in identifying potential impacts is comparing our organization to common industry practices and standards. Researching these practices and standards allows us to continue to modernize and develop our methodologies to increase efficiency and decrease negative impacts on our water resources. We work with process and facilities engineers to determine process needs, understand the waste that is produced and effectively utilize our resources to focus on conservation, reduction of chemical usage and effective treatment of water waste. We regularly interface with local regulatory agencies to ensure that usage of water resource and water waste discharge is lawful and does not damage the environment.\n\nWe actively seek to avoid negative water-related impacts. Our organization strives for transparency with stakeholders, displaying deliberate stewardship of water as the important resource it is. Following this, we firmly believe that reduction in water usage enables the shared usage of water resources and reduces cost within process methods; therefore, we continue to seek out water recycling, reuse and reduce options.\n\nAll of our wastewater is treated before it is discharged, and our effluent discharge meets or exceeds local regulations. In 2021, 1,398 megaliters of water were withdrawn from high or extremely high water-stressed regions, out of the total 13,599 megaliters of water withdrawn. We are committed to recycling water and reducing our water consumption. As part of our commitment to water-use efficiency, 5,779 megaliters of water were recycled in 2021. That water recycled is the equivalent of approximately 2,300 Olympic-sized swimming pools. In 2021, we reduced water withdrawal by 4.9% compared to the previous year.\n\n### Water and Waste Management\n\n#### Water Management\n\nHigh purity water is a necessity for semiconductor manufacturing, as it is used in delivering chemicals, washing wafers and many other operations within the fabrication process such as scrubbing the exhaust of our systems to reduce pollution.

Some of these projects led to a reduction in chemical consumption or increase in recycling waste. For example, our sites have implemented projects that expand the lifetime of cleaning baths, modified processes to reduce the volume of chemicals per wafer or installed mini pumps for optimal application of chemicals.\n\nIn 2021, the total amount of hazardous and non-hazardous waste that we recycled from our manufacturing and non-manufacturing sites globally was 18,515 metric tons, while waste directed to disposal was 8,652 metric tons. Our total hazardous waste generated was 9,842 metric tons; this includes both solid and liquid waste, but does not include gaseous emissions, wastewater discharge or any waste associated with on-site wastewater treatment.\n\nDue to a redefinition of waste categorization, the amount of hazardous waste directed to disposal increased from 2020 to 2021.\nIn 2021, approximately 614,000 kilograms of scrap materials and 810 kilograms of precious metals from our worldwide manufacturing facilities were processed, sorted and sold for reuse. The reclamation of these materials recouped more than $26 million USD.\n\nEnvironmental Compliance\n\nAs a sign of our commitment to protecting our environment, we adhere to an increasing number of laws and regulations, including the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH) within our own manufacturing process as well as those of our suppliers. We continuously work with our suppliers to certify that our products are free from any restricted materials and to ensure that all metals utilized in our products are sourced from conflict-free mines. We provide our customers with products and services that are compliant with all applicable electronic product related environmental directives and regulations around the globe and industry environmental best practices.\n\nIn December 2019, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) completed a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Compliance Evaluation Inspection (the \u201cinspection\u201d) of our Gresham, Oregon wafer manufacturing facility. As a result of the inspection, the EPA identified and issued citations with respect to eight violations of the RCRA, including failure to mark, monitor, inspect and keep adequate records with respect to certain waste storage tanks. The notice of violation was completed on April 20, 2021. As a result of these violations, onsemi entered into a consent agreement with a final order date of September 17, 2021.

Beginning in 2022, we introduced a formal goal setting process. This process further defines business priorities and helps employees understand how their contributions impact overall company success.\nEmployee Engagement\n\nEmployees are the company\u2019s number one asset and a key differentiator for the future. Employee feedback informs what we are doing well and where we need to improve. onsemi has developed a listening strategy to gather employee feedback from different channels (e.g., pulse surveys, focus groups, HR mailboxes) throughout the year. One key channel is the employee engagement survey. The company has followed a cadence of conducting a global full census engagement survey once every two years and conducting a total company pulse survey in the off-year to monitor progress on key initiatives and focus areas.\n\nIn 2021 a total company pulse survey was completed by 81% of our employees representing all company locations across the globe. Respondents completed the survey in a variety of ways including online via direct email, mobile device and Beekeeper App (a notification system with the survey link pushed to an employee\u2019s mobile device). The different options helped maximize participation particularly from the employees without regular access to a computer and email.\n\nThe pulse survey consisted of 11 categories including sustainable engagement, communication, inclusion and learning and development. There were 30 questions designed to provide valuable feedback regarding key company strategies and initiatives. Results were analyzed and two key strategic areas scored lower than in the previous engagement survey.\n\nThese two focus areas are:\n- There are no substantial obstacles to doing my job well (Action: Mitigate Obstacles)\n- There is effective sharing of information across business units (Action: Improve cross organization communication)\n\nCompany-wide improvement actions for these two focus areas were identified and will be deployed throughout the year. The improvement actions have been communicated to the company by the CEO in a video and through multiple other employee communication channels. Employees will have an opportunity to provide additional feedback on employee engagement progress through the following company communication channels:\n- CEO live chats\n- Executive skip-levels\n- Employee engagement SharePoint page\n- HR mailboxes\n- Quarterly pulse surveys\n- Company-wide forums (quarterly all-hands meeting)\n\nImprovement targets for the two focus areas have been identified and will be measured in the next engagement survey scheduled in the fall of 2022.\n\nAccording to our employee engagement survey provider, Willis Towers Watson, onsemi is consistently assessed to have a high-performance engagement score when compared to other companies across all industries, putting the company in the high-performance norm distinction.\n\nPulse Survey Highlights\n\nIn 2021 a total company pulse survey was completed by 81% of our employees representing all company locations across the globe.

Our EHS management teams are committed to developing, leading and promoting a culture that supports the EHS management system by protecting employees from reprisal when reporting incidents, hazards, risk and opportunities, ensuring a process for employee consultation and participation and supporting EHS committees.\n\nSafety Standards and Expectations\n\nProcedures regarding emergency preparedness, hazardous materials, industrial hygiene and health resources and safety are standardized throughout our company. We consult with our employees and encourage participation to identify hazards and reduce health and safety risks. Employees are encouraged and incentivized to report unsafe acts or conditions to their management, EHS department or our anonymous ethics helpline. To promote a transparent and reliable culture, information is shared with all sites to further mitigate health and safety risks.\n\nUpon hire, all employees receive safety training and many receive additional safety training depending on their area of responsibility and associated risks. If an incident is to occur, we use 8D protocol and Why-Why analysis to resolve incidents.\n\nBased on our safety culture program, all employees are involved in the discussions and activities concerning safety. There are daily workplace safety inspections performed by employees at their respective areas to ensure there are no unsafe conditions present. If our employees observe unsafe conditions, their duty is to enter them into the system. Supervisors perform the same inspection daily. Managers of the departments discuss safety matters with their staff weekly and site top managers are required to do so monthly. Employees are encouraged to indicate safety issues or positive observations during these meetings. Lastly, we implemented a peer-to-peer job safety review program in all factories so employees can provide effective feedback to each other regarding unsafe habits, acts or conditions.\nImpacting Our Community through Giving\n\nToday\u2019s world requires a new mindset and approach to address and support the ongoing challenges facing people and communities every day. This new mindset required us to embark on a bold new approach that would transform our giving program and ignite a positive change to drive an even deeper impact in the future. As a result, we rebranded our global giving program under our new Tomorrow, today campaign. This rebranding initiative required us to place a short pause on our global giving efforts in 2021 so that the enhanced program could be unveiled in early 2022 offering exciting opportunities and new ways of giving. As part of the redesign, the corporate social responsibility (CSR) team looked at the best ways to make effective contributions globally while further engaging employees. Additionally, throughout the redesign process, the company strategically reserved $3M in 2021 to support future giving activities.\n\nIntroducing the new onsemi Giving Now program\n\nWith the unveiling of our new global giving program, called \u201cGiving Now,\u201d we enabled a renewed focus at onsemi on the positive social impacts of our giving efforts guided by the passion of our employees and onsemi\u2019s commitment to promoting Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics (STEAM) education, amplifying employees\u2019 time and donations and responding to natural disasters and humanitarian crises.\n\nThe Giving Now program will drive positivity forward by creating meaningful change for our planet and every community that we live and work in around the globe.

The board has at least four scheduled meetings annually where they and the various committees review and discuss reports by management and the performance of the company. Our corporate governance principles further set forth certain requirements under which the board and management operate.\n\nBoard of Directors Summary\n\nThis summary represents the members of onsemi\u2019s Board of Directors and committee representation, effective immediately following the Annual Meeting in May 2022. All directors are independent directors except Hassane El-Khoury, who also serves as the president and chief executive officer of onsemi. We have a board member age limit of 75 years old.\n\n| BOARD MEMBER       | GENDER | AGE | TENURE | COMMITTEES                                      | QUALIFICATIONS |\n|--------------------|--------|-----|--------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Atsushi Abe        | Male   | 68  | 11     | Audit                                        |                |\n| Alan Campbell      | Male   | 64  | 7      | Executive (Chair), Audit, Governance and Sustainability |                |\n| Susan K.

As a reflection of the board\u2019s enhanced focus on ESG matters, the \u201cCorporate Governance and Nominating Committee\u201d was renamed as the \u201cGovernance and Sustainability Committee\u201d in 2021.\n\nAdditionally, the board, in conjunction with the members of the HCC Committee, expanded the formal oversight in managing the company\u2019s approach to human capital management, recognizing the vital role that the company\u2019s workforce plays in generating its financial and operational success. In turn, the former \u201cCompensation Committee\u201d was expressly tasked with oversight of the company\u2019s policies and strategies with respect to human capital and was renamed as the \u201cHuman Capital and Compensation Committee.\u201d\n\nBoard Oversight of ESG\n\nThe GS Committee has the responsibility of overseeing matters related to ESG, unless there is a specific matter connected to ESG initiatives that is assigned to another committee of the Board. For example, the HCC Committee has the responsibility of overseeing the company\u2019s policies and strategies in respect of human capital, which include those regarding diversity, equity and inclusion. Both the GS Committee and the HCC Committee play a role in the company\u2019s management and oversight of diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nThe HCC Committee considers diversity, equity and inclusion in its broader review of pay equity within the company. In turn, the HCC Committee designed certain of the goals tied to the 2021 short-term incentive compensation program to align with organizational improvements to the company\u2019s diversity and inclusion initiative and, in 2020 and certain prior years, elected to use the achievement of a specified level of diversity within the company\u2019s workforce as a performance measure for the compensation of the company\u2019s named executive officers under the company\u2019s short-term incentive compensation program.\nThe mission of our enterprise risk management (ERM) program is to drive strategic capabilities that preserve and create value for our company by embedding a risk-aware decision-making culture across all functions. To that end, we have developed a process and framework to effectively identify, evaluate, prioritize, manage and report key risks that can impact our company\u2019s ability to achieve strategic goals and objectives. We identify critical risks by interviewing key stakeholders within the company and reviewing external research on the risk landscape. The risks identified and prioritized for action are closely tied with the company\u2019s operating and strategic plan. Risk response actions and commitments are tracked for completion on a regular basis. Ultimately, ERM is not considered a separate stand-alone activity, but is rather integrated into the fabric of how we operate and included within the activities and functions we engage in to run our business and successfully achieve our goals and objectives.\n\nManagement Approach\n\nOur ERM program is overseen by a Risk Committee (comprised of the CEO, CLO, CFO and EVP of global operations and manufacturing). To maintain accountability at the highest functional level, Executive Staff members are appointed as Risk Sponsors for individual risks and work with Risk Owners who manage the risk on a day-to-day basis. The board of directors have oversight responsibility as they ensure appropriate risk management systems are in place and that risk-awareness is incorporated in the business strategy and decision-making.\nBusiness Continuity\n\nonsemi understands the importance of business continuity and having systems of prevention and recovery in place to assist with the disruption of business functions and processes that could affect our customers, partners and other stakeholders. Our business continuity program derives from our holistic ERM model, which systematically, consistently and effectively identifies, evaluates priorities and manages key risks and opportunities affecting the company.\n\nWe engage with internal and external industry experts to conduct risk assessments at our facilities and suppliers to identify key risks. The types of risks we face are listed below. Additionally, we mitigate certain risks proactively through the qualification of certain products to a secondary production source.\n\nWe maintain a vigorous process in which we are consistently analyzing risks and working to reduce the likelihood and impact of negative events, while identifying how to capitalize on the opportunities provided by the dynamic market and supply chain in which we operate. We recognize that no amount of mitigation and prevention can stop all negative impact events from occurring. We engage in a robust process of planning for the response and recovery operations required to minimize impact to our customers, partners and stakeholders.\n\nTypes of risks we face include:\n\n- Key Equipment Failures\n- Reoccurring natural disasters\n- Utility interruptions\n- Interruption from externally provided products, processes and services\n- Fires\n- Infrastructure disruptions\n- Cyber-attacks on information systems\n- Labor shortages\n- Pandemic\n\nCurrent Practice\n(Super Typhoon Odette)\n\nIn December 2021, storm warnings were issued by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) \u2013 specifically to Visayas and Mindanao islands. This storm soon escalated into a category 4 typhoon as it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility and was named Odette by PAGASA. Super typhoon Odette caused major damage as it traversed the Visayas and Mindanao islands. One of three onsemi assembly and test operations manufacturing sites located in the Philippines is in this region on the island of Cebu. As early warnings were received, the onsemi Cebu business continuity team began holding meetings and preparing for the impact of the storm. Some of the critical tasks were adjusting work schedules, planning factory shutdown, trimming tree branches, emplacing safety nets by windows among other mitigating measures.\n\nFollowing the storm, a state of calamity was declared in the province of Cebu largely in part because of power, water, communications outages (cellular, Internet etc.) and impassable roads throughout the island. Also of impact, onsemi Cebu was constrained by externally provided products and services such as nitrogen, gas and diesel. onsemi Cebu resumed operations on December 17, 2021, but was forced to shut down on December 19, 2021, due to scarcity of water, nitrogen and diesel supply. The business continuity team along with local team support helped to seamlessly transition to the recovery phase of the event. The team solicited support from the local government and vendors who prioritized onsemi Cebu throughout the city\u2019s recovery operations efforts. Critical supplies and services were swiftly reestablished, so the facility was able to restart by December 22, 2021, which resulted in minimal impact to customers.\nOur ethics and compliance programs are designed to assist us in preventing, detecting and responding to unethical or illegal conduct, and to promote an organizational culture of integrity, accountability and compliance with the law. To do this, ethics and compliance are integrated into every level of our company from the board of directors and CEO, to each individual employee.\n\n**Ethics and Compliance**\n\nOur ethics and compliance programs are designed to assist us in preventing, detecting and responding to unethical or illegal conduct, and to promote an organizational culture of integrity, accountability and compliance with the law. To do this, ethics and compliance are integrated into every level of our company from the board of directors and CEO, to each individual employee.\n\n**Code of Business Conduct**\n\nOur Code of Business Conduct outlines the broad principles of legal and ethical conduct embraced by our company and our core values of respect, integrity and initiative to guide every business decision. Paired with this is the responsibility of each employee to comply with those laws and regulations, embrace our core values and exemplify our commitment to operating ethically.\n\nTogether, these programs provide a procedural framework for enhancing and monitoring our compliance with the Code, the policies referenced in the Code, and other rules or regulations governing our worldwide operations. Additionally, the programs are structured to comply with, among other laws and regulations, the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and the Listing Rules of NASDAQ Stock Market Inc.\nWe aim to implement ethical principles into everyday business operations by providing relevant training and guidance, targeted communications and dedicated resources. We aspire to be a global leader in demonstrating the power of aligning business objectives with doing the right thing. Our senior director, ethics and compliance, who reports directly to the chief legal officer, is responsible for administering and executing the ethics program. She and her team manage the Code, related training and education, and oversee the intake and triage of complaints and questions that come into our company\u2019s helpline or other reporting channels. Working closely with the law department, human resources and any other relevant departments, the ethics program ensures all concerns are promptly and thoroughly investigated without retaliation. Our employees are empowered and encouraged to report potential ethics violations and taught to recognize extraordinary commitments to our core values.\n\nWhat it means to be a Business Ethics Liaison\n\nOur network of 44 Business Ethics Liaisons (BELs) across the globe serve a critical role in promoting and institutionalizing an ethical culture throughout our global operations. Ethics is a top-down and bottom-up process at our company, and every employee is encouraged to talk about ethics, raise concerns and share their experiences. Our CEO sets the tone at the top by communicating our expectations and holding our managers accountable for delivering on those expectations. BELs further amplify these expectations at the local and site levels, serving as a trusted resource for employees seeking guidance or wishing to raise a concern. The BEL network, which is comprised of employees of all job functions and grade levels, is essential to the continual strengthening of our company\u2019s ethical foundation and culture of integrity. Through quarterly calls, BELs get the chance to review case studies, share best practices, receive trainings and discuss trends in the ethics and compliance fields.\n\nThe availability of BELs gives employees access to a peer with whom they may raise potential concerns outside human resources and their management chain. The accessibility of this additional reporting channel helps our company integrate ethics and compliance into our culture by building trust at the local level. We consider the fact employees choose to raise concerns to BELs, more than any other reporting channel, to reflect the strength of the ethics and compliance programs. Employees also have the option of using the Helpline, which is available online, and toll-free by phone, 24-hours a day, seven days a week, with translators available in all languages in which we do business. Further, unless restricted by local law, employees may make reports to the Helpline anonymously.\n\nonsemi has a network of 44 Business Ethics Liaisons (BELs) across the globe\nIn parallel with our ethics program, we always strive to comply with the law, and in certain areas, we have adopted policies and practices that go beyond what the law requires to foster a culture of integrity and accountability. Our chief compliance and legal officer is responsible for administering and executing the legal compliance program which is designed to prevent and detect violations of the law, the Code or related standards of conduct by employees with oversight from the audit committee of the board of directors.\n\nThe law department's programs for anti-corruption, trade compliance and data privacy are designed to include all the essential elements for effective compliance, including risk assessments, policies and procedures, training, and monitoring and auditing thorough investigation and remediation of misconduct. These legal compliance programs are dynamic and continually evolving as our company grows and the business landscape changes.\n\nCompliance Program\n\nProgram Trust and Awareness\n\nWe believe employees\u2019 trust and awareness of the ethics and compliance programs is attributed to our organizations\u2019 continuous training and education.\n\nAn indicator of trust is the utilization of our reporting channels. Employees have access to several reporting channels including the following: The Helpline, a network of 44 global BELs, members of the ethics and compliance programs, and direct access to the chief compliance officer and senior director, ethics and compliance.\n\nOur company\u2019s Code is central to our organization, embodying our expectations around legal and ethical business conduct in employees\u2019 day-to-day activities. It is available for employees to review in 14 languages, making it easily accessible to employees in all regions where we do business.\n\nThe ethics and compliance group reviews the Code regularly. Every year, the board of directors and all employees are required to read and acknowledge their understanding of it by taking an online training course.\n\nWe also require managers and other select individuals to complete additional compliance-related training courses related to topics such as anti-corruption and privacy.\n\nGovernance Structure\n\nCEO and President\n\nChief Legal Officer, Chief Compliance Officer\n\nSenior Director, Ethics and Compliance\n\nEthics and Compliance\n\nBoard of Directors, Audit Committee, Governance and Sustainability Committee\n\nBusiness Ethics Liaisons, CSR Site Champions, and Subject Matter Experts\n\nKey Stakeholders\n\nEnvironmental Health and Safety, Global Security, Global Supply Chain Operations, Human Resources, Internal Audit and other Members of the Law Department\n\nWe maintain an open-door policy, allowing employees to communicate and engage with management staff and human resources.\nOne of the most fundamental RBA programs is the Validated Assessment Program (VAP). It is the leading standard for onsite compliance verification and effective, shareable audits. The primary value of an onsite compliance audit is the correction of identified issues. The RBA recognizes factories that show a commitment to corporate responsibility through verified closure of the issues identified in a VAP audit.\n\nAbout half of our manufacturing facilities are scheduled for VAP audits through RBA on an annual basis. At onsemi, we conduct internal RBA audits on an annual basis to ensure those facilities not slated for an official RBA VAP audit are remaining compliant to RBA Code standards. In 2021, six out of 18 onsemi manufacturing facilities were subject to internal audits and 14 manufacturing sites participated in initial or closing RBA VAP audits. Nine of our sites also participated in customer audits or shared Validated Audit Reports (VAR) with customers.\n\nIn 2021, five sites were audited remotely. These five sites received a perfect score of 200 points resulting in RBA Recognition. These five sites are Mountain Top, Pennsylvania, United States; South Portland, Maine, United States; Carmona, Philippines; Cebu, Philippines; and Tarlac, Philippines. We also had two sites that were audited onsite. These two sites, Bucheon, South Korea and Suzhou, China, received Platinum and Gold recognition respectively for their audit scores.\n\nValidated Assessment Program (VAP)\n\nOne of the most fundamental RBA programs is the Validated Assessment Program (VAP).

These two sites, Bucheon, South Korea and Suzhou, China, received Platinum and Gold recognition respectively for their audit scores.\nPrevention of Child Labor\n\nOur practice on the use of child and young labor is based upon our global minimum employment age policy. The purpose of this policy is to define and ensure that sufficient measures and controls are in place to verify the minimum age of individuals working at our company. As a rule, we only employ individuals who are at least 18 years of age by the first day of employment. The only exception to this rule is in China, where the minimum age for employment is 16 years old. To confirm candidates for employment meet the minimum age requirement, members of our human resources department perform due diligence to make sure we are complying with federal, state, regional and local requirements. The global minimum age policy also describes the process to be followed and protection afforded to discovered child laborers.\n\nWe apply the same minimum age requirement for employment at our supplier companies and labor agencies. We work to ensure that our suppliers have the necessary policies, procedures and management systems to ensure that all work at our company is voluntary and that workers are legally entitled to leave the company without penalty. Our company also ensures that workers are not required to hand-over government issued identification and original work permits to our company or any of our labor agents. We train our human resources staff and labor agents on the company\u2019s practices related to anti-human trafficking and conduct on-site verification to ensure compliance. Incidents of slavery and human trafficking are also verified in our supply chain using risk assessments and site visits.\n\nOur employees and other stakeholders are encouraged to report any concerns they may have on human trafficking through the global trafficking hotline at 1-844-888-FREE or by emailing help@befree.org.\nSupply Chain\n\nAt onsemi, we are committed to ensuring the highest standards of social responsibility in all regions at which our company is located. We insist that our suppliers provide safe working conditions, treat workers with dignity and respect, prohibit human trafficking and slavery (including the procurement of commercial sex acts and the use of forced or child labor), promote ethical behavior, and use environmentally responsible manufacturing processes and follow principles like those in our Code of Business Conduct. As outlined in our Supplier Handbook, the supplier must conform to all environmental laws, all applicable laws and regulations, behave ethically, conform to all social responsibility and conflict mineral requirements that are required by onsemi\u2019s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Statement of Commitment, and provide any requested certifications and cascade all applicable requirements through their supply chain.\n\nManagement Approach\n\nOur global supply chain operations (GSCO) and global sourcing and procurement (GSP) organizations is led by our EVP, global manufacturing and operations who reports to our CEO and board of directors. We operate a flexible, reliable and responsive supply chain that is compliant with IATF-16949 and ISO 9001 requirements as defined in our internal Supplier Handbook. We continually develop business partnerships with selected key suppliers and strive to ensure that all purchased materials used in product manufacturing satisfy current governmental, environmental and safety criteria applicable to the country of manufacture and sale. Our transportation packaging meets electrostatic discharge (ESD) requirements, and appropriate use of packing is used to prevent physical damage. We require our internal and external manufacturing facilities to complete specific tests, evaluations and calibrations to receive qualification and acceptance by customers in order to perform. Through our sales and operations planning process, we work directly with our business units and sales teams to align capacity and demand to support customer requirements.\n\nOur Suppliers\n\nOur supply chain has a multifaceted supply structure of direct materials suppliers, foundry and subcontractor providers, indirect material suppliers and professional service providers deployed across a global sourcing and procurement organization. In 2021, we worked with 9,500 suppliers and service providers in North America, Asia Pacific, Europe and the Middle East. Of those suppliers, approximately 7,000 were production-related.\n\nThere are a total of 96 suppliers that constitutes 85% of our direct materials spend in 2021. We are currently in the process of further classifying these critical suppliers as high or low risk considering various factors such as procurement amount, product criticality, single or dual source, and business relationships with onsemi from both Supplier Risk Management and Supplier Relationship Management perspective.\n\nWhen possible, we try to keep our sourcing efforts local by prioritizing purchasing from local suppliers.\n\nProcurement from Local Suppliers (Percentage)\n\n| REGION       | 2021  | 2020  | 2019  | 2018  |\n|--------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Asia         | 90.5% | 91.9% | 92.3% | 89.83%|\n| EMEA         | 83.7% | 82.9% | 80.2% | 77.8% |\n| North America| 90.3% | 91.2% | 91.7% | 89%   |\n| onsemi total % spend on local suppliers | 88.2% | 88.7% | 88.1% | 85.5% |\n\nManaging Risk in the Supply Chain\n\nWe understand that supply chain risks have the potential to cause disruptions to our manufacturing process, alter our ability to deliver our products to our customers and create a ripple effect impacting all stakeholders. Our procurement team currently uses several models to manage risk in our supply chain. From new supplier selection, we consider the financial strength, quality track record, geography, CSR compliance and technology of our suppliers. Once selected, we expect them to adhere to the onsemi Supplier Code of Conduct outlined in our Supplier Handbook. We conduct bi-annual RBA conformance certification and engage with our suppliers in regular cycles by clearly communicating our expectations, deploying risk assessments, conducting business reviews, launching verification audits and addressing any non-conformance.\n\nConflict Minerals\n\nAs a purchaser of products containing conflict minerals that include tantalum, tin, tungsten, gold and cobalt from suppliers for use in our manufacturing process and products, we continue to be concerned about the reports of violence and human rights violations resulting from the sourcing of such metals from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. As active member the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), we engage in reasonable and responsible due diligence with our suppliers and other third parties in our supply chain in a manner consistent with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (CAHRAs).\n\nPolicy\n\nIdentify Risk\n\nRisk Management\n\nAudit\n\nDisclosure\n\nEstablish conflict minerals policy and management system to support due diligence\n\nIdentify all key suppliers with conflict minerals in their products and conduct risk assessment\n\nMake plan for removal or replacement on non-RMAP conformant smelters and refiners\n\nSupport and use RMI\u2019s RCOI Report for third party audit of smelters and refiners\n\nFile annual SEC report and publish Annual Conflict Minerals Report\nWe require our suppliers to engage in due diligence to analyze their sources and to complete the RMI Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT). In 2015, we achieved our road to zero by identifying all utilized smelters. This means we are aware of and can trace the origin of metals throughout our supply chain. We hold our suppliers responsible and align responsibility and transparency with our customers\u2019 requests. Each year, we target 100% responsible minerals assurance process (RMAP) conformant smelters and we achieved this target in 2018 to 2019 and continue to sustain the goal of 100% smelter conformance. If we become aware that our supply chain includes uncertified minerals sourced from a conflict region, we act promptly to review the circumstances and remedy the situation as appropriate. This resulted in satisfied customers and a supply chain that continues to request company or product-level CMRTs without non-conformant smelters or refiners. onsemi responds and completes more than 1,000 customer CMRT inquiries annually. For reporting year 2021, we achieved 98% conformance of our smelters. Both tantalum and tungsten smelters were 100% conformant while gold refiners and tin smelters were 98% and 96% conformant, respectively.\n\nAfter submitting reporting year 2020 annual conflict minerals report, Sentry (an investigative and policy team that follows the dirty money connected to African war criminals and transnational war profiteers), evaluated 50 of the largest electronics companies in the U.S., 15 of the largest jewelry retailers and 24 of the largest automakers. They named 13 out of more than 1,000 major electronics, jewelry and automotive companies as \u201cGood.\u201d \u201cGood\u201d companies are defined as companies who report that 99 to 100% of their supply chains are made up of conflict-free smelters and refiners including onsemi. See snapshot from news article in Sentry:\n\nMembers of our conflict minerals team continue to actively participate in RMI workgroups including due diligence practice team and minerals reporting team. Please see our latest SEC Form SD, Conflict Minerals Sourcing Policy as well as our latest company-level CMRT for more information. For any other conflict minerals inquiry, please send to continuity@onsemi.com.\n\nHazardous Substances Commitment\n\nonsemi is committed to providing our customers with products that are compliant with industry environmental best practices, now and in the future. We meet all applicable Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) requirements and all products manufactured by onsemi comply with the amended Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) directive. To support this commitment, we have environmental requirements for our suppliers related to the hazardous materials in their products. All purchased materials, services and products used in part manufacturing shall satisfy current governmental, statutory and regulatory requirement, and safety constraints on restricted, toxic and hazardous materials; as well as environmental, electrical and electromagnetic considerations applicable to the country of manufacture and sale. All purchased materials, services and products must conform to onsemi\u2019s environmental requirements described in our Product Chemical Content Brochure. Suppliers must be prepared to provide supporting evidence of conformance.\n\nExpectations of Our Suppliers\n\nWe are committed to ensuring our suppliers have a clear understanding of our expectations, and have the information required to successfully meet our needs. We expect our suppliers to conform and adhere to onsemi Supplier Code of Conduct outlined in our Supplier Handbook. Our general expectations for all suppliers can be found on pages 4-6 of our handbook.\n\nThe Good\n\nThe number of companies sourcing only from conflict-free refiners and smelters has increased, which is encouraging, although they are still a small minority. 13 major electronics, jewelry and automotive companies report that 99% to 100% of their supply chains are made up of conflict-free smelters and refiners that are conformant with credible, independent audits and that require their suppliers to source from conflict-free smelters. The companies were Apple, Google, Intel, Microsoft, IBM, Macy\u2019s, Micron Technology, Nvidia, Signet Jewelers, Skyworks, Target, Tiffany & Co. and onsemi, and they deserve praise for these efforts. That is a significant achievement, as it is up from just a small handful in previous years.\n\nOverall % RMAP Conformant (percentage)\n\n| Smelter | Conformant | Non-Conformant | Active |\n|---------|------------|----------------|--------|\n| Gold    | 105        | 0              | 2      |\n| Tantalum| 25         | 0              | 0      |\n| Tin     | 50         | 2              | 0      |\n| Tungsten| 24         | 0              | 0      |\n| Total   | 204        | 2              | 0      |\n\nOverall % Conformant\n\n| Smelter | Conformant | Non-Conformant | Active |\n|---------|------------|----------------|--------|\n| Gold    | 107        | 0              | 2      |\n| Tantalum| 52         | 0              | 0      |\n| Tin     | 25         | 0              | 0      |\n| Tungsten| 24         | 0              | 0      |\n| Total   | 208        | 2              | 0      |\n\n2021 REPORTING YEAR\n\n| Smelter | Conformant | Active | Non-Conformant | Not Eligible | Total Smelter | % Conformant |\n|---------|------------|--------|----------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|\n| Gold    | 107        | 2      | 0              | 0            | 107           | 98%          |\n| Tantalum| 52         | 0      | 0              | 0            | 52            | 100%         |\n| Tin     | 25         | 0      | 0              | 0            | 25            | 100%         |\n| Tungsten| 24         | 0      | 0              | 0            | 24            | 100%         |\n| Total   | 208        | 2      | 0              | 0            | 208           | 98%          |\nInformation Protection\n\nAt onsemi, we work around the clock to protect our company, technology and intellectual property from potential cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities. We take privacy and cybersecurity seriously and strive to identify and eliminate potential threats to our IT infrastructure, proprietary technologies and confidential information.\n\nPrivacy\n\nWe have developed a global data privacy program designed to comply with applicable laws around the world and protect the personal information of onsemi employees, customers and others who have entrusted us with their personal data.\n\nWe also have a Data Privacy Committee that provides strategic guidance and oversight to support our data privacy program. In addition, our chief privacy officer has appointed employees of various roles and grade levels throughout the company as \u201cData Privacy Champions\u201d who advocate the importance of our data privacy program, maintain awareness of key data privacy laws and help reinforce best practices around data privacy matters.\n\nWe also have a Data Privacy Committee that provides strategic guidance and oversight to support our data privacy program.

This comprehensive framework provides an intuitive and comprehensive set of control objectives that align with several other standard frameworks such as ISO 27001:2013 and COBIT 5. The ISR team adapted and implemented the framework to suit the executive risk appetite and business objectives of the company.\n\nManagement Approach\n\nAt onsemi, the ISR team is led by our chief information security officer (CISO). The team oversees compliance with the Information Technology General Controls (ITGC) framework, coordinates the Information Security program and facilitates risk management activities within Information Technology (IT).\n\nISR Team Responsibilities and Activities\n\nThe below represents some of the activities that are performed and/or overseen by the ISR team:\n\n- IT established a hierarchy of policies, processes and standards that all IT departments follow, and the Information Security program adheres to that hierarchy. Additionally, the ISR team developed more than 50 policies, processes and standards that were reviewed, approved and published. An ongoing periodic review of these policies is completed to ensure accuracy and completeness. IT projects are built with security controls and executed according to the project delivery lifecycle.\n\n- Each year, IT is subject to several internal and external audits globally. The CISO collaborates with the auditors, regulators and customers to coordinate and oversee the audit and assessment activity.\n\n- ISR periodically engages with an independent consultant to perform an information security benchmark against the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The benchmark assesses progress toward the company\u2019s desired target maturity state. Recommendations from the assessment are reviewed and implemented within the IT roadmap to ensure ongoing maturity and continuous improvement of the program.\n\n- The ISR program governs the IT risk process on behalf of the chief information officer (CIO). ISR manages a cyber risk register which is updated on an ongoing basis. Risks are managed via a remediation plan and reported accordingly.\n\n- The ISR team is responsible for the security awareness program at onsemi. Throughout the year, the team regularly trains personnel on phishing and provides follow up training where needed. Security awareness communications are published on a regular basis and the team hosts an annual Cyber Awareness Month each October.\n\n- ISR team provides identity assurance via secure access to onsemi systems and applications. The team validates on a regular basis that the right people have access to right data.\n\n- In the event of a serious or material data breach, the Information Security Program has chartered a Cyber Incident Response team (CIRT) to act. The CIRT is comprised of subject matter experts from the global IT team. In addition, the Information Security team has contracted with eSentire Digital Forensic & Incident Response Team and IBM\u2019s X Force IRIS (Incident Response and Intelligence Services) on a rapid retainer basis. In the event of a serious or material data breach, these rapid response services provide security and forensic expertise immediately via phone and onsite within 24 hours. Also, the ISR team collaborated with onsemi\u2019s Treasury Department to obtain cybersecurity insurance. This type of insurance reimburses the company for costs incurred in responding to and recovering from a data breach.\n\n- ISR applies a risk-based approach to vulnerability management, with emphasis on critical, high-risk assets and focus on highest risk findings to quickly reduce exposure and close critical gaps.\n\n- The ISR team monitors onsemi systems, identifying and tracking any threats that arise. The team works closely with outside agencies and receives threat intelligence information regularly.\n\n- The CISO has accountability for Key Performance Indicators (KPI) for the information security program. The CISO reports KPIs and status of key IT risks to Executive Management and the Board of Directors on regular schedules.\nAt onsemi, we support public policies that encourage innovation, investment and open markets and enable us to create the intelligent power and sensing technologies to solve the world\u2019s most complex challenges leading the way to a safer, cleaner and smarter world. Our public policy program reflects our profile as a global company headquartered in the U.S., which interacts regularly with government agencies around the world. Much of our public policy advocacy is performed through the U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), although our company is also a member of local associations in the regions in which we operate. We are an active participant in the World Semiconductor Council (WSC), an organization composed of the world\u2019s leading semiconductor industry associations from China, Taiwan, Europe, Japan, South Korea and the U.S. The organization meets annually at the CEO level to make recommendations to governments and authorities on issues such as expanding the global market for information technology products by promoting fair competition, sound environmental and health and safety practices, intellectual property rights and open markets.\n\n### PUBLIC POLICIES SUPPORTED \u2013 2021\n\n| Category                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Pro-Innovation, Pro-Growth Business Environment** | We work with the SIA and our other associations to support U.S. government policies that promote innovation and growth. This includes federal incentives for semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. to increase the share of global wafer fabrication capacity located in the U.S. from its current level of only 12%, increased federal support for semiconductor-related research and development at universities and national laboratories, and government actions to ensure a well-educated semiconductor workforce. In June 2021, the U.S. Senate voted to support $52 billion to fund the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) for America Act and the House passed similar legislation in January 2022. The House and Senate must next resolve differences between the two bills as well as larger differences in the legislative packages in which the bills reside. |\n| **COVID-19 Policies**                          | The semiconductor industry faced ongoing challenges from the outbreak of COVID-19. Our policy advocacy centers around a 2020 statement by ten semiconductor industries from around the world on the industries\u2019 efforts to keep their employees and communities safe. The statement also urged governments to recognize that restrictions in any one region disrupted the global supply chain of chips used in the automotive, industrial and IT industries that drive the world economy and the life-saving medical devices that are never needed more so than during the pandemic. |\n| **Open Markets and Fair Competition**          | We actively work to promote policies that support open markets and fair competition. Working through our trade associations, we oppose tariffs on semiconductors, including the 25% tariffs that the U.S. imposed in 2018 on imports of discrete semiconductors and integrated circuits imported from China. We work through the World Semiconductor Council to promote transparency on government subsidies, which depending on size, scope and discriminatory application have the potential to distort fair competition in global semiconductor markets. We also recommend that when the U.S. government imposes export controls, it do so under two conditions: 1) only to the extent necessary to protect national security; and 2) only if the controlled U.S. items cannot be easily substituted with foreign sourced items. |\n| **Stopping Counterfeit Semiconductors**        | Counterfeit semiconductors are unreliable and can fail at any time. The semiconductor industry has found counterfeits in air bags, train-braking systems and other applications where a failure can have serious health or safety consequences. In 2021, we assisted law enforcement to identify and seize counterfeit goods and remove them from the marketplace. |\n| **Energy Efficiency, Fuel Economy and Automotive Safety** | We are an ally member of American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), a thought leader on energy efficiency policies such as deployment of Electric Vehicles. Additionally, we are a member of Motor & Equipment Manufacturing Association (MEMA) that advocates for legislation and regulations related to fuel economy and automotive safety such as advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) including automatic emergency braking and policies to facilitate the introduction of autonomous vehicles. |\nStatement on Political Contributions\n\nParticipating in political activities is a very sensitive and complex area, and strict laws govern our political activities as a company. For this reason, onsemi does not make political contributions to individual candidates. In the U.S., companies and other organizations may organize political action committees (PACs) to support political candidates with funds voluntarily contributed by qualified employees. We chose not to have a PAC and did not make political contributions in our company\u2019s name in 2021.\n\nExternal Initiatives and Industry Associations\n\nonsemi belongs to many associations which we work with on various policy objectives. We also collaborate with other outside groups and coalitions, such as the RBA and Semiconductor Industry Association, to advance policies that drive growth; promote competitiveness; and support our shareholders, customers, employees and the communities in which we operate.\n\nExternal Initiatives\n\n- American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), Leader tier\n- Association of Climate Change Officers (ACCO)\n- Association for Corporate Citizenship Professionals (ACCP)\n- Arizona Forward\n- Arizona Grantmakers Forum\n- Arizona Tax Research Association\n- Boston College Center for Corporate Citizenship\n- Business for Social Responsibility (BSR)\n- Carbon Disclosure Project\n- CEB Compliance and Ethics Leadership Council (founding member)\n- Chief Executives for Corporate Purpose (CECP)\n- Clean Energy Buyers Alliance (CEBA)\n- Conference Board \u2013 Philanthropy and Engagement Council\n- Corporate Volunteer Council of Central Arizona\n- CSR Board (founding member)\n- Electronic Components Industry Association (ECIA)\n- Ethisphere\u2019s Business Ethics Leadership Alliance (BELA)\n- Greater Phoenix Chamber of Commerce\n- Hearing Industries Association\n- Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC)\n- Mactan Export Processing Zone Chamber of Exporters and Manufacturers (MEPCEM)\n- Microelectronic Industry Design Association (MIDAS) Ireland\n- Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association/Original Equipment Suppliers Association (MEMA/OESA)\n- Pocatello Chubbuck Chamber of Commerce\n- Responsible Business Alliance (RBA)\n- Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI)\n- Semiconductor Electronic Industries in Philippines Inc.

We demonstrate our commitment by continuing our Road to Zero Defects initiative, which was implemented several years ago. This initiative focuses on eliminating quality excursions, improving eight disciplines problem solving (8D) responsiveness, lowering our parts per billion (ppb) defect rate and enhancing our quality standards. We recognize that incorporating these objectives into our service offerings, processes and products will enable us to use our quality and reliability as fuel for growth of our corporation. Ultimately, we are committed to maintaining a distinctive, world-class quality system that transcends international quality standards and aims to exceed customer expectations. For more information, please see our Quality and Reliability Handbook.\n\nCulture of Quality\n\nTo successfully navigate higher-quality expectations, onsemi pursues activities that have a significant and positive impact on creating a culture of quality, ensuring employees live and breathe quality. The key drivers embedded in our company\u2019s focus on quality include employee ownership, leadership emphasis, message credibility and peer involvement. Every other year we administer a survey through Gartner\u00ae to measure employee understanding of our quality initiatives and gain insights on employee perception of our quality program. onsemi\u2019s Culture of Quality Index score improved year after year. In the last survey of 2020, onsemi was ranked 6th among 147 participating companies with 85% of our employees worldwide participating. The results reflect our employees\u2019 perception of our quality performance due to our increased focus on reinforcing our quality culture and the positive results of our road to zero defects projects. The next culture of quality survey will be administered later in 2022.\n\nCustomer Satisfaction\n\nonsemi is engaged in a very competitive global marketplace. We cannot grow if we continue to focus only on our heritage and our past accomplishments. We continually strive to put customers at the center of what we do by understanding and anticipating our customer\u2019s needs for service and support as expressed in our Quality Policy: \u201cWe will exceed customer expectations with superior products and services.\u201d\n\nThe feedback we receive on the quality of our products and services is a key driver. We strive to understand this to anticipate solutions to product and service needs that our customers have yet to recognize. We listen to our customers\u2019 ideas about how we can better serve them from a holistic customer experience perspective \u2013 from idea introduction to the successful delivery of product or service.\n\nonsemi is measuring customer feedback through customer score cards, customer rewards, sales feedback, complaints, etc. Every other year, we conduct a satisfaction survey with our customers that measures our performance in the areas of service, quality, delivery, pricing and environmental sustainability.\n\nThe last survey was administered in 2020 and ended with very positive results. A positive trend of 10% was observed over the past six years of respondents who \u201cstrongly agreed\u201d with the key indicator question in the survey, \u201cIt is likely that you would recommend onsemi to a peer or colleague.\u201d\n\nCustomer Experience\n\nonsemi is engaged in a diverse competitive global marketplace. We continually strive to put customers at the center of what we do by understanding and anticipating our customer\u2019s needs for service and support. We realize our customers expect us to grow with them and that means we must deliver value not only through innovative quality products and designs but also through every customer interaction. In 2022, we established a dedicated global Customer Experience function to accelerate our ability to anticipate customer needs and provide transparency on critical information impacting customer outcomes. We will accomplish this by upgrading our data models, internal processes as well as expanding our analytics capabilities to listen and take action on customer feedback. Customers can expect improved digital experiences, making it easier to do business with onsemi.\nAppendix\n\nTransparency in Action\n\nUnited Nations Sustainable Development Goals\nTriple Bottom Line Performance Summary\nSustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Framework\nTask Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Framework\nGlobal Reporting Initiative (GRI) Index\nThird Party Assurance Statement\nUnited Nations Sustainable Development Goals\n\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), set by the United Nations (UN) in 2015, highlight the world's biggest social and environmental issues.

The CMO is responsible for making recommendations to the board around climate-related issues including trending CSR topics and how onsemi should be responding to these trends. Additionally, our CMO is directly responsible for the success of our ESG programs including annual reporting, Global Giving, and our CSR targets. Our Risk Committee (comprised of the CEO, CLO, CFO and EVP of global operations and manufacturing) is responsible for the identification, management, and mitigation of risks faced by onsemi. Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program has identified climate-related risks that the company will face over the coming years. ERM findings are communicated to the Risk Committee on a quarterly basis to ensure that this information is communicated to the other C-Suite team and to our board of directors. |\n\n| TCFD RECOMMENDED DISCLOSURE | LOCATION OF DISCLOSURE | BRIEF DESCRIPTION |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Strategy**                |                        |                   |\n| a) Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the organization has identified over the short, medium and long term. | CDP Climate Change, Questions C2.3, C2.3a, C2.4, C2.4a | At onsemi, we have identified climate-related risks that have the potential to affect our business continuity, strategy, and financial planning. We have also identified climate-related opportunities. One of the key risks we have identified is the increasing frequency and magnitude of climate-driven natural disasters and extreme weather events. This risk is driven by the change in physical climate parameters of climate change and is a specific (yet real) example. Using this climate risk, we can produce an estimate of related financial impact of climate change risk at one of our manufacturing facilities, before taking any action. We see an opportunity in the shift in consumer preferences towards sustainable technology. The business of power electronics is fundamentally tied to energy and efficiency, so the tracking of opportunities related to climate change is infused in every part of our planning and operations. Any regulation or event which makes energy more expensive will increase demand for energy-efficient solutions. Just a few of the markets directly tied to climate change are energy infrastructure, including solar boost & inverters systems and battery/grid interfaces, electric vehicles (EV) and EV charging and cloud computing. We produce long-term products to enable every one of those products and markets, but also support energy efficiency in consumer electronics, appliances, telecommunication networks and industrial systems. We consider these products part of our sustainable product ecosystem. |\n### Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Framework\n\n| TCFD RECOMMENDED DISCLOSURE | LOCATION OF DISCLOSURE | BRIEF DESCRIPTION |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Strategy**                |                        |                   |\n| b) Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization's businesses, strategy, and financial planning. | CDP Climate Change, Questions C3.1, C3.1a, C3.3 | We estimate that one natural disaster/extreme weather event affecting a single manufacturing facility will have an acute physical risk on our direct operations and have the potential to cause over $5 million in financial impact on our business. In this scenario, the climate-change related impact assumes a 100% production outage, for 3 months, at one manufacturing site. onsemi has over 20 manufacturing sites worldwide. We shipped approximately 70 billion units through our global logistics network in 2021 and approximately 64.3 billion units in 2020, resulting in a period-over-period increase of approximately 9%. In 2021, revenue from our sustainable products ecosystem amounted to $5.011 billion. We anticipate that majority of our products sold will fall into this sustainable product ecosystem as demand for energy-efficient solutions and energy infrastructure increases. We feel that $900 million is a fair estimate for the financial impact this demand will have on the company. |\n| c) Describe the resilience of the organization's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios including a 2\u00b0C or lower scenario. | CDP Climate Change, Questions C3.2, C3.2b | onsemi has conducted an internal exercise similar to climate-related scenario analysis which involved thinking through what possible futures exist and identifying the potential risks, opportunities, and impacts that these potential future states could have on the company. Additionally, the ERM group at onsemi hosts an annual, off-site emerging risk scenario planning session with a cross-functional group of individuals to evaluate specific emerging risk scenarios that are considered new, ambiguous, unforeseen or slow to develop. These practices are informative and have assisted in framing some of the future scenarios that could come to be, however they are not as comprehensive as a true climate-related scenario analysis. We understand the importance of conducting such scenario analysis and will be completing an analysis like this in the next twelve months. |\n## Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Framework\n\n| TCFD RECOMMENDED DISCLOSURE | LOCATION OF DISCLOSURE | BRIEF DESCRIPTION |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Risk Management**         |                        |                   |\n| Disclose how the organization identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks. | CDP Climate Change, Questions C1.2, C1.2a, C2.1, C2.1a, C2.2, C2.2a | We have developed a framework to identify, evaluate, prioritize and manage key risks and opportunities across different time horizons that can impact our company's ability to achieve strategic goals and objectives systematically, consistently and effectively. We seek to identify critical risks by interviewing key stakeholders within the company and conducting research via external sources. The risks identified and prioritized for action are embedded within the company's operating plan. |\n| a) Describe the organization's processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks. | CDP Climate Change, Questions C2.2, C2.2a, C2.3, C2.3a | Risk response actions and commitments are tracked for completion on a periodic basis.

These acute and chronic hazards have a significant impact on human development and economic productivity, including supply chain disruptions, damage to owned operations and endangerment, death or injury to people in impacted communities. Our GHG emissions contribute to average temperature rise and can have an impact on the frequency of these acute and chronic hazards. |\n### Metrics and Targets\n\n| TCFD RECOMMENDED DISCLOSURE | LOCATION OF DISCLOSURE | BRIEF DESCRIPTION |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|\n| c) Describe the targets used by the organization to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets. | CDP Climate Change, Questions C4.1, C4.1b, C4.2, C4.2b, C4.3, C4.3a, C4.3b, C4.3c onsemi blog, 2040 Emissions Goal for onsemi | In 2021, onsemi committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2040. With this commitment, we have set the most ambitious goal among our competitors and will surpass the Paris Agreement\u2019s goal by a full decade. Our strategy is broken down into three pillars:  \n- **Capitalize on efficiency** - Every ton of carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) avoided is a ton we do not need to eliminate or offset. Investments in facilities, processes, and equipment to increase energy efficiency can reduce our greenhouse gas footprint by as much as 15% by 2040. We will also be focusing on our process gas usage as there is substantial opportunity for efficiency in this area.  \n- **Renewable energy** - To achieve net zero, companies need to invest in renewable energy equal to the emissions associated with their energy consumption. Offsets cannot be used for electricity-related emission in a net-zero model. We will transition to an emissions-free renewable energy portfolio to achieve this goal. We plan to use 50% renewable energy by 2030 and 100% by 2040. We will engage with energy providers to identify power purchase agreements (PPAs) in locations where it is feasible to recoup investment costs in long-term agreements. To assist in our shift to renewable energy, we joined the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance to ensure a rapid transition to a cleaner zero-carbon energy future. |\n\n### Offsets and influence\n\n- **Offsets and influence** - For nonelectricity emissions that cannot be eliminated, we will purchase certified carbon offsets equal to their amount. Green-E and Gold Standard certified offsets are the most credible and will be prioritized in our strategy. Science-based targets also require goals for reducing emissions in the supply chain. We will leverage our Responsible Business Alliance membership to engage suppliers on emissions reduction.\n\nOur corporate social responsibility team works closely with our environmental health and safety (EHS) and facilities teams to ensure processes and frameworks are in place to measure our progress against our net zero goal. Our annual Sustainability Report will be a key resource for tracking our progress.\n## 2.

Governance\n\n### 2-9 Governance structure and composition\n\n- See Committees of the Board in our 2022 Proxy Statement, pg 16.\n\n### 2-10 Nomination and selection of the highest governance body\n\n- See Charter of the Governance and Sustainability Committee and 2022 Proxy Statement, pg 13-14\n\n### 2-11 Chair of the highest governance body\n\n- Alan Campbell is a non-employee director and serves as Chair of the Board.\n\n### 2-12 Role of the highest governance body in overseeing the management of impacts\n\n- See Amended and Restated On Semiconductor Corporation Corporate Governance Principles.\n### Delegation of responsibility for managing impacts\n\nThe Board delegates responsibility for managing the Company's impacts on the economy, environment and people largely to the Governance and Sustainability Committee, which has been explicitly tasked with oversight of the Company's climate- and sustainability related initiatives, and the Human Capital and Compensation Committee, which has been explicitly tasked with oversight of the Company's human capital management. The Board receives updates on such aspects of the Company at each of its quarterly meetings, and the Company's internal CSR/ESG department team handles the day-to-day oversight and management of the ESG-type impacts of the Company's operations.\n\nThe CMO attends meetings with the Governance and Sustainability Committee and provides reports to the Board on ESG- and CSR-related initiatives. The CMO works directly with the CSR/ESG department team on climate- and sustainability related initiatives through their supervisors. Today, the CEO, CFO, CMO and other members of management report on the Company's impacts on the economy, environment and people to the Board at its meetings and in between meetings, as needed.\n\n### Role of the highest governance body in sustainability reporting\n\nThe Board was not responsible for the review and approval of the reported information in previous years. However, in 2022, the Board will be reviewing and approving the Company's Sustainability Report, Corporate Governance section of our 2021 Sustainability Report, pg 44.\n\n### Conflicts of interest\n\nSince January 1, 2021, there have been no related party transactions that are required to be reported as such under SEC rules. See Charter of the Audit Committee and Related Party Transactions in our 2022 Proxy Statement, pg 72.\n\n### Communication of critical concerns\n\nThe Board of Directors and management of the Company, and the Chief Legal Officer in particular, keep an open line of communication for the smooth transmission of issues and ideas related to the Company.\n\nThrough its standing committees, the Board receives not only information regarding critical concerns that impact the Company but also informed, reasoned ways with which to handle such concerns. Members of management are also present at Board and committee meetings, and are capable of offering their input and/or insight regarding the Company as needed. When critical issues arise, management makes sure to keep members of the Board abreast of important developments.\n\nFor example, pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, one of the responsibilities of the Human Capital and Compensation Committee (as stated in its charter) is to establish procedures for: (i) the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received by the Company regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters; and (ii) the confidential, anonymous submission by employees of the Company of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters.\n\n### Collective knowledge of the highest governance body\n\nThe Governance and Sustainability Committee of the Board is tasked with encouraging and facilitating directors' continuing education, including coordinating training sessions and informative presentations for external parties for the directors on various topics and aspects related to corporate governance and other aspects of Board service. The company allows and encourages directors to select continuing director education offerings to attend, so directors are empowered to further develop their skillsets and attend offerings that will serve to complement their existing knowledge bases.\n### Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Index\n\n| GRI STANDARD | DISCLOSURE | CROSS REFERENCE OR ANSWER |\n|--------------|------------|---------------------------|\n| 2-18         | Evaluation of the performance of this highest governance body | See Corporate Governance section of our 2021 Sustainability Report, pg 44 |\n| 2-19         | Remuneration policies | See Compensation Discussion and Analysis in our 2022 Proxy Statement, pg 30-48. |\n| 2-20         | Process to determine remuneration | See Processes and Procedures for Considering and Determining Executive Compensation in our 2022 Proxy Statement, pg 33-36. |\n| 2-21         | Annual total compensation ratio | (a) Annual total compensation ratio 912:1 for all employees 86:1 for U.S.-based non-manufacturing employees See our 2022 Proxy Statement, pg 67 |\n|              | (b) Change in the annual total compensation ratio | 0:1 |\n| 2-22         | Statement on sustainable development strategy | See United Nations Sustainable Development Goals section of our 2021 Sustainability Report, pg 61 |\n| 2-23         | Policy commitments | See our Code of Business Conduct and our Human Rights Policy.
