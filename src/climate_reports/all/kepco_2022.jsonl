Rising fuel prices for natural gas, oil, and fossil fuel have pushed global energy companies to the verge of bankruptcy. KEPCO was also confronted with an unprecedented financial crisis.\n\nTo overcome the crisis, KEPCO and Group companies have undertaken high-level finance improvement measures as well as comprehensive management reform. At the same time, we continue to invest in infrastructure to ensure a stable supply of electricity, which is integral to our nation\u2019s economy. Furthermore, we are making every effort to prepare for a sustainable future in areas such as climate change responses and energy security.\n\nWe declared the objective of \u300cZero for Green\u300d in 2021 in order to take the lead in carbon neutrality efforts. We have also been at the forefront of the transition sector by creating joint technology development strategies with group companies power group companies. This year, we want to carry out carbon neutrality initiatives under the leadership of the Carbon Neutrality Promotion Committee, while also broadening global cooperation to secure core technology. This year, we are publishing a comprehensive Sustainability Report in collaboration with group companies for the first time.\n\nWe have a long road ahead of us to achieve sustainability management in the face of increasing energy uncertainties. We must overcome challenges such as the financial crisis while also achieving carbon neutrality and energy security. Furthermore, we will continue to invest in the future to improve the global competitiveness of the electric power industry. To that end, we will prioritize and promote five key areas.\nFirst, we will enhance financial soundness by taking extensive improvement.\n\nKEPCO and Group companies created the Emergency Response Committee to aggressively pursue financial soundness initiatives, including self-rescue actions. We want to take every conceivable measure to strengthen the financial structure, including investment efficiency, asset rationalization, and profit maximization, while decreasing costs as much as possible within the range that does not threaten energy supply stability. In addition, we will build a cost-based power price system that accounts for cost-changing factors such as fuel, climate, and environmental costs.\n\nSecond, we will prioritize energy efficiency to attain effective carbon neutrality.\n\nWith energy efficiency improvement projects for energy-intensive sectors, small-to-medium-sized businesses, and root companies, we will drive effective carbon neutrality by converting the industry to low-consumption and high efficiency. We will also work together to adopt GHG reduction strategies with a broader implementation scope that includes indirect emissions (Scope 3). In addition, we will build a planned site that fully considers the system and location conditions for an orderly and scale renewable energy distribution. Energy security will be realized through the development of a green energy supply system that incorporates new carbon-free power sources like hydrogen and ammonia, as well as the development of small modular reactors (SMR).\n\nThird, we will create a positive cycle of shared growth in the electric power industry.\n\nWe will enhance the overall competitiveness of the industry with the solidarity and cooperation among all stakeholders. We will strengthen open R&D cooperation by connecting industry, academia, and research, while also supporting technology commercialization through life-cycle technology development support for innovative companies. We will construct an Innovation Cluster with energy convergence complexes that will serve as a hub for innovative companies to demonstrate and test their new business models and technologies without barriers, thereby encouraging private-led innovation and growth.\n\nFourth, we will safeguard future growth engines by launching new business initiatives and reorganizing overseas businesses.\n\nTo help revitalize new, local energy projects, we will be more open and share power data, as well as leverage business platforms such as charging for electric vehicles. In addition, we will restructure our overseas project portfolio to include profitable eco-friendly businesses such as large-scale power transmission networks and renewable projects, hydrogen full-cycle projects, and carbon new-growth businesses. We will also actively encourage related local businesses to enter the global market with us. Furthermore, we will complete the UAE nuclear power plant project successfully. Based on such a milestone, we will construct a worldwide cooperation system to boost Korea\u2019s ability to secure nuclear power project deals.\n\nFifth, we will value and maintain safety and integrity above everything else.\n\nUnder the principle of \"Safety First, Construction Next\", we are fundamentally redefining the management paradigm around \"Safety and Life\". We will construct a complete safety system that eliminates all accident causes and possibilities to assure the safety of workers and citizens, as well as the stability of the energy supply. Furthermore, by aggressively implementing the Ethics Compliance Management Certification System(K-CP) and regularly certifying the anti-corruption management system in accordance with international certification(ISO 37001), we will take the lead in building a corporate culture of integrity.\n\nKEPCO and Group companies will continue to innovate and communicate openly with stakeholders in order to grow as a \"Global Energy Platform Company.\" I would appreciate your continued encouragement and support.

This is a shift toward a 'Platform-based' environment. As a result, KEPCO and group companies are laying a solid basis with new value chains to meet the expanding demand for 4IR.\n\n**INPUT**\n\n**KEPCO Value Chain Process**\n\n**Financial Capital**\n- Total Assets: KRW 211.1 Trillion\n- Total Capital: KRW 65.3 Trillion\n\n**Human Capital**\n- Number of Employees: 49,158 Persons\n- Employee Training Hours: 4,583,727 Hours\n- Employee Training Expenses: KRW 101.1 Billion\n\n**Intellectual Capital**\n- R&D Personnel: 1,404 Persons\n- R&D Expenses: KRW 876.2 Billion\n\n**Manufactured Capital**\n- Purchased Electricity: 554,197 GWh\n- Tangible Assets: KRW 73.9 Trillion\n\n**Natural Capital**\n- Energy Usage: 2,181,005 TJ\n- Water Usage: 56,660,617 m\u00b3\n\n**Social and Relationship Capital**\n- KEPCO Volunteer Groups: 312 Nationwide\n- Social Contributions: KRW 124.3 Billion\n- Purchases of Products Manufactured by SMEs: KRW 9.7 Trillion\nWe develop power grid plans based on predictions of future electricity demand. We also complete transmission and substation facilities on schedule, run them efficiently, and distribute energy to places where it is needed, all of which contribute to the lives of citizens and industrial development. Furthermore, we aspire to operate a rational charge system and distinct customer services, all while dominating the global energy industry with constant ambition and innovation.\n\n(Scope: KEPCO and Group companies. As of December 31, 2021)\n2\n\nSustainability Management\nESG Strategies\n\nESG Trends in Power Industry\n\nInternational crises triggered by COVID-19, trade wars, and the Russia-Ukraine war are reawakening the importance of ESG in financial markets and industries. ESG trends across the economy, including management, consumption, and investment, have become a daily routine. KEPCO identifies ESG trends in advance, manages them systematically, and establishes ESG management strategies thereupon. In particular, the electric power industry is in a significant transition period with the 2050 carbon neutrality declaration and the energy transition policy in response to climate crisis. We are facing the demands from various stakeholders to fulfill environmental and social responsibilities in terms of the continuous growth of the company and shareholder value enhancement. With the shift of the paradigm, KEPCO will not only actively manage risk factors related to key ESG issues in the power industry, but also uncover new opportunities and develop business models to come up to the external expectations.\n\nAs the global climate crisis is intensifying, the energy industry is faced with disruptions, such as greenhouse gas reduction, green energy, and the decarbonization of the entire value chain, leading to rapid changes in the industry. In line with the great shift, carbon neutrality is one of the core issues in the power industry. Korea is aiming for carbon neutrality by 2050 in pace with the global trend. Accordingly, it is inevitable to transform the overall power industry to achieve net-zero in the energy transition sector by making energy transportation and consumption efficient, generating power from zero-carbon or low-carbon sources, and optimizing the energy mix. We aim to play a clear role in achieving carbon neutrality with the electric power group companies and expand our renewable energy and energy efficiency businesses, while acquiring key net-zero technology through cooperation. In addition, we will help the entire industry achieve carbon neutrality by increasing our net-zero efforts.\n\nInvestors in and outside Korea, including pension fund managers and asset managers, are demanding active climate responses from companies by utilizing their investment/financial capabilities. For instance, they have introduced a negative screening strategy for coal-related companies. They are also asking companies they are engaged in to improve mid-to-long-term performance and ESG management by considering ESG in investment/financial decision-making and expanding responsible investment. As a listed company on the Korea Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange, KEPCO seeks to declare the suspension of overseas coal-fired power projects, advance the decision-making system, such as establishing the ESG Committee, and reorganize the structure to focus on renewable energy and future energy businesses as the call for ESG management from investors is increasing. With the mid-to-long-term ESG strategy, we are identifying and implementing measures to improve performance and manage ESG-related risks.\n\nThe discussion on regulating the disclosure of non-financial information centered on ESG is making progress. In the EU, ESG information disclosure is mandatory for companies with a certain number of employees. In 2019, Korea implemented the mandatory disclosure system of corporate governance reports for large-scale listed companies with total assets of KRW 2 Trillion or more in response to the demand. The Financial Services Commission announced a gradually compulsory ESG disclosure plan that will expand the publication duty of corporate governance reports and sustainability reports to all KOSPI-listed companies from 2026 and 2030 respectively. Preemptively responding to the mandatory information disclosure, KEPCO has disclosed ESG information transparently and in detail in the Sustainability Report (First published in 2005) and the Corporate Governance Report Report (First published in 2017). We also meet the demand for ESG information from stakeholders by disclosing our ESG-related policies, systems, activities, and performances on our website.\nESG Strategy System\n\nHere at KEPCO, we established our ESG vision and goals. In order to achieve this, we created an ESG strategy system by synthesizing improvement measures for each ESG area that had been disconnected. To achieve our ESG vision, \u2018Achieving a global top-level sustainability management in solidarity and cooperation with stakeholders\u2019, we have set \u2018ESG-based paradigm shift\u2019, \u2018Leading ESG efforts in the public sector\u2019, \u2018Enhancing ESG values for stakeholders\u2019, and \u2018Ranking highest in third-party ESG assessments\u2019 as our goals. \u2018Shift to green energy in response to climate crisis\u2019 is the aim in the environment area, \u2018Creating a synergy effect from cooperation by leading the change in the industry\u2019 in the social area, and \u2018Establishing a clean governance trusted by all stakeholders\u2019 in the governance area. Thus, we have a total of 9 directions and 12 tasks under the 3 major aims and 4 major goals that we are implementing.\nESG Highlights\n\nIn 2021, KEPCO and group companies continuously strived to create sustainable values through solidarity and cooperation with stakeholders. We practice sustainable management that reflects economic performances on top of ESG performances across our business activities to preemptively respond to climate crisis and fulfill our responsibilities and duties as a corporate citizen.\nGoing forward, KEPCO and group companies will firmly establish ourselves as the company that is most trusted by stakeholders through sustainability management activities with integrity, in addition to continuing to pursue greater changes, challenges, and growth. Leveraging our capabilities across all of our business areas, we will do our utmost to create a sustainable energy industry and growth engines.\n\n**Grand Prize for practicing social

By collecting, converging, and processing energy-related digital data, we have developed and adopted platforms to optimize the investment in and operation of the facilities for the generation, transmission and distribution of power, increase energy efficiency and work efficiency, and foster the energy industry. We also enhance customer satisfaction continuously by providing tailored services based on the big data from remote meter readings.\n\n2035 Digital Transformation Roadmap\n\n| IDPP Intelligent Digital Power Plant | IDSS Intelligent Digital Substation | ADMS Advanced Distribution Management System |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| 2024                                | 2030                              | 2035                                        |\n| \u2022 Utilization and demonstration of IDPP by KEPCO and Group companies | \u2022 Acquisition and demonstration of base technology for full digital substations | \u2022 Sophistication of existing technology and demonstration of ADMS 1.0 |\n| \u2022 Entering overseas markets with Intelligent power generation Technology and expanding application of Private power generation | \u2022 Building an IDSS platform and expanding the digital substations | \u2022 Strengthening the base of integrated ADMS data and gradual expansion across the company |\n| \u2022 Realization of technology to enable Zero-carbon power generation and application of renewable power generation | \u2022 Upgrading the IDSS platform and expanding/exporting IDSS to 34.5+kV | \u2022 Expansion across the company and operation of an electricity market platform |\n\nExpected effects\n\n| Facility failure rate | Decrease in power blackout failure (Increased operational reliability) | Renewable energy control accuracy |\n|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| 50 % \u2193                | More than 95 %                                                      | More than 95 %                   |\n| Facility maintenance cost | CAPEX and OPEX | Appropriate voltage holding rate |\n| 15 % \u2193                | 30 % \u2193                                                             | 99 %                             |\nStable Operation of Power Infrastructure\n\nStability of Power Generation Facilities\n\nOptimal Operation of Power Generation Facilities\n\nWith the aim of stable power supply, KEPCO and group companies are sparing no effort in making the power generation facilities reliable under the company-wide power supply plan. We take thorough measures to prevent major failures, such as replacing old parts in the electric/control facility, by monitoring and diagnosing points of concern in the facilities. Moreover, we regularly conduct planned preventive maintenance actions on the boilers, turbines, control facilities, data facilities, etc. under the standard model for planned preventive maintenance to minimize major damage and failures in the power generation facilities that may hinder power supply. We are working on manufacturing core parts domestically and securing our own technology in terms of gas turbines and nuclear power plants to allow immediate maintenance in emergency, and we contribute to the stable supply of electricity by constructing power plants in a timely manner. We have secured stable fuel supplies (e.g., overseas resource development) through the cooperation between, and we introduced an advanced purchase management system in preparation for fuel price volatility the electric power group companies to procure fuels in an economical and timely manner. Furthermore, we have diversified our global supply chain in response to the supply chain crisis due to COVID-19 and trade wars, while improving our facilities to make the use of equipment more efficient.\n\nOptimal Operation Measures for Power generation Facilities\n\nReliable Power supply through Stable and Efficient Operation of Power Generation Facilities\n\nFacility Failure Prevention\n\nKHNP | Optimal Planned Preventive Maintenance of Nuclear Reactors\n\nKHNP established and implemented the 10 major tasks with a task force with external experts to minimize delay in construction due to insufficient quality of maintenance and to optimize the planned preventive maintenance process for the nuclear reactors. JHNP first minimized the maintenance time during the peak time of electricity use by revising the process management system, and optimized resource distribution by utilizing personnel and equipment more efficiently. Also, KHNP provided more support to internal and external experts for safety management and improved the planned preventive maintenance process with on-site safety managers and a special safety support team.\n\nKOSPO | Upgrading LNG Power Generation Facilities\n\nKOSPO applies advanced techniques, such as degradation assessment and computational analysis, to analyze the damage on the vulnerable points of LNG power plants, upgrade the points, and maintain the highest reliability of the facilities. Although the facilities were operated 30% more than last year after taking measures to improve the vulnerable points, such as extending the lifespan of the gas turbine rotors, replacing exhaust pipes, and inspecting and replacing the HRSG tubes and pipes, the fail stop rate was close to zero (0.01%).\n\nResults of planned process optimization\n\n| Facility | Delay Reduction |\n|----------|-----------------|\n| Kori     | 9.8 days less   |\n| Wolseong | 4.6 days less   |\n| Hanul    | 6.2 days less   |\n\nLess delay in construction due to low-quality maintenance\n\nDelay 76.4 days less\n\nZero major failures\n\nAchieved for 8 consecutive years\nIncreased Maintenance Capacities\n\n**KOMIPO | Improved Predictive Maintenance System (MIRI) with Patented Technology**\n\nTo prevent major failures due to leakage from boiler tubes, the predictive maintenance system was upgraded to detect failures with frequency now. Previously, it was difficult to detect failures before the damage increased, but the frequency method allows the system to detect high frequency from minor damages early on. When there was a leak from the tube in the New Boryung Thermal Power Plant, the damage was detected 11 days earlier.\n\n**Results of the Predictive Maintenance System**\n\n| Improvement in failure prediction | 2020 | 2021 |\n|----------------------------------|------|------|\n|                                  | 3,720| 7,021|\n| Improvement in failure prediction | 89%  |      |\n\n| Prevention of major failures | 2020 | 2021 |\n|------------------------------|------|------|\n|                              | 27   | 45   |\n| Prevention of major failures | 67%  |      |\n\n**KOWEPO | In-house Technology to Repair Gas Turbine Rotors**\n\nKOWEPO pushed for developing internal technology for inspecting and repairing gas turbine rotors, which are key parts, in partnership with group companies, such as KPS and KEPRI. Instead of relying on overseas manufacturers for equipment repair and inspection, Korea Western Power developed repairing source technology and manufactured parts domestically through reverse-design. As a result, KRW 12.4 billion was saved in the spare rotor budget, and the repair period was reduced from 4 months to 2 months.\n\nStable Fuel Supply\n\n**EWP | Purchase Strategy Tailored to Procurement Environment**\n\nEWP assessed the fuel supply risk per country by analyzing national yields, price volatility, dependence on foreign countries, and economics of transporting fuels, upon which the purchase strategy was revised for each nation to supply fuels economically. Also, EWP sought to diversify purchase strategies, including measures tailored to market prices per quarter, timely alternative purchases in niche markets, and complementary purchases in consideration of heat generation and batches.\n\nKOEN | Two-Track Strategy for Resource Security in Korea and Overseas\n\nIn response to the weaponization of resources by Indonesia (ban on exporting coals) and Russia (restriction of gas supply) KOEN increased the quantity from the mines in Indonesia and Australia, where KOEN is an equity holder, by 300,000 ton annually. In Korea, KOEN increased the target inventory day of bituminous coals and manages the inventory with an integrated fuel management system. By swapping bituminous coals and purchasing them jointly with power generation companies, which led to mitigating the fuel crisis of other power generation companies, KOEN contributed to stabilizing power supply in Korea.\n\n**Share of Joint Supply**\n\n| Year | Share of Joint Supply |\n|------|-----------------------|\n| 2020 | 16.8%                 |\n| 2021 | 19.3%                 |\n\nPrevention of Supply Chain Crisis\n\n**KOSPO | Rapid Renovation of Urea Solution-Only Facilities**\n\nKOSPO overcame the long-term discontinuance of power supply by rapidly renovating environmental facilities to address the issue of unstable urea solution supply, which is highly dependent on foreign countries. While cutting the amount of urea solution, which is the raw material of DeNOx facilities, by optimizing the input amount, KOSPO upgraded the DeNOx facilities that only use urea solution to use both urea solution and ammonia. Under the leadership of the CEO, storage tanks were upgraded, ammonia direct spraying facilities were added, and the optimal input amount of ammonia was set to address concerns about power due the global supply crisis.\nIncreased Reliability of Electricity System\n\nSupply of High-Quality Electricity\n\nKEPCO has established the optimal plan to operate the power system based on the prediction on future power demands and the power generation equipment composition, built transmission and distribution facilities in a timely manner, and operate the distribution facilities optimally and efficiently to provide electricity stably and economically. To minimize power loss and optimize the power system, we addressed power system overload by increasing transmission and distribution facilities (substations and transmission lines), integrated the operation of light-load transformers, increased the capacity of facilities to reduce reactive power, replaced overloaded or old facilities, and used low-loss equipment and intelligent systems. In addition, we are strengthening the reliability of the power supply system by using digital diagnostic technologies for substations and more. While managing the distribution net spread out across the country, we are developing or adopting the Advanced Distribution Management System (ADMS) to manage ESS, EVs, and other resources efficiently. We also have measures in place, such as a special inspection in preparation for natural disasters, to prepare for power outage failures to supply high-quality electricity.\n\nStable Power Supply\n\nKEPCO manages facilities strictly and has established an emergency response system in case of potential crises in power supply. Every summer and winter, when electricity demand is at its highest, we conduct an emergency training in order to maintain power supply and check step-by-step measures in case of emergencies even in situations where reserve power is rapidly reduced, such as in the case of a generator failure. In addition, we prepare for unexpected incidents and accidents via inspecting and replacing of power facilities in areas where power use is expected to surge, relieving power system overload, and inspecting the blackout prevention diagnosis system and recovery system. In 2021, 595 underground (complex) substations under multi-purpose facilities and major transmission lines, such as a national industrial complex, were inspected, as were 20 distribution stations to prevent regional blackouts and 48,774 substations that were expected to be overloaded, among which 1,931 were replaced to stabilize power supply. There were 4 on-site inspections in cooperation with a government agency to strengthen response capacities in partnership with relevant agencies in case of a power supply emergency. Employees were designated to large-capacity clients and clients using the emergency power saving service to take rapid measures, including demand management, in case of an emergency. We are equipped with load management and high-efficiency equipment for the peak seasons in the winter and summer and to spread power demands. With the use of load management equipment, such as the maximum power management device, the maximum power decreased by 21MW, as well as 490MW with high-efficiency transformers and energy-efficient equipment at old facilities.\n\nMaximum Power and Load Factor\n\n| Year | Maximum Power (MW) | Load Factor (%) |\n|------|--------------------|----------------|\n| 2018 | 92,478             | 70.4           |\n| 2019 | 90,314             | 71.2           |\n| 2020 | 89,091             | 70.6           |\n| 2021 | 91,141             | 72.2           |\n\n* SAIFI: System Average Interruption Frequency Index, SAIDI: System Average Interruption Duration Index\nStable Power Supply with HVDC* Transmission System\nKEPCO is pushing for the large-scale construction of transmission lines using HVDC. The HVDC system is becoming more needed as power supply is complex and its scale is growing with the current power system. The HVDC system can control the amount of power transmitted, which enables an stable operation of the power grid and prevents regional blackouts in case of potential failure in the 765kV transmission lines. Moreover, power transmission towers can be smaller and simpler in shape, which creates better views, and the transmission lines can be more accepted by local residents because the electromagnetic waves reduce with the uniform scale and direction of voltage and current.\n\n* HVDC transmission system: alternating current generated at a power plant converted into direct current and transmitted, which is then converted back to AC\n\nAnalysis on Impact of Solar Power Supply outside Power Market\nAs the amount of solar power generated in direct transaction with KEPCO is increasing, so is the power supply volatility. We analyze the impact of solar power supply outside the power market and apply it to the daily demand prediction to make the power system stable, factoring in the volatility. As a result, we marked the world\u2019s highest demand prediction accuracy in 2021 (98.86%). We seek to reflect the impact of solar power supply in predicting the national electricity demand in cooperation with the government.\n\n* U.S. prediction accuracy: 97.9-98.3%\n\nFacility Inspection with Autonomous Drones\nKEPCO reduced the time and cost of inspection by about 20% while preventing safety accidents by using drones to inspect lines and minimizing people climbing up control tower. By adding an AI automated tracking system for transmission facilities to drones, we automated the inspection process from take-off, flying, recognition, filming, and landing. We developed a 3D map and the \u201cDrone Road\u201d based on the 3D grid using facility information that hinder the drones from flying, such as transmission towers and high-voltage lines, for the drones to fly outside the visibility range safely. The transmission lines work as median strips that divide the two directions of the drone road to minimize collision between drones.\n\nBusiness Case Optimal Electricity Supply in K-Semiconductor Belt\nFollowing the government\u2019s plan to invest in building a K-Semiconductor Belt to stabilize the supply of semiconductors, KEPCO will build the optimal electricity supply chain in the belt based on the integrated facility plan for high-capacity clients, including Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix. The long lines in the semiconductor cluster of Samsung Electronics will be replaced with short-distance integrated substations to secure power supply capacities, and the separate lines of SK Hynix and KEPCO will be integrated to cut the total length and investment cost in the cluster of SK Hynix. We expect that local residents will be more accepting of the optimal power supply chain than a complicated one, while lowering investment costs compared to the clients building individual supply chains.\n\n| Pyeongtaek Semiconductor Cluster (Samsung) | Yongin Semiconductor Cluster (SK Hynix) |\n|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **As-is** | **As-is** | **To-be** | **To-be** |\n| ![Long lines for client](image1) | ![Samsung](image2) | ![Transmission lines](image3) | ![Normal Clients](image4) |\n| ![Substation](image5) | ![Constructing KEPCO lines](image6) | ![Yongin Semiconductor Cluster](image7) | ![SK](image8) |\n| ![Constructing KEPCO facility](image9) | ![Normal Clients](image10) | ![Combined constructing facility](image11) | ![SK](image12) |\n| ![Normal Clients](image13) | ![SK](image14) | ![Normal Clients](image15) | ![SK](image16) |\n\nDemand in power market (GW)\n\nSolar power outside the market\n\nPeak Sp.m.\nAdvanced Facility Construction and Management System\n\nInnovation in Facility Construction and Management\n\nOptimizing Power System for Reasonable Supply of Renewable Energy\n\nWe, at KEPCO, is changing the paradigm in the construction industry by building power plants after building the transmission system instead of the other way around based on the analysis on the issues involving power systems in line with the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC). As for the offshore wind power projects that require substantive capital and technology, such as the one in Shinan, we plan to connect the power system immediately after the complexes are constructed by building joint connection facilities. We upgrade the power system in areas that are favorable for renewable energy and recommend building power plants in an area with a power system to prevent excessive investment for system connection and delays due to not considering power systems when building power plants. We plan to continuously increase investment to establish a roadmap for upgrading power networks in line with the NDC and build a transmission network first as it takes longer to construct.\n\nNew Technology and Eco-Friendly Construction\n\nKEPCO minimizes costs and environmental pollution by developing and applying an advanced eco-friendly construction method to maximize the efficiency of construction investment. To address the issue of adding electric power conduit pipes due to connecting the underground single-conductor transmission cables separately, more single-multi conductor cables can be connected by diversifying the specification of the Y branch joint boxes for underground cables, increasing the transmission capacity using existing conduit pipes. We are developing non-destructive exploration techniques to learn the location, size, and direction of underground objects by using the technology to analyze electric fields and deep learning, which can also predict buried objects and increase accuracy, leading to the prevention of accidents, such as buried objects being destructed during construction.\n\nJoint Review on Investment into Transmission, Distribution and Transformation\n\nKEPCO reduced investment costs for transformations by reviewing the construction and operation of a power system jointly instead of establishing a transmission and transformation plan and the plan to connect them to distribution separately. Excessive investment was likely before as the opinions on the adequacy of the investment were heard and adjusted insufficiently, but in the latter case, relevant teams jointly review and discuss the plans and new technologies, thus preventing excessive investment. By doing so, KRW 300 billion was saved in the budget compared to the early 2022 plan.\n\nAnalysis on Relationship between Investment Costs and Quality of Electricity\n\nDespite the increase in investment to upgrade power systems, the effect of increasing investment is not as visible when the investment scale exceed a certain level. For example, blackouts are not decreasing as rapidly. There is also a difference in when the investment starts to make an impact. KEPCO analyzed the investment sizes and the number of blackouts (power quality) between 2007 and 2021 and set the budget based on the investment cost at the point of stagnant improvement in power quality to prevent excessive investment. KEPCO will continue to improve our facility construction and management system through various efforts, such as analyzing the relationship and setting the budget for facility upgrade adequately.\n\nInvestment-blackout relationship\n\n* Less failure reduction if the investment is above a certain level (2015)\n\nBusiness Case\n\nDemonstration Test Bed for Substations\n\nKEPCO built a demonstration test bed for substations where power equipment can be assessed in the same circumstance as the actual power system. Korea\u2019s first demonstration test bed for substations is composed of a 154kV substation and a high-voltage test unit. We plan to use the data in predicting when to replace old facilities and identifying the root cause of a failure to increase the reliability of substations and the quality of electricity.\nConstruction Model for Mutual Growth with Local Communities\n\nLocal Residents\u2019 Right to Decide on Construction Projects\nKEPCO respects the local residents\u2019 say in the construction project to build electricity facilities that meet the expectations and requirements of the residents and the community. The share of local residents in the Site Selection Committee increased to 67%, and local residents can make decisions on the design of the transmission line poles. As such, we strived to have local residents more accepting.\n\nConstruction Mindful of Environment and Local Residents\nKEPCO works with and improves local communities by reflecting the voice of the residents, increasing acceptance, and protecting safety and the environment. Our first choice, when installing transmission lines in cities and near a resident area or school, is to install them underground or to upgrade or move the lines to keep the streets safe and clean. We are also aiming for a transition to community-friendly facilities, such as substations that have facilities open to residents and city-friendly substations.\n\nBuilding Next Generation Electricity Grid\n\n9th Long-Term Transmission and Transformation Facility Plan\nKEPCO established the 9th long-term transmission and transformation facility plan with the aim of having the optimal energy mix and building a stable power system centering around the consumers and the environment, upon which we make investments and take actions to supply electricity stably. The plan includes long-term specific plans for the transmission and transformation facilities for 15 years (2020-2034). We plan to expand our electricity grid to 48,075C-km of transmission lines (1.39x increase vs. 2019), 1,154 substations (1.34x increase vs. 2019), and 478,222MVA of transformation facilities (1.44x increase vs. 2019) by 2034.\n\n* As per the 9th long-term transmission and transformation facility plan, which will be revised according to the 10th Basic Plan for Power Supply and Demand\n\n| Length of transmission lines | (Unit : C-km) | Length of distribution lines | (Unit : C-km) |\n|-----------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------|---------------|\n| 2019                        | 34,440        | 2019                        | 504,403       |\n| 2020                        | 34,665        | 2020                        | 514,779       |\n| 2021                        | 34,923        | 2021                        | 525,172       |\n\nBusiness Case 23kV Superconductivity Platform Pilot Project\nKEPCO held a groundbreaking ceremony for the 23kV super conductivity platform pilot project in June 2022 at the Sunyu Substation in Paju. Its aim is to build a small-scale superconductive station (1/10 of a normal substation) between Munsan Substation and Sunyu Substation by December 2023 and provide electricity to nearby areas stably with two-track supply lines using superconductivity technology. If the superconductivity platform technology is successful, cities can be equipped with eco-friendly power systems without large-scale civil construction, and it is expected to contribute to increasing renewable energy and achieving net-zero.\n\n*Superconductivity technology: A technology that uses the superconductive phenomenon in which the electric resistance becomes closer to 0 when a matter is cooled to an extremely low temperature. It enables energy transmission and communication with low loss.\nBuilding Future Electrical Grid for Green Energy Mix\n\nIncreasing Capacity of Renewable Energy in System\n\nParadigm Shift in Transmission / Transformation Construction\nAlthough renewable energy is expected to increase in the future, there is a gap between the time to construct a renewable energy power plant (average 3 years) and that of a transmission/transformation facility (up to 6 years), hindering timely system connection. To address it, KEPCO established a transmission / transformation facility plan considering business opinions, potential amount of renewable energy, and authorized capacity of power generation, and centering around the power grid and consumption instead of power sources. We are reducing the amount of delay in renewable energy connection by building a power grid in advance in areas that have favorable conditions for using renewable energy.\n\nPursuing Legalization of Planned Site Selection System\nKEPCO pursues the legalization of the planned energy site selection system to facilitate the supply of large-scale renewable energy and parceling out transmission rights under the leadership of the central and local governments to prevent disorderly and inefficient land development and promote the efficient use of renewable energy. In partnership with the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, we plan to specify the system by listening to the voice of stakeholders in the industry and academia. Moreover, we will lead the effort to promote the efficient use of renewable energy, decentralize power demands and foster balanced growth by linking the renewable energy sites and power demands.\n\nResolution of Delay in Connection with Renewable Energy\nKEPCO increased the capacity of transmission and distribution facilities by adding lines and improving the system to minimize delays in connecting renewable energy. We reviewed the adequate additional capacity for renewable energy, considering the minimum load (used in households and commercial places) in distribution lines. We allowed the capacity per line to be increased from 12MW to 13MW if the minimum load exceeds 1MW according to an on-site test for the lines. We increased it from 200MW to 215MW, considering the minimum load, for substations with prolonged delays. These measures allowed additional 317MW of renewable energy without increasing substations and distribution lines. We aim to connect a total of 624MW by the end of 2022 by solving the delay of 307MW through increasing transformers and distribution lines.\n\nRenewable Energy Sufficiency Data\nThere is a supply imbalance between the metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas, and the supply of renewable energy is concentrated on some areas. Due to the imbalance between supply and demand, the need for strengthening the power grid is increasing. To solve this issue, we provide the renewable energy sufficiency data, including connectable capacity of renewable energy and the facility data, on our website, which prompts the decentralization of renewable energy. With this, large-scale renewable power generation businesses (>40MW) that wish to connect to the transmission grid can establish a business plan focusing on areas with insufficient renewable energy.\nAdvanced Operation of Renewable Energy\n\nRenewable Energy Operation System\n\nTo expand dispersion energy, an optimal plan and operation of distribution grid is needed in the short term and an operator of the distribution grid market in the long term. KEPCO are developing a DSO (Distribution System Operator) system and relevant systems and technologies for efficient and systematic management. KEPCO developed the next generation distribution grid control system for an integrated management of dispersed power sources and completed the demonstration operation in Choongcheongbuk-do that included installing information terminal devices and calculating minimum load at the renewable energy power plant, which will be expanded to 15 headquarters in the next 3 years (3\u21925\u21926) while providing AMIs to small-scale power generation companies first.\n\nIntegrated Control System for Renewable Energy\n\nKEPCO established a government-funded plan for an integrated control system for renewable energy to ensure the stability of the power system. We plan to control the output in case of emergency, such as unstable supply or system failure, by monitoring output and quality of electricity in real time, installing information terminal devices at more than 500 kV renewable power plants and upgrading inverters. KEPCO will increase the stability of the power system by resolving the volatility of renewable energy through real-time information sharing between renewable energy generation operators, system operation, and power transmission and distribution management entities.\n\nBusiness Case\n\nKHNP\u2019s Renewable Energy Control Center\n\nKHNP is involved in the renewable energy output prediction system, establishing the Integrated Renewable energy Control Center to improve the level of prediction despite the volatility in renewable energy. The control center allows KHNP to manage the solar and wind power plants and accumulate facility data for the prediction of renewable energy output. KHNP seeks to improve the prediction capacity by accumulating data from not only its own facilities, but also external facilities, and build a new business model in the electricity intermediary business by improving the accuracy of prediction.\nIndustry Innovation through Digital Technology\n\nDirection of Digital Transformation\n\nMid-term Strategy for Digital Transformation\n\nKEPCO is accelerating the digital transformation to establish a data-centric management system, including creating new businesses based on electricity data. To that end, we established the mid-term strategy for digital transformation in 2019. We are continuously implementing the strategy to respond to changes in policies related to management and energy and make management more efficient, for example, cutting operation costs and capital investment.\n\n| Strategy | Advancing digital infrastructure | Intelligent safety/ work system | AI-based energy efficiency | Profit creation from new biz |\n|----------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Goal     | Internalize DX company-wide     | Increase DX tech for safety     | Promote carbon neutrality  | Expand data biz             |\n| Task     | \u2022 Increase the use of the integrated data platform  \n\u2022 Create an e-data standard  \n\u2022 Foster DX* experts  \n\u2022 Boost data analysis skills | \u2022 Intelligent construction safety management system  \n\u2022 Build a digital safety process  \n\u2022 Mobilize transmission & distribution  \n\u2022 Make site work more efficient | \u2022 Increase renewable E acceptance  \n\u2022 Optimize ReE connection  \n\u2022 Improve IDPP platform  \n\u2022 Engage in EERS to encourage saving energy | \u2022 Strengthen EN/TER Data Biz  \n\u2022 Promote data open business  \n\u2022 Facilitate AMI service  \n\u2022 Expand e-data integration service |\n\n* Digital Transformation\n\nDigital Infrastructure Development\n\nAdvancing KEPCO Data Integrated Platform\n\nKEPCO completed the creation of the KEPCO Data integrated Platform (KDP) in February 2021, on which data is collected, refined, and processed. Employees can utilize software development tools and AI technology to create a new business model based on big data, analyze and use data efficiently, and innovate business.\n\nAsset Management System (AMS)\n\nKEPCO is developing the Asset Management System (AMS) to enhance the efficiency of investment by assessing the performance of facilities based on big data and determining the priority of investment. The AMS assesses risks based on the data on the entire lifecycle of facilities and considers the optimal time and cost of investment to make an investment decision. This is significant in that it changes the paradigm of facility management from overall replacement on expiry dates to selective replacement depending on the risk of each facility. We are developing the AMS for 10 transmission and distribution facilities, which will be expanded gradually.\nIntelligent Power Facility System\n\nIntelligent Digital Power Plant (IDPP)\nKEPCO is developing intelligent digital power plants (IDPP) based on big data and AI technology to make power generation efficient and economical. Big data is collected from the vibration sensors and pressure sensors of facilities, which is used in optimizing the operation and repair of the facilities. The facility operation can be optimized with the use of virtual digital power plants in the digital realm, converged with IoT, big data, and AI technology. The collected and analyzed data can be the basis for identifying operation conditions and repair period. Following the optimization, pollutants, such as fine dusts, CO2 and NOx can be reduced as well as the time it takes to inspect facilities and safety accidents. We will lead the power generation O&M market with the IDPP, creating high value-added apps in partnership with domestic power generation companies to incorporate their technology.\n\nIntelligent Digital Substation (IDSS)\nKEPCO successfully developed the core technology of Intelligent Digital Substation (IDSS) with a remote operation system and an intelligent digital device that monitors, measures, controls and protects all power facilities at the substation as per IEC 61850, which is the communication standard for substations. IDSS enables asset management upon digital data while removing physical risks via cybersecurity and reducing site areas and maintenance costs. It is effective for preventing failure as the AI can decide on the status of facilities and the electric device can inspect facilities in real time. We established the 2035 Substation Digitalization Masterplan to go completely digital, and plan to strengthen our capabilities in digital infrastructure (digitalizing 345 kV substations), applied technology (integrated system for automated substation system), system quality (IED), digital troubleshooting manpower and business automation. Currently, 130 154kV-substations are digital.\n\nDemonstration of Digital Twin Technology\nKEPCO and group companies jointly developed the digital twin technology for boilers and steam turbines and applied it to coal-fired power plants in Korea to predict and diagnose the status of core equipment in real time. The digital twin system can make optimal decisions by predicting pollutions and the efficiency and reliability of facilities in various virtual scenarios.\n\nEarly Warning System\nWe developed an early warning system on which facility data and AI technology are integrated, and completed the demonstration study in Korea. The system prevents failure by detecting abnormal operation of equipment at power plants and diagnosing failure or a breakdown before it occurs.\n\nAdvanced Distribution Management System (ADMS)\nKEPCO developed and verified the Advanced Distribution Management System (ADMS). The system operates and manages the distribution grid across the country, manages the quality of electricity, and mitigates the volatility and intermittency of output that changes depending on weather conditions. For example, it identifies the location of failure in case of a blackout and the quality of electricity in lines and monitors the quality (e.g. electric flow in both ways, load, output, voltage, etc.) of power in the distribution grid in real time. It also estimates the output for accurate prediction of the output of renewable energy, adjusts the power system to stabilize electricity quality, and calculates the optimal voltage. We plan to complete the ADMS in 15 headquarters by 2024, starting in an area with high share of renewable energy.\n\nIntegrated control system for distribution grid and renewable energy\n\n| ADMS | Switchgear | Renewable Energy | Voltage regulator |\n|------|------------|------------------|-------------------|\n|      | External System | Design System | Transformation Control System | Measurement Data |\nIntelligent Digital Business\n\nEfficiency-Focused Mobile Business Process\n\nWe are gradually going mobile, starting from areas with room for increasing efficiency and lowering social costs. We are reducing inspection time by making on-site tasks mobile (e.g., facility inspection and log management), while saving KRW 900 million per year by switching paper bills to messages or e-mails. We are improving customer services, reaching 91.4% response rate at the customer center by making more inquiries to mobile. We are utilizing the mobile function in multi-faceted assessment, employee communication and cooperation, mobile community, and other ways to improve the organization.\n\nAI-based Business Automation\n\nRPA (Robotic Process Automation) refers to AI-based business automation used in innovating business through data analysis, cutting costs, and improving services. The top 10 RPA tasks were selected through a company-wide contest, which are applied in business management and operation.\n\nApplication and results of RPA\n\n| Category | Automatic application of welfare discounts | Streamlined issuance of land registers for applying for power use | Automated search for potential/actual insolvency |\n|----------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| As-is    | Discount suspended in case of moving       | Land register issued by employee per application              | Data collection system for each weak credit      |\n| To-be    | Welfare discount applied without applying for it | RPA issues a land register and notifies personnel             | Data on weak credits sent from sources automatically |\n| Result   | Welfare discount reception rate 81.2%      | 4,135 documents issued automatically                          | 276,000 cases of potential insolvency automatically |\n\nIntelligent Integrated VOC Analysis System\n\nWe developed and are operating the intelligent integrated VOC analysis system to manage inquiries from submission to completion in an integrated way. The separate VOC channels from the KEPCO website, the customer center, and e-People were integrated. VOC is analyzed based on work types, urgency, and customer emotions using AI, upon which the customer service and system are improved.\n\nDigital Business\n\nPromoting Energy Marketplace (EN:TER)\n\nKEPCO operates an integrated energy business platform, address the difficulties of energy businesses and service users and create new values in the energy sector. In EN:TER, various energy-related services and products can be traded, applications using energy data can be used, and renewable energy can be sold and purchased. We are adding energy-specific contents, such as statistical data on customer contract history, and services, such as a PPA portal and a green premium system to support the creation of a new business model.\n\nEN:TER Services\n\n| Members | Partner Companies |\n|---------|-------------------|\n| Customers that use electricity | Service providers |\n| New energy companies | Electrical facility manufacturers/builders |\n| Renewable energy providers | Electrical work providers |\n| Electrical safety administrators | Home appliance manufacturers/distributors |\n\n| Electricity Data Service | Enhancing Energy Efficiency | Trading Renewable Energy |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|\n| \u2022 Energy Data Open Portal | \u2022 Support for high efficiency home appliances | \u2022 Third-party PPA |\n| \u2022 Energy Data Service Market | \u2022 Energy efficiency (K-BEMS) | \u2022 PPA with KEPCO |\n| \u2022 Energy Data Portal for Service Providers | \u2022 Enhancing energy efficiency | \u2022 Green Premium bidding service |\n| | \u2022 New energy business fund | \u2022 Renewable energy transaction information |\nSophisticated Customer Service\n\nIncreased Use of AMI (Remote Metering)\n\nKEPCO plans to supply 22.5 Million AMI (Advanced Metering Infrastructure) devices for remote metering by 2024 and use them as the basis of increasing energy efficiency, providing choices to customers (e.g. rating per hour), and creating a new business model. AMI is a demand-reactive system that allows KEPCO to meter electricity use remotely through two-way communication and notify the customers of their electricity bills at any time so that they can use electricity when the cost is lower. Despite the supply crisis of semiconductors due to COVID-19, we supplied additional 520,000 devices by revising how we order materials and assess equipment technology. We also seek to strengthen the security of electricity data and the construction and operation efficiency by using AMI 2.0 with improved data protection and installation method. AMI 2.0 costs less to install because it has both metering and communicating features and remote operation can be expanded as the software is standardized. Moreover, the electricity-related personal data of customers can be protected with AMI\u2019s security feature.\n\nIncreased Efficiency of Customer Electricity Facility Management\n\nWe continue to increase customer values by providing tailored digital services. We provide information on the quality and safety of electricity on mobile devices for large-scale facilities, such as buildings and factories through the Power Check Mobile service incorporated with AI and data collected via AMI. Electrical safety managers can monitor multiple power facilities at the same time on the Power Check Mobile app, and overload failure can be prevented by using the load pattern prediction AI and an alert system. The safety managers can operate, maintain and repair facilities efficiently with the monthly electricity quality analysis reports.\n\nPer-Hour Rate System for Households\n\nTo reflect customers\u2019 pattern of use in billing, encourage an efficient use of electricity and diversify rate systems, we adopted the per-hour rate system for households that provides price signals based on unit costs. The system allows users to consume electricity more affordably as the price is higher when the demand is high and lower when the demand is low. It is adopted first in Jeju with high distribution of AMI. The AMI customers can compare their bills by viewing the actual consumption data on the Power Planner app, and the non-AMI customers can do so by viewing their energy pattern standard on KEPCO\u2019s website. By adopting it in Jeju, it is expected to stabilize the power system by transferring up to 7.7MWh during daytime when output control occurs.\n\nBusiness Case\n\nAI Energy Efficiency Using Energy MyData\n\nKEPCO is conducting a pilot project using the Apartment Energy MyData in partnership with other companies, such as Samsung Electronics. We collect energy MyData for customers who live in apartments, which used to be neglected in terms of energy efficiency, and provide real-time consumption data to them. Samsung Electronics offers energy saving services by connecting the smart app to control air conditioners and air purifiers. Through the pilot project we plan to establish a standard for collecting and sharing energy MyData and develop various energy efficient services using the data.\nDiversified Future Growth Business Portfolio\n\n**Group companies** Roadmap for Increasing Capacity of Renewable Energy Facilities\n\n(Capacity of facilities owned, excluding hydroelectric power)  \n(Unit: GW)\n\nKEPCO and group companies will achieve carbon neutrality in power generation by supplying renewable energy in a rational way to contribute to the NDC and diversify business portfolio and secure new growth engines by discovering new businesses in the energy sector focusing on renewable energy.\n\n\u203b As per the 9th long-term transmission and transformation facility plan, which will be revised according to the 9th Basic Plan for Power Supply and Demand.\n\n**Group companies** Renewable Energy Capacity per Region  \n(Directly owned facilities as of Dec. 31, 2021)\nRenewable Power Generation on Idle Sites\n\nKEPCO and group companies push for solar power generation using idle sites to develop the land efficiently and promote the use of renewable energy.\n\nKOWEPO built 7.7MW solar power plants on 14 idle sites, such as rooftops, parking lots, and built-up parts of highways, in partnership with Korea Expressway Corporation, while conducting a 40MW solar power generation project using an idle site of a private company located near the Pyeongtaek headquarters.\n\nEWP also constructed 10.8MW solar power facilities on the rooftops of 72 factories in an industrial complex in Busan. KEPCO and the electric power group companies will utilize public and private idle sites and promote renewable power generation to protect the environment and foster local economies in a balanced way.\n\nLeading Hydrogen Industrial Ecosystem\n\nKEPCO and group companies have developed and are adopting the H2GT (Hydrogen to Gas Turbine) technology to reduce GHG emissions, aiming to transition to 100% zero-carbon hydrogen to generate power by 2050. We strive to secure a value chain in the hydrogen business from production to supply and transportation to promote the hydrogen economy.\n\nFor example, KOSPO constructed the Shinincheon Bitdream Hydrogen Fuel Cell Power Plant, which is the world\u2019s largest (80MW) in October 2021 and declared to lead the domestic hydrogen ecosystem with the hydrogen business roadmap that includes developing hydrogen technology, building infrastructure, and securing production technology.\n\nKHNP is pushing for the hydrogen convergence business model for producing hydrogen and building and operating hydrogen charging stations in cooperation with hydrogen suppliers. KHNP seeks to create the Korean U-Shaped Hydrogen Belt upon the business model.\nDiversified Future Growth Business Portfolio\n\n**Group companies** Sales and facility capacity of overseas projects\n\n**Sales**\n- KRW 3,1391 Tn\n\n**Facility capacity**\n- Total 11.9 GW\n\n**Group companies** Mid-term roadmap for overseas projects\n\nKEPCO and group companies are exiting from coal-related businesses and entering more countries with renewable energy.

KHNP also entered the EU market, including Romania, Slovenia, and Spain, using its technologies from operation to repair and disassembly.\n\nGroup companies | Number of Overseas Nuclear Power Projects\n6 Cases\n\nGroup companies | Scale of Overseas O&M Project Orders\nKRW 14.4 Bn\nLeading the Renewable Energy Sector\n\nIncreasing Supply of Renewable Energy\n\nRenewable Portfolio Standard\nThe Renewable Portfolio Standard makes it mandatory for power generation companies (Suppliers) with a capacity of 500MW or more to include at least a certain share of renewable energy (Mandatory supply) in the total power generated. As KEPCO and the electric power group companies participate in the RPS, we strive to increase the share of renewable energy in Korea through various efforts, such as building renewable energy facilities and purchasing renewable energy certificates.\n\nContribution to Reaching National Renewable Energy Supply Target\nThe government is pursuing net-zero policies, such as phasing out coal-fired power plants and increasing renewable power plants as per the 9th Basic Plan for Power Supply and Demand. Following that, 30 out of 60 coal-fired power plants will be shut down by 2034 and 24 out of the 30 plants that are shut down will turn into LNG power plants. KEPCO is successfully operating the Southwest Jeollabuk-do Offshore Wind Power Demonstration Project (60MW), which is the nation\u2019s first public-led large-scale offshore wind power project, and is planning on a total of 2.8GW offshore wind power projects, including the project in Jeju (100MW), Southwest Jeollabuk-do (100MW), and Shinan (1.5GW). We also run the Miryang Hope Light Solar Power Project, in which the profit is shared with local residents, and building a 110MW-capacity solar power facility on idle land in a school campus or a local government. The target share of renewable energy by 2030 is 21.5% as per the Working-Level Plan of the 10th Basic Plan for Power Supply and Demand, and we will raise the share of renewable energy in a rational and planned way once the 10th Basic Plan is confirmed.\n\nRenewable Energy Roadmap of Electric Power Group Companies\n\n(Unit: GW, Accumulated)\nWorld\u2019s First Large-Scale Offshore Wind Turbine Installation Technology\n\nKEPCO became the world\u2019s first to develop a batch installation technology (Multi-purpose Mobile Base of MMB) for offshore wind turbines, which can be assembled on land, transported to the sea, and installed in a designated area. We launched a special MMB vessel that delivers the turbines to the sea in July 2021. Using this technology can cut the installation cost by about KRW 3.7 billion for a 5MW turbine, and the installation time can be reduced from 90 days to 10 days. It is also eco-friendly as it eliminates noise, vibration and flotation.\n\n* Batch installation technology: A technology that allows a turbine to be assembled at the port where it is safe and the entire structure to be picked up and delivered to the sea to be installed.\n\nOffshore wind turbine MMB vessel\n\nEWP | Floating Solar Panels on Daeho Lake\n\nEWP acquired an approval for constructing and operating 98MW floating solar panels around Daeho Lake in Seosan, Chungcheongnam-do by signing an MOU with Seosan on the floating solar panel project that is mutually beneficial to the local community. EWP held more than 150 meetings with local residents before starting on the project to earn their acceptance, and strived to hear from various stakeholders. Under the MOU, Seosan will provide administrative support, including authorization, and Korea East-West Power will involve more local constructors and share the profit from power generation in local communities, such as Daesan-eup. EWP will take the lead in transforming Chungcheongnam-do into a region of green energy with its own capabilities.\n\nSolar power generation complex using an abandoned saltern\n\nTake-off of Jeju Hallim Offshore Wind Power Project\n\nKEPCO, KOMIPO, KEPCO E&C, a constructor, and a financial organizer signed a project financing agreement on the Jeju Hallim Offshore Wind Power Project for the operation and maintenance of offshore wind power plants in February 2022. In the project, a total of 100MW offshore wind power complex (18 5.56MW turbines) will be built in the sea in Jeju with KRW630.3 billion. The designation of the area, the use of public waters, and other authorizations have been granted, thus it is being constructed with the aim of starting commercial operation by 2024. KEPCO oversees the project, and KOMIPO plans to secure 800,000 REC by producing 234GWh renewable energy per year in this project. This project is meaningful in that all turbines are domestically made and the capital is entirely from within the country, establishing a standard for building a wind power ecosystem that is full of domestic technology and capital strength.\n\nSigning a PF agreement on Jeju Hallim Offshore Wind Power Project\n\nKOMIPO | Korea\u2019s Largest Solar Power Site\n\nKOMIPO constructed a solar power plant and a solar ESS power generation complex on a 1 Million-abandoned saltern in Hasa-ri, Yeonggwang-gun. The complex is equipped with a 100MW solar power module and 312MWh ESS facilities generating solar power. It can produce 139GWh per year, which is sufficient for about 62,000 households for a year. The solar panels and key ESS equipment are domestically made, and mostly local companies conducted the electric, civil, and structural engineering and construction. As such, the project has boosted the domestic renewable energy industry and local economy.

We aim to selectively carry out and strategically exit profit-oriented businesses, such as coal-fired power generation, and expand businesses that are suitable for the transition to carbon neutrality, such as LNG CCPP projects, in response to the difficulty regarding the suspension of developing coal-fired power plants. In the long run, we will transition to an eco-friendly overseas project portfolio by focusing on developing renewable power generation projects that have potential for growth (e.g., solar power and wind power). As a result, all overseas coal-fired power generation projects of KEPCO will be ceased after 2050.\n\n| Capacity of Coal-Fired Power | GHG Emissions |\n|-----------------------------|---------------|\n| **Now** | **2030** | **2035** |\n| 4,370MW coal-fired power | 9.2 Million ton/year | 8.1 Million ton/year |\n| 100% | | |\nIntroduction\n\nWe won the order for the UAE nuclear power plant project for building 4 APR 1400 nuclear facilities (5,600 MW) in December 2009. Since then, we have been overseeing the project. The power plant no.1 began its commercial operation in April 2021 as the power plant no.2 did in March 2022. The power plant no.3 was loaded with fuel in June 2022 and connected to the grid in October to supply reliable power to the UAE power grid stably. KEPCO has proven its ability to build and manage nuclear power plants overseas at home and abroad, and the UAE power plant project is recognized as the most successful project in the global nuclear power market. We are making all-out efforts to complete the remaining processes, including the commercial operation of power plants no.3 and 4 through a solid partnership with the UAE.\n\nWinning Overseas Nuclear Power Projects\n\nWe are conducting activities to win nuclear power projects by gathering the strength of the government and the domestic nuclear power industry based on the successful experience of the UAE nuclear power plant project. We are boosting our export competitiveness in the global nuclear market by forming a joint team with the UAE and forging a partnership with the U.S. to jointly enter the nuclear market. We are making tailored efforts to win orders by utilizing our strengths as an energy company and meeting the interest of clients. We are working with the UAE in the nuclear-hydrogen power project in line with the carbon neutrality policy and discussing with South Africa and the U.K. to find ways to collaborate. We have a long-term relationship with countries that are first adopting nuclear power plants, such as Uzbekistan and Ghana. Based on this, we will contribute to achieving the national policy target of exporting 10 nuclear power plants by 2030.\n\nNew Overseas Project | Active Efforts to Enter Foreign Markets\n\nFollowing the 2015 pilot microgrid (MG) project in Canada as the first Korean company to win a MG project in North America, we are expanding our new energy business with the 2018 MG project on the Galapagos Islands and the 2021 project on Guanaja. We saw the potential for expanding the new energy business (AMI, DAS, GIS, etc.) from developing the distribution new business model in the Dominican Republic in 2017, and we are entering new regions with the 2018 GIS project in 4 cities in Bangladesh, and the 2020 feasibility study for smart energy infrastructure development in Indonesia.\n\nOverseas Renewable Energy | Expansion of Business Areas\n\nWe are sparing no effort to gain more footholds in the overseas renewable energy markets, such as California and Mangilao (Solar Power), in addition to the wind power market in China and Jordan. We won the order for the 60MW+32MW/32MWh ESS solar power project in Mangilao, Gwan in 2016 and signed a PPA with the Guam Power Authority in 2018. The construction was completed in June 2022 and the facility is commercially operating.

Gas-fired CCPP projects are seen as a bridge between coal-fired power and green energy production following the declaration to stop winning coal-fired power projects from other countries.\nOverseas Transmission and Distribution | Securing Position in Overseas Markets\n\nIn 2021, KEPCO won the order for building a green energy island in Honduras, improving the power system of Myanmar, and conducting a feasibility test for automating power distribution in the Dominican Republic. As such, we are fostering the consultation business in transmission and distribution. We are securing future growth engines by diversifying businesses and expanding business areas through the AMI pilot project in Sri Lanka, the distribution line project in northern Philippines, the ESS EPC consultation in Guam, and the SCADA/EMS consultation in Uzbekistan. We plan to engage in the follow-up projects and create added value using the transmission/distribution technology and network, and enter overseas markets jointly with other Korean companies through cooperation.\n\nOverseas Coal-Fired Power | Stable Operation of Large-Scale Projects\n\nWe constructed the Vietnam Nghi Son II coal-fired power plant earlier than scheduled in July 2022 on the back of the experience from the fluidized coal-fired power project in the Philippines (200MW) and the heavy oil project in Saudi Arabia (1,204MW). We are currently building the Java 9 & 10 coal-fired power plants in Indonesia (2,000MW) and the Vung Ang 2 coal-fired power plant in Vietnam (1,200MW). We decided not to participate in additional overseas coal-fired power projects in line with the coal-exit movement following the global discussion on carbon neutrality, and we plan to accelerate the effort for coal exit from overseas projects by selling existing coal-fired power plants by 2030.\n\nIncreased Profitability in Overseas Projects through Asset Rationalization\n\nWe are building an asset management system through cooperation with relevant teams and third-party experts to maximize profit and minimize risks in overseas projects. In case of the solar power project in Japan, we formed a task force in response to changes in the renewable energy policy and the prediction for increased risks incurred by earthquakes and output volatility, established a cooperative system with third-party experts and set a specific process to sell the asset. We built the optimal sales strategy based on the decision made by the task force and successfully disposed our equity for early investment return for the first time in overseas businesses. The profit was invested in follow-up projects, such as the solar panel project in Guam. We established a flexible and active asset management system for overseas projects.\n\nIncrease in Profitability through Asset Realization\n\n| Business Case | First Overseas Grid Investment Project |\n|---------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Solar Power (Chitose, Japan) | Equity disposal for early investment return |\n| Project in Shanxi, China | Profit of KRW 7.4 Billion |\n| Gas-Fired CCPP (Al Qatrana, Jordan) | Sold due to environmental issues and safety risks |\n| Wind Power (China) | Profit of KRW 130.3 Billion |\n| Heavy Oil (Rabigh, Saudi Arabia) | Cost cut by facilitating competition for the lifespan extension construction |\n| | Cut KRW 29.5 Billion |\n| | Using the financial support system of China provided to renewable energy companies |\n| | Profit of KRW 14.5 Billion |\n| | Receiving dividend and facility investment by procuring subordinated debt |\n| | Profit of KRW 6 Billion |\n\nWhile we are aiming to expand overseas renewable energy and grid projects in line with the net-zero energy transition movement, we successfully won the UAE underwater transmission grid BOT* project worth $3.84 Billion in 2021.

Electricity transport business and sales business of transmission and distribution networks are not exposed to water pollution risks. On the other hand, UAE Jordan where overseas businesses are ongoing is categorized as a water shortage country according to the WRI(World Resource Institute), WWF(World Wildlife Fund), and PAI(Population Action International). In response to this, KEPCO use sea water as cooling water in Saudi Arabia(Arabic), UAE(Shuweihat), Philippines(Cebu, Ilihan), not underground water, and use heavy water recycled from domestic sewage as cooling water in China(Sanseo), and cool the water using air in Jordan(Al Quatrana), thereby managing and protecting the water.\n\nManagement of Water Usage\nAs one of the performance indicators to implement environmental management, KEPCO selects the water usage and manages the performance and targets every year. KEPCO collects the data of enterprise water usage from operations and has a system of examining and managing the performance monthly and yearly. Water usage information of KEPCO is disclosed on env-info(http://www.env-info.kr).\n\nMinimizing Water Waste and Increasing Recycling Rate\nKEPCO and group companies are striving to protect marine ecosystem and reduce carbon emissions through resource circular generation by developing waste water recycling technologies and establishing facilities. In particular, we are working hard to procure the technology to prevent water pollution and recycle waste water, such as by minimizing waste water discharge and processing desulfurized wastewater.\n\nKOMIPO l ReWater70 Roadmap\nIn consideration with severe water shortage by region caused by climate change, Korea Midland Power established the Roadmap of \u2018KOMIPO ReWater 70.\u2019 This roadmap aims to increase the reused water usage to more than 70% by 2025 through discovery of unused water resource such as sewage and rainwater and reuse business investment. Korea Midland Power aims to secure 5 million tons of reuse water from sewage reprocessing, 330,000 tons of reuse water from rainwater, 1.34 million tons of reuse water from waste water among total reuse water.\n\n| Classification | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 |\n|----------------|------|------|------|------|\n| ReWater Usage Rate | 15% | 20% | 59% | 72% |\n| ReWater Usage (10,000 Tons) | | | | |\n| Sum | 141 | 189 | 552 | 667 |\n| Sewage | 26 | 35 | 400 | 500 |\n| Rainwater | 14 | 18 | 18 | 33 |\n| Waste Water | 101 | 136 | 134 | 134 |\n| Water Supply Usage Rate (10,000 Tons) | 825 | 776 | 376 | 263 |\n\nKOWEPO l Evaporation Enrichment Method\nBy applying the evaporation enrichment method in Taean 1-8 plants, Korea Western Power constructed the zero discharge system of desulfurized wastewater by evaporating waste water, crystallizing impurities, and generating distilled water to be used as power generation water. This facility enables desulfurized waste water to be reused 100%, securing 290,000 tons of power generation water every year, while minimizing the impacts on marine ecosystem by reducing the discharge volume. Going forward, we intend to secure 850,000 tons of power generation water by increasing the recycling rate of water resource through the expansion of waste water reuse facilities and application of integrated control system for water circulation.\n\nBusiness Case\n\nUsed Heavy Water Up-Cycling and Disposal\n\nKHNP made a contract to supply the used heavy water to Chinsan nuclear power plant, China, by upcycling through the reduction of the tritium concentration of used heavy water. Heavy water is the combination of heavy hydrogen and oxygen and it is used as a reactor moderator or coolant and heavy water reactors, including the first Wolsong Nuclear Power Plant, will be permanently phased out. By 2029, a total of 4 plants will be permanently stopped. KHNP developed the upcycling export model of used heavy water without usability, while laying the foundation for creating additional profits regarding nuclear power, in addition to reducing storage cost.\nSecuring Energy Resource\n\nIn line with the competitive energy market to secure energy resource, KEPCO and power companies are striving to secure energy resources stably. The company supplies necessary fuel to overseas Independent Power Producer (IPP) business, thereby increasing the competitiveness to secure IPP business, while planning to minimize business risks, such as by initiating the CNG and shale gas business, coal terminal business, expanding bituminous coal investment in Australia, Indonesia, North America, and expanding uranium investment in Canada, Africa, and Australia to make an optimal investment portfolio. Other than this, we are actively responding to changing environment through the resource quantity secured through various businesses including resource trading business, while also promoting the stability of electricity supply.\n\nRecycling Operating Waste\n\nKEPCO and group companies strive to recycle wastes including waste paint and waste thinner as well as metal occurred in the process of business activities. The company recycles the waste through the recycling company when it comes to recyclable waste, while incinerating and reclaiming the waste that can not be recycled according to the eco-friendly process and lawful process. Moreover, for the disposal of PCBs (Poly Chlorinated Biphenyls) that is categorized as harmful waste, we strictly control the waste transformer according to the PCBs management process, while also discharging and disposing waste transformers containing concentration of 2ppm or more through the PCBs analysis and disposal agency certified by the Ministry of Environment every year. In addition to this, to promote the resource circulation, power companies are currently expanding the waste recycling of coal ash and desulfurized gypsum, while taking the lead in fostering resource circular economy by developing recycling technology regarding by products.\n\nBusiness Case\n\nKOEN\u2019s Resource Circulation Activities\n\nKOEN reduced the SOx emissions through upcycling by recycling \u2018oyster shell\u2019 that used to be abandoned on ocean as SOx absorbents, while contributing to increasing production and sales of SOx plaster, reducing waste disposal cost, and creating jobs. In addition to this, in order to reduce the cost of disposing byproducts from power plants that use wood pellets as fuel, the company is producing the farmland improvement additive (Biochar) applying the waste recycling technology. Charcoal from burning is recycled as organic biochar, which is improving farmlands, thereby contributing to reducing the production cost of the farmland improvement additive and revitalizing local economy.\nEnvironmental Protection for Sustainable Future\n\nIdentifying Biodiversity Based on Environmental Impact Assessment\n\nBased on the Nagoya Protocol, the international protocol containing the utilization guideline of living resources among countries, KEPCO and group companies are strictly managing the status of biodiversity around construction areas. We select the area through strategy impact assessment in consideration with surrounding nature and landscape in case of construction, while analyzing impacts on ecosystem caused by construction from the establishment of construction plan by strictly implementing environmental impact assessment. Based on strategy impact assessment and environmental impact assessment, we are applying design and construction methods that can protect river, soil, geomorphic environments, and biodiversity. KEPCO and group companies comply with laws and regulations regarding biodiversity improvement, wildlife protection, landscape preservation, forest/soil/water resource use, while making utmost efforts to preserve and expand the living animals and species when certain species and living animals have been destroyed due to business activities. For the protection of lands, marine areas, river, and coastal ecosystem, we are carrying out systematic biodiversity protection activities, such as by consistently monitoring environmental impacts, establishing and implementing environmental restoration plans even after constructing electricity facilities. In particular, when required by laws and regulations and stakeholders including local communities, we are carrying out dedicated biodiversity protection activities in consideration with the environmental characteristics of regions containing electricity facilities. Moreover, we are also carrying out specialized programs and voluntary services attended by employees to protect and restore endangered wildlife, sea creatures, and globally endangered species near electricity facilities.\n\n**KEPCO Status of Environmental Impact Assessment Implementation**\n\n* As of December 31, 2021\n\n| Examination regarding environment | Environment impact assessment | Small-scale environment impact assessment |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| 2 Cases                          | 5 Cases                      | 52 Cases                                 |\n\n**Total 59 Cases**\n\n**KEPCO The Number of Operations Paying the Ecosystem Protection Cost**\n\nTotal 23\nImplementing Overseas Greenhouse Gas Reduction Project\n\nAs a global electricity company, KEPCO and power companies have been actively implementing CDM (Clean Development Mechanism) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

In addition, the management is allocated with the business site across the nation to conduct on-site \u2018Safety Inspection\u2019 under his/her supervision as parts of efforts to establish around-the-year on-site inspection system. We are also striving to spread the safety culture, providing a comprehensive training for the workers from suppliers and in-house employees engaged in high-risk work, including 1,188 suppliers, 1,176 representatives, and 5,839 workers. In addition, by conducting a survey of 2,808 field workers, we are promoting field-oriented safety management activities such as improvement of working environments for field workers.\n\nKOEN I Risk/Hazardous Factors Detection and Improvement\n\nKOEN is working to identify and improve harmful and risk factors throughout the entire process. On a regular basis, the company is improving the on-site environments through joint tour inspections and joint safety and health inspections with the Safety and Health Council. When placing orders, the company listens to workers\u2019 opinions on site improvement, and are strengthening risk assessment before starting work, safety level improvement guidance during work, and risk assessment feedback after work. Also, post-evaluation is also being conducted, such as awards for achievement of safety management goals and activities to discover and promote hazards and risk factors in the field. Through these activities to improve safety, Korea South-East Power has achieved zero serious accidents for three consecutive years.\n\n| Risk/Hazardous Factor Detection and Improvement Process |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Everyday**                                           |\n| \u2022 Safety and Health Council, joint tour inspection, etc.|\n| **Placing Orders**                                     |\n| \u2022 Securing on-site safety by listening to workers\u2019 opinions|\n| **While Working**                                      |\n| \u2022 Evaluating and managing work risk review by supervisors|\n| \u2022 On-site guidance for accident prevention and training for partner companies|\n| \u2022 Reflection of hazardous and risk factors assessment |\n| **In Progress**                                        |\n| \u2022 Rewards for meeting safety management goals          |\n\nKHNP I JSA-KGNP Development\n\nKHNP developed a unique risk assessment model (JSA-KHNP) by supplementing the functions of the existing P-D-C-A cycle to strengthen the effectiveness of risk assessment for major disaster risk factors. Work hazards and risk environments around the workplace were described in detail to enable accurate risk assessment, and work safety analysis techniques were used to improve efficiency in identifying risk factors. In particular, the risk assessment reviewers and approvers can utilize a checklist to ensure a review without omission in objective perspectives. In addition, essential check items have been strengthened to be reviewed by supervisors before starting work, and a post-performance evaluation checklist has been added to ensure continuous improvement of the risk assessment process.\n\nKOSPO I Strengthening Cooperative System for Safety Management of Vulnerable Workers\n\nKOSPO defined the roles and responsibilities by job and position at the company, by establishing safety management standards for all stages from order placement to completion, and established management standards for high-risk work likely to lead serious accidents. Also, it conducted work safety risk assessments led by partners to make sure that workers could directly identify and recognize risks, and adopted a computerized collaboration infrastructure system for all stages of safety work procedures, from request for work, planning and permission, to review and approval. The company analyzed 17 cases of crane and forklift accidents that occurred at five power generation companies to designate the targets for hazardous equipment management, and establish management standards to take the lead in preventing safety accidents for workers engaged in special tasks.\n\nIn addition, the company is running a safety innovation school together with its partners, adopting safety competency mentoring for small-scale suppliers, and developed a mobile risk reporting app, and conducted preliminary safety competency review and safety management implementation level evaluation for suppliers to create a sustainable safety ecosystem.

In particular, safety diagnoses are conducted on facilities vulnerable to fire and explosion accidents, and risk improvement activities are implemented based on the results.\nCyber Security and Personal Information Protection\n\nInformation Security System\n\nKEPCO is establishing and strengthening an information security management system to protect the national power grid from cyber threats getting increasingly intelligent and targeted. The company-wide information security system is managed by the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), with more than 20-year experiences in information security technology, and CISO is prohibited from holding concurrent positions other than information security. There is a separate information security office under the CISO and the office identifies risk factors and areas of vulnerabilities, posing treats to KEPCO\u2019s information security, and prepares countermeasures against risk situations caused by external attacks or large-scale disasters. Information security activities and performance of all departments other than the information security activities and performance of all departments other than the Information Security Office are reflected in the internal performance evaluation, and disciplinary standards for information security violations of executives and employees are established to take personnel measures such as disciplinary action in case of violation.\n\nSpreading Information Security Culture\n\nKEPCO encourages the active participation of management and employees across the company to strengthen the information security system and spread the information security culture. Adopting \u2018Basic Information Security Guidelines\u2019 to define step-by-step response procedures to information security threats that all executives and employees can access and read and at the same time, KEPCO established information security training plan to boost awareness of executives and all employees and provide customized practical training related to information security. In addition, trainings are provided for employees to respond to external attacks such as DDoS and to swiftly respond when business systems are at risk of information security.\n\nKEPCO is operating a reward system for employees showing excellent performance in information security to create a work culture in which employees can autonomously detect, report, improve, and receive feedback on information security vulnerabilities, rather than providing one-way education for employees. In 2021, a total of 122 information security vulnerabilities were identified by executives and employees, and 50 executives and employees were for detecting and making improvement on critical security vulnerabilities. As a result of these efforts, KEPCO has achieved \u2018Zero information security incidents\u2019, \u2018Actively participation in cyber security contests by government agencies and achieving the highest score(1st place in the contest by the National Intelligence Service and by MOTIE)\u2019.\n\nWe are running security review procedures for cyber assets and information security systems at all times, and implementing specialized education and training to nurture cyber security experts.

Lastly, we are providing future-oriented education, introducing a \u2018Blended Learning System\u2019 that combines e-learning with practices and discussion.\n\nDirections for Future Generation Nurturing\n\n| MZ Generation Cultivation Master Plan | HR Innovation Advisory Group | Blended Learning System |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|\n| 2,407 Employees participating in Job Mentoring | 28 Teams, 120 Employees participating on Corporate Policy Improvement | 15,184 Employees participating on learning programs |\n| 15 Employees applying Master\u2019s course education in new growth areas | 9,145 Employees participating in Vision Mentoring | 13,756 Employees participating on Customized e-learning |\n\nESG Management Expert Nurturing and Education\nAs the importance of corporate sustainability and ESG management is growing, ESG-related training was newly introduced for employees and stakeholders to increase the understanding of ESG management among all executives and employees and to boost awareness.\n\nSustainability Education Areas\n\n| Carbon Neutrality | Safety Social Value | Labor-Mgmt Relations, Ethical Management |\n|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| New growth areas including carbon neutrality | (Safety) Support for acquiring professional license | (Professional) Competency enhancement including doctorates in labor |\n| Building a system for expert nurturing | (Mutual Growth) Energy Valley workforce nurturing | (Ethics) Improving ethics awareness across the company |\n| Expanding the areas of professional certificate acquisition |\n\nEmployees Education Status\n\n| Employees Education Status | (Unit : KRW Million, hours) |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Total Education Cost      | Total Education Hours       |\n| 2019                      | 2020                        | 2021                        |\n| 24,841                    | 15,901                      | 15,122                      |\n\nEducation cost per employee\n\n| Education cost per employee | KRW 649,338 |\n|-----------------------------|-------------|\n| 1Education hours per employee | 72 hours |\nTalent Recruitment\n\nStrategic Talent Recruitment\nKEPCO is making continuous efforts to improve the quality of employment and hire talents that meet the demands of the field. We recruited 1,051 new entries by expanding our hiring capacity, discovering jobs in new business areas and securing additional quotas. In addition, the specialized fields were further subdivided (36 \u2192 53), including new fields such as industrial safety and offshore wind power, and the research fields in research category were also subdivided (24 \u2192 55), resulting in the number of people hired in specialized fields was expanded from 59 to 122, compared to the previous year. In addition, KEPCO is reflecting ESG-related questions during job interviews to hire talent with a high level of understanding and awareness of ESG. KEPCO plans to strengthen its strategic talent recruitment in line with the management strategy and goals.\n\nData Analysis-based Recruitment Process\nKEPCO verified the feasibility of the recruitment process based on HR big data analysis for efficient data-based human resource management, breaking away from the traditional HR management method. The HR Analytics organization was newly established to reinforce the manpower of experts in the field of information statistics. Based on this, the optimal operation plan for HR management will be analyzed including analysis on recruitment time and scale, personnel transfer, promotion and leave qnxduwntpd, and the HR data integration platform will be established and further expanded in 2023.\n\nExpanding Occasional Recruitment\nKEPCO introduced a real-time management system of the gap between the required and current workers for efficient manpower management. By maximizing new recruitment through occasional recruitment through real-time comprehensive analysis of the gap between the required and current workers, we expanded the number and size of recruitment. Individual monitoring was conducted for groups frequently using leave of absence, and precisely prediction was made based on the number of people scheduled to take leave or return to work in real time. After reflecting this in the recruitment plan, we were able to manage the gap between required and current workers efficiently with recruitment in a timely manner.\n\nEfforts to Convert to Full-time Position\nKEPCO strived to prevent inappropriate non-regular employment in advance by introducing the pre-screening system, which was fully revised and began to be applied in earnest 2020. As a result, the number of term-based workers continuously decreased, declining 29 people in 2021. In addition, dispatched workers were converted to regular workers at three group companies, and support for management stabilization was made by improving the working conditions of workers converted to regular workers and operating a joint task force between the parent company and affiliates.\n\nJob Creation for the Youth\nKEPCO is making continuous efforts to create jobs for the youth. First of all, 97 additional quotas were added through job discovery in new industries to expand recruitment capacity, and 122 new entries were hired in specialized fields by expanding recruitment in specialized fields where young people have strengths. As a result, 94% of new hires were from the younger generation, resulting in a total of 986 full-time employees. In addition, to expand opportunities for youth internships, 10 job areas suitable for youth internships were discovered, and office and electrical work fields were selected separately to provide experiences highly aligned with actual jobs.\n\nAchievement in Youth Job Creation\n\n| Youth job creation | 2,779 |\n|-------------------|-------|\n| Hiring the youth in full-time positions | 986 |\n| Youth Internship | 1,793 |\n| Experience-oriented internship participants becoming full-time employees | 140 |\n\nRegional Recruitment\nKEPCO is actively recruiting and nurturing talents from non-metropolitan areas and population-relocated areas to build a win-win and fair employment ecosystem to grow together with the region. First, through the operation of the local professional employee system, it pursued stable operation of local offices by making it mandatory for employees to work in the region they applied for, for 10 years. Local business offices require manpower with high local knowledge and long-term employment, so the ratio of local experts is set at 50-60%, and the duties for local experts are expanded, such as Level 4 civil engineers and Level 5 drawing managers and with these efforts, we achieved 57.1% of the talent recruitment from the non-metropolitan area.\n\nPreferential System for the Underprivileged\nKEPCO is continuously improving the system to increase job accessibility and job support opportunities for the underprivileged. With consulting and support agreements with the Korea Employment Agency for the Disabled and introduction of limited competitive employment for the disabled, the number of full-time employees with disabilities increased 90% compared to the previous year (42 people in 2021), and 177 interns with disability were hired. For persons of national merits and low-income households, KEPCO hired them for 80 jobs with a preferential system such as special recruitment for veterans and exemption from document screening. In the case of multicultural families and North Korean defectors, a preferential system was newly established to give 5% additional points in the first-round document screening. In addition, we hired 195 high school graduates by providing qualification acquisition training and converting to full-time positions for high school graduates.\n\n*3 Group Companies : KEPCO MCS, KEPCO FMS, KEPCO CSC\nPerformance Management and Compensation\n\nIntroducing the Total Quota for Performance Evaluation Indicators\n\nTo address the difficulty of executives and employees concentrating on core tasks, due to the increase in basic indicators among performance evaluation indicators and the burden of evaluation on evaluators due to the increase in the number of indicators, the performance evaluation indicator total amount system was introduced to create an environment where competencies can be concentrated on core tasks. The total quota of performance evaluation indicator system sets the limit for the total number of performance evaluation indicators and take out the same No. of existing indicators as new indicators are introduced. KEPCO defined the optimal number of indicators by analyzing key indicators such as government evaluation, management goals, and key tasks, and evaluates the appropriateness of indicators such as business contribution, representativeness, rationality, reliability, and controllability to institutionalize the total quota for indicators. As a result of the analysis on performance evaluation indicators in 2021, four new indicators, including the public procurement priority purchase rate, were newly introduced, and the lower four indicators for adequacy evaluation, such as distributed power generation DB accuracy, were abolished.\n\nIntroduction of 360\u00b0 Multi-dimensional Evaluation\n\nKEPCO has advanced the job evaluation system by introducing a 360\u00b0 multi-dimensional evaluation with both superiors and colleagues participating. The 360\u00b0 multi-dimensional evaluation involves the participation of various stakeholder groups, including HR experts such as professors, labor attorneys, and management consultants who have knowledge and experience in overall KEPCO business, and labor union leaders and union members for the horizontal evaluation method for each job unit and management and participation of supervisors including the management and co-workers, for a vertical evaluation at each organizational level. By reinforcing the evaluation of supervisors and co-workers who have a detailed understanding of job descriptions in organizational units, fairness and internal acceptance of personnel management and job evaluation systems have been improved. In addition, we secured a connection between job evaluation and job grade through role-based job grade redesign, and improved the completeness of job evaluation by promoting job reorganization and advancing job description components. KEPCO\u2019s job analysis and evaluation system was selected as an \u2018Excellent Case of Job-centered Remuneration System Renewal in Public Institutions\u2019 by the Ministry of Strategy and Finance.\n\nPerformance-based Compensation System\n\nKEPCO motivates its employees to actively focus on their work by establishing work-oriented management innovation and a fair performance-based compensation system. Compensation is differentiated according to effort and ability, such as task difficulty and importance, performance generated, improvement and others. In addition, employees who have created innovative achievements are rewarded with \u2018KEPCO Award\u2019, \u2018Technology Creativity Award\u2019, \u2018Integrity Manifesto\u2019, and \u2018Budget Reduction Achievement Fund\u2019 are rewarded. We also provide opportunities of education such as overseas master\u2019s and doctoral degree courses and benchmarking training, as well as domestic MBA and professional degree programs.\n\nBy strengthening the performance-oriented personnel system, executives and employees with excellent business capabilities or who have produced tangible results are actively promoted. During 2021, 8 people making special contribution, such as HVDC construction and new technology development, were specially promoted. As part of the internalization of safety management, heads of business sites with unsatisfying safety and health activities are demoted to strengthen their sense of responsibility.\n\nJob-centered, Reasonable Remuneration System with Labor, Management and Employees\n\nKEPCO has decided to make efforts to convert to a job-oriented remuneration system through continuous communication with labor, management and employees. In relation to the job evaluation system, the \u2018Remuneration System Renewal Council\u2019 was established to build a labor-management communication network, and the \u2018Job Evaluation Committee\u2019 was organized to review overall matters in the job evaluation process. In addition, the \u2018Wage Negotiation Committee\u2019 was held to reach an agreement on the remuneration system between labor and management, while securing acceptance on the revision of the remuneration system through on-site wage briefings. Based on various efforts, such as expanding job compensation for important and avoided tasks by reflecting field opinions, we were able to sign a wage agreement for the first time among the first-tier public corporations in 2021.\n\nResults of Survey on Evaluation Satisfaction\n\n| Evaluation | 2020 | 2021 |\n|------------|------|------|\n| Organization Evaluation | 88.8 | 90.8 |\n| Individual Evaluation | 89.0 | 89.3 |\n\n* Converting a 10-point standard into a 100-point scale\nActive Work Support and Eradication of Passive Administration\n\nWe have extended the application period for \u2018Active Duty Exemption\u2019, in which executives and employees are exempted from liability for partial procedural defects in the process of faithfully and actively carrying out their work to promote the public interest. In addition, executives and employees showing excellent examples of active duty exemption were rewarded and a case book was published and shared throughout the company. In order to eradicate possible infringe upon the rights and interests of customers or financial losses to the company due to passive behavior such as omission or neglect of duty by executives and employees, personnel management measures were strengthened when \u2018passive administration\u2019 was detected in the audit. To prevent this \u2018passive administration\u2019, we made preventive education mandatory for employees.\n\n| Category                        | Previous                                                                 | Improved                                                                 |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Innovate the Way We Work        | \u2022 Collective and face-to-face meetings                                   | \u2022 Innovate meeting culture using video conferencing system               |\n|                                 | \u2022 Long waiting time for face-to-face reports                            | \u2022 Encourage non-face-to-face reporting through e-mail and messenger       |\n| Build Digital Environments       | \u2022 Work with desktop PCs                                                 | \u2022 Build cloud, laptop, and wireless infrastructure                       |\n|                                 | \u2022 In-house wired phone(Fixed type)                                      | \u2022 Introduce mobile in-house phone and secured messenger Power Talk       |\n| Automate Basic Repetitive Tasks  | \u2022 3 Cases including PPA business tax invoice payment, simplifying corporate credit cards settlements | \u2022 Automatic extraction of customer information to find indications of insolvency (auction/public sale), Expanding to 10 cases, including survey on the latest price of power equipment |\n\nActive Work Support and Eradication of Passive Administration\n\nWe have extended the application period for \u2018Active Duty Exemption\u2019, in which executives and employees are exempted from liability for partial procedural defects in the process of faithfully and actively carrying out their work to promote the public interest.

To prevent this \u2018passive administration\u2019, we made preventive education mandatory for employees.\n\nIn order to resolve the issue of long-term unused materials due to manual material quantity billing, we reduced long-term unused in storage by establishing a management system for material requirement reconciliation and using the remaining materials for other construction projects. In addition, the material center operated by each regional headquarters was converted into an integrated logistics center, and material storage operations efficiency was increased, adopting mobile-based real-time inventory management and multi-level loading to improve space utilization.\n\n| Business Case | Work Efficiency Improvement with Logistics Process Innovation |\n|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n|               | In order to resolve the issue of long-term unused materials due to manual material quantity billing, we reduced long-term unused in storage by establishing a management system for material requirement reconciliation and using the remaining materials for other construction projects.

In order to fundamentally eradicate discrimination likely in the recruitment process, all stages of recruitment, including document screening and written screening, processed as blind recruitment and in particular, in the document screening process, female applicants are processed, considering the gender equality recruitment target system(20%). Also, we have taken precautionary measures to prevent gender discrimination and disadvantage against applicants during the recruitment process, providing education on gender equality for job interviewers. In addition, KEPCO strengthened the band-range personnel evaluation system to prevent paternalistic performance evaluation based on seniority, and provided equal opportunities for promotion for female employees, recognizing the use of parental leave(3 years) as the years of service to prevent female employees from being eliminated from promotion due to parental leave. Through these efforts, additional female non-executive directors were appointed in 2021 and the company appointed the first female head of regional divisions, and witnessed women promoted to the Level 1 position.\n\nEmpowerment of Female Talents\nKEPCO is operating various capacity-building programs for female executives and employees to increase the number of high-level female managers. We operate \u2018Senior Manager Female Leaders Forum\u2019 to strengthen the policy capabilities of Level 2 female senior managers, such as business planning, and support participation in external communities such as \u2018WIN Conference\u2019 to form a network with external female leaders. To enhance leadership competency for Level 3 managers \u2018Ewha Leadership Course\u2019 and \u2018Female Executive Class\u2019 are operated, and \u2018Vision Mentoring\u2019 and \u2018Job Mentoring\u2019 courses are operated to help the Level 4 female employees acquire job competencies to provide opportunities to design future career in relation to individual duties and visions. As of 2021, we supported 22 female employees in master\u2019s and doctoral degree courses, 62 in professional certification courses, and 12 in language courses to strengthen their capabilities.\n\nAchievements in Fostering Female Workforce and Maternity Protection\n\n| Category                  | 2020 | 2021 | Up/Down |\n|---------------------------|------|------|---------|\n| Master\u2019s/Doctoral Degree  | 17   | 22   | +29.4%  |\n| Professional Certification| 623  | 62   | -       |\n| Language Course           | -    | 12   | New     |\n\nThe Current Status of Female Managers\n\n| Year | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Total(persons) |\n|------|---------|---------|---------|----------------|\n| 2019 | 1       | 27      | 420     | 448            |\n| 2020 | 1       | 16      | 483     | 519            |\n| 2021 | 1       | 12      | 528     | 571            |\n\n* Those on leave, suspension included\n\n* Based on KEPCO\n\n- Percentage of females employees in Level 4 recruitment: 35.5% \u2192 37.9%\n- Key Positions*: 155 \u2192 183\n- Percentage of Female Managers: 9.1% \u2192 9.8%\n\n* HQ policy departments, regional HQ head, etc.\nMaternity Protection Program\nKEPCO has a variety of welfare programs in place to ensure optimized working environments for work and life balance. We established a maternity protection program to run reduced working hours and leave of absence to ensure the healthcare and childrearing time for pregnant women, and integrated services such as white papers on childcare e-books to help employees live a healthy and harmonious family life. At the same time, we grant additional points in recruitment for certain positions as part of job support for women with career discontinuation.\n\nExpanding Gender Understanding\nKEPCO agreed on the importance of understanding between different genders and gender sensitivity, and newly opened and conducted gender-balanced leadership training for deputy general managers. In this training, we learned how to expand our understanding of different generations and genders and better communicate. Also, participants acquired the qualifications and competencies required as middle managers of organizations to embrace gender diversity, by exploring the need to establish gender partnerships that lead to improved organizational performance and how to establish it.\n\nKOWEPO I Training Female Managers following Life Cycle\nKOWEPO applies an upper limit on the number of employees in the same department for employees in Level 4 positions, and encourages them to have various job experiences through job changes after 3 years of service and transfer after 5 years of service. We provide leadership and job competency training for female middle managers in Level 3, and encourage them to acquire related certifications. In particular, they are assigned to business management and facility support departments to help them grow as business development and construction managers. In addition, we are expanding participation of senior female managers in Level 1, 2 at major committees, in the process of management decision-making, for promotion review and Carbon Neutral Response TF. We are striving to foster female managers and female human resources by setting the direction for human resource development based on analysis on female human resources utilization along the lifecycle, supporting leadership and network building through participation in internal and external women leader education.\n\nKOSPO I Realization of Gender Equality and Cultivation of Female Leaders\nKOSPO launched \u2018KOSPO Gender Equality Development Committee\u2019 to strengthen gender equality and discover and implement improvement tasks from a gender-balanced perspective. Female executives are in charge of the entire process, including planning, task discovery, implementation, and inspection for the realization of gender equality within the organization and defined six tasks for gender balance including establishing a parental leave manual and improving female employee career management to ensure gender equality. In addition, we are operating various training programs to nurture female executive director candidates. Also, we are running courses for master\u2019s and doctoral degree education by field and rotation system for job positions to develop management and field capabilities, and at the end of 2021, Korea Southern Power appointed the first female director at Hadong Power Plant.\nPractical Support for Work-Life Balance\n\nImprovement in Work-Life Balance System\n\nWith changes in the external environment related to the improvement of working conditions, such as \u2018Encouraging Childbirth to Tackle Population Decline\u2019 and \u2018Reduced Working Hours for a Life with Family Dinner\u2019, and internal expectations such as growing interest in work-life balance and welfare programs among employees, KEPCO established company-wide work environments and implemented corporate culture improvement activities.

In addition, a flexible work hour is implemented to improve work efficiency with self-directed work time design, and work infrastructure has been strengthened following the implementation of the telecommuting system such as in-house mobile phone apps and cloud PCs.\n\nWe are also contributing to the creation of new jobs by strengthening parental leave, encouraging male employees to use parental leave, and securing additional hiring capacity for vacancies caused by the flexible work system.

Temporary Board of Directors is collected when necessary. While allowing directors to join the 100 billion won of executive liability insurance for courageous decisions, according to the Commercial Act, directors are not allowed to work as a director, a member of the executive committee and auditor we restrict the additional job through the BOD operation regulation to make sure that they can put their time and energy in important decision making. And they should report to the Board of Directors and get approval regarding the additional job when trying to get additional jobs in other companies.\n\nTo secure the transparency in Board of Directors, KEPCO thoroughly manages and monitors the conflicting activities by ensuring that directors get approval from Board of Directors when directors try to utilize the KEPCO\u2019s business opportunities as their interests or third-party\u2019s interests in accordance with Article 398 and 398 of the Commercial Act. In addition, directors who have special relationship with proposals of Board of Directors, they are not allowed to participate in resolution of the relevant proposal.

Regarding the management goals to be achieved during the term, we make management contracts with the government(Minister of the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy) and are assessed by the Public Institution Management Evaluation Group regarding the implementation performance. The salary of inside directors, including CEO, is set by the \u2018Executive Salary Guideline for Public Institution and quasi-governmental departments\u2019 to set the salary limits and the salary is paid within the approved compensation limit determined by the Board of Directors.

As the company listed on the securities market, 49% of shares excluding the government\u2019s share is held by foreigners and other shareholders and KEPCO does not issue the golden share that allows shareholders with a share to exercise the right of veto regarding the resolution matters of the shareholders\u2019 meeting.\n\n| Month | Classification | Government | Korean Development Bank | Foreigners | Others | Sum |\n|-------|----------------|------------|-------------------------|------------|--------|-----|\n| 2021.12 | Number of shares | 116,841,794 | 211,235,264 | 91,105,897 | 222,781,122 | 641,964,077 |\n|       | Ratio (%)       | 18.2       | 32.9                    | 14.19      | 34.71  | 100 |\n\nEfforts to Ensure the Rights of Stakeholders\n\nKEPCO is carrying out various activities to ensure the rights of shareholders. We ensure the basic right, such as profit-sharing right, participation of shareholders\u2019 meeting and exercising voting rights, and information provision for exercising voting rights stipulated in the Commercial Act. Furthermore, various communication channels allow the reliable communication with shareholders and DART and website disclose the IR material (Management performance and prediction information), thereby providing shareholders and potential investors with useful information for decision making. In addition to that, IR and NDR collect various requests and opinions from shareholders to ensure the reasonable management activities.\n\nVoting Rights System (Electronic Voting System)\n\nKEPCO regulates that recruitment announcement should be made at least before two weeks to make sure that shareholders recognize the proposal of shareholders\u2019 meeting in advance. Furthermore, for shareholders who are not able to participate in the shareholders\u2019 meeting due to the location and time, we adopted the electronic voting system from December 2015. Therefore, shareholders of KEPCO can exercise the voting rights on online without having to attend in person.\n\nGrant One Share and One Vote\n\nBased on the Commercial Act and Articles of Association, we ensure the voting rights according to the one-share-one-vote rule. As of late 2021, the total shares of common shares are 641,964,077 and we don\u2019t have treasury share.\n\n| Classification | Type of share | Common share | Preferred share | Sum |\n|----------------|---------------|--------------|-----------------|-----|\n| I.

From 2017, KEPCO\u2019s governance report explains the corporate governance policy, rights and role of shareholders and BOD, and the current status of internal audit organizations and outside auditors in detail, and the compliance with 15 relevant key indicators is disclosed to all stakeholders. Governance report is disclosed on the KEPCO website and DART system.\n\nCompliance with Key Indicators of KEPCO Governance\n\n| Classification | Indicator | Compliance Status | Explanation on O/X mark |\n|----------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------------|\n| Shareholders   | 1) Announce the shareholders\u2019 meeting before four weeks | X | Notify and announce the shareholders\u2019 meeting before two weeks |\n|                | 2) Implement electronic voting system | \u25cb | Introduce and utilize the electronic voting system |\n|                | 3) Hold shareholders\u2019 meeting excluding the concentrated day | \u25cb | Hold shareholders\u2019 meeting on March 29 excluding the concentrated day |\n|                | 4) Announce the dividend policies and dividend implementation plan to shareholders at least once a year | X | Disclose the dividend implementation plan on the day when Board of Directors makes decision |\n| BOD            | 5) Devise and operate the CEO succession policy (including the appointment policy when it comes to emergency situations) | \u25cb | Operate the appointment process for the head of an institution according to the Act on the Management of Public Institutions |\n|                | 6) Devise and operate the internal control policy | \u25cb | Operate the internal accounting management regulations |\n|                | 7) Separate the chairman of Board of Directors and CEO | \u25cb | The chairman of the Board of Directors is appointed among non-executive directors and separated from CEO |\n|                | 8) Adopt the cumulative voting system | \u25cb | Cumulative voting system is not excluded according to the Articles of Association |\n|                | 9) Come up with policies to make sure that people who are responsible for corporate value damage and infringement of shareholders\u2019 interests are appointed as executives | \u25cb | Disqualification and ability examination are assessed comprehensively from the Executive |\n|                | 10) There is no outside director who has been holding office for more than 6 years | \u25cb | The term of outside directors is two years and they can serve consecutive terms on a yearly basis |\n| Audit organization | 11) Provide training at least once a year | \u25cb | The term of outside directors is two years and they can serve consecutive terms on a yearly basis |\n|                | 12) Establish the independent internal audit department (Internal audit organization) | \u25cb | There is an internal audit organization under the Audit Committee |\n|                | 13) There are accounting professionals or financial professionals in the internal audit organization | \u25cb | Appoint an accountant or financial professional among audit members |\n|                | 14) Internal audit organization holds a meeting with outside auditors without executives once a quarter | \u25cb | Hold an in-person meeting more than once a year quarterly |\n|                | 15) Devise the process with internal audit organization in the management-related information | \u25cb | Ensure by the audit regulations |\nReinforcing the Risk Identification and Preemptive Response\n\nKEPCO and group Companies are facing unprecedented risks including climate change, energy supply disruptions and sudden rises in energy prices, and concerns about the economic slowdown. Amid the uncertainty of external conditions, we are planning to secure the future-oriented growth engine and dominate the overseas markets and new industries through preemptive technology innovation and energy system transition, turning the risk into opportunities to achieve win-win growth. To this end, Audit Committee under BOD, the highest decision-making body, ESG Committee, and Advisory Committee will play a major role in preventing and minimizing the risks preemptively from the professional view.\n\nKEPCO\n\nAs KEPCO is facing unprecedented crises including a sudden rise in material costs and stricter ESG regulation, we are sharing electric business-related issues and maximizing the risk management capabilities by organizing consultative groups such as \u2018Meetings with the presidents of electric group companies\u2019 and \u2018Emergency Planning Committee of group companies.\u2019 Furthermore, we established the disaster countermeasures for stable electricity supply and sustainable supply chains by providing subcontractors with ESG transition support, thereby establishing the ESG-based risk management system throughout the electric industry. Going forward, we will consistently strive to communicate and cooperate with major stakeholders such as group companies and subcontractors to supply sustainable \u2018Human-centered Clean and Warm Energy\u2019\n\nKHNP\n\nKHNP launched the ESG Committee in August 2021 to respond to ESG-based risks preemptively. ESG management of KHNP is focusing on achieving the coexistence between nuclear power and renewable energy, leading a carbon-neutral system, strengthening human rights and safe operation, and having tailored communication with stakeholders. Especially, KEPCO puts a priority on the safe operation of nuclear power plants. ESG Committee of KHNP will endeavor to operate the nuclear power plants safely by encouraging active communication and voluntary problem-solving.\n\nKOEN\n\nKOEN established the \u2018KOEN 2050 Carbon-neutral Roadmap\u2019 to quickly respond to climate change risks in a decisive manner. The company is speeding up the large-scale solar photovoltaic power business and offshore wind power business to convert the coal thermal power generation into new renewable energy generation. In addition, we are diversifying the low-carbon technologies such as CCUS (Carbon Capture, Utilization, and storage) to achieve a 100% reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions, cultivating the climate-related new industry. Going forward, we will keep strengthening the capabilities of climate change risk management by communicating with stakeholders, ushering in the energy transition era, and achieving 2050 carbon neutrality.\nKOMIPO\n\nKOMIPO established the \u2018KOMIPO Ethical Management Standard Model\u2019 comprising six major factors including the establishment of ethical awareness and identification of ethical risks to systematically manage the integrity ethics and human rights risks. KEPCO adopted the human rights management system that manages ethical risks by breaking them into key risks and general risks, monitoring the human rights risks by the business site in advance, and improving the shortcomings gradually. Going forward, we will pursue transparent governance and ethical compliance management to win the trust of various stakeholders and Korean people, thereby becoming a reliable public institution.\n\nKOWEPO\n\nKOWEPO established the ESG Committee within BOD in June 2021 to actively respond to the national carbon-neutrality policy related to climate change. Especially, KOWEPO is supporting the ESG management of subcontractors and improving regulations for fair trade to spread the ESG culture. For example, the company is discovering practical cooperation measures and implementing them by carrying out \u2018ESG consulting support for subcontractors\u2019 and \u2018Outreach CEO mutual growth management.\u2019 Going forward, KOWEPO and ESG Committee will strive to achieve mutual and sustainable growth with contractors. Thank you.\n\nKOSPO\n\nIn February 2022, European Parliament revealed the \u2018Due Diligence Guideline of Supply Chains\u2019 that requires companies to monitor and improve the existing due diligence system of supply chains. It means that we need leading ESG risk management different from existing support activities for supply chains. In response to this, KOSPO is taking the lead in managing the ESG-related risks of supply chains by encouraging subcontractors to improve their ESG levels and implementing safety level strengthening business. For effective ESG management, we established the ESG Committee in May 2021 and turned it into an \u2018Open ESG Management Committee\u2019 by recruiting private experts. Going forward, we will endeavor to realize sustainable ESG management through the solidarity of the industry ecosystem.\n\nEWP\n\nAs stakeholders are asking for safety at the workplace and the Serious Disaster Punishment Act has been implemented, systematic safety management is becoming more important. Under the slogan of \u2018No Development without Safety\u2019, EWP puts a priority on workers\u2019 safety when it comes to its management. Last year, Korea East-West Power monitored all activities related to regulations, systems, and the way of work by operating the \u2018Special Safety TF\u2019 led by the CEO and improved the shortcomings to prevent industrial disasters. Going forward, Korea East-West Power will strive to strengthen the constitution of safety management to prevent ESG risks and become the leading company in terms of the eco-friendly energy transition.\nEnterprise Risk Management\n\nRisk Management System\n\nKEPCO is facing two major paradigm shifts including eco-friendly energy transition and ESG management adoption. The new paradigm comes with opportunities to become the world-class power supply company and risks caused by uncertainties. Therefore, we are operating the management system to prevent the possible risks in advance and efficiently respond to risks emerged. We regularly host the management meetings and business strategy meetings led by executives to share the inspection results of internal and external management environment and risks by area. By doing so, we are exploring how to collectively respond to difficult risks that are not handled by individual department with relevant departments.\n\nKEPCO established the enterprise risk system to identify and manage various types of risks and designated CRO (Chief Risk Officer) to operate the risk governance. By establishing the risk management department by type to identify, report, and respond to risks by factors.\n\nTogether with that, KEPCO is independently operating the Risk Deliberation Committees comprising of inside and outside professionals by finance, business, and operation, outside auditors, and Audit Committee in the Board of Directors. Furthermore, we are working hard to make sure that internal control system is operated effectively by establishing the independent internal audit organization under the Audit Committee.\n\nIn the Risk Deliberation Committee, while the majority of directors should be outside directors to secure independence and expertise, financial risks are disclosed by reviewing and evaluating the financial statement and internal accounting management system by independent outside auditors. In addition, we established the ESG Committee comprising of outside directors to review and deliberate the major reporting and decision-making matters regarding the non-financial risks such as environment, society, and governance.\n\nKEPCO Risk Management Organization Chart\n\nKEPCO Risk Monitoring Process\n\n- **Risk Factor Monitoring**: Carry out regular monitoring through risk management\n- **Risk Factor Impact Analysis**: Impact analysis by the department in charge of each risk factor\n- **Determining the Level of Risk Response**: When a risk factor occurs, the relevant committee is convened and a decision is made\n- **Response Scenario Operation**: Immediate response by the relevant department\nRisk Management Plan by Type\n\nFinancial Risk Management\n\nStrategy & Planning Division is evaluating and managing the enterprise risks and opportunities and related impacts are reflected in the financial management areas. Financial risk management portal establishes the medium- and long-term financial management plan every year by monitoring financial risk factors and analyzing short-term, mid-term and long-term management environment, reporting them to the Board of Directors. In terms of KRI, we set the standard according to the three years of fluctuation by indicators and scenarios and manage them in accordance with 5 stage risk level (Preparation, Attention, Caution, Alert, Serious).\n\n#1 Profitability Decline caused by the Fuel Cost Increase\n(Explanation and effects) When price fluctuation is not reflected on the electric bill, the hike in fuel cost such as bituminous coal, petroleum, LNG may not be reflected on the current electricity bill. As a result, the financial soundness of KEPCO may be undermined.\n(Easing activities and plans) By applying the cost-linked bill, we disclosed the basic oil cost (Electricity Bill) in December 2021 and we decided that the fuel cost is 46.6 won per kwh, up 9.8 won. Considering the burden of people, we decided to increase the basic fuel cost by 4.9 won/kwh in April 2022 and by 4.9 won in October.\n\n#2 Increase in Power Generation Costs caused by Stricter Environment-related Regulations\n(Explanation and effects) Policies and laws managing the climate change (reduction in greenhouse gas emission and coal-power development according to the Nationally determined Contributions (NDC), Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) are regulated and stricter. In response to this, new renewable energy development facilities and technology investment are required and this may decline the financial soundness in KEPCO and group companies.\n(Easing activities and plans) We are planning to make investment to respond to legal risks including the infrastructure investment for renewable energy power generation. To this end, in January 2021, the company introduced the cost-linked electricity rate system to clarify the link between climate and environmental costs and electricity rate and improve transparency by charging such costs separately. \u2018Climate and environmental costs\u2019 were separated from the existing \u2018electricity rate\u2019 to reflect the costs related to RPS and ETS and the reduction in coal power generation. In December 2021, we announced the climate and environmental costs that will be applied from 2022 by considering the increase of climate and environmental costs in 2021 in accordance with the adoption of a cost-linked electricity rate system.\n\nNon-financial Risk Management\n\nIn the rapidly changing management environment, various types of risks are taking place in economy, society, and environment. KEPCO regulated the \u2018Risk Management Business Guideline\u2019 to effectively manage such risk factors and designated the responsible departments and relevant departments in conflicts, health, terror, disasters, and promotion to establish the risk management system and stipulate the necessary matters that are required for risk management activities. Together with that, \u2018Risk Management Portal\u2019 allows the consistent management activities, and KEPCO published the \u2018Risk Management Manual\u2019 to respond to risks quickly.\n\n| Conflicts | Health | Terror |\n|-----------|--------|--------|\n| Civil complaints related to transmission and conversion equipment | Health related risks for employees such as the outbreak of contagious disease | Human life and power facilities are damaged by facility terrors |\n| Power supply is disabled because of social factors | | |\n\n| Disasters | Climate Change | Public |\n|-----------|----------------|--------|\n| Power supply shortage caused by demand hike | Energy reduction and greenhouse gas emission reduction | The company image is damaged because of the negative cases related to employees occur |\n| Power supply is disabled because of disasters | Response to changing policy like RPS and carbon management | Power industry may be in risk because of the inaccurate report |\n| Power supply is disabled because of the breakdown of power grid | Response to emission trading system of greenhouse gas | |\n| Power supply is disabled because of the cyber attacks | | |\nClimate Change and ESG Risks\n\nClimate Change Risk Identification and Assessment\n\nKEPCO integrated the climate change-related risks into the enterprise risk management system. Through the deliberation process from Business Selection Committee, Risk Deliberation Committee, and Investment Deliberation Committee. Along with that, we make efficient investment decision regarding the climate change-related businesses. When it comes to business that comes with climate change-related activities and large-scale investment, we deliberate the business feasibility through the process before executing investment cost. We comprehensively consider the financial impacts such as stricter environmental regulation, tax reform in energy, emission trading and non-financial impacts such as external reliability, analyzing the risks of relevant businesses caused by climate change.\n\nStep-by-step Committees and Key Risk Management Matters\n\n| National Business (New Businesses in Energy and New Renewable Energy Business) | Overseas Business |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Obstacles in businesses, analysis on expected risks and return rate, possibility of capital finance, implementation plan and required budget, schedule** |  |\n| \u2022 Matters related to basic guidelines and plans | \u2022 Review the business environment and major assumptions |\n| \u2022 Matters related to contract | \u2022 Management strategy for risk analysis and response measures |\n| \u2022 Matters regarding the establishment of the branch(SCP) and contribution | \u2022 Project cost composition and capital finance |\n| \u2022 Matters regarding finance capital | \u2022 Sensitivity analysis by estimating situational cash flow |\n| \u2022 Basic plan for investment risk management | \u2022 Reflection of residual value and restoration costs |\n| \u2022 Review the major assumptions and business environment, analyze the situational sensitivity, risk management | \u2022 Approval of the adequacy test for the existing profit rate |\n\nThe necessity of business promotion, appropriateness of enforcement period, profitability, examination of risks and countermeasures, change points and reasons after the deliberation by the previous steps\n\nFinal approval after the deliberation of business investment\nDirection of Climate Change Risk Response\n\nClimate change risks of KEPCO consists of transition risks and physical risks. Transition risks are risk factors that may change the policy, technology, and market and affect the company image and reputation while responding to climate change and the risks are managed by establishing the response strategies by item. Physical risks are chronic and acute risk factors in power facilities caused by abnormal climate. To respond to this, we analyzed the comprehensive climate change impacts through scenario analysis (RCP 8.5) and came up with the 'Climate Change Adjustment Measure' to reflect it on the management strategy.\n\n| Type          | Explanation                                                                 | Response                                                                 |\n|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Transition Risks | Policy \u2022 Free allocation ratio of emission trading decreased from 97% to 90%, so the purchase cost of emission trading is expected to increase \u2022 Need to respond to additional reduction allocation requirements to achieve the 2050 carbon-neutral plan | \u2022 Power transmission and distribution gas, 64% of greenhouse gas emissions, can be collected and refined and greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced by expanding eco-friendly switch |\n|               | Technology \u2022 Financial burden rises when R&D cost increases because of the technology development to respond to climate changes by reducing greenhouse gas and expanding new renewable energy | \u2022 Group companies carry out collective research regarding SF6 reduction technology, next-generation CO2 decoupling technique \u2022 2.86 trillion won will be invested in 37 techniques in 5 areas by establishing the 2030 mid-to-long-term technology strategy |\n|               | Law \u2022 When lawsuit regarding environment like climate change, negative impacts on financial structure and reputation emerge | \u2022 Identify and evaluate the climate-related legal risks according to the internal deliberation process, and review and establish the response measures |\n|               | Market \u2022 Unit price of power purchase is determined by various factors including fuel costs by power source, exchange rate, price | \u2022 By applying the cost-linked electricity bill system, price fluctuation in imported fuels, such as coal and natural gas, is periodically reflected in the bill |\n|               | Reputation \u2022 When stakeholders\u2019 request regarding climate change is not considered, negative impacts like the cost of capital finance may take place | \u2022 By participating in the CDP, climate change response is disclosed and information disclosure practice is strengthened according to the TCFD recommendation |\n| Physical Risks | Short-term \u2022 Short-term environmental changes caused by abnormal climate change, such as typhoon and flood, lead to power facility breakdown and recovery cost | \u2022 Analyze and evaluate how extreme heat, extreme cold, heavy rain, heavy snow affect power facilities utilizing climate change scenario (RCP 8.52) \u2022 Establish and implement the climate change adjustment measure containing 2035 step-by-step implementation plan |\n|               | Medium and long term \u2022 Long-term environmental change like global warming negatively affects the operation of power facilities and causes extra cost | |\n| Opportunity Factors | Promote the demand resource trade \u2022 Power purchase cost can be reduced by avoiding construction cost utilizing demand resource markets and encouraging system marginal price | \u2022 Expand the operation technique of demand resource, Smart Meter, and distributed resource like ESS and EVC to revitalize the demand resource trade |\n|               | Eco-friendly business \u2022 Eco-friendly business demand will increase according to the decarbonization investment status in the capital market and 2050 carbon-neutral plan | \u2022 Develop the large-scale renewable energy like offshore wind power and diversify the eco-friendly business by expanding the new industry in ICT convergence energy |\n|               | Diversify resource finance \u2022 By financing the capital with the issuance of ESG bond, financial cost can be decreased and the company can be considered as eco-friendly | \u2022 Develop the renewable energy by issuing ESG bonds and increase the eco-friendly investment by expanding the new renewable energy-related facilities |\n\n1) CDM(Clean Development Mechanism) : The reduction portion from the investment to developing countries is credited as the reduction performance of advanced countries\n2) RCP(Representative Concentration Pathways) 8.5 : The scenario supposing that what the future look like when greenhouse gas emission is maintained at the current status\n3) Demand Response : Trade where surplus electricity is sold to electricity markets when price is high or electricity system is in the crisis\nOperation of Audit Committee\n\nAudit Committee Composition\n\nAs KEPCO abides by the Act on the Management of Public Institutions and constitutes and operates the Audit Committee according to the Article 20-2 of the same Act. We regulate the \u2018Audit Committee Operation Guideline\u2019 and operates the committee according to this to secure the transparency and independence. The role and right of the Audit Committee is organized by meeting the requirements of the Audit Committee defined by the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

Certification is approved by adopting the ethical management compliance program(K-CP) and screening them. Through the certification system, KEPCO is taking the lead in 5 topics, including the establishment of K-CP\u2019s environment, corruption risk mapping, prevention and management of corruption risks, monitoring and improvement, sanctions and incentives.\n\nSupport the Ethical Compliance Consultation and Operate the Prior Consulting System\n\nKEPCO is operating the ethical compliance support system in the internal control system to support the employees\u2019 ethical compliance management. An ethics/integrity implementation leader, a code of conduct officer, and an anti-solicitation officer are supporting the ethical consultation and an in-house lawyer and legal advisors are supporting compliance-related consultation. In addition, \u2018Prior Consulting System\u2019 supports the compliance duties and expands the prevention audit function.\n\nExpansion of Anti-corruption Management System Certification (ISO 37001)\n\nKEPCO strives to prevent violation in advance by establishing the anti-corruption monitoring system. While we focused on chronic corruption like bribery, we are managing the new corruptions, such as abuse of power and unfair exercise of authority, to raise the effectiveness. We stay away from collecting information passively or carrying out audit by depending on human resources, we monitor the situation and prevent corruption in advance based on big data-based anti-corruption monitoring system by identifying corruption signs in advance and signaling them.\n\nRevitalize the Reporting Channel and Protect Whistleblowers\n\nKEPCO allows internal and external stakeholders to get consultation or report regarding violation of ethical compliance matters. Reporting channels for corruption (irrationality) consist of e-people, irrationality anonymous reporting system, report system for abuse of power, K-Whistle. The KEPCO website discloses the reception status by reporting channel, detailed information about misconducts, result of disciplinary actions transparently. In addition, the identity and reporting-related information should not be disclosed without approval from whistleblowers according to the Act on Anti-corruption and the Establishment and Operation of the Anti-corruption & Civil Rights Commission and the audit department takes disciplinary actions after identifying the situation when the information is disclosed without approval.\n\nReception by Reporting Channel\n\n| Reporting channel          | Reporting method | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|---------------------------|-----------------|------|------|------|\n| Internal voluntary reporting | Online (Intranet) | 182  | 158  | 277  |\n| Irrationality reporting center | Online (Intranet) | 3    | 60   | 119  |\n| Anonymous reporting system | Online (Intranet) | 60   | 74   | 84   |\n|                           |                 | 119  | 84   | 44   |\n\n(Unit : Case)\nPrevent Interest Conflicts in Carrying out Duties\n\nAct on the Prevention of Conflict of Interest Related to Duties of Public Servants prevents public servants pursuing the private interests related to their duties, banning the interest conflicts that may arise while carrying out duties and ensuring the fair duty performance to secure the reliability from the public. The act consists of 10 detailed conducts and each of them are divided into reporting and submission obligation and restriction and prevention conducts. It was legislated on May 18, 2021 and will be implemented on May 19, 2022. KEPCO established the preemptive response system before implementing it in earnest to make sure that employees raise their awareness toward the act and implement them.\n\nFirst of all, we evaluated the awareness level related to the act to figure out whether they know about important matters and allowed public servants to discover and strengthen the necessary matters for initial establishment. As a result, 46% of employees responded that they understand the act, 32% responded that they understand the 10 detailed conducts, 49% understand the private interests, 34% understand the reporting process. Most of them responded that promotion and training should be strengthened to raise the awareness and establish the system initially.\n\nAccordingly, we raised the awareness by operating customized training program and pledges for stakeholders and support the expansion of the culture of integrity by signing the convention on the prevention of conflict of interest for internal and external stakeholders. For high-ranking servants, the vice-chairman of the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission was invited to give a lecture regarding the act. For employees, we encouraged them to take the course of \u2018Understandable Act on the Prevention of Conflict of Interest Related to Duties of Public Servants\u2019. 99.5% of them completed the course. By implementing the mock training regarding the reporting method and process measures when interest conflicts take place, we allowed 582 employees to participate in the training. By doing so, there has been no violation regarding the interest conflicts as the result of our five times of own violation inspection.\n\n### 10 Detailed Conducts to Prevent Interest Conflicts\n\n| Reporting and submission obligation | Prevent interest conflicts in carrying out duties |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| \u2460 Avoid reporting private stakeholders | \u2465 Prevent recruiting family members |\n| \u2461 Report possession and purchase of real assets related to duties of public institutions | \u2466 Prevent private contract |\n| \u2462 Report the trade with people related to duties | \u2467 Restrict external activities related to duties |\n| \u2463 Report private contacts with retired people | \u2468 Prevent the private use of public institutions |\n| \u2464 Submit work activities of high-ranking officials in private sector | \u2469 Prevent the use of confidentiality in the job |\n\nFirst of all, we evaluated the awareness level related to the act to figure out whether they know about important matters and allowed public servants to discover and strengthen the necessary matters for initial establishment.

Fair trade compliance program means that companies regulate and operate the internal compliance system in training and monitoring to comply with fair trade-related laws. After adopting the program, we have established the management system by designating the general autonomous compliance manager (chief of legal affairs) and a dedicated department (law office) and appointing 24 members of the Autonomous Compliance Conference. In the process, 12 departments related to customers, subcontractors, and contract attended and we held the Autonomous Compliance Conference in April 2021 and implemented the \u2018Pledge for Fair Trade Compliance Implementation\u2019. In addition, our company launched the \u2018Consultative Body for Public Institutions\u2019 Contract Work\u2019 to establish the organic cooperative channel. Currently, the consultative body is being operated for 9 public institutions in Naju innovation city and will be expanded to other institutions going forward. Likewise, KEPCO strives to establish the fair and transparent trade culture.\n\nImplement Fair Trade Training and Internal Monitoring\nKEPCO is carrying out systematic training for effective operation of fair trade compliance program. An in-house lawyer carried out training regarding fair trade, such as unfair behaviors and violations and compliance guideline for 331 contract officials. Also, an outside professional such as Fair Competition Federation was required to take a total of 7 outsourced lectures regarding fair trade-related issues and regulations. In addition to that, we conducted the internal monitoring to inspect the trade system and situation for all operations regarding unfair practices and abuse of power. A total of 89 matters, including unpaid delayed interest, have been taken care of. Our company also conducts monitoring regarding the violation of laws when implementing business or enacting or amending work standards. KEPCO endeavors to realize the fair economy by improving unreasonable factors in the whole trade process.\n\nFair Trade and Anti-corruption of Subcontractors\nKEPCO ensures the rights of subcontractors and helps establish the mutual trade model by raising the transparency of contract process for fair trade with subcontractors. To secure safety of subcontractors, we established the system to give extra points when subcontractors obtain ISO45001 (Safety and Health) when it is eligible and regulated the safety guideline and safety management table for service providers. To operate the fair contract system and promote transparency, we established the estimated price calculation system and computerized a bid, improving the unreasonable factors when writing the estimated price manually. In addition, the retired person in terms of prevention of contacts with retired people is within 2 years from the retirement date, thereby eradicating unfairness.\n\nOperate the Internal Control System\nKEPCO\u2019s internal control system consist of \u2018Autonomous Compliance\u2019 for prior prevention and \u2018Internal Audit\u2019 activities centered around follow-up audit. It consists of detailed content to make sure that internal check is carried out.

KEPCO respects and supports the international standards regarding human rights and labor, including Universal Declaration of Human Rights and UN Guideline Principles on Business and Human Rights : Ruggie Framework, striving to protect stakeholders including employees in the whole management process.\n\nHuman Rights Management Implementation System\n\nHuman Rights Management Announcement\n\nAs the energy leading company, while KEPCO actively implements the human rights management that focuses on respect and values for humans in all business activities, we announced the human rights management announcement to prevent the human rights risks of all stakeholders related to business operation. The announcement highlights the responsibility of human rights respect for customers, employees, partners, and local communities. Also, it promises to comply with human rights-related international standards and compliance, prohibition of discrimination, prohibition of child labor and forced labor, creation of safe working conditions, guarantee of collective bargaining and freedom of association, environment protection and pollution prevention, personal information protection, thereby focusing on customers\u2019 value, human rights of residents, mutual development, and fair treatment for business partners.\n\nImplementation Guideline for Human Rights Management\n\nKEPCO suggests 10 implementation guidelines by area according to the \u2018Human Rights Management Announcement\u2019.

The assurance provider worked in good faith according to the internationally accepted assurance methodology.\n\nReport's Scope\n\nThe assurance provider assured key information included in the report, such as sustainability management policies, systems, activities, performance, and goals of KEPCO and its six group companies. Quantitative information in the report included data from the past three or five years, and qualitative information included activities from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 in the scope of verification. For specific subjects, data and activities until 2022 were included in the scope of verification.\n\nDescription of Methodology\n\nThe assurance provider conducted assurance engagement to Type 1 and Moderate levels of AA1000AS v3, and also checked compliance with the four principles of AA1000AP(2018). In addition, it was assured whether the 'specific subject matter' derived from the materiality test satisfies the disclosure standards of the GRI Standards.\n\n- In order to confirm that KEPCO correctly grasps issues raised by stakeholders, the approach, such as setting the scope and target of stakeholders and stakeholder engagement procedures, was confirmed.\n\n- Reviewed the issue identification and decision process of KEPCO and its six power generation subsidiaries to ensure that KEPCO\u2019s material sustainability management issues are reflected in the report.\n\n- We reviewed KEPCO\u2019s internal documents and records to see if they matched the information contained in the report. We focused on assuring that there were no significant errors, omissions, or misrepresented information.\n\n- Through KEPCO\u2019s on-site inspection, we identified items that require detailed assurance such as performance data and certificates, and conducted internal employee interviews related to the information included in the report.\n\n- Only written assurance was performed for the 'Electronic Disclosure System Disclosure Data' and 'Korea Electric Power Corporation and Electric Power Group Company Website' posted materials, and among the reporting boundaries, information from outside (KEPCO\u2019s partners, contractors, etc.) was excluded from the scope of verification.\n\n| Classification          | Indicators                                                                 |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Universal Standards     | Organizational Profile(102-1~13), Strategy(102-14,15), Ethics and Integrity(102-16, 17), Governance(102-18, 102-22~25, 102-29, 35, 36, 38, 40), Stakeholder Engagement(102-41~45), Reporting Practice(102-46~56), The management approach method(103-1~3) |\n| Economic                | Economic Performance(201-1~2), Industry Economic Effects(203-1,2), Anti-corruption(205-1~3) |\n| Environmental           | Energy(302-1, 4, 5), Biodiversity(304-1~3), Emissions(305-1~5, 7) |\n| Social                  | Employment(401-1, 3), Occupational Health and Safety(403-1~10), Training and Education(404-1, 2), Diversity and Education(405-1, 2), Non-discrimination(406-1), Child Labor(408-1), Forced or Compulsory Assessment(409-1), Human Rights Assessment(412-1, 2), Local Communities(413-1), Supplier Social Assessment(414-1, 2), Customer Health and Safety(416-1), Customer Privacy(418-1) |\nConclusions\nThe assurance provider confirmed that this report reflects the sustainability management policies, systems, activities, achievements, and goals of KEPCO and its group companies at an objective and reliable level. In addition, we were unable to find anything that would cause us to judge that the information contained in the report did not match the data actually being managed or that the assumptions used in the report preparation process were inappropriate. The assurance provider determines that the report complies with the 'Core' Option requirements of the GRI Standards.\n\n- Inclusivity\n  It has been confirmed that KEPCO and its group companies are actively communicating with stakeholders through internal and external communication channels. Key stakeholders redefined as 8 groups, including shareholders, investors, government agencies, and citizens/customers, and various opinions are collected in consideration of the characteristics of each group.\n\n- Materiality\n  It has been confirmed that KEPCO and its group companies are actively communicating with stakeholders through internal and external communication channels. Key stakeholders redefined as 8 groups, including shareholders, investors, government agencies, and citizens/customers, and various opinions are collected in consideration of the characteristics of each group.\n\n- Responsiveness\n  It has been confirmed that KEPCO is reflecting key issues that affect stakeholders in its sustainability management strategy, and that the implementation status of its sustainability management strategy is described in the report. In addition, KEPCO is effectively promoting sustainability management strategies through the ESG Committee and other subcommittees.\n\n- Impact\n  KEPCO and group companies identify the impact of sustainability management on the natural environment, social capital, local community and other stakeholders, set performance indicators (KPIs) to maximize positive impacts and minimize negative impacts, It was confirmed that the results and future plans were presented.\n\nLimitations\nThe assurance provider assured the accuracy of the information presented in the Report, as in the aforementioned assurance scope. Errors, omissions, or false descriptions caused by the creation, processing, conversion, etc. of the information described in the report were not assured. In addition, KEPCO\u2019s financial statements, \u2018Electronic disclosure system disclosure data\u2019, \u2018Korea Electric Power Corporation and Group companies homepages\u2019 posted materials were only referenced during assurance, and the data themselves are not included in the scope of assurance.\n\nRecommendations\nThe assurance provider highly appreciates the attempt to publish an 'Integrated report' that summarizes the sustainability management performance of KEPCO and electric power group companies. Publication of an integrated report is a groundbreaking change that can identify sustainability factors in the power industry at the same time by raising stakeholder awareness of the power industry value chain and delivering value-creating activities by business unit, such as power generation, transmission and distribution, and transformation. In the future, it is recommended to expand the scope of information disclosure step by step by specifying and internalizing data management indicators and standards that can indicate the integration performance of KEPCO and group companies. In addition, strategic tasks for sustainability management need to be presented as performance compared to plans in the annual integrated report so that stakeholders can continuously observe and pay attention to them.\n\nIndependence and Competency\nThe assurance provider employs appropriately qualified assurance auditors and all assurance results are reviewed responsibly internally to ensure compliance and transparency of the approach applied. The assurance provider does not have any interests that may hinder independence and fairness by engaging only this assurance audit with KEPCO.\nHistory of Sustainability Report Publication 2005-2022\n\n2005 2006 2007 2008 2009\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\n\n2020 2021\n\n2021-2022\nKEPCO Sustainability Report Publication (2022.11)\nContact Information\n\nThis report can be viewed and downloaded on the KEPCO website.
