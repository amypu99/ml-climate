Here at KEPCO, we have thoroughly analyzed the confusion brought about by and the impact of COVID-19, and have established an emergency response system aimed at implementing systematic measures that seek to minimize the impact COVID-19 has on business. In addition, we will ultimately create higher corporate value and lay the foundation for sustainable growth by protecting the safety of our employees, customers, partners, and local communities and overcoming these crises together in a cleaner and more sustainable way in the process of recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nEstablishment of Company-wide Risk Response Management System\n\nAfter the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic, we established an emergency response headquarters and a company-wide crisis management system based on Business Continuity Management (BCM) and ISO 22301*. Our headquarters control tower is organized into 5 teams and 15 units capable of operating a situation room 365 days a year. Moreover, separate business continuity plans (BCP) have been established for each regional base office such that we are always ready to respond in the event of an emergency. Furthermore, we are doing our best to ensure an uninterrupted power supply by establishing special measures for public services.\n\nEnhancement of Workplace Safety and Health Management\n\nWe are currently implementing various measures aimed at blocking COVID-19 from entering our domestic and overseas business sites and managing the health and safety of our employees. In addition to making it compulsory that all employees wear masks, we discourage business trips and implement a rotational system of working from home while limiting access to our offices by external personnel. In addition, we installed thermal imaging cameras to monitor the movement of internal and external visitors. We also support customized quarantine services for each of our workplaces in order to minimize the possibility of employees being infected with COVID-19, and we are working hard to provide safer working conditions for vulnerable workers such as pregnant women. Moreover, we are making concerted efforts to establish a remote work environment capable of increasing work productivity.\n\nStructure of the COVID-19 Emergency Response Headquarters\n\n| Crisis Response Headquarters | Relevant Organizations |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------|\n| \u2022 Head of the Headquarters : Chief Business Management Officer | \u2022 Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy |\n| \u2022 Members : Heads of relevant departments and offices | \u2022 Ministry of Health and Welfare |\n| \u2022 Secretary : EHS Team | \u2022 Center for Disease Control, etc. |\n\n| General Supervision Team | Office Operation Team | PR Team |\n|--------------------------|----------------------|---------|\n| \u2022 Safety & Health Dept. | \u2022 Sales & Marketing Dept. | \u2022 Corporate Communications Dept. |\n| \u2022 Management Support Dept. | \u2022 Distribution Operations Dept. | |\n| \u2022 ICT Operations Dept. | \u2022 Transmission & Substation Operations Dept. | |\n\n| HR Management Team | Materials & Procurement Team |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------|\n| \u2022 Human Resources Dept. | \u2022 Procurement Dept. |\n\nCustomized Quarantine Support for Each Workplace\n\n**Domestic**\n- Emergency budget support for disinfection of all office buildings (KRW 380 million per month)\n- Provision of masks for all those dealing with customer interaction\n- Delivery of masks to Daegu and Gyeongsangbuk-do through the company-wide mask collection campaign (6,000 masks)\n\n**Overseas**\n- 11 total inspections conducted for all UAE construction site workers including suppliers (about 6,500 people)\n- KF94 mask support for overseas workers (34,000 masks)\n- Increase in insurance limit for overseas workers and support for the early return of family members living in China\n\n**Support for Vulnerable Workers**\n- Provided special leave for pregnant women so as to alleviate concerns regarding infection\n- Implementation of working-from-home priority for vulnerable workers (pregnant women, patients with underlying medical conditions, etc.)\n\n**Improvement of Remote Work Environment**\n- Implementation of the largest scale of working-from-home among public institutions (average of 3,200 people per day during level 2.5 of social distancing)\n- Development of a working-from-home management system and conversion to a real time interactive video lecture system for the KEPCO Academy lectures\n- Establishment of a smart work environment based on laptops and the cloud platform\n\n*ISO22301: An international certification that evaluates the ability of a company to minimize damage and normalize core business within the shortest time possible in the event of business disruption due to a disaster or catastrophe.*\nStakeholder Support Activities\n\nCustomers\nKEPCO is alleviating the burden of electricity bills for small business owners and vulnerable groups across the country who are suffering from the effects of the COVID-19 crisis. Between April 2020 and December 2021, we are implementing a measure to extend payment deadlines by intervals of three months. In addition, we provided support worth KRW 72.7 billion through a 50% reduction in electricity rates from April 2020 to September 2020 for a total of 151,000 small businesses in the regions designated as special disaster zones, such as Daegu, Gyeongsan, Cheongdo, and Bonghwa. Further, to ease the pressure on small business owners who are complying with government regulations on gatherings and business operations, we have partially reduced their electricity bills for April-June (reduction for ban on gatherings: 50%, reduction for business restrictions: 30%).\n\nPartner Companies\nHere at KEPCO, we are providing a range of contractual benefits to suppliers that are experiencing operational difficulties due to COVID-19. We have implemented measures aimed at exempting suppliers from having to pay compensation for delays and temporarily extending contract periods in order to support suppliers facing unavoidable difficulties in terms of meeting the demands of their delivery schedules due to disruptions in the supply and demand of raw subsidiary materials. In addition, we contribute to the prompt payment of contracted fees and secure stable contract volumes for our suppliers by shortening payment periods, reducing contract deposits by 50%, and expanding stock. Moreover, we are helping to secure financial liquidity by implementing a temporary contract exception aimed at increasing prepayment limits from 70% to 80%.\n\nLocal Communities\nWith a view to ensuring the safe distribution and inoculation of COVID-19 vaccines, we offer support in terms of securing uninterrupted electricity for about 260 vaccination centers and vaccine logistics centers nationwide. Moreover, we converted some wards at Hanil Hospital, the KEPCO Medical Foundation, into hospitals dedicated to treating COVID-19 in order to support inpatient treatment for infected patients, and provided the KEPCO Academy as a living treatment center, thereby contributing to resolving the problem of bed shortages in the Seoul metropolitan area. In addition, our employees working in offices across the country are voluntarily participating in various social contribution activities aimed at supporting vulnerable groups who are experiencing difficulties due to COVID-19. These activities include the donation of KRW 3.2 billion by KEPCO Group companies, launching the \u2018Good Mask Sharing Campaign\u2019 that provided 100,000 masks to vulnerable and marginalized people, participating in the \u2018Love Sharing Blood Donation Campaign\u2019 in order to alleviate the shortage of blood due to the prolonged pandemic, and purchasing agricultural products from farms that are financially suffering during the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nInternational Communities\nRecognizing that COVID-19 is a global crisis, we replaced existing overseas CSR activities, such as volunteer activities, with support for quarantine and screening products in an effort to participate in overcoming the COVID-19 crisis. In addition, we provided KRW 1.56 billion in funds and relief supplies in consideration of the rapid spread of COVID-19 in countries where our overseas offices and branches are located, such as Jordan, Mexico, and the Philippines.\n2\n\nSUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT\n1.

In order to preemptively respond to the climate crisis and fulfill our responsibilities and obligations as a corporate citizen, we practice a system of sustainable management that takes into consideration economic performance as well as ESG performance throughout our business activities.\n\n**ESG Assessment**\n- Incorporated into the Dow Jones Sustainability Asia/Pacific Index for 7 consecutive years\n- Awarded Grade A in Korea Corporate Governance Service (KCGS) ESG assessment\n\n**DJSI Asia-Pacific**\n- Awarded Grade A for integrated ESG\n\n**CDP Sector Honors**\n- Reduced greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1&2) in 2020 compared to the previous year\n- Selected for Energy & Utility Sector Honors for 5 consecutive years by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)\n\n**Declared the suspension of overseas coal-fired power projects**\n(October, 2020)\n\n**USD 1.3 billion**\n- Issued global green bonds worth USD 1.3 billion for 3 consecutive years\n  (USD 500 million in 2019, USD 500 million in 2020, USD 300 million in 2021)\n\n**61,465 tCO\u2082eq**\n\n**1st Family-friendly company**\n- Ranked No. 1 among Public Corporation Group I for 3 consecutive years in a survey regarding the contribution to social value\n- Maintained Family-friendly company certification for 10 consecutive years since first acquisition in 2011\nGoing forward, we will strive to firmly establish ourselves as the company that is most trusted by stakeholders through sincere sustainability management activities, in addition to continuing to pursue greater change, challenges, and growth. Leveraging our capabilities across all of our business areas, we will do our utmost to enhance environmental and social value.\n\n**Sustainability Management Highlights**\n\n(As of December 31, 2020)\n\n- **Won ESG Management Grand Prize Award**\n  - Exclusively awarded in the public enterprise category at the ESG Management Awards hosted by JoongAng Ilbo (June, 2021)\n\n- **Transmission & Distribution Loss Ratio**: 3.54%\n\n- **Net Income**: KRW 1.95 trillion\n\n- **Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure**: 9,769 units\n\n- **Credit Rating**: Aa2 (Moody\u2019s), AA (S&P)\n\n- **Board Attendance Rate**: 98.6%\n\n- **Dividends**: KRW 780.6 billion (Dividend payout ratio 40%)\n\n- **Best institution for ethical management**\n  - Citation from the Chairman of the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission (April, 2021)\n\n- **ESG Committee**\n  - Established the ESG committee under the Board of Directors, a first for a public company in Korea (December, 2020)\n\n- **Job creation in the private sector**: 40,191 persons\n\n- **Employee volunteer hours**: 93,155 hours\nSustainability Management Strategy\n\nESG Trends in the Power Industry\n\nThe international crisis triggered by COVID-19 is reawakening the importance of ESG in financial markets and industries. ESG trends across the economy, including management, consumption, and investment, have become a daily routine. KEPCO identifies ESG trends in advance, manages them systematically, and establishes ESG management strategies thereupon. In particular, Korea\u2019s electric power industry is in a significant transition due to the implementation of the carbon neutrality declaration in 2050 and the energy transition policy to respond to the climate crisis. We are facing the demands of various stakeholders for fulfilling environmental and social responsibilities from the perspective of continuous growth of the company and enhancing shareholder value. We aim to meet external expectations by stably settling key ESG issues in the electric power industry through a company-wide responsible response by grasping the challenges and new opportunities in the turning point.\n\nThe environment of the electric power industry at home and abroad is changing rapidly as the reorganization of the new social and economic order surrounding the electric power industry is accelerating, including the reduction of greenhouse gases to respond to the climate crisis, the transition to eco-friendly energy and the expansion of new energy businesses triggered by the 4th industrial revolution, etc. In line with these considerable changes in the energy environment, carbon neutrality and energy conversion are major issues in the electric power industry. With that, Korea is aiming for carbon neutrality by 2050 in pace with the global trend. Accordingly, it is inevitable to change the overall power supply system to make energy consumption efficient, promote the electrification of energy supply, and cover the supply power with GHG-free power to implement carbon neutrality in the energy sector. KEPCO will contribute to achieving carbon neutrality throughout the industrial ecosystem by securing its leadership in the new energy business ecosystem and accelerating the development of technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while expanding renewable energy supply and energy efficiency improvement projects.\n\nAs of the end of 2020, the global ESG investment amounted to $35.3 trillion, an increase of about 15% compared to the previous year, despite economic activity contraction due to the spread of COVID-19. In Korea, the National Pension Service has introduced a negative screening strategy for coal-related companies, thereby increasing the proportion of ESG investment centered on public pension funds and institutional investors and enhancing the ESG evaluation of investment target companies. As such, ESG integration in investment, socially responsible investment, is being strengthened internationally. ESG investors are demanding sincere non-financial risk management and supervision and increased credible disclosure of information. As a listed company on the Korea Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange, KEPCO promotes ESG management based on communication with investors, such as declaring the suspension of overseas coal-fired power projects and establishing an ESG committee. We will continue to strengthen communication with investors to improve their understanding of our ESG management activities.\n\nNational legislation to regulate ESG performance management is being institutionalized and enacted in countries. Among them, the regulation on the disclosure of non-financial information centered on ESG is progressing the fastest. In major European countries such as the UK, France, and Germany, ESG information disclosure is mandatory for companies with business sites of a certain size. In Korea as well, the mandatory disclosure system for corporate governance reports was implemented for large-scale listed companies with total assets of KRW 2 trillion or more in 2019, in line with the trend of ESG disclosure enhancement. In addition, the Financial Services Commission announced a step-by-step compulsory ESG information disclosure plan that will expand the publication of corporate governance reports and sustainability reports to all KOSPI listed companies from 2026 and 2030, respectively. Preemptively responding to the mandatory information disclosure, KEPCO is disclosing ESG information transparent and detailed through the Sustainability Report (first published in 2005) and Corporate Governance Report (first published in 2017).\nSustainability Management Strategy System\n\nIn 2020, here at KEPCO, we established a system of ESG-based sustainability management. In order to achieve this we created a sustainability strategy system by synthesizing improvement activities for each ESG field. Since then, we have continued to strive to conduct ESG-related tasks and transparently disclose major activities and results to stakeholders through our annual sustainability report. Going forward, we will continue to revise and supplement sustainability management strategies by reflecting ESG trends in the electric power industry as we conduct business and explore more effective methods for communication with stakeholders. We will also strive to contribute to the sustainable development of society by pursuing inclusive growth with a balance of environmental, social, and economic values under our vision of becoming \u2018a company that opens a warm energy world by creating future value through clean energy\u2019.\n\nVision\n\nAchieving a global top-level of sustainability management by expanding cooperation and communication with stakeholders\n\nGoal\n\nOpening a warm energy world by creating future value through clean energy\n\nSocial Value\n\nEnvironmental\n\nEstablish a foundation for the expansion of eco-friendly energy\n\nBuild systems to actively respond to the climate crisis\n\nPromote energy improvement and practice eco-friendly management\n\nSocial\n\nContribute to the development of local communities and participating in efforts to resolve social issues\n\nCreate an environment for win-win development & shared growth with SMEs\n\nImprove disaster and safety controls and information security systems\n\nInnovate our way of working and establishing a corporate culture of trust and creativity\n\nEconomic Value\n\nEnvironmental Value\n\nGovernance\n\nStrengthen ESG management carried out by the Board of Directors\n\nConduct ethical management and strength anti-corruption systems\n\nEstablish cooperative relationship based on fair trade\n\nCore Tasks\n\n- Expand renewable energy supply and improve system capacity\n- Develop key technologies for timely response to carbon neutrality\n- Reorganize overseas business portfolio focused on low carbon and eco-friendliness\n- Expand new businesses in energy, such as EVC, K-BEMS, etc.\n- Implement energy efficiency improvement projects\n- Expand community participation and create value based on win-win development\n- Support the market development of SMEs and enhance cooperative R&D\n- Establish a system for promoting sustainable social contribution activities\n- Improve safety, health, and security management capabilities\n- Develop human resources and improve corporate culture\n- Establish an ESG management and oversight system involving the Board of Directors and management\n- Substantiate the company-wide ethical compliance management system\n- Disseminate a culture of integrity and ethics both internally and externally, and improve the anti-corruption system\n- Correct unfair practices in all work processes\n- Establish fair transaction orders with partner companies\nActivities and Performance Related to UN SDGs\n\nHere at KEPCO, we strive to establish a strategic response system for ESG management within the broad framework of sustainable management. We manage our mid- to long-term goals and performance by linking the ten strategic directions of our ESG strategy system with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We expect to ultimately contribute to the sustainable development of the international community by achieving our own targets which are linked to the UN SDGs.\n\n| Strategy Directions | UN SDGs |

profit and enhancing shareholder value, recently, as investors\u2019 interest in non-financial value has increased, the role of fulfilling corporate social responsibilities and overcoming the climate crisis have become increasingly important goals. Accordingly, via a resolution from the Board of Directors in December 2020, we became the first public company to establish an ESG Committee, which operates under the Board of Directors. We established the ESG Committee in order to strengthen our ESG-based management system and create sustainable ESG results. The ESG Committee deliberates on major ESG-related management issues, provides advice on ESG management strategies and business plans, checks the overall direction of sustainable management, and manages and supervises results and issues. In particular, the committee is composed entirely of outside directors in order to ensure that issues are independently and objectively deliberated on. Currently, Si-Heon Seong, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, sits on the committee as the chairperson, and three outside directors with expertise in various fields participate in the committee.\n\nLaunch of ESG Advisory Committee\n\nIn addition to establishing the ESG Committee, we launched the ESG Advisory Committee in September 2021 with a view to collecting opinions from all walks of life based on solidarity and cooperation with stakeholders. In line with the rapidly changing business environment, the Advisory Committee comprises five external experts from various backgrounds, including academia, law, civic groups, and related institutions, each of whom have demonstrated expertise in ESG-related fields. The committee plays the role of providing comprehensive advice on overall ESG management. In particular, we expect that the Advisory Committee will significantly contribute to improving our approach to ESG management by effectively communicating, to the outside world, our business activities from an ESG perspective and by providing advice on the direction of ESG value creation. In addition, the Advisory Committee plans to respond more strategically to increasingly complex and diverse ESG issues by closely cooperating with the ESG Committee.\n\nComposition of the ESG Advisory Committee\n\n| Composition of the ESG Advisory Committee |\n|------------------------------------------|\n| YoungSook Park (Female) Social            |\n| Current CEO of FleishmanHillard Korea    |\n| Adjunct Professor, Department of Public Relations, Yonsei University |\n| MinHo Lee (Male) Environmental            |\n| Current Director of Yulchon ESG Research Center |\n| Former Director of the Environmental Policy Department at the Ministry of Environment |\n| KwangSup Jin (Male) Governance             |\n| Professor in the Department of Public Administration at Honam University |\n| Former President of the Korea Governance Society |\n| WooSam Jin (Male) Environmental            |\n| Current Chairman of RE100 Korea Branch    |\n| Former President of the Korean Society for Renewable Energy |\n| KyungDoo Cho (Male) Environmental          |\n| Current Director of the Incheon Climate and Environment Research Center |\n| Former Research Director at the Korea Environmental Disorders Research Association |\n\nComposition of the ESG Committee\n\n| Composition of the ESG Committee |\n|----------------------------------|\n| Si-Heon Seong (Male) Industry/Technology |\n| Current Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chairman of the ESG Committee |\n| Former Head of the Korea Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology |\n| Su-Ran Bang (Female) Law           |\n| Current Senior Legal Advisor at Seoul Energy Corporation |\n| Attorney-at-law/Partner at S Law Firm |\n| Cheol-Ho Hwang (Male) Environmental/Climate |\n| Current Director of the Carbon Neutral Cities Research Support Group, International Climate and Environment Center |\n| Private member of the Green Growth Committee |\n\nPerformance of the ESG Committee\n\n| Classification | Agenda Item | Result |\n|----------------|-------------|--------|\n| 1st in 2021 (January 15, 2021) | [Resolution] 1.

The \u2018ESG Operation T/F\u2019 consists of four divisions: Environmental, Social, Governance, and External Cooperation. The Chief Financial & Strategic Planning Officer serves as the T/F Team Leader, and is in charge of our company-wide ESG response, including the establishment of our ESG management strategy, operation of the ESG Committee, and our response to ESG evaluations. In addition, we are making various efforts to encourage our employees to voluntarily participate in activities related to ESG management by increasing the overall awareness and understanding of ESG. In order to encourage our employees to take action, we periodically select the latest issues in each ESG field, such as environmental protection, social contribution, and ethical compliance, introduce relevant and necessary information, and provide news cards and newsletters to all of our employees. Moreover, we have strengthened our efforts to foster and internalize a culture of ESG management by inviting external experts to conduct ESG seminars. Finally, our employees contribute to addressing environmental and social issues, such as campaigns to reduce the use of plastic and single-use products and support the underprivileged through voluntary fundraising.\n\nKEPCO ESG Governance\n\n1) ESG Committee: Deliberation on major ESG-related management issues, checking on the direction of sustainable management, and supervision of performance/problems\n2) ESG Operation T/F: Execution of practical functions, such as discovering ESG initiatives, and reviewing and implementing ESG Committee recommendations\n3) ESG Advisory Committee: Providing comprehensive advice on our overall approach to ESG, conducting ESG specialized training (composed of external ESG experts)\nIssuance of ESG Bonds\n\nAs ESG management is increasingly being emphasized as part of essential business activities for the sustainable growth of a company, ESG bonds are gaining attention as a means of financing ESG-related projects for progress toward achieving carbon neutrality in an effort to respond to the climate crisis and support local communities in overcoming the COVID-19 crisis, etc. ESG bonds are special-purpose bonds for which the purpose of using the raised funds is limited to eco-friendly projects and investments aimed at addressing social issues. The bonds are classified into three types: green bonds, social bonds, and sustainability bonds.\n\nIssuance of Green Bonds and Sustainability Bonds\n\nKEPCO successfully issued its global green bonds for three consecutive years\\(^1\\) for the first time in Korea in September 2021 and additionally laid a financial foundation to enhance its carbon-neutral execution capabilities since its first issuance in 2019. In particular, many high-quality investors worldwide, including central banks of major countries, participated in this bond issuance, reaffirming the investors\u2019 high interest in KEPCO\u2019s ESG management and carbon neutrality beyond simple financing. KEPCO plans to invest the funds raised through green bonds issued in new and renewable projects at home and abroad, new and renewable system connections, and expansion of eco-friendly transportation vehicles. KEPCO acquired certification from Sustainalytics, a global ESG certification body with high public confidence in the source of funds, that confirms KEPCO meets EU taxonomy\\(^2\\), the strictest among green bond standards. In addition, following the global green bond issuance, KEPCO issued KRW 400 billion of sustainable bonds in November 2021 in Korea, successfully issuing domestic ESG bonds for three consecutive years\\(^3\\). As such, KEPCO not only takes the lead in realizing social values through successive issuance of ESG bonds such as green bonds and sustainability bonds but also practices ESG management that balances social value (fulfillment of environmental and social responsibility) and economic value (reduction of financial costs) by reducing financial costs through low-interest procurement.\n\n1) $500 million in 2019, $500 million in 2020, $300 million in 2021  \n2) EU Taxonomy: European Union\u2019s Green Industry Classification System  \n3) KRW 200 billion in 2019, KRW 200 billion in 2020, KRW 400 billion in 2021\n\nOverview of Issuing ESG Bonds from 2019 to 2021\n\n| Issuance date | Issuance scale | Due date (Maturity) | Issuance rate | Credit rating |\n|---------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| **Green Bonds** | | | | |\n| June 24, 2019 | USD 500,000,000 | June 24, 2024 (5 years) | 2.500% | Aa2 (Moody\u2019s) AA (S&P), AA- (Fitch) |\n| June 15, 2020 | USD 500,000,000 | June 15, 2025 (5 years) | 1.125% | |\n| September 24, 2021 | USD 300,000,000 | September 24, 2026 (5 years) | 1.125% | |\n| **Sustainability Bonds** | | | | |\n| October 24, 2019 | KRW 100 billion for 3 years / KRW 40 billion for 5 years / KRW 60 billion for 30 years | October 24, 2022 (3 years) / October 24, 2024 (5 years) / October 24, 2049 (30 years) | 1.482% (3 years), 1.646% (5 years), 1.583% (30 years) | AAA (NICE Investors Service, Korea Investors Service, Korea Ratings) |\n| November 4, 2020 | KRW 30 billion for 2 years / KRW 100 billion for 5 years / KRW 70 billion for 5 years | November 4, 2022 (2 years) / November 4, 2023 (3 years) / November 4, 2025 (5 years) | 1.019% (2 years), 1.137% (3 years), 1.432% (5 years) | |\n\n* As the issuance of KRW-denominated sustainability bonds is expected in 2021, details such as the interest rate (as of the date of publication of this report) are unconfirmed.\n**Usage History of the ESG Bonds Procurement Fund**\n\n### Scale of issuance of green bonds\n\n- **$1 billion in total**\n  - **$500 million** in 2019\n  - **$500 million** in 2020\n\n| Total amount spent | USD 985 million | 98.5% |\n|--------------------|-----------------|-------|\n| Balance            | USD 15 million  | 1.5%  |\n\n### Distribution and usage history by type of business (Unit: USD million)\n\n- **Domestic and overseas solar power projects**: 106.3\n- **Domestic and overseas wind power projects**: 131.9\n- **Eco-friendly R&D**: 81.3\n- **Expansion of new & renewable energy linkage facilities**: 500.0\n- **Purchase of electric vehicles and expansion of charging infrastructure**: 165.2\n\n### Scale of issuance of sustainability bonds\n\n- **KRW 200 billion** in 2019\n\n| Total amount spent | KRW 200 billion | 100% |\n|--------------------|-----------------|------|\n\n### Distribution and usage history by type of business (Unit: KRW billion)\n\n- **Electricity bill support for beneficiaries of basic livelihood security**: 50\n- **Electricity bill support for social welfare facilities**: 50\n- **Job creation**: 25\n- **Support for SMEs**: 25\n- **Energy efficiency improvements projects**: 50\n\n### Ratio of Green Bond Fund Usage\n\n- **Investment in renewable energy**: 24.1%\n- **Eco-friendly transportation**: 16.8%\n- **Expansion of new & renewable energy linkage facilities**: 50.8%\n\n### Ratio of Sustainability Bond Fund Usage\n\n- **Job creation and support for SMEs**: 25%\n- **Electricity bill support for socially vulnerable groups**: 50%\n\n*Details concerning the distribution and usage of green bonds (2021) and the KRW-denominated sustainable bond procurement fund (2020 and 2021) will be disclosed via the official KEPCO website at a later date.*\nMateriality Assessment\n\nMateriality Assessment Process\n\nKEPCO conducts a materiality assessment in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) principles, which serve as a guideline in terms of global sustainability reporting, and we report on topics identified as material issues.

Preemptive Risk Management\nHere at KEPCO, we contribute to the development of the national economy by supplying stable and high-quality power at the highest standard. In response to the issues we face in the Industry 4.0 era, we are currently taking measures that seek to innovate our services through the establishment of next-generation power systems aimed at improving customer value and achieving optimization and higher efficiency in terms of power grid construction and operations. As various sectors continue to merge, it is clear that the digitalization of the power industry is a necessity. Accordingly, we are promoting digital transformation across our business areas, infrastructure, services, and processes by combining digital technology and culture. Furthermore, in order to ensure stable leadership in the energy ecosystem and create sustainable engines for future growth, we are focusing on developing our low-carbon and eco-friendly overseas businesses and expanding our new high-tech convergence energy businesses.\n\n### 2020 Key Performance\n\n**Transmission & Distribution Loss Ratio**\n\n* World\u2019s highest level\n\n3.54%\n\n**Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure**\n\nBuilt 9,769 chargers\n\n### Management Approach\n\n- Electrical Infrastructure and Service Innovation\n- Leading Digital Transformation in the Electric Power Industry\n- Promotion of Low Carbon & Eco-Friendly Overseas Projects\n- Expansion of New Energy Business\nAchieving a Stable, High-Quality Power Supply\n\nIt is our primary responsibility to supply stable, high-quality electricity to our customers. We strive to expand transmission and substation facilities in a timely manner and systematically operate our power distribution facilities based on new technologies, in addition to building next-generation power infrastructure such that all customers can enjoy the benefits of a stable power supply. Moreover, we make concerted efforts aimed at improving the reliability of our power system by digitalizing our monitoring and control operations in order to preemptively predict facility failures.\n\nAs a result of these efforts, we recorded only 8.90 minutes of power outage time per household in 2020, which equates to the world\u2019s highest level of power system reliability. We have also been able to fundamentally prevent equipment failure by precisely diagnosing transmission and distribution lines using advanced digital equipment such as drones, and minimized recovery time following power failure by utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) technology. In addition, through efforts aimed at reducing power loss, such as the optimal operation of power facilities and the use of low-loss equipment, we were able to record our best ever transmission/distribution loss rate of 3.54% in 2020. We were able to achieve this record by minimizing loss in the process of transporting generated electricity and thereby maximizing the efficiency of power supply.\n\nAs a result, we have been ranked within the top three in the world in the category of electricity supply in the business environment evaluation hosted by the World Bank for eight consecutive years. Going forward, we will continue to do our utmost to strengthen our competitiveness in order to ensure that all citizens can safely use high-quality electricity.\n\nUninterrupted Electric Power Supply for Important National Events\n\nHere at KEPCO, we strive to ensure that important national events, such as major elections and other large-scale events, can go ahead without any setbacks. We continue to do our best to provide support for various events by supplying stable power by means of preventive maintenance and multi-power configuration of supply lines at event sites and by establishing a system capable of supporting rapid recovery in case of an emergency. Accordingly, through these efforts, we were able to achieve power supply with zero defects for major events such as the 21st National Assembly election and the 2021 College Scholastic Ability Test.\n\nSecuring Stable Electricity Supply and Demand in Winter and Summer\n\nWe seek to stabilize electricity supply and demand by systematically managing demand and establishing a prompt emergency supply and demand response system. Every summer and winter, when electricity demand is at its highest, we conduct emergency training on power supply and demand in order to enable a stable supply and demand to be maintained and check step-by-step measures in case of emergencies even in situations where reserve power is rapidly reduced, such as in the case of a generator failure.\n\nIn addition, we prevent equipment breakdowns and thoroughly prepare for unexpected incidents and accidents via pre-inspection and the replacement of power facilities in areas where power use is expected to rapidly increase, relief of the power system overload, and inspection of power failure prevention diagnosis and recovery support systems, etc. In particular, in order to provide stable power to organizations responding to the COVID-19 health crisis, such as the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, specially designated covid-safe hospitals, and screening clinics, we preemptively conducted a special inspection of power supply equipment and diagnosed and reinforced internal electrical facilities. In addition, we continuously implement strengthened facility management measures aimed at ensuring that the relevant organizations face no disruptions in their response to COVID-19, such as operating a regular patrol to support rapid recovery in case of emergency.\nFacility Construction and Management Paradigm Innovation\n\nConstruction of Strategic Facilities Centered on People and the Environment\n\nHere at KEPCO, we recognize that the construction of electric power facilities is a critical issue which affects the living environment of citizens. Accordingly, we strive to promote smooth construction projects and simultaneously pursue regional development and the improvement of the welfare of citizens by minimizing conflict factors via the establishment of a full-cycle conflict management system during the process for selecting sites for power facilities and via the operation of a win-win committee in partnership with local residents. In order to minimize environmental damage during the construction of electric power facilities, we also prepare measures aimed at reducing environmental impact through a pre-construction environmental impact assessment, and conduct a post-environmental impact assessment at the construction or restoration stage. In addition, we promote a method of construction that works in harmony with the environment without harming the surrounding landscape by developing landscape-enhancing power transmission facilities and eco-friendly supporting structures.\n\nWe are also aiming for a transition to eco-friendly facilities by collaborating with residents on efforts to build new-concept power facilities. These efforts include our projects titled \u201csubstations open to residents,\u201d which include welfare facilities, and \u201charmonious urban substations\u201d, which take aesthetics into consideration. These projects are aimed at achieving win-win growth with residents, rather than simply constructing substations for the sole purpose of supplying electricity. In addition, when constructing transmission lines, we select areas close to living environments, such as villages and schools, as priority targets for undergrounding in order to create safe and pleasant streets in downtown areas. Furthermore, we have identified facilities deemed to be weak in terms of safety and are conducting our own underground line project aimed at strengthening safety in preparation for disasters. Going forward, we plan to continue developing advanced underground facility models that minimize ground equipment in order to build power facilities capable of peacefully coexisting with residents.\n\nFacility Management Technology Innovation\n\nAt KEPCO, we implement optimal facility management using convergence technology in response to the complexity and diversification of power facilities. By installing IoT diagnostic sensors in power facilities to collect data in real time and to automatically determine facility conditions, we have established a transmission and substation prevention diagnostic system to actively utilize new digital technologies for power facility maintenance. In addition, in consideration of the fact that periodic inspection is difficult on account of most domestic transmission lines being located in mountainous areas, we succeeded in developing a \u201cdrone road\u201d that spans about 16,000km across the country by utilizing precise 3D map information and facility information, such as power transmission towers and high-voltage cables, and we plan to actively utilize it for regular inspections.\n\nWe are also building and will operate a system capable of monitoring underground distribution lines in real-time. This system works by installing IoT diagnostic sensors at planned excavation sites, such as housing development districts, in order to provide a notification transmission function when excavation is determined. Through this, we are able to prevent damage to underground cables and reduce line inspection costs. In addition, we inspect and manage underground power facilities that are difficult to detect with the naked eye by utilizing a system that leverages augmented reality (AR) technology to display and intuitively visualize 3D underground line information. Accordingly, we can increase the convenience of facility maintenance by visualizing and displaying sites with the underground lines going through them on actual road images. We are thus able to prevent accidental breakdowns and respond promptly in the case of disasters.\n\nStatus of Underground Transmission and Distribution Rates\n\n(Unit: %)\n\n| Year | Transmission line | Distribution line |\n|------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| 2018 | 12.0              | 18.3              |\n| 2019 | 12.5              | 18.8              |\n| 2020 | 12.9              | 20.3              |\n\n[Using drones to inspect transmission lines]\n\n[Using AR to visualize underground lines]\nElectricity Rate System Reform\n\nIntroduction of Cost-Linked Electricity Rate System\n\nIn January 2021, we began applying a cost-linked electricity rate system with a view to switching to a more transparent and predictable rate system. The most distinctive feature of the cost-linked electricity rate system is that the \u201cfuel cost adjustment fee\u201d item is newly added, and changes in the price of imported fuels such as coal and natural gas are periodically reflected in the rate so as to alleviate the burden caused by temporary adjustments. The system also improves upon the predictability of electricity rates and induces reasonable electricity consumption by providing consumers with information on rate changes in advance. To this end, we reflected in the fuel cost adjustment fee by calculating the change of performance fuel cost (average fuel cost for the preceding three months) compared to the base point of each quarter (immediately previous year).\n\nIn addition, we separated the \u201cclimate environment fee\u201d, which had previously been included in the electricity rate, and started providing it as a separate item, thereby making it clear how much that individual fee is. By classifying and levying climate and environmental costs incurred for clean and safe energy use, we have raised the awareness of consumers in terms of climate and environmental costs through clear disclosure of relevant information and encouraged voluntary participation in the expansion of eco-friendly energy. Going forward, we intend to respond to the public demand for clean and safe energy distribution and enhance the sustainability of the electric power industry by reorganizing it into a reasonable electricity rate system.\n\nImprovement of the Electricity Rate System for Housing\n\nIn response to criticism that our guaranteed charge deduction system, which provides discounts for residents using less than 200kWh of electricity per month, benefited single or two-person middle-class households more than it benefited low-income families, we improved the system such that it effectively meets its aim of \u201cprotecting vulnerable people\u201d. Accordingly, while gradually reducing or abolishing discount benefits for general households from July 2021, we have continued to provide discounts to vulnerable people who receive welfare discounts on electricity bills, and expanded the system in order to identify vulnerable groups who were eligible to receive discounts but failed to do so because they did not apply for them. In addition, we will operate customer-centered electricity rate plans (such as by expanding our electricity rate options) by providing seasonal and hourly plans \u2013 that were previously only offered to industrial and general users \u2013 to our residential customers in Jeju from September 2021. Going forward, we plan to expand the number of areas eligible for such electricity rates.\n\nImplementation of Green Premium\n\nIn January 2021, we launched the \u201cgreen premium\u201d aimed at enhancing the global competitiveness of companies and spreading eco-friendly consumer value. The green premium is a way of participating in RE100, a voluntary global campaign in which electricity consumers declare that they will use 100% renewable electricity. Participants voluntarily pay additional premiums which are separate from electricity bills, and the confirmation of renewable energy usage corresponding to the green premium payment is used for RE100 certification. In addition, the green premium paid by consumers is used to finance the renewable energy investment project promoted by the Korea Energy Agency. We thus expect that the virtuous cycle of energy conversion will be strengthened through this project.\n\nGreen Premium Operation Process\n\n1. Calculation of annual sales volume\n2. Premium bidding, billing, and receipt\n3. Issuance of confirmation of use\n4. Distribution of confirmation of use\n5. Premium transfer\n6. Premium payment\n7.

By establishing a mobile consent system for contracts related to electricity usage, we simplified the application process and documents required for submission in the form of application seal and copy ID, as well as improved customer convenience by enabling consent to be submitted following mobile identity authentication. In addition, with the introduction of our mobile notification talk service, we have strengthened the customer\u2019s right to information and improved the electricity usage application process by informing customers, in real time, of their progress at each stage and providing a summary of the key terms and conditions. Moreover, we are focused on developing new concept services using new digital technologies, such as the \u2018Power Check Mobile\u2019 application.\n\nExpansion of Social Welfare-Based Customer Service\n\nIn cooperation with telecommunication companies and local government, we are expanding the number of local regions that are introducing the single-person household care service and upgrading our analysis model. The \u201csingle-person household care service\u201d works as a social safety net that preemptively prevents the occurrence of emergencies by detecting abnormal states - based on the electricity consumption of single-person households, mobile phone calls, and location data - and provides an emergency alert to the civil servant in charge of the relevant administrative welfare center. In addition to this, we continue to make concerted efforts aimed at expanding social welfare-based customer services for people who are socially disadvantaged, such as introducing an automatic discount application service linked with the information of welfare discount customers, such as people of national merit, and operating electric vehicle charging stations for vulnerable groups who are not able to easily use transport.\n\nPublic Proposal Contest for Power Service Improvements\n\nHere at KEPCO, we actively collect customer opinions with a view to providing simple and convenient services for our customers. We reflect these opinions when developing policies and when improving our system aimed at understanding and empathizing with customers. In particular, since 2014, we have been communicating with our customers through the National Proposal Contest for improving power services. In 2020, we held a contest under the theme of \u201cThe New Normal\u201d, which covered our \u201cFair System\u201d for improving unfair processes, our tailored \u201cContactless Service\u201d that enhances customer convenience in the era of COVID-19, and our customers\u2019 interesting lifestyle ideas in terms of electricity, as well as messages of support in these challenging circumstances brought about by the pandemic. Outstanding proposals selected through the contest are being used to help us make improvements across our business as a whole, such as improvements to our terms and conditions and in developing better customized services. KEPCO communicates with customers and listens to opinions through various communication channels such as meetings with consumer groups, operation of university student supporters, and online panel groups, and continues to innovate to improve customer satisfaction.\n\nBUSINESS CASE\n\nCustomer value improvement through development of Power Check Mobile application\n\n\"Power Check Mobile,\" developed by KEPCO via the convergence of the analysis of power-related big data and the artificial intelligence technology of our Intelligent Power Metering System (AMI*), is a service that provides information, on mobile, on electricity quality and electrical safety necessary for the operation of large-scale power facilities such as buildings, factories, and shopping malls, etc. Electrical safety managers are able to operate power facilities more safely and prevent electrical failures through timely inspections by utilizing various pieces of electricity quality information, such as information pertaining to high frequency, power factors, and unbalanced phase voltage, provided through Power Check Mobile and a preemptive power outage risk warning notification function. Further, electrical safety managers facing difficulties conducting on-site visits and facility inspections due to the prolonged COVID-19 crisis can remotely monitor electricity quality and inspect facilities 24 hours a day, thereby enabling them to perform their tasks more conveniently and efficiently.\n\n* AMI (Advanced Metering Infrastructure) : An intelligent power metering system that provides electricity usage information to customers in real time using a two-way communication network\nLeading Digital Transformation in the Electric Power Industry\n\nPower Industry Innovation Based on Digital Transformation\n\nWe are in the process of transforming from a traditional power company to a digital-based power company via a digital transformation across the entirety of our business. We are creating new value and establishing a data-oriented business environment by integrating and analyzing vast amounts of power-related big data using ICT technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud, and artificial intelligence (AI), and developing various business models and efficiently improving management activities.\n\nImplementation of Mid-Term Strategy for Digital Transformation\n\nIn recognition of the fact that company-wide digital transformation is essential, in 2019 we established our 2022 mid-term strategy aimed at systematically promoting digital transformation. Our mid-term strategy includes step-by-step implementation content tailored to each field, such as building digital infrastructure to create a foundation for digital transformation, digitalizing asset management, reducing costs and improving work efficiency through work intelligence, and creating digital business monetization models, etc. We are striving to internalize a digital culture throughout our organization and achieve practical results such as the development of various digital solutions through the systematic implementation of our mid-term digital transformation strategy. Going forward, we plan to set a new direction for digital transformation by establishing a 2025 digital transformation mid-term strategy in order to transform into an energy platform company.\n\nKEPCO Digital Transformation Strategy\n\n| Strategies per sector | Strategic tasks |\n|-----------------------|----------------|\n| 1) Building digital infrastructure | \u2022 Data platform advancement |\n| Internalization of digital transformation | \u2022 Company-wide data management |\n| 2) Digital asset management | \u2022 Asset management optimization |\n| OPEX/CAPEX savings | \u2022 Development of facility diagnosis technology |\n| 3) Digital work intelligence | \u2022 Mobile use for field work |\n| Work efficiency improvement | \u2022 Work efficiency utilizing RPA |\n| 4) Creation of digital business model | \u2022 External collaboration of digital transformation |\n| Creation of future business | \u2022 Development of AI-based service |\n\n1) OPEX: Operating Expenses\n2) CAPEX: Capital Expenditures\n3) RPA (Robotic Process Automation): Artificial intelligence-based work automation\n\nEstablishment of Digital Infrastructure\n\nHere at KEPCO, we are striving to establish an organizational culture based on data by expanding employee participation in digital transformation, while at the same time building digital infrastructure such as by upgrading data integration platforms for successful digital transformation.\n\nEnhancement of Our Data Integration Platform\n\nThe KEPCO Data Integration Platform is a space where, having expanded platform functions in terms of data collection and analysis, employees are able to directly utilize software development tools and AI technologies to create new business models based on big data. In 2020, we raised the data collection target from 308 types (2019) to 617 types with a view to increasing data usability, enhancing use-value, and expanding software and AI analysis capabilities.\n\nEstablishment of Company-Wide Data Standard Quality Management System\n\nHere at KEPCO, we established a company-wide data management system based on data standardization in order to ensure that our data is of a high quality. Through data management principles, organizations, and processes, as well as the establishment of an integrated management system, we enhanced the management of the entire data life cycle (creation \u2192 storage \u2192 utilization), and established a virtuous data cycle system. In addition, we improved data interoperability and utilization value by establishing and applying data standards and introducing a data quality management system. Going forward, we plan to unify scattered core data across our business systems by promoting our standard information management (MDM, Master Data Management) establishment project while also establishing an organization and workforce dedicated to implementing the data standard quality management system throughout our company.\n\nExpansion of Company-Wide Data Discovery Innovation Activities\n\nData discovery is a process that gives new meaning to data by analyzing and combining data in various systems with a view to addressing current issues such as cost reduction and the improvement of work efficiency, or to create new value. Starting in 2021, we expanded the target audience of data discovery activities such that employees from various business offices and various job groups are able to participate. Currently, for 33 different data analysis tasks, we formed a team consisting of idea proposers and a staff member from the digital transformation department who is responsible for supervision and coaching, who then carry out these tasks while being provided with workspace and budget support.\nDigital Asset Management\n\nIn response to issues such as reduced efficiency and the replacement of power facilities due to aging, we promote the digitalization of asset management in order to reduce maintenance and power generation costs while also maintaining a highly reliable power supply.\n\nAsset Management System (AMS)\n\nWe are developing an Asset Management System (AMS) for power facilities with a view to enhancing investment efficiency through facility performance evaluation and investment prioritization based on big data related to power. AMS is a system that evaluates risks based on data from the entire facility life cycle, such as inspection, diagnosis, failure, and load. It makes investment decisions by comprehensively taking into account optimal investment timing and cost. This system is of great significance in that it transforms the facility management paradigm as it prioritizes replacing high-risk equipment by assessing risks, thereby moving away from the conventional investment method of replacing the existing facilities altogether as soon as they reach their life expectancy. We are currently developing and creating these systems for 10 major types of transmission and distribution and plan to expand the scope of the application of these systems in the future. By implementing AMS, we expect to reduce facility investment costs and improve investment efficiency.\n\nSubstation Equipment Diagnostic & Analysis System (SEDA)\n\nIn order to build an efficient power facility operating system combining power facility operation experience with new digital technologies, we completed development of the next-generation Substation Equipment Diagnostic & Analysis System (SEDA), which is now in active operation. SEDA creates a comprehensive information DB by integrating and linking IoT sensor data for each substation facility, as well as inspection and diagnosis history data, with external data such as information on weather and disasters. Based on this DB, the system diagnoses the status of power facilities in real-time and automatically determines facility grades by combining big data and AI technology. Going forward, we will be able to enhance our failure prevention capabilities and reduce operating costs through efficient facility inspection and maintenance by changing our approach from manpower-centered simple inspections and inspection facility management to facility diagnosis using a data analysis system. We also plan to develop a comprehensive preventive diagnosis system by establishing an integrated preventive diagnosis system for transmission and substation facilities, improving and diversifying IoT sensor performance, and expanding digital twin substation construction, etc., while continuously upgrading the data analysis algorithm based on our know-how in terms of facility operation.\n\nIntelligent Digital Power Plant (IDPP)\n\nHere at KEPCO, we are promoting the construction of an Intelligent Digital Power Plant (IDPP) that utilizes 4th industrial revolution technologies such as IoT, big data, and AI to maximize power plant operation efficiency through digital transformation.

Through the establishment of an IDPP, we are able to maximize power generation revenue, minimize maintenance costs, and secure power plant operation flexibility. Currently, we are conducting a pilot operation of the platform at six plants in cooperation with electric power group companies, and are seeking to demonstrate the capabilities of the apps by developing five types of apps with functions such as AI-based boiler diagnosis and early warning. In the future, whilst expanding our development of intelligent apps, we also plan to collaborate with private sector companies to develop a commercialization model based on power generation data in the fields of digital power plant construction, power plant operation management, and facility improvement and maintenance.\n\nTechnological Structure of the IDPP\n\n- Facility evaluation\n- Monitoring /status diagnosis\n- Operation information visualization\n- Asset performance management\n- Specialized power generation platform\n\nOperational evaluation technology for boilers, turbines, and generators, etc.\n\nAccident prevention technology via abnormal state diagnosis and early warning\n\nRemote support based on expert knowledge of DB and AR/VR\n\nMinimizing power generation costs through risk-based asset performance management\n\nProvides a foundation for developing and implementing intelligent apps via standardized linkage of power plant data\nDigital Work Intelligence\n\nHere at KEPCO, we are expanding investment in AI/RPA and mobile, which are core technologies, with a view to improving work efficiency through work intelligence, while also applying various digital solutions developed using these technologies.\n\nWork Efficiency Improvement Using AI/RPA\n\nWe are striving to improve work efficiency by making work more intelligent through the use of big data and AI. We have developed a customer detection solution for high voltage AMI misconnection and current phase loss as customers continue to experience abnormal metering due to reasons such as watt-hour meter device defects and wiring errors. In addition, we improved detection accuracy through analysis of AI-based AMI data on anomaly customer patterns. We were able to prevent leakage of sales revenue and reduce fieldwork via early detection of customers experiencing abnormal metering. Moreover, we have applied artificial intelligence technology to our bid-rigging detection system in an effort to establish a fair trade approach. Through this, we are able to prevent fraudulent bidding and reduce the workload of the employees responsible for this work as were are able to analyze, in real-time, bidding information of participating companies and determine whether or not there is any collusion. Furthermore, we reduced workloads by automating simple, repetitive, and time-consuming tasks using RPA, thereby improving work methods and enabling employees to focus on high value-added tasks. We have significantly reduced business processing times by automating rehabilitation and bankruptcy customer management tasks and customer refund tasks that were previously performed manually, in addition to improving work accuracy by preventing human error. Moving forward, we plan to continue to improve work efficiency by expanding the application of AI and RPA.\n\nMobile App Development for Construction Site Safety Management\n\nWe are developing a construction site safety management mobile app in order to improve efficiency in terms of construction site management and prevent safety accidents.

In addition, it is expected that work efficiency will be enhanced as the mobile app enables remote construction site management and work approval. We are also trying to apply AI and mobile technologies to various on-site tasks such as safety management, design, and patrol/inspection.\n\nCreation of Digital Business Model\n\nAt KEPCO, we are promoting making data more accessible and open in order to encourage the external use of power-related data and to support the development of data-based business models. Further, by collecting, analyzing, and linking both power-related data and external data, we have been able to commercialize public services such as our single-person household care service and create new business revenue models through the establishment of digital platforms. Moreover, we are promoting big data analysis and the development of digital solutions through the operation of the \u201cData Science Lab\u201d, which consists of data experts, S/W experts, and in-house research personnel. Going forward, we plan to create new services based on big data and revitalize the data sharing ecosystem by utilizing the vast quantity of power-related data produced every year \u2013 amounting to over 3 trillion data points. In addition, the government is expected to actively utilize the regulatory sandbox, a special case of industrial convergence regulations, with a view to expanding the digital business domain.\n\nResults of Sharing Power-Related Data and Making it More Accessible\n\n| Accessible | Sharing | Distribution |\n|------------|---------|--------------|\n| Power-related data portal | Power-related data sharing center | Energy Marketplace |\n| Online platform providing key statistics related to power (115 types), and customized statistics for consumers | A space to analyze data that is difficult to provide due to the Personal Information Protection Act, etc. | Open market for various data and service transactions in the energy sector |\n\n- 130,000 cumulative visits\n- 230,000 requests to download statistics\n- 421 requests to provide customized statistics\n- 23 cases of completed use\n- 1,595 days of cumulative use\n- 207,000 service brokerage transactions\n- About 184 million cases of data distribution\nRevitalization of Energy Marketplace (EN:TER)\n\nIn August 2019, we began operating EN:TER, a comprehensive business platform we developed with a view to addressing the difficulties experienced by energy operators and service users and creating new value in the energy sector. Various services and products in the new energy sector are traded on EN:TER, in addition there are applications that utilize energy data, and new and renewable energy can be sold and purchased. In order to support the creation of a new business model, we added energy-specific content \u2013 such as statistical data on customer contract histories \u2013 and expanded various customer services, such as our integrated operation of a power transaction contract portal and a green premium system. In addition to business matching services, EN:TER also provides a number of services aimed at enhancing customer convenience, such as facilitating the download of the KEPCO mobile app, providing information on local electricity contractors, and providing information on distributed power linkages so that members can easily access various pieces of information related to the energy sector.\n\nProvision of EN:TER* Services\n\n| Members | Partner companies |\n|---------|------------------|\n| Customers that use electricity | Service providers |\n| New and renewable energy producers | Electrical facility manufacturers/builders |\n| New energy companies | Electrical work providers |\n| Electrical safety administrators | Household electronics manufacturers/distributors |\n\n| New energy business | Energy Data Service | New and renewable energy |\n|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|\n| Procurement support for high-efficiency household electronics | Energy Data Service | PPA Portal |\n| Registration for EERS | Energy Data Open Portal | Third-party PPA intermediary |\n| New energy business fund matching | | Comprehensive operation of the Green Premium |\n| Establishment of K-BEMS | | New and renewable energy transaction information |\n| Participation in DR | | |\n| Energy consulting | | |\n\n* EN:TER : An abbreviation for KEPCO\u2019s new \u2018ENERGY\u2019 and \u2018base(TER)\u2019\n\nAwarded \u2018Grade 1\u2019 in public data quality evaluation by the Ministry of Public Administration and Security\n\n\u2018CIO 100 Awards\u2019 First domestic company to be awarded for 5 consecutive years\n\nAwarded the \u2018Presidential Award\u2019 at the 20th Korea Digital Management Innovation Awards\n\n* CIO (Chief Information Officer) : Selects and awards 100 companies regarded as outstanding in terms of creativity and innovation in the global IT sector every year.\n\nDevelopment of Social Safety Net Service Using Power-Related Big Data\n\nHere at KEPCO, we contribute to the expansion of a social safety net through the development of a new public service by implementing various social welfare solutions that integrate big data. Our single-person household care service is a social welfare service solution that analyzes electricity consumption, mobile phone calls, and location data in order to detect signs of anomalies in terms of the safety of single-person households and provide emergency alerts to social welfare officials. We began with a pilot project in Usan-dong, Gwangju in 2019, are currently providing the service in Seogwipo and Siheung, and plan to expand the number of local governments that introduce the service nationwide. We have been recognized, both domestically and internationally, for our achievements in relation to developing social welfare solutions using power-related big data, for example we were awarded the Presidential Award at the 20th Korea Digital Management Innovation Awards hosted by the Ministry of Science and ICT in September 2020.\nPromotion of Low Carbon & Eco-Friendly Overseas Projects\n\nReorganization of Overseas Business Portfolio\n\nWe took our first step into the global market in 1995, with the restoration and operation of the Malaya heavy oil power plant in the Philippines. Since then, as of the end of 2020, we have grown into a global company carrying out a total of 47 projects covering areas such as thermal, nuclear, renewable, transmission, and new businesses across 26 countries. By 2020, we were able to achieve cumulative sales of KRW 37.4 trillion and a net profit of KRW 3.5 trillion through our overseas businesses, thereby contributing to improving our overall financial stability as a company.\n\nHowever, as the global energy transformation centered on new and renewable energy accelerates, our overseas business is facing a new turning point. Due to stricter regulations on carbon emissions and the proliferation of policies banning coal, orders for thermal power generation, traditionally one of our company\u2019s strengths, have decreased, and the market has been reorganized around renewable and grid power. In response to the global climate change crisis, we are fundamentally reorganizing our overseas business portfolio with a view to taking the lead in terms of energy transformation.\n\nIn October 2020, KEPCO declared that it would focus on developing low-carbon and eco-friendly businesses to enhance the sustainability of overseas business, while declaring that it would no longer pursue new projects in the case of overseas coal-fired power plants. Therefore, it is expected that all overseas coal-fired power generation projects operated by KEPCO will be terminated after 2050, and we are making efforts to operate in an eco-friendly manner by applying stricter standards than international environmental standards.\n\nEstablishment of Mid- To Long-Term Strategies for Overseas Business\n\nVision\n\nLeaping forward as the world\u2019s top energy platform company taking the lead on energy transition\n\nStrategic Direction\n\nOptimize portfolio to respond to global energy transition\n\nImprove business profitability through active asset management\n\nSecure global-level expertise to strengthen business capabilities\n\nStrategic Tasks\n\n\u2022 Selective promotion of thermal power business and expansion of entry into new and renewable business\n\u2022 Expand into grid-related investment projects and new businesses using core capabilities in transmission and distribution\n\u2022 Reasonable asset management\n\u2022 Improve profitability of projects and enhance risk analysis\n\u2022 Strengthen the ability to implement engineering (E) & procurement (P) and merchant projects\n\u2022 Foster professionals with respect to overseas businesses\n\nSelective Promotion of Thermal Power Business and Expansion of Entry into New and Renewable Business\n\nBased on our rich experience in developing and operating thermal power generation projects, we are selectively initiating thermal power projects centered on low-carbon and high-efficiency \u2013 such as combined cycle \u2013 in consideration of profitability and stability, and are focusing our capabilities on developing new and renewable projects such as solar and wind power-based projects.

We have demonstrated such a 100kW-class solar power generation system in Shinan, Jeollanam-do, in addition to building a 400kW-class demonstration test facility in Naju, Jeollanam-do in order to build a solar power generation facility capable of coexisting with agriculture by producing electricity while growing crops. Moreover, we developed an integrated operating system that simultaneously simulates and predicts crop growth and solar power generation. Furthermore, we are carrying out various basic convergence research projects in a bid to extend solar power application areas such as roads and sea and enhance social acceptance of solar power facilities.\n\nStatus of Solar Power Generation Project\n\n(As of 2021.6.30)\n\n| Classification | School and Public Land Solar Power | Miryang Hope Light Solar Power |\n|----------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Project Information | Construction and operation of solar power plants in schools and at public sites nationwide (110MW) | Construction and operation of a solar power plant that actively involves residents near the Miryang transmission line (2.5MW) |\n| Share Ratio | KEPCO 50% | KEPCO 50% |\n| Power generation subsidiaries | 50% | 50% |\n| Progress Status | 61MW completed (in operation) | 2.5MW completed (in operation) |\n\nKEPCO\u2019s Renewable Energy Development Goals\n\n(Unit: MW)\n\n| Classification | Solar power | Offshore wind power | Total |\n|----------------|-------------|---------------------|-------|\n| Total development goals | 371 | 737 | 2,800 |\n| Short-term (2022) | 356 | 686 | 1,900 |\n| Mid-term (2026) | 15 | 51 | 4,700 |\n| Long-term (2030) | | | 5,808 |\n\n| Classification | Solar power | Offshore wind power | Total |\n|----------------|-------------|---------------------|-------|\n| Total solar power | 2,942 | | |\n| Total offshore wind power | | 2,866 | |\n| Total | 5,808 | | |\nLeading the Development of Large-Scale Offshore Wind Power Projects\n\nIn order to achieve the goal of expanding renewable energy, we need to overcome Korea\u2019s lack of land and thus develop a large-scale offshore wind power project that utilizes Korea\u2019s advantages, such as being surrounded by the sea on three sides. In January 2020, we completed the nation\u2019s largest offshore wind power demonstration project (60MW) comprising twenty 3MW offshore wind power generators and offshore substations in the waters of Wido, Gochang-gun, and Buan-gun in Jeollabuk-do, and started full-scale commercial operation. Further, we selected a turbine supplier to develop the Jeju Hallim (100MW) offshore wind power project and earned approval for the development project, and are thus currently preparing to construct the power plant complex. We are also advancing the development of large-scale offshore wind power projects, for example the project in Shinan, Jeollanam-do (1.5 GW). In addition, we are leading supply chain expansion via nurturing and supporting domestic offshore wind power companies by easing the financial burden of initial investments by private operators through the preemptive building of joint connection facilities* to lead the vitalization of the domestic offshore wind power industry ecosystem. We are also enhancing R&D cooperation by sharing the results of the offshore wind power technology we develop, such as basic suction installation technology and batch installation technology.\n\n* Joint connection facility: Connection facility used jointly by multiple power generation companies for grid connection for efficient use of land\n\nStatus of Offshore Wind Power Generation Projects\n\n| Classification | Demonstration Complex | Pilot Complex | Expansion Complex |\n|----------------|-----------------------|---------------|-------------------|\n| Purpose        | Test-bed construction | Securing references | Large-scale complex development |\n| Project scale  | 60MW                  | 400MW         | 800MW             |\n| Development/ construction period | Completed in January 2020 | 2020 to 2026 | 2020 to 2028 |\n| Total project cost (Tentative) | KRW 0.4 trillion | KRW 2.4 trillion | KRW 4.6 trillion |\n\n| Classification | Project Location | Project Period | Total Project Cost |\n|----------------|------------------|----------------|--------------------|\n| Jeollabuk-do Southwest Offshore Wind Power Project (1.2GW : Pilot complex 400MW + Expansion complex 800MW) | 30km west of Imjado Island, Shinan-gun | (Development/Construction) 2019-2019 (Operation) For 25 years following construction | KRW 8.6 trillion (tentative) |\n| Shinan Offshore Wind Power Project (1.5GW) | Sea of Suwon-ri, Hallim-eup, Jeju-si | (Development/Construction) 2017-2017 (Operation) For 20 years following construction | KRW 0.65 trillion (tentative) |\n\nBUSINESS CASE\n\nThe Launching Ceremony for the Offshore Wind Power Multi-Purpose Mobile Base (MMB)\n\nWe developed the world\u2019s first offshore wind power batch installation technology*, and held a launching ceremony for the Multi-Purpose Mobile Base (MMB) at Gunsan Port in July 2021. The MMB was built over a period of 60 months with an investment of KRW 34 billion and was specially designed to transport and install 5MW-class wind turbines that weigh up to 1,500 tons and stand at 140m tall. Through the MMB, we can reduce installation costs by approximately KRW 3.7 billion when constructing one wind turbine and shorten the offshore installation period from 90 days to 10 days. Going forward, we also plan to apply this MMB technology to lower foundation transport installation at the offshore wind power facilities in southwestern Jeollabuk-do and Shinan, and we also expect to utilize the MMB in small-scale offshore wind farms and multi-purpose offshore works mainly promoted by the private sector.\n\n* Batch installation technology: Technology that lifts and transports the entire structure of the generator to the sea for installation after assembling the lower foundation and upper turbine of the generator in a safe port\nPreemptive Power System Reinforcement\n\nAs outlined in the Ninth Basic Plan for Power Supply and Demand, the government set a goal of increasing the proportion of renewable energy generation to 26.3% and installed generation capacity to 77.8GW by 2034. Accordingly, the quantity of transmission and substation facilities required for connection to the renewable energy system is expected to increase rapidly. In September 2021, we established and announced our ninth long-term transmission and transformation facility plan, which includes plans to promptly connect renewable energy, such as a new transmission and substation facility plan and a reinforcement plan. Through this plan, we seek to efficiently connect large-scale renewable energy integration complexes such as Saemangeum, Southwest Jeollabuk-do, and Shinan to the power system by introducing a joint connection facility system, in addition to striving to promote preemptive system reinforcement by establishing an accurate forecast quantity-based facility plan in an area where connection to renewable energy is expected.\n\nImproving Renewable Energy Connection Standards\n\nSmall-scale renewable energy takes less than three years to develop. However, transmission and substation facilities take more than six years to complete, resulting in an increasing number of cases where renewable energy cannot be connected to the grid and connection is delayed due to this difference in construction periods. Here at KEPCO, in order to address these issues, we are maximizing the renewable energy connection capacity that can be accommodated in existing power facilities, without expanding such facilities, by improving the connection standards for renewable energy in transmission and distribution facilities, such as by applying capacity that accounts for actual output (70% of overall capacity) and increasing the allowable capacity for connection of distribution lines (12MW \u2192 13MW), as well as preemptively enhancing the systems through timely construction of new power facilities.\n\nConnection Delay Reduction Performance\n\n(Unit: MW)\n\n| Year | Connection delay | Connection completion | Connection delay trends |\n|------|------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|\n| 2018 | 12,160           | 53% (6,452)           | 47% (5,708)            |\n| 2019 | 13,903           | 42% (5,854)           | 58% (8,049)            |\n| 2020 | 15,343           | 24% (3,727)           | 76% (11,616)           |\n\nIn particular, in December 2020 we opened the Renewable Energy Center in Jeju, the first center of its kind in Korea to comprehensively monitor renewable energy. Through this, we are able to monitor, in real-time, the output of renewable energy in Jeju, analyze driving characteristics, predict renewable energy production in advance, and evaluate any impact on the power system based on meteorological data. In addition, in cooperation with relevant organizations, we plan to expand the current system to land systems by upgrading the prediction accuracy and install an integrated control system that enables real-time monitoring, automatic prediction, and remote control of renewable energy. We are also promoting the introduction of a public ESS for grid stabilization with a scale of 1.4GW in order to maintain power system reliability and ease power generation constraints in preparation for the spread of renewable energy.\nExpansion of Energy Efficiency Improvement Projects and Diversification of Business Models\n\nCountries worldwide are expanding the introduction of the Energy Efficiency Resource Standards (EERS) as energy efficiency improvement is recognized as the most effective means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in both economic and environmental aspects. Korea will implement the EERS project in earnest from 2022 after its EERS pilot project period from 2018 to 2021. Accordingly, we are conducting various support projects in order to contribute to the transition to a low energy consumption society by improving energy consumption efficiency, and to cost-effectively achieve the EERS reduction goal. To this end, we have established dedicated functions within our organization, including an EERS Development Team at our headquarters and Energy Management Team at 15 of our regional HQs. We reduced energy consumption by 592,741MWh in 2020 through existing high-efficiency equipment supply projects such as heat pump boilers, regeneration control devices, and LED lighting, and are expanding the target equipment by continuously discovering high-efficiency equipment models. In particular, we focused on supplying high-efficiency equipment tailored to various industries for low-efficiency and high-consumption customers by contract type below cost. In addition, we are diversifying our business models, such as the consumer voluntary behavior change program and agency business utilizing ESCO. Going forward, we intend to lead the transition to a high-efficiency, low-consumption energy structure by expanding the introduction of new business models to improve energy efficiency, and by developing energy-saving solutions using power-related big data.\n\nSupport for Revitalization of RE100\n\nRE100 (Renewable Energy 100%) is a voluntary campaign that sees companies commit to using 100% renewable energy. 312 companies (9 Korean companies) are participating in this campaign worldwide. From among the five ways of implementing the RE100, we support the activation of the domestic RE100 through the Third Party Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) and the Green Premium. Going forward, we will introduce an electronic bidding method based on the Energy Marketplace (EN:TER) in order to establish a green premium system. At the same time, we will actively play our role as a power company in encouraging and facilitating the participation of all citizens in RE100, such as by expanding the target of participation in the project from general and industrial use to residential consumer use etc.\n\nDomestic RE100 - Means of Implementation\n\n| Means of Implementation | Contents |\n|-------------------------|---------|\n| Green Premium           | \u2022 Consumers purchase renewable energy by paying a premium, which is separate from existing electricity bills, to KEPCO |\n| Certificate Purchase    | \u2022 Consumers purchase renewable energy REC not used to fulfill RPS obligations through a trading platform established by the Korea Energy Agency |\n| Third Party PPA         | \u2022 Signing of PPAs between consumers and renewable energy generators through KEPCO brokerage |\n| Self-generation         | \u2022 Consumers directly install renewable energy facilities for their own use |\n| Equity Investment       | \u2022 Consumers invest a certain share in the renewable energy power generation sector |\n\n1) Renewable Portfolio Standard  2) Renewable Energy Certificate\n\nSF\u2086 gas is one of the six major greenhouse gases, and its effect on global warming is 23,900 times that of carbon dioxide (CO\u2082). Here at KEPCO, we use SF\u2086 gas, which exhibits excellent performance in terms of insulation, as an insulating material for transmission and distribution facilities. Accordingly, SF\u2086 gas accounts for about 62% of our total greenhouse gas emissions. We thus established a climate change response center at the Shinokcheon substation in 2019 and continue to reduce emissions by recovering and refining SF\u2086 gas emitted from switchgear for power distribution and recycling it for use in the substation field. In addition, we are working to essentially reduce the greenhouse gas emissions generated during the power distribution process by developing eco-friendly switchgear using substitute materials, such as solid insulation and nitrogen, instead of SF\u2086 gas.\nDeveloping Core Technologies for Carbon Neutrality\n\nLeading the Push for Carbon Neutrality through Technological Innovation\n\nTechnology Development for Timely Carbon-Neutral Response\n\nWe are actively promoting technology development in four key areas (CCUS, green hydrogen, offshore wind power, and maintenance of grid reliability) in order to take the lead in terms of creating a carbon-neutral energy ecosystem. We are currently concentrating all of our R&D capabilities on expanding eco-friendly power generation through the commercialization of CCUS, securing advanced offshore wind power technology, enhancing large-capacity and high-efficiency production of green hydrogen, and reinforcing the power system\u2019s capacity to accommodate new and renewable energy.\n\nTechnology Development Strategic System in 4 Key Areas of Carbon Neutrality\n\n| Strategic Goal | [Power Supply] Development and Commercialization of Decarbonization Future Technology | [Power Transport] Advancement of Grid in Response to Volatility |\n|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Strategic Direction | \u2776 CCUS* | \u2777 Green hydrogen | \u2778 Offshore wind power | \u2779 Grid reliability maintenance |\n| Strategic Tasks | Commercialization of the world\u2019s best technology | Early catch-up of advanced technology | Preoccupation of new markets | Enhancement of volatility response capabilities |\n| | \u2022 Large-scale demonstration of capture facilities | \u2022 Improvement of hydrogen production efficiency | \u2022 Optimization of wind power complex design | \u2022 Securing system flexibility resources |\n| | \u2022 Diversification of CO\u2082 utilization technologies | \u2022 Large capacity hydrogen storage | \u2022 Securing economic feasibility of construction technology | \u2022 Increasing renewable energy capacity |\n| | \u2022 Securing economic feasibility | \u2022 Diversification of hydrogen utilization technology | \u2022 O&M digital automation | \u2022 Ultra-precision grid operation |\n\n* Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage\n\n\u2776 Development of CO\u2082 Capture and Utilization Technology\n\nKEPCO is developing capture technologies for before, during, and after combustion in order to reduce the large amount of carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) emitted from power plants. We first began developing post-combustion wet/dry capture technology in the early 2000s, conducted a step-by-step research process (Lab-scale \u2192 0.1MW/0.5MW), and then successfully developed a 10MW-class CO\u2082 capture pilot plant (200 tons of CO\u2082 processed daily), the largest such facility in Korea. In particular, by utilizing a world-class high-efficiency CO\u2082 capture absorbent and process development, we were able to stably operate a 10MW-class CO\u2082 capture plant in connection with the exhaust gas of the power plant, thereby proving that it is a technology that can be immediately applied to industrial sites.\n\nCarbon dioxide utilization technology can reduce CO\u2082 emissions and simultaneously create added value by converting and utilizing the generated or captured CO\u2082 into carbon compounds. Going forward, we plan to demonstrate the 30Nm\u00b3 CH\u2084/h class process by developing a 10kW class sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO\u2083) production pilot process and establishing a 5kW-class biological methanation conversion system using independently produced methanation microorganisms. In order to achieve carbon neutrality, and based on the technologies and experiences derived through CCUS research and development, we aim to create new markets and pioneer technologies for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\u2777 Promotion of P2G-based Green Hydrogen Project\n\nKEPCO is carrying out research related to power-to-gas (P2G) with a view to increasing the efficiency of MW-class green hydrogen production, securing long-term storage technology, and using the stored green hydrogen as a flexible resource when necessary. P2G is electric power gasification technology that produces and stores hydrogen through the electrolysis of water by using surplus renewable energy, or combines the produced hydrogen and carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) and converts it into methane (CH\u2084), the main component of natural gas, for use as fuel for transportation, power generation, and city gas. In May 2019, we were selected by the government to lead efforts related to P2G, and thus conducting a P2G-based green hydrogen project in Ulsan and Naju.\n\nGreen Hydrogen Project Details\n\n| Project title | Period/place | Participating organizations | Details |\n|---------------|--------------|----------------------------|---------|\n| Research on P2G-based multi-MG operation and distribution | May 2019 to April 2022 / Ulsan Techno Industrial Complex | 6 including KEPCO and Ulsan TP | Securing multi-MG operation technology and demonstrating production |\n| Development of MW-class water electrolysis & methanation | May 2019 to April 2022 / Naju Industrial Complex | 18 including KEPCO and East-West Power | P2G core technology development and demonstration |\nDevelopment of New Offshore Wind Power Technology\n\nKEPCO is making concerted efforts to develop technologies for the entire cycle of offshore wind power generation in order to efficiently carry out large-scale offshore wind power projects in Korea. We became the first company in the world to develop suction foundation installation technology and batch installation technology for offshore wind power, and these are now core technologies in the construction field. Suction foundation installation technology is a new technology for rapid installation of lower foundations within the offshore wind power sector that drives the foundation into the ground by using water pressure generated when discharging water inside the pile using a suction pump after mounting a large steel pipe on the seafloor. This technology is capable of reducing production and installation costs by more than 30% compared to current methods, in addition to dramatically shortening the installation period. In addition, since this technology uses a pressure difference at sea level instead of driving the foundation structure into the seafloor, it can prevent excessive driving noise, flotation, and marine pollution caused by cement injection material. Batch installation technology is a technology which is capable of transporting and installing the entire generator structure at sea, by utilizing a special vessel (MMB*) after assembling both the lower foundation and upper turbines in a safe port. Through this technology, we are able to shorten the offshore installation period and improve construction convenience. Moreover, MMBs are expected to be used for multi-purpose offshore work, such as installing and dismantling weather towers and rescue ships. By establishing an offshore wind power environmental monitoring system, we are working to constantly monitor the impact of offshore wind power farms on the local marine environment and apply our findings to our wind power generation business.\n\nExpansion of R&D into System Reliability\n\nKEPCO is working on various technological developments to respond to the deterioration of grid stability, reduced electricity quality, and increased grid accommodation costs caused by the spread of renewable energy use. We are installing an integrated operating system for the transmission and distribution of renewable energy in order to stabilize the power grid, while also developing a high-precision prediction model based on artificial intelligence in a bid to advance the prediction of new and renewable output. In addition, we are developing and researching next-generation energy storage technologies for frequency adjustment and recoveries, such as graphene super-caps and manganese-based batteries, with a view to addressing the issues of the volatility of renewable energy. Going forward, we plan to overcome challenges in terms of system operation due to the expansion of renewable energy supply, and enhance grid technology competitiveness through continuously developing new technology and conducting diverse research.\n\nUtilization of R&D Results and Promotion of Commercialization\n\nKEPCO is actively promoting technology transfer and the establishment of a research institute for the commercialization of cutting-edge technologies, while also carrying out continuous technology development. We transfer technology to third parties, such as small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) facing difficulties in terms of carrying out R&D, by transferring intellectual property rights, granting licenses, and providing technical guidance. In addition, we have been operating research institutes* since 2018 to go beyond the existing technology transfer method and directly commercialize R&D results. A research institute is established by jointly investing technology and finance in the form of a combination of our technology and a company capable of commercializing the technology. Through research institutes, we are able to conduct more active technology commercialization activities.\n\n* Research institutes : Companies established in special R&D zones by public research institutes investing 20% or more of capital as the main body of establishment (12 companies established as of the end of 2020)\n\nPatent Application/Registration Status\n\n| Classification          | Unit | 2018  | 2019  | 2020  |\n|-------------------------|------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Patent Application      | Case | 666   | 832   | 841   |\n| Patent Registration     | Case | 254   | 364   | 407   |\n| Total                   | Case | 920   | 1,196 | 1,248 |\n\nTechnology Transfer Performance\n\n| Classification          | Unit          | 2018  | 2019  | 2020  |\n|-------------------------|---------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Contract                | Case          | 119   | 176   | 185   |\n| Transfer Company        | Company       | 96    | 156   | 164   |\n| Revenue                 | KRW 100 million | 20.2  | 32.3  | 92    |\n\nTechnical Support Performance\n\n| Classification          | Unit          | 2018  | 2019  | 2020  |\n|-------------------------|---------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Domestic                | KRW 100 million | 28    | 37    | 73    |\n| Overseas                | KRW 100 million | 20    | 25    | 15    |\n| Power Generation Subsidiary | KRW 100 million | 110   | 90    | 38    |\n| Private                 | KRW 100 million | 13    | 9     | 10    |\n| Total                   | KRW 100 million | 171   | 161   | 136   |\nRealizing Eco-friendly Management\n\nEstablishment of Environmental Management Promotion System\n\nImplementation of Environmental Management Plan\nKEPCO systematically implement environmental strategies and policies by establishing a company-wide environmental management plan every year in a bid to establish a sustainable environmental management system. Major business plans related to environmental management and the performance of our environmental management system are reported to our senior leadership, and we have been reducing environmental risks by reviewing and evaluating environmental impacts when making investment decisions. In addition, we conduct regular internal inspections on business sites and strive to minimize adverse environmental effects by addressing and improving nonconformities identified during this process.\n\nOperation of an Environmental Management Organization\nThe EHS Team of the Safety and Health Department establishes a company-wide environmental management plan with a view to achieving our environmental management goals, and monitors the implementation results. In addition, to enhance our integrated environmental management system, we have established environmental management guidelines and are thus implementing, maintaining and continuously improving our environmental management system.\n\nEnvironmental Management System Certification\nIn order to conduct environmental management in a more systematic manner, KEPCO has maintained ISO 14001 certification, an international environmental management system standard, since first acquiring it in 2007. We have hence established a company-wide environmental management system and are efficiently managing all related activities, such as complying with environmental laws and regulations, managing environmental performance, and reducing environmental pollution, to ensure that the basic requirements of international standards are fulfilled. KEPCO will continue to maintain ISO 14001 certification and promote environmental management in accordance with international standards.\n\nEnvironmental Management System Certification Status\n\n| Certification Standard | Certification Scope | Certification Work | Certification Agency |\n|------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| ISO 14001:2015         | Headquarters and 19 regional offices | Construction, operation, sales of domestic and overseas electric power facilities (power generation, transmission and substation, distribution), and all related tasks, overseas nuclear power plant project development and operation management | KSR Certification Institute |\n| KS I ISO 14001:2015    |                     |                   |                     |\n\nMinimization of Environmental Impact\n\nWater Risk Management\nKEPCO recognizes that water resources are a global risk and, as such, strive to prevent environmental risk factors when using water. In the case of our domestic power transportation and sales businesses, there is no exposure to water risks such as water shortage and water pollution. However, we recognize water risk as a potential risk factor and therefore strive to reduce consumption across the company.\n\nRegarding our overseas projects, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Jordan are regarded as water-stressed countries according to water-stressed country classification criteria*. Accordingly, we use seawater, not groundwater, as cooling water in Saudi Arabia (Rabigh), UAE (Shuweihat), and the Philippines (Cebu, Ilijan), and heavy water recycled from domestic sewage as cooling water in China (Shanxi Gyeokmaeng International) in an effort to minimize exposure to water risks in the vicinity of overseas power generation projects, whereas in Jordan (Al Qatrana), we are striving to manage and protect water by using air for cooling.\n\nWater Management\nKEPCO selected water consumption as one of the specific performance indicators in terms of practicing environmental management, and we manage our performance and goals related to water consumption every year. To this end, we established an energy portal system and a management system to report and verify company-wide water consumption by regional division, month, and year. We also transparently disclose critical environmental information, such as water consumption, energy consumption, waste discharge, etc., through the Environmental Information Disclosure System (http://www.env-info.kr) operated by the Korea Environmental Industry and Technology Institute (KEITI) every year.\n\nWater Consumption\n\n| Year | Water Consumption (Unit: thousand m\u00b3) |\n|------|--------------------------------------|\n| 2018 | 1,988                                |\n| 2019 | 2,911                                |\n| 2020 | 2,697                                |\n\n* Classification criteria of water-stressed countries from WRI (World Resource Institute), WWF (World Wildlife Fund), PAI (Population Action International)\nWaste Management\nKEPCO increases our recycling rate by discovering new recycling destinations for waste generated in the course of business, while also entrusting the disposal of waste that is difficult to recycle to a legitimate specialized treatment company. In particular, for the safe removal of PCBs*, which are classified as hazardous waste, we strictly control transformers according to our PCBs management procedure. In addition, we thoroughly manage waste transformers with a PCBs content of 2ppm or more from discharge to disposal through a PCBs analysis and treatment institution certified by the Ministry of Environment every year.\n\nBiodiversity Protection\nWhen selecting construction sites for transmission and substation facilities, KEPCO refrains from proceeding with projects in biodiversity-protected areas, such as wetland protected areas, wildlife protected areas, forest genetic resource reserves, the Baekdudaegan Mountains Reserve, and other such areas. We exclude biodiversity-protected areas from being project candidate sites by appointing a professional company to conduct power impact assessments prior to starting a project. At the environmental impact assessment stage, we analyze the environmental risks to both animals and plants and, by conducting documentary surveys, inquiries, on-site investigations, etc., produce an impact reduction plan incorporating protective measures in order to double-check whether the site is a biodiversity protected area.\n\nAir Pollutant Management\nKEPCO\u2019s power generation subsidiaries have built a chimney remote monitoring system (CleanSYS) capable of measuring air pollutants such as sulfur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and dust (TSP) with an automatic chimney measuring device (TeleMetering System), and are monitoring the emission status in real-time. We have also implemented a suspension of coal-power and upper limits (80%) via a seasonal management system (December to March), as well as striving to reduce air pollutant emissions by introducing world-class environmental facilities such as flue gas desulfurization facilities and electrostatic precipitators.\n\nManagement of Coal ash and Desulfurized Gypsum\nKEPCO\u2019s power generation subsidiaries select and thoroughly manage the recycling of coal ash and gypsum waste as environmental management indicators in order to promote resource circulation. Additionally, they are continuously promoting the development of technology to turn by-products of power generation into resources.\n\nWaste Discharge and Recycling\n(Unit: ton)\n\n| Year | Waste discharge | Recycling |\n|------|-----------------|-----------|\n| 2018 | 16,365          | 166,295   |\n| 2019 | 18,900          | 139,324   |\n| 2020 | 36,104          | 151,145   |\n\nAir Pollutant Emissions*\n(Unit: ton)\n\n| Year | SOx | NOx | TSP |\n|------|-----|-----|-----|\n| 2018 | 50,261 | 60,904 | 2,725 |\n| 2019 | 36,482 | 46,468 | 2,238 |\n| 2020 | 24,166 | 30,431 | 1,669 |\n\n* Calculation range: Korea South-East Power, Korea Midland Power, Korea Western Power, Korea Southern Power, Korea East-West Power\n\nCoal ash and Desulfurized Gypsum Emissions and Recycling*\n(Unit: thousand ton)\n\n| Year | Coal ash | Desulfurized gypsum |\n|------|----------|---------------------|\n| 2018 | 9,368    | 8,782               |\n| 2019 | 8,365    | 8,365               |\n| 2020 | 7,289    | 7,140               |\n\n* Calculation range: Korea South-East Power, Korea Midland Power, Korea Western Power, Korea Southern Power, Korea East-West Power\n\nBiodiversity Protection\nWhen selecting construction sites for transmission and substation facilities, KEPCO refrains from proceeding with projects in biodiversity-protected areas, such as wetland protected areas, wildlife protected areas, forest genetic resource reserves, the Baekdudaegan Mountains Reserve, and other such areas.

At the environmental impact assessment stage, we analyze the environmental risks to both animals and plants and, by conducting documentary surveys, inquiries, on-site investigations, etc., produce an impact reduction plan incorporating protective measures in order to double-check whether the site is a biodiversity protected area.\n\nIn addition, in accordance with the Environmental Impact Assessment Act, we conduct environmental impact assessments in order to review the environmental impact of significant changes to or expansions of the construction sites for transmission and substation facilities. Moreover, we prepare various alternative plans with a view to minimizing environmental impact and discuss these alternative plans with approval agencies and local environmental agencies. In addition, we monitor the environmental impact of construction work through a post-environmental assessment service conducted by a specialized company, and submit the results to local environmental agencies. Local Environmental Agencies disclose the results of environmental impact assessments through the Environmental Impact Assessment Information Support System (http://www.eiass.go.kr).\nTCFD Report\n\nOperating under the G20, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) established the Task-force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in 2015 and made recommendations on information disclosure related to the climate crisis. Accordingly, from 2020, KEPCO has been disclosing information related to our climate crisis response efforts* in accordance with the TCFD recommendation in response to the needs of global investors.\n\n* KEPCO discloses climate crisis-related indicators and information in detail by participating in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). The CDP report can be found on our official website.\n\nGovernance\n\nBoard-Level Supervision of Risks and Opportunities Related to Climate Change\n\nKEPCO became the first public enterprise in Korea to establish an ESG Committee operating under the BOD following a resolution by the BOD in December 2020, with a view to enhancing ESG management and supervision at the board level. The ESG Committee is in charge of deliberating on the overall direction of the company in terms ESG, including climate change response activities and strategic goals. The committee, chaired by the Chairperson of the BOD and consisting of three outside directors, holds regular quarterly meetings, in addition to convening ad hoc meetings to discuss ESG-related management issues if and when necessary. In addition, we established the ESG Advisory Committee in September 2021, which operates as an advisory body directly under the ESG Committee. In consideration of the rapidly changing business environment, the ESG Advisory Committee is composed of five external ESG-related experts, and appoints advisors with expertise in the environment and climate fields in order to provide strategic advice on our climate change response activities and the realization of carbon neutrality.\n\nThe Role of Management in Assessing and Managing Risks and Opportunities Related to Climate Change\n\nThe Chief Financial & Strategic Planning Officer plays the role of managing and supervising risks and opportunities related to climate change at the board level and below, by constantly monitoring and reporting essential information to the BOD, such as our response to the greenhouse gas emission trading system and the current status of investment projects necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, as part of our climate change response efforts, we established the Carbon Neutral Strategy Department and Sustainable Growth Strategy Department at the Electric Power Innovation Division under the Chief Financial & Strategic Planning Officer. The Electric Power Innovation Division oversees our company-wide response to climate change, prepares strategies and action plans aimed at achieving the goal of carbon neutrality, and strengthens the cooperative system between power generation subsidiaries and other power group companies, while simultaneously establishing and implementing a carbon-neutral technology roadmap. Meanwhile, our climate change response activities are directly linked to expanding new and renewable energy, new energy business development, energy efficiency improvement, and greenhouse gas reduction technology development. Accordingly, in order to enhance our climate change response capabilities, we established the following departments under the control of the Chief Business Operations Officer the Offshore Wind Power Project Department in charge of developing domestic offshore wind power projects; the New Energy Business Department overseeing new energy business such as electric vehicle charging infrastructure and smart cities; the Demand & Efficiency Optimization Department that establishes a demand management plan including the energy efficiency improvement project; and the Technology Planning Department that promotes the development of carbon-neutral core technologies.\n\nClimate Change Response System\nKEPCO divides risks related to climate change into transition risks and physical risks. Transition risks are defined as policy, technology, and market changes that occur in response to climate change and risks that may damage corporate image and brand reputation. We establish and manage response strategies for each type of risk. Physical risk refers to acute and chronic risks to power facilities caused by abnormal climate and extreme weather due to climate change. We established climate change adaptation measures and reflect these measures throughout our management strategies through scenario analysis (using RCP 8.5) regarding damage to power facilities due to climate change and submit the inspection results on the implementation of adaptation measures to the Ministry of Environment every year. Detailed information on our RCP 8.5 scenario analysis and climate change adaptation measures is disclosed in detail in the CDP report.\n\nClimate change can, on the other hand, also serve as an opportunity to create new business when transitioning to a low-carbon economy. We strive to reduce electricity purchase costs and develop new business using surplus electricity by activating demand trading. We also lead large-scale projects that are difficult for private operators to participate in by developing renewable energy projects such as offshore wind power, while also expanding our new energy business based on the convergence of new renewable energy and ICT technology. Moreover, we successfully issue ESG bonds, such as green bonds, as a means of financing large-scale and eco-friendly investment projects, and are seeking to reduce financial costs by raising funds at lower interest rates than electric power bonds.\n\n### Risks and Opportunities Related to Climate Change\n\n| Type | Contents | KEPCO\u2019s Response |\n|------|----------|------------------|\n| Regulation | \u2022 During the Phase 3 allocation plan for the Korean Emissions Trading Scheme (2021-2025), the free allocation ratio will be lowered from 97% to 90% and thus the cost of purchasing emission rights is expected to continue to increase  \n\u2022 Need to respond to the demand for additional reduction in the power sector in order to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 | \u2022 Collection and refinement of SF6 gas, which accounts for approximately 62% of KEPCO\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, as well as the expansion of the use of eco-friendly switches to reduce SF6 emissions  \n\u2022 Securing greenhouse gas emission rights through external reduction activities, such as the CDM project in Myanmar |\n| Technology | \u2022 Increasing R&D costs and additional financial burden in the event of failure, as a result of developing technology, to respond to climate change, such as for GHG emissions reduction and expanding new and renewable energy | \u2022 Promotion of systemic technological development, such as the joint development of CCUS and green hydrogen by group subsidiaries, to respond to climate change and develop technology to reduce greenhouse gas emissions |\n| Legal | \u2022 Any lawsuits related to the environment, such as those relating to climate change, not only have a financial impact but also have a negative effect on corporate reputation | \u2022 For major projects, preliminary identification and assessment of climate change-related regulatory risk factors, as well as the establishment and review of response measures, in accordance with the internal review process |\n| Market | \u2022 As a power sales company, KEPCO purchases electricity from the power wholesale market.

We identify and evaluate climate change-related risks through a committee deliberation process in a step-by-step manner, and make efficient investment decisions for major projects related to our climate change response. For projects that involve large-scale investments, including climate change response activities, we deliberate on business feasibility through organizations such as the Project Selection Committee, Risk Review Committee, Investment Review Committee, and the BOD, before finalizing the investment amount. As part of this process, we analyze the risks posed by the project in terms of climate change by comprehensively considering potential financial impacts, such as enhancing environmental regulations, energy tax reform, and the response to the emission trading system, as well as non-financial impacts such as external reliability.\n\nThe Project Selection Committee comprehensively deliberates on the project feasibility analysis results conducted by the project development department, including obstacles to project implementation, analysis of expected risks and returns, bankability, project implementation plans, required budgets, and implementation schedule. The Risk Review Committee determines which risks need to be prioritized in terms of management, taking into consideration risk management strategies such as significant risk analysis and countermeasures and the possibility of the occurrence of risks from a short-term and mid- to long-term perspective. The Investment Review Committee conducts the final evaluation of investment portfolios for projects that have passed the Project Selection Committee and Risk Review Committee, and other investment projects. Following this final evaluation, final approval for the project is made through the BOD.\n\nMeanwhile, we recognize the risks and opportunities associated with climate change from a financial perspective, monitor carbon emission-related risks, and establish systematic response plans in connection with company-wide risk management. Climate change response activities are reflected throughout our short-term, mid-term, and long-term investment plans, considering the impact of risks and the possibility of new business promotion, while also periodically analyzing execution performance against the budget and performance management indicators. By synthesizing these analysis results, we are able to manage the impact of climate change-related risks on our operating profit in accordance with step-by-step standards, and reflect these results throughout our mid- to long-term financial management plan through a yearly mid- to long-term business environment analysis which we report on to the BOD. The mid- to long-term financial management plan established in 2020 includes investment directions and investment plans for each business in preparation for changes in the business environment related to climate change, such as: reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing restrictions on coal power generation in order to respond to fine dust; increase in environmental costs such as RPS and emission rights; diffusion of low-carbon and distributed energy such as renewable energy and the smart power grid; and expansion of new energy businesses such as smart cities, electric vehicle charging, and ESS construction, etc.\n\nMajor Risk Management Factors by Committee\n\n| Domestic Projects (new energy project, renewable power generation project) | Overseas Projects |\n|---|---|\n| \u2022 Project implementation obstacles, expected risk and return analysis, financing availability, project implementation plan and required budget, implementation schedule, etc. | \u2022 Verification of project environment and major assumptions |\n| \u2022 Matters concerning basic policies and plans | \u2022 Risk management strategies such as major risk analysis and countermeasures |\n| \u2022 Matters concerning the conclusion of contracts | \u2022 Matters related to the main contents of various contracts and guarantees |\n| \u2022 Matters concerning the establishment and investment of a corporation (SPC) | \u2022 Matters related to project cost structure and financing |\n| \u2022 Matters related to financing | \u2022 Sensitivity analysis such as cash flow estimation by situation |\n| \u2022 Basic investment risk management plan according to investment feasibility, etc. (verification of project environment and major assumptions, sensitivity analysis by situation, risk management strategy, etc.) | \u2022 Residual value and restoration cost reflection |\n| \u2022 Review of project need, adequacy of implementation timing, profitability (economic feasibility), review of risk and response plan, changes and reasons for change after deliberation by previous stage | \u2022 Approval of standard return adequacy verification results |\n| \u2022 Final approval after review of project investment validity | |\nGreenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Target\n\nKEPCO, in partnership with our six power generation subsidiaries, sets a target to reduce emissions by 80 million tons (37.9%) by 2030, relative to 2017 levels (211 million tons) under the Electric Power Group Companies\u2019 2030 Basic Plan for GHG Emissions Reduction. To this end, we are striving to enhance the eco-friendly power generation mix by improving power generation infrastructure such as the early abolition of coal power plants and LNG-conversion, increasing the proportion of renewable energy generation, and shutting down coal power plants.\n\nIn addition, we are discovering and promoting external reduction projects, greenhouse gas emissions reduction technology utilization, CDM project implementation through collaboration with various stakeholders, etc., in addition to internal reduction efforts. Meanwhile, the government plans to raise the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) for 2030, which is a direct route to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, and confirm and announce detailed strategies for achieving carbon neutrality tailored to each sector. In response, we, in collaboration with our group subsidiaries, will strive to play a pivotal role in achieving the national goal of carbon neutrality by announcing our own vision for carbon neutrality during BIXPO 2021, which is to be held in November 2021. We also plan to establish and announce new step-by-step greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals and implementation strategies in a timely manner in connection with the upgraded NDC goals and the detailed carbon-neutral strategies for each sector as outlined by the government.\n\nStatus of Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n\nKEPCO closely monitors information on greenhouse gas emissions throughout our business activities and systematically manage all direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions in the three stages of Scope 1, 2, and 3. Our total greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 amounted to 1.04 million tons, a decrease of about 5.6% (61 thousand tons) from the previous year. Our future emissions are expected to decrease further due to our efforts to recover and refine SF6 gas, which accounts for the largest proportion of greenhouse gas emission sources, and our efforts to introduce eco-friendly gas. Meanwhile, the GHG emissions of our electric power group companies, including six power generation subsidiaries, are expected to decrease by approximately 13.2% (26.6 million tons) from the previous year to 175.6 million tons as a result of energy conversion policies such as reducing coal power generation and expanding renewable energy.\n\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions of KEPCO Group Companies\n\n| Classification | Unit | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 |\n|----------------|------|------|------|------|\n| KEPCO          |      |      |      |      |\n| Scope 1&2      | 10 thousand tCO2eq | 136.6 | 110.5 | 104.3 |\n| Scope 1        | 10 thousand tCO2eq | 117.1 | 91.3  | 84.2  |\n| Scope 2        | 10 thousand tCO2eq | 19.5  | 19.2  | 20.1  |\n| Power Generation Subsidiaries |      |      |      |      |\n| Scope 1&2      | 10 thousand tCO2eq | 21,457.1 | 20,113.3 | 17,454.9 |\n| Scope 1        | 10 thousand tCO2eq | 21,094.2 | 19,762.3 | 17,113.6 |\n| Scope 2        | 10 thousand tCO2eq | 362.9  | 351.0  | 341.3  |\n| Total          | 10 thousand tCO2eq | 21,593.7 | 20,223.8 | 17,559.2 |\n\nOther Indirect Emissions (Scope 3)\n\n| Classification | Unit | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 |\n|----------------|------|------|------|------|\n| Power Generation Fuel Production | tCO2eq | 49,161,641 | 45,442,637 | 39,323,308 |\n| Capital Goods | tCO2eq | 1,300 | 1,154 | 2,312 |\n| Power Generation Fuel Combustion | tCO2eq | 240,309,224 | 219,634,493 | 189,287,108 |\n| Upstream Transportation and Logistics | tCO2eq | 2 | 2 | 6 |\n| Waste Treatment | tCO2eq | 1,191 | 765 | 1,358 |\n| Employees\u2019 Domestic And Overseas Business Trips | tCO2eq | 10,829 | 9,104 | 4,944 |\n| Employee Commute | tCO2eq | 477 | 483 | 323 |\n| Total          | tCO2eq | 289,484,754 | 265,078,284 | 228,619,359 |\n\n1) Based on the National GHGs Management System (NGMS), the 2020 emissions may be partially changed depending on government verification results (scope of calculation: domestic business sites)\n2) Power generation subsidiaries: Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power, Korea South-East Power, Korea Midland Power, Korea Western Power, Korea Southern Power, Korea East-West Power\n3) Scope 1: Direct emissions from emission sources directly owned and controlled by business operators\n4) Scope 2: Indirect emissions from the production of electricity, steam, etc.\n5) Scope 3: External emissions from power generation fuel production, domestic, and overseas business trips, product use, etc. (excluding downstream investments)\nSOCIAL\nAs the recognition that a corporation is an individual member and also a citizen of the community is growing, the responsibilities and duties required of a corporation as corporate citizens are increasingly emphasized. With this in mind, we have defined social value as \u2018value contributing to public interest and community development,\u2019 and continue our concerted efforts aimed at realizing social value in all areas of our businesses. Through these efforts, we are taking the lead in terms of creating sustainable social value based on the \u2018establishment of an inclusive society\u2019 and \u2018solidarity and cooperation\u2019 with the mindset of respect for humanity. Also, we will strive to become a beloved public corporation model by improving the public\u2019s quality of life.\nRealization of Safe Workplace\n\nStrengthening Safety & Health Management\n\nEnvironment, Health, and Safety (EHS) Management Policy Implementation\n\nHere at KEPCO, we prioritize environment, health, and safety values when it comes to management activities. In addition, we re-established our EHS management policy in June 2021 in order to share our specific policies related to EHS management throughout our company, and our employees comply with this management policy in performance of their duties.\n\nDetails of EHS Management Policy\n\n| Management value | Risk management |\n|------------------|-----------------|\n| Set EHS as the top priority in terms of corporate activities and encourage the participation of all employees | Implement a system of eco-friendly management, remove risk factors from corporate activities, and ensure safe and healthy working environments |\n\nEHS standard management\n\nIntroduce and operate a EHS standard management system at all domestic and overseas business sites\n\nCommunication and cooperation\n\nSpread a commitment to EHS management to all stakeholders and strengthen EHS partnership\n\nCompliance with laws\n\nComply with all EHS-related laws & regulations\n\nInnovation and improvement\n\nContinuous improvement in terms of EHS performance by sharing ideas and new technologies, and conducting education and training\n\nSafety and Health Management System Certification\n\nHere at KEPCO, we built a global-standard safety and health management system in accordance with international standards. We were the first domestic public institution that acquired ISO 45001 certification, which is the most recent international standard in terms of safety and health. Moreover, we continue to make efforts aimed at upgrading our safety and health management activities in accordance with ISO 45001 requirements.\n\nSafety and Health Management System Certification Status\n\n| Certification standard | Certification scope | Certification work | Valid period | Certification agency |\n|------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------|---------------------|\n| ISO 45001:2018 | Headquarters and four regional offices | Design, development, construction, and maintenance of power facilities | 2019. 3. 22 ~ 2022. 3. 21 | KSR Certification Institute |\n\nRe-establishing a Dedicated Safety Management Organization\n\nWe are striving to enhance our management system by strengthening our expertise in terms of safety and health through the establishment of a dedicated organization and the expansion of our workforce. In particular, with a view to reinforcing safety and health-oriented management, we established the Safety and Health Department in December 2020. Serving as our overall safety and health control tower, the Safety and Health Department conducts safety management diagnosis and accident prevention consulting for regional HQs. In addition, we have established Safety & Disaster Management Teams at 15 regional headquarters and 3 construction headquarters in order to implement site-focused safety accident prevention plans, while also striving to improve work environments and establish a unique safety culture. To this end, we significantly increased our number of safety task forces from 172 in 2019 to 251 in 2020.\n\nSafety and Health Organizational Chart\n\nDeveloping and Amending Safety & Health Regulations\n\nThe amended Occupational Safety and Health Act came into effect in January 2020 and, accordingly, the responsibilities and roles of the contractor have been enhanced, and the scope of protection has been expanded. Consequently, we enacted and revised 241 safety work regulations related to distribution, transmission and substation, construction, and ICT by reflecting industrial safety-related laws, guidelines, standards, etc.\n\nStatus of Development and Amendment of Safety & Health Regulations\n\n| Classification | Distribution | Transmission and Substation | Construction | ICT | Total |\n|----------------|--------------|-----------------------------|--------------|-----|-------|\n| Enactment      | 5            | 5                           | 6            | 154 | 170   |\n| Amendment      | 54           | 11                          | 6            | -   | 71    |\n| Total          | 59           | 16                          | 12           | 154 | 241   |\nEnhancement of Safety Accident Prevention System\n\nTimely Implementation of Risk Assessment and Establishment of Management System\n\nWe prepare our safety measures by preemptively identifying risk factors in the workplace through regular and ad hoc risk assessments, in addition to establishing and managing procedures aimed at facilitating the safe operation and maintenance of facilities. We conducted periodic evaluations at all of our business sites in accordance with Article 36 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of June 2020 and Article 15 of the Guidelines on Safety Management of Public Institutions. We also established improvement measures for risk factors derived from these evaluations. Moreover, we ensure that risk assessment results are reflected throughout safety management activities and safety culture performance evaluations of business sites. In addition, we have built a risk assessment management system for the systematic management of the operation of each of our offices.\n\nRisk Assessment Implementation History\n\n| Conducted 4,181 risk assessments |\n|---------------------------------|\n| Measures established | Improvements completed | Measures being implemented |\n| 13,861 cases | 13,351 cases | 510 cases |\n\nConstant Operation of the Work Suspension Request Center\n\nThe right to stop work refers to the right of workers to refuse to work upon receiving unsafe work orders or having difficulty working due to physical or emotional factors. Here at KEPCO, we operate the Work Suspension Request Center and guarantee our workers the right to stop work. We prevent safety accidents at hazardous worksites by, following a request to stop work, resuming work only after risk factors have been removed and the construction supervisor has checked the site.\n\nSafety Management Enhancement for those Vulnerable in terms of Safety\n\nWe made it compulsory to fill out a worker-management card at 79 construction sites with a view to enhancing the safety management of those who are vulnerable in terms of safety, such as daily workers and foreign workers. In addition, we ensure that new workers wear identification stickers and that workers must work in pairs. We also provide foreign workers with safety work regulations handbooks in various foreign languages, such as English, Chinese, Uzbek, etc.\n\nApplication of Smart Safety Management System\n\nWe applied a smart safety management system to five large-scale construction sites, including 345kV civil engineering and electric power conduit pipes. We only allow workers who have completed pre-registration through facial recognition to enter worksites, we are able to locate workers in real-time using smart sensors, and reinforce our safety management through warning alarms in case of emergency by constantly measuring oxygen levels and temperature.\n\nEstablishment of Multi-protection Environment for Workers\n\nFollowing a thorough analysis of the types of major safety accidents that have occurred in the past, we learned that there is a high number of safety accidents due to electric shock and falls. Accordingly, we are striving to enhance our on-site safety management through the development of new technology and equipment, such as a resting place for tubular steel pole workers, low-pressure polymer insulated gloves, safety equipment for preventing pylon fall accidents, and remote control tower fall arrest nets, etc., while also establishing measures aimed at avoiding the recurrence of critical management accidents. Going forward, we will intensively manage potential accidents according to the time period when accidents occur and the type of construction through systematic safety accident analysis, in addition to actively responding to issues in a bid to prevent recurrence of safety accidents through the improvement of working environments and the development of safety equipment, etc.\n\nEfforts to Eradicate Major Management Accidents\n\n| Electric shock | Fall accident |\n|----------------|--------------|\n| Implementation of optimized indirect live wire construction method | Improvement of fall arrest net (1st stage \u2192 2nd stage) |\n| - Improved operator convenience and safety through the introduction of electric tools | - Improvement of fall arrest net (1st stage \u2192 2nd stage) |\n| - Prevention of musculoskeletal disorders through reducing weight of auxiliary equipment (5kg \u2192 4kg) | - Improvement of fall arrest net (1st stage \u2192 2nd stage) |\n| - Dispersion of worker load when using heavy tools due to the development of auxiliary wearers | - Improvement of fall arrest net (1st stage \u2192 2nd stage) |\n\n| Electric shock accident (Unit : cases) | Fall accident (Unit : cases) |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 2019 21 | 2019 13 |\n| 2020 13 | 2020 11 |\n\n38% \u2193 15% \u2193\nInternalization of Safety and Health Culture\n\nImplementation of Safety Education and Training\n\nHere at KEPCO, we are making concerted efforts to internalize an autonomous safety culture while upgrading our safety management system in order to create a workplace that prioritizes the life and safety of workers. We provide specialized training tailored to each type of work with a view to cultivating the necessary safety competencies for each role, such as safety management managers, working-level employees, and new employees. In addition, statutory safety education is mandatory for all employees. We also conduct discussion-led safety training once a year for company representatives and once a quarter for workers in order to raise the awareness of our partner companies in terms of safety and establish a voluntary safety culture. Through this training, we are able to listen to the difficulties faced by our suppliers in relation to safety management and collect and apply ideas for improving on-site safety management. In addition, we introduced safety education which utilizes VR and is tailored for power facility construction sites in order to increase education impact and maximize education effectiveness.\n\nSafety Training Performance\n\n(As of 2020)\n\n| Classification       | Training content                                      | Number of participants |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Employees            | Training for responsible personnel, managers, staff, and new employees | 7,026 persons (specialized education) |\n| Partner companies    | Key points related to safety accident prevention, accidents, etc. | 1,042 persons (representatives), 12,080 persons (workers) |\n\nEstablishment of a Culture of Safety and Health at Partner Companies\n\nThe importance of establishing an autonomous safety culture is bigger than ever on account of the abolishment of the accident-free record certification system. Furthermore, the compulsory system aimed at preventing industrial accidents, has reached its limit in terms of effectiveness. Accordingly, we introduced and are currently operating our own autonomous safety culture certification system with our partner companies. We also evaluated the safety culture foundation, practice, and performance of 166 regional divisions and partner companies in 2020, granted safety culture certifications to 78 regional divisions and 82 partner companies, and handed out rewards. In addition, as of 2020, 138 suppliers and 27 regional divisions participated in our \u2018mutually beneficial cooperation program for safety and health,\u2019 and made joint efforts to improve safety and health management, such as by improving risk assessment and supporting education and facilities. Moreover, we restricted the ability of companies determined to have caused industrial accidents to partake in bidding by introducing a penalty point mileage system.\n\nJoint Labor-Management Safety and Health Management Activities\n\nWe have implemented a period for emphasizing industrial safety and health in order to promote autonomous industrial accident prevention activities and discover and eliminate safety blind spots through joint action between labor and management. We are also enhancing our public relations efforts related to the safe use of electricity at construction sites where there is a high possibility of electric shock, while also running a campaign to promote electrical safety using various themes in a way that closely represents the daily lives of the general public.\n\nDetails of Joint Labor-Management Safety and Health Management Activities\n\n| Area                                      | Main content                                                                 |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Creating an environment suitable for the period for emphasizing industrial safety and health | \u2022 Safety slogan, publicity billboard (placard), accident-free resolution contest  |\n| Site-oriented safety management activities | \u2022 Regional division site map inspection, safety equipment, and vehicle inspection |\n| Support for safety management of customers and partner companies | \u2022 All-in-one inspection of important facilities, construction site experience day |\n| Safety culture diffusion campaign         | \u2022 Support for customer facility safety inspection, safety meetings with suppliers |\n| Electric safety promotion                 | \u2022 Operation of special safety inspection team in cooperation with customers and suppliers |\n| Health management                         | \u2022 Joint labor-management safety patrol inspection during hot weather period |\n|                                           | \u2022 Implementing safety experience, visiting safety exhibitions and conferences |\n|                                           | \u2022 Safety improvement proposal contest, safety accident illustration relay exhibition |\n|                                           | \u2022 Company-wide safety and health manager workshop, vehicle safety accident prevention training |\n|                                           | \u2022 Promotion of electrical safety (PR media, collaboration with related organizations, street campaigns, etc.) |\n|                                           | \u2022 Promotion a culture of safety to business partners who work close to power lines |\n|                                           | \u2022 Life cycle health checkup tailored to each age group |\n|                                           | \u2022 Periodic psychological counseling by visiting experts |\n|                                           | \u2022 Adoption and trial application of mobile health management app \u2018MO-OM\u2019 |\n\nReceived \u2018Minister of Public Administration and Security Award\u2019 at the 19th Korea Safety Awards\n\n*Awarded \u2018Best Prize\u2019 in Best Practices for Safety and Health Shared Cooperation Program\n\n* Hosted by the Ministry of Employment and Labor\nEstablishment of a Preemptive Disaster Response System\n\nEstablishment of Disaster Management System\n\nHere at KEPCO, we have established and are currently operating an integrated disaster management system based on ISO 22301 certification, an international standard for business continuity management (BCM) for fast response and recovery when faced with an interruption to power supply due to a disaster. Through this system, we are able to prevent safety accidents and provide a stable power supply by preemptively inspecting and managing major power facilities in preparation for disasters that are becoming increasingly larger and more complex.\n\nEnhancement of Safety Inspection of Power Facilities Vulnerable to Disasters\n\nWe preemptively prevent large-scale disasters by managing safety according to facility type and period, while also enhancing our safety accident prevention efforts and power supply stability by conducting intensive inspections of power facilities during times of crisis. We install and inspect thermal insulation facilities in preparation for the heavy snow and cold waves during winter (November 15 to March 15). During the warmer months (March 15 to November 15), we conduct special inspections for areas prone to soil loss and drainage facilities in preparation for typhoons and torrential rain.\n\nEnhancement of Disaster Response Capabilities\n\nWe conduct various types of disaster education and training in order to check our disaster response system and enhance our actual disaster response capabilities. We also carry out our own drills for each type of disaster, such as emergencies concerning electricity supply and demand, natural disasters, cyber terrorism, power system failure, etc., by developing disaster response training scenarios and introducing a VR-based training simulator. In addition, we conducted, while simulating conditions expected during the COVID-19 crisis, fire response training at in-house multi-use facilities, such as a human resource development center (124 people), two dormitories (500 people), two training centers (179 rooms), etc., and reinforced our evacuation facilities.\n\nAwarded \u2018Excellent Grade\u2019 in Disaster Management Evaluation by the Ministry of Public Administration and Security for 3 consecutive years\n\nImplementation of on-site National Safety Inspections\n\nHere at KEPCO, we eliminate equipment weakness and risk factors by conducting national safety inspections on power transmission lines, substations, distribution lines, and power facilities at large construction sites across the country in order to prevent safety accidents and provide a stable power supply. In particular, in 2020, in order to enhance the expertise and effectiveness of national safety inspection, we intensively inspected power facilities that would have a significant social impact in the event of a breakdown, such as large-scale substations and power cables over 20 years old, in collaboration with a joint public-private inspection team composed of 12 external experts, including professors in the electrical field. We also conducted special inspections applying scientific equipment and technologies such as thermal imaging and drones for core facilities such as supply lines for fire-vulnerable facilities and multi-use facilities, etc. Through these efforts, a total of 8,709 inspection personnel inspected 8,731 sites and strengthened accident prevention capabilities at 1,090 sites, in a timely manner. Going forward, we will do our best to create a society in which all citizens are safe by strengthening disaster safety management activities through continuous equipment inspection and the establishment of a rapid power facility recovery system.\nPursuit of Employee Growth and Happiness\n\nCreating High Quality Jobs\n\nCreating Jobs for the Young to Alleviate Youth Unemployment\n\nWe created 1,550 full-time jobs in 2020, the largest number created by any public institution. We filled 1,488 of these positions with young people, accounting for 96% of the total number of hires, by identifying new employment potential such as mid- to long-term workforce analysis and advancement of the forecast for the number of employees taking leave. We also selected 2,004 young interns in order to provide them with job experience opportunities, while actively supporting them to enhance their employment competitiveness by expanding opportunities for practical experience via rotation between departments and strengthening our mentor system, etc. As a result of these efforts, 208 of these young people who participated in our internship programs joined our workforce as full-time employees.\n\nIn particular, we introduced non-face-to-face recruitment methods such as video interviews in order to ensure a smooth recruitment process despite the COVID-19 crisis, and we are providing online special lectures delivered by management on training new employees, in addition to online introductory training on job competency. Accordingly, we were able to complete large-scale recruitment in a timely manner and build and operate a digital education environment capable of enabling new employees to receive training without being affected by the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nFair and Transparent Recruitment\n\nHere at KEPCO, we guarantee equal opportunities to all applicants in terms of fair and transparent recruitment of excellent talent centered on job competency. We introduced our own NCS* recruitment method to secure the right talent for the jobs we have available, and established a blind recruitment system in order to ensure that applicants are not discriminated against based on education history, gender, age, etc. As a result of our continuous efforts to improve our recruitment methods such that they are fairer and more transparent, no recruitment irregularities or transparency violations were pointed out by a joint public institution recruitment audit with government departments despite receiving our highest ever number of applicants (51,637 people).\n\nExpansion of Recruitment Based on Social Equality\n\nHere at KEPCO, we strive to create an open and equitable recruitment culture that takes into consideration those who are socially disadvantaged. Accordingly, we expanded preferential employment for people with disabilities and people of national merit, and continue to recruit outstanding high school graduates by linking our youth internship system with the recruitment of such graduates. Through this, we are able to expand employment opportunities for talented high school graduates, thereby contributing to the establishment of a recruitment culture that is centered on competency. In addition, we are increasing the recruitment of local talent in non-metropolitan areas and the region to which our headquarters relocated in a bid to increase the youth employment rate for graduates of local universities. To this end, we are selecting more regional specialists, offering additional points during the document screening phase of recruitment, and supporting local talents* with their efforts to enhance their employability by, for example, providing tailored recruitment briefing sessions.\n\nYouth Job Creation Performance\n\n| Year | Youth Interns | Youth Recruitment |\n|------|---------------|-------------------|\n| 2018 | 1,728         | 1,730             |\n| 2019 | 1,674         | 1,699             |\n| 2020 | 2,004         | 1,486             |\n\nRecruitment Based on Social Equality\n\n| Year | Local talent from outside the capital region | Local talent from the relocation area | High school graduates |\n|------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| 2018 | 1,091                                       | 223                                  | 220                   |\n| 2019 | 1,102                                       | 244                                  | 281                   |\n| 2020 | 925                                         | 245                                  | 395                   |\n\n* NCS (National Competency Standards) : National job competency standards that systematize the knowledge, skills, attitudes, etc., required to perform duties in industrial workplaces\n\n* Local talents : Employees hired after graduating from schools that are not located in Seoul, Gyeonggi, or Incheon, or located overseas\n\n* Gwangju/Jeonnam\nJob Creation in the Private Sector\n\nIn addition to directly creating private sector jobs linked to our main business, we also simultaneously provide indirect support aimed at inducing employment. We continue to take the lead in creating large-scale jobs by continuously promoting core businesses in the power sector, such as the construction of transmission and distribution power infrastructure and the maintenance of power facilities. We also create socially inclusive job opportunities by discovering and nurturing startups and supporting social and economic organizations. In addition, we expand local win-win jobs through new energy market exploration by attracting Energy Valley companies and establishing research institute companies. As a result of these efforts, we were able to create a total of 40,191 private sector jobs in 2020.\n\nPrivate Sector Job Creation Performance\n\n| Private sector job creation | 40,191 persons |\n|----------------------------|---------------|\n| Construction and operation of transmission and distribution power infrastructure, joint entry into overseas business | 26,804 persons |\n| Revitalization of Energy Valley, establishment of research institute companies, promotion of new energy business | 13,089 persons |\n| Discovering and nurturing startups, supporting social and economic organizations | 298 persons |\n\nManagement Stabilization Support for Subsidiaries\n\nWe established three subsidiaries (KEPCO MCS, KEPCO FMS, and KEPCO CSC) in the fields of meter reading, facility management, and customer centers in an effort to convert contract workers into permanent employees. Accordingly, we were able to complete the early conversion of 8,025 contract workers into permanent employees, the largest number of any public institution. Moreover, in the process of carrying out this project, we formed a labor-management and expert consultation body and reached agreements with all stakeholders through 160 meetings and negotiation sessions in accordance with the government\u2019s Guidelines for Conversion of Temporary Workers to Permanent Workers.\n\nWe also carried out a fair conversion recruitment process by ensuring compliance with the recruitment corruption prevention guidelines and by operating the Center for Reporting Corruption related to Permanent Employment Conversion. Meanwhile, we share major management issues and seek reasonable solutions by organizing and operating a joint parent-subsidiary company council in order to support the stabilization of management efforts at our three subsidiaries at which contract workers were converted to permanent employees. In addition, we provide support with strengthening the expertise of the subsidiaries\u2019 workforce, signing parent-subsidiary education cooperation MOUs, and sharing job training courses. We made further efforts to improve the treatment of workers converted to permanent employment by expanding resting facilities via the operation of the Working Environment Improvement TF. On account of these joint efforts by parent and subsidiary companies aimed at early management stabilization, the three aforementioned subsidiaries contributed to job creation by hiring 739 new employees (25 at KEPCO MCS, 588 at KEPCO FMS, and 126 people at KEPCO CSC).\n\nNumber of New Hires by Newly Established Subsidiaries\n\n739 persons\nOptimal Innovative Talent Cultivation\n\nStrategic Human Resource Development\n\nHere at KEPCO, we are striving to develop strategic human resources in an effort to take the lead in achieving our vision and mid- to long-term strategic goals. To this end, we established three primary human resource development directions of \u2018high-level expertise,\u2019 \u2018learning organization,\u2019 and \u2018future-oriented HRD\u2019 and are systematically implementing 10 strategic tasks in accordance with these directions.\n\nDirection of Talent Development and Strategic Tasks\n\n| High-level Expertise | Fostering talents with high-level expertise in order to drive sustainable growth, re-establishing the traditional image of talent with a focus on expertise |\n|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1) (Nurturing new growth experts) Establish a system for nurturing experts in mid- to long-term new growth areas |\n| 2) (Providing systematic job training) Enhance expertise by systematizing training courses by position, job, and level |\n| 3) (Expertise-focused talent) Establish a new approach to talent recruitment that focuses on expertise and reflects current trends |\n\n| Learning organization | Activation of a learning culture that learns to respond quickly and flexibly to the rapidly changing business environment and improve on-site problem-solving skills |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1) (Activation of constant on-the-job learning) Activate on-the-job training and self-directed learning |\n| 2) (Cultivation of various types of knowledge and literacy) Diversify educational programs to spread knowledge sharing |\n| 3) (Expansion of education on management issues) Rapidly identify management issues and improve problem-solving skills |\n\n| Future-oriented HRD | Preparation for a major change in educational methods such as Metaverse, customized training recommendations, etc. |\n|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1) (Enhancement of the capabilities of future generations) Establish OJT consulting for new employees and enhance growth support |\n| 2) (Global solidarity and cooperation) Expand educational opportunities so as to learn global best practices |\n| 3) (Large-scale conversion to education method 1) Improve educational effects dramatically by introducing Metaverse |\n| 4) (Large-scale conversion to education method 2) Recommend personalized education based on AI and big data |\n\nEstablishment of Non-face-to-face, Real-time HRD Platform\n\nWe are concentrating on building a digital-based HRD platform in an effort to replace face-to-face education, which tends to be centered on group education, amid the rapid changes brought about by the COVID-19 crisis, and overcome the shortcomings of the simple delivery e-learning education method. We recently introduced and are currently operating a cloud-based, non-face-to-face real-time video training system. Through this, participants are not affected by the COVID-19 crisis and are able to receive training by communicating with professional instructors in real-time. Moreover, we are innovating our education methods by combining new digital technologies, such as the development of digital learning content based on indirect experiential Web-VR* and the expansion of field-based simulation education using 360\u00b0 3D, etc.\n\nRealization of Learning and Growing Organization\n\nWe operate the \u2018Time for Accumulation Program\u2019 that guarantees suitable conditions for self-directed immersive learning and supports individuals and organizations in accumulating expertise and competency. Through this program, we have built a self-directed and customized learning system in which learners lead the entire learning process. Also, sufficient immersive learning conditions, such as training time and fees, are ensured, an accumulated learning experience is shared with the company in order to make the learning more useful on-site.\n\nTime of Accumulation Program Overview\n\n| 8 hours of accumulation | 8 hours of study per week | Guaranteed self-directed immersion learning time |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| +                       | +                        | +                                               |\n| Accumulation grid       | Learning support system  | Support, share, and disseminate learning experiences (from planning stage to implementation) |\n| +                       | +                        | +                                               |\n| Accumulation class      | Themed lectures          | Lectures and talks with top experts (on-site lectures, lectures through Youtube) |\n| +                       | +                        | +                                               |\n| Accumulation sharing    | Learning campaign        | Learning motivation interactive content |\n| +                       | +                        | +                                               |\n| Accumulation cafe       | Immersive learning space | Study cafe service (pilot operation at headquarters) |\n\nEmployee Training Status\n\n(Unit: KRW million, hours)\n\n| Year | Total training cost | Total training hours |\n|------|---------------------|----------------------|\n| 2018 | 23,012              | 2,109,611            |\n| 2019 | 24,841              | 2,204,693            |\n| 2020 | 15,901              | 1,576,493            |\n\n1) Cumulative overlap in the number of people enrolled in group training and video training (excluding e-learning training)\n2) Reflecting the decrease in training time and cost due to being unable to leave the country due to the COVID-19 crisis and the restrictions placed on group education\nFostering Future Core Business Experts\n\nIn line with the rapidly changing energy paradigm, we are focused on nurturing experts in future core businesses. In particular, we focus on nurturing internal experts with core competencies through a step-by-step curriculum with a view to taking the lead in terms of megatrends such as energy transition and digital transformation, and enhancing our ability to win overseas business.\n\nIn addition, we are operating a system aimed at supporting the acquisition of professional qualifications intrinsically linked to future core businesses and jobs in order to activate the self-directed career development of executives and employees and enhance their professional competencies. Currently, we are providing our employees with support in terms of educational expenses, such as lecture fees and books, for 12 types of professional certifications, as well as providing them with study time in a way that ensures their work performance is not negatively affected. In addition, we are helping our employee grow into experts by giving them, and prioritizing, work related to their professional qualifications once they obtain them.\n\nFostering Female Leaders and Advancing Career Development Program of Women\n\nHere at KEPCO, we are systematically expanding our support for female talents in an effort to nurture competitive female leaders. In 2020 we were able to reach, in advance, the national goal to increase the number of female managers to 10% of all managers by 2022, with our female managers accounting for 10.2% of total managers. We were able to achieve this through career development program tailored to the requirements of the various stages of the life cycle, such as joining the company to childbirth, childcare, promotion, etc. In addition, we support the enhancement of female talent and their growth as female managers through external training courses such as leadership training at Ewha Womans University, in addition to internal training and workshops.\n\nCareer Development Program for Women Tailored to the Various Stages of the Life Cycle\n\n| Stage          | Program                                                                 |\n|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 20s (4th tier position) | Job competency / growth vision  \n\u2022 Motivation for voluntary growth  \n\u2022 Implementation of job and vision mentoring |\n| 30s (3rd tier position) | Professional competency and leadership  \n\u2022 Reinforcement of leadership competency and decision-making  \n\u2022 Support for obtaining professional qualifications |\n| 40s and onward (2nd tier position or higher) | Advanced competency and network  \n\u2022 Acquisition of management trends and enhancement of policy capabilities  \n\u2022 Facilitating obtainment of master\u2019s and doctoral degrees in management and technology fields (17 persons) |\n\nStatus of Future Core Business Training\n\n| Basic understanding : 67 courses / 8,628 persons completed |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Energy transition | Understanding energy transition such as distributed power |\n| Digital transformation | Learning the basics through practice, such as big data and Python |\n| Overseas business | Understanding overseas business, development process, etc. |\n\n| Field application : 39 courses / 682 persons completed |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| Energy transition | Reinforcement of practical competencies in fields such as renewable energy, EVC, and wind power generation |\n| Digital transformation | Education for nurturing experts by digital core technology area |\n| Overseas business | Practical skill improvement such as power generator design |\n\n| Experts : 30 courses / 171 persons completed |\n|---------------------------------------------|\n| Energy transition | Master\u2019s and doctoral degree programs in energy materials, secondary batteries, etc. |\n| Digital transformation | Master\u2019s and doctoral degree programs in Data Science, IoT, Cloud, etc. |\n| Overseas business | Fostering experts in overseas business such as CP3P |\n\nNumber of Female Managers*\n\n| Year | 1st and 2nd tier position | 3rd tier position | Total |\n|------|---------------------------|------------------|-------|\n| 2018 | 20                        | 363              | 383   |\n| 2019 | 28                        | 420              | 448   |\n| 2020 | 36                        | 483              | 519   |\n\nPercentage of Female Managers*\n\n| Year | Total managers | Female managers | % |\n|------|----------------|-----------------|---|\n| 2018 | 383            | 5,083           | 7.5 |\n| 2019 | 448            | 5,006           | 8.9 |\n| 2020 | 519            | 5,100           | 10.2 |\n\n* Including employees on leave or suspended\nCreating a Positive Corporate Culture\n\nOperation of KEPCO Corporate Culture Committee\n\nWe operate the Corporate Culture Committee which serves as a control tower that gathers various ideas in a bid to build a flexible and warm corporate culture while also overseeing the spread of such a culture across the company.\n\nComposition of the Corporate Culture Committee\n\n| Main Committee* (Chairman : Chief Mutual Growth & Management Officer) |\n| --- |\n| Junior Board* |\n| Secretary : Head of the Corporate Culture Team |\n\nWorking-level Committee* (Chairman : Director of Labor-Management Cooperations Department)\n\n- Working Culture Division : Improving meeting/reporting culture\n- Communication and Convergence Division : Activating communication\n- Leadership Division : Reinforcing leadership competency\n- Diffusion Division : Spreading corporate culture improvement tasks\n- External Advisory Group* : Providing expert feedback, advice, and special lectures\n\nOrganization of the Junior Board\n\nWe operate the Junior Board with a view to providing the MZ generation, our future leaders, with an active role and creating synergies through intergenerational collaboration.

In particular, we diversified communication channels between labor and management by newly establishing a LAN discussion forum, which was held every Wednesday throughout 2020, due to restrictions placed on face-to-face communication due to the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nLabor-Management Working Together to Improve Corporate Culture\n\nWe strive to create a flexible organizational culture based on stable labor-management relations. Labor and management together selected a list of the top ten tasks for improving corporate culture, focusing on tasks that employees felt passionate about, such as: eradicating excessive protocols; complying with work ethics and punctuality; eradicating bullying and harassment; and assigning tasks clearly and reasonably. Labor and management are also working together to conduct company-wide implementation campaigns and encouraging the voluntary participation of all executives and employees. In addition, labor and management are responding to major issues such as reducing working hours through joint efforts and making various attempts to facilitate horizontal communication within the organization and establish a friendly corporate culture by conducting a leader-led Corporate Culture Change Campaign targeting senior managerial level or higher.\n\nCreating a Family-friendly Corporate Culture\n\nHere at KEPCO, we count parental leave (3 years per child) as working years in order to prevent employees from being disqualified from promotion due to leave of absence, while also guaranteeing equal opportunities for promotion by expanding special promotions based on competency and performance. In addition, due to the COVID-19 crisis, we expanded childcare leave and improved our HR system with a view to affording pregnant women priority when it comes to working from home. Furthermore, we continue to make various efforts, such as the opening of \u2018childcare product sharing market\u2019 which allows employees an opportunity to exchange childcare products with each other, aimed at promoting a family-friendly corporate culture. We are also actively implementing a flexible working system such that employees can choose a way of working that most closely aligns with their individual situations. In particular, we improved work convenience by introducing a self-designed flexible working system in which employees autonomously design individual work schedules of 40 hours a week. As a result of these efforts, we have been awarded the Family-Friendly Certification for 10 consecutive years since 2011. This certificate is awarded by the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family in recognition of companies that model family-friendly systems, such as childbirth and child-rearing support programs, and flexible working systems.\n\nStatus of Flexible Working System Usage*\n\n| Year | Usage |\n|------|-------|\n| 2018 | 10,451 |\n| 2019 | 12,947 |\n| 2020 | 15,116 |\n\n* Excluding work-from-home\n\nEfforts to Communicate with the MZ Generation\n\nAs the number of new employees has increased significantly over the past five years, as of the end of 2020, the MZ generation (the generation born between the early 1980s and early 2000s) accounts for about 44% of the total number of employees. With that in mind, we are working in various areas to transform our corporate culture into a horizontal one capable of meeting the needs of the MZ generation. We published our own booklet, \u2018KEPCO\u2019s new normal, MZ has arrived\u2019 in order to narrow the gap between the MZ generation and the older generation. Through this booklet, many employees were able to empathize with each other across generations on account of the descriptions, via case studies, of various issues experienced by the MZ generation and how the MZ generation and the older generation think of each other. In addition, we produced and aired our internal communication web drama \u2018kW (KEPCO Web drama). Even though the web drama was geared toward the MZ generation, it featured the story of a protagonist with a conservative mindset who was struggling to find his identity and the ideal organizational culture. We believe that the web drama significantly contributed to broadening intergeneration communication throughout our organization and to creating an atmosphere of organizational fusion.\nSustainable Supply Chain Establishment\n\nImplementing Systematic Supply Chain Management\n\nDistribution of Code of Conduct for Suppliers\n\nWe were the first ever public institution in Korea to create a Code of Conduct for Suppliers in order to establish a fair trade order and build a sustainable supply chain in accordance with the 10 principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and the OECD and International Labor Organization (ILO) labor and environment guidelines. The Code of Conduct for Suppliers specifies ethical, environmental, and social standards. It provides guidance to all domestic and foreign partners with whom we have business relationships and other participating companies such that they are able to comply with the terms outlined in all contracts. In addition, the code of conduct recommends that subcontractors who deal with business partners recognize and abide by the principles of the Code of Conduct.\n\nDetails of Code of Conduct for Suppliers\n\n| Ethical standards | Environmental standards | Social standards |\n|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|\n| \u2022 No illegal subcontracting | \u2022 Compliance with laws and regulations related to environment and safety | \u2022 Compliance with tax and labor laws |\n| \u2022 No bribery | \u2022 Provision of a safe working environment | \u2022 Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of race, religion, or gender |\n| \u2022 No collusion | \u2022 Environmentally-conscious management activities | \u2022 Guaranteeing freedom of assembly and association |\n| \u2022 No unreasonable solicitation | \u2022 Spreading of eco-friendly technology | \u2022 Prohibition of child labor |\n\nKey Supplier Management\n\nHere at KEPCO, we designated major power equipment, such as transformers and switchgear, that significantly impact power quality and supply stability, \u2018trusted items\u2019 and only allow pre-registered companies with the required manufacturing capabilities and quality systems to participate in bidding. After pre-examining those companies who registered their trusted items in terms of quality and process, we manage them as key suppliers, classifying them into the following categories: transmission, substation, distribution, and ICT. By conducting a supplier sustainability survey covering a total of 20 assessment criteria, we strive to promote the sustainable ESG management of our key suppliers. In addition, we receive a breakdown of key parts manufacturers from registered producers of trusted items.\n\nKey Supplier Status\n\n(As of 31 December 2020)\n\n| Supplier type | No. of suppliers |\n|---------------|------------------|\n| Total suppliers | 1,294 companies |\n| Registered producers of trusted items | 262 companies |\n| Registered producers of core parts | 493 companies |\n\nSupply Chain Risk Prevention\n\nWe create a sound industrial ecosystem through supply chain management, in consideration of both quality risks and the sustainability of suppliers. While conducting on-site inspections and performance verification tests in regard to technology and quality in order to secure excellent equipment, we also provide training and consulting for partner companies with a view to enhancing technological competitiveness and quality management. In addition, we encourage companies participating in bidding to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct, which outlines regulations that must be adhered to in terms of human rights, labor, environment, anti-corruption, etc. We also make it mandatory for companies participating in bidding to sign and submit the Integrity Contract Implementation Memorandum that pledges to ban unfair acts such as bid-rigging, and the receipt of money and/or entertainment. Moreover, we operate a computer-based system (http://srm.kepco.net) to facilitate business between partner companies, purchasing departments, and testing institutes, in order to enable us to systematically manage the supply chain. We use this system to disclose regulations and detailed guidelines related to supply chain management in detail.\n\nSupply Chain Evaluation Follow-up Management\n\nWe conduct on-site inspections of suppliers deemed to be high risk based on the results of our supply chain evaluation in order to establish and implement a corrective action plan and regularly conduct follow-up management. We also impose sanctions such as suspension of registration and cancellation of registration for ineligible companies who have violated regulations, etc., depending on the degree of violation following a decision by the Reward and Punishment Committee.\n\nSupply Chain Management Process\n\n- Supplier Code of Conduct\n- Equipment supplier management guidelines\n- Equipment quality grading system evaluation criteria\n- Special conditions for safety contract\n- Operational standards of the Reward and Punishment Committee of partner companies, etc.\n\n- New suppliers\n  - Financial status evaluations, pre-quality evaluations, and on-site inspections\n  - Identification and evaluation of non-financial factors (labor, human rights, environment, anti-corruption, safety, etc.)\n\n- Existing business relationships with suppliers\n  - Comprehensive evaluation (defect, failure, inspection failure, etc.) and grade assignment\n\n- Incentives for suppliers evaluated as excellent\n- Request for corrective action based on sanctions standards (in case of non-compliance, registration suspension, registration cancellation, etc.)\nEnhancing Supply Chain Sustainability\n\nSupply Chain Sustainability Assessment\n\nWe conduct technology and quality evaluation on registered producers of trusted items, in other words our core suppliers, every year in accordance with the evaluation criteria of the quality grading system for each piece of equipment. In addition, we reflect ESG factors in evaluation items, such as compliance with environmental laws and worker safety management, when conducting regular evaluations of partner companies.\n\nSupplier Sustainability Management Evaluation System\n\n| Classification | Key evaluation items |\n|----------------|----------------------|\n| Economic risk  | \u2022 Credit rating, equipment quality rating  \n|                | \u2022 Quality management system (ISO 9001) certification |\n| Environmental risk | \u2022 Violation of laws (violations of environmental regulations, etc.)  \n|                  | \u2022 Eco-friendly product certification, product production environment management |\n| Social risk     | \u2022 Violation of laws (sanctions such as anti-corruption, etc.)  \n|                | \u2022 Safety violations (lack of safety equipment, etc.) |\n\nExpansion of Eco-friendly Power Equipment Purchases\n\nWe are expanding the purchase of eco-friendly power equipment in order to achieve carbon neutrality throughout our supply chain. We established the following three primary directions: \u2018policy and institutional improvement\u2019; \u2018R&D innovation\u2019; and \u2018eco-friendly technology transition\u2019 and established a carbon-neutral procurement roadmap. Accordingly, we aim to increase the purchase amount of eco-friendly power equipment from KRW 0.4 trillion (15.8%) as of 2020 to KRW 1.2 trillion (40%) by 2030, and ultimately, reach 100% of purchases being eco-friendly by 2050. To achieve this goal, we plan to establish a preferential purchase policy, such as additional points for eco-friendly suppliers that pass qualification screening. We will also enhance cooperative R&D with a view to developing electric power equipment using eco-friendly materials, and actively promote the supply of eco-friendly equipment and materials at industrial sites.\n\nFair and Transparent Supply Chain Management\n\nWe are striving to improve our systems and processes to protect partner companies\u2019 rights and interests and establish a fair economic order. We revoke equipment supplier qualification when the supplier is found to have submitted forged or false documents in relation to big-rigging and registration. In addition, we are reviewing and amending our terms and conditions, guidelines, etc., in order to discover elements of unfairness across our company rules and regulations related to transactions with business partners. Furthermore, we became the first domestic company to introduce a reward system (up to KRW 20 million) for reporting unfair procurement practices. We also continue to make concerted and diverse efforts at increasing the transparency of contract work, such as by expanding information disclosure by prohibiting contact with retirees, operating a reporting system, and establishing an integrated management system for small-value optional bidding contracts.\n\nLogistics Work Innovation using D\u00b7N\u00b7A* Technology\n\nHere at KEPCO, we secure purchasing competitiveness by establishing a stable and sustainable logistics system and by reducing logistics costs. In particular, we are currently modernizing the Gyeongin Integrated Logistics Center, which is to integrate and build four major material centers in the Gyeongin area through the application of Industry 4.0 advanced technology. This project is expected to come into full-scale operation in 2023 and is expected to address the inefficiency in terms of innovation caused by the aging of material centers and manual warehousing and retrieval systems. Furthermore, we are strengthening the foundation for innovation in terms of low-cost and high-efficiency logistics business, such as by reducing working time and total stock, through automated robot and AI-based warehousing tasks, the standardization of material packaging standards, and the optimization of logistics flow.\n\n* Data, Network, AI\n\nKEPCO Material Center Status\n\n![KEPCO Material Center Status Diagram]\nCreation of a Win-win Development Ecosystem\n\nPromotion of Win-Win Development with Local Communities\n\nCreating the Energy Valley Ecosystem\n\nWe are promoting a project aimed at creating an Energy Valley based on win-win regional coexistence tailored to the next-generation power industry. Energy Valley refers to the Global Smart Energy Hub that revitalizes the local economy and creates high-quality jobs by attracting and accumulating energy-related companies and research institutes, in cooperation with local governments in Gwangju-Jeonnam joint innovation city and nearby areas, and that creates a new energy industry ecosystem. We attracted 501 companies as of the end of 2020 through active investment attraction activities despite the COVID-19 crisis. We were, accordingly, able to achieve an investment effect of KRW 2.1596 trillion and created 11,158 jobs. In addition, we are carrying out comprehensive activities, such as financial support using a deposit-type interest support system in order to facilitate a soft landing of companies that we try to induce to locate to Energy Valley, and priority purchase by limiting competition with regions and support for market development, etc. The Energy Valley creation project may so far have been focused on quantitative growth centered on SMEs and the supporting and fostering of companies that have relocated to Energy Valley, but the second phase of the project, from 2021, is going to be focused on achieving qualitative growth to enable many companies to make actual investments by working together with local governments and relevant organizations.\n\nPerformance of Supporting Companies who moved to Energy Valley\n\n| Classification | Details |\n|----------------|---------|\n| Financial support | \u2022 Loan interest reduction (126 companies, KRW 4.2 billion)  \n\u2022 Promising company fund investment (KRW 79.6 billion) |\n| Sales support | \u2022 Priority purchase from local companies (KRW 128 billion)  \n\u2022 Export support (6 companies, KRW 5.2 billion) |\n| Competency support | \u2022 1 company 1 item matching (patent transfer, etc.)  \n- 165 companies, increased sales by KRW 152.1 billion |\n\nDesignated as free economic zone (June 2020)\nProvision of various incentives such as special labor and management-related regulations and tax reduction\n\nDesignated as Gangso R&D special zone (August. 2020)\nIntensive cultivation of intelligent solar power, etc., by designation of the first public enterprise special R&D zone in Korea\n\nDesignated as special zone for regulatory freedom (November 2020)\nSupport for new technology verification and commercialization through innovative deregulation\n\nClassification | Details |\n|----------------|---------|\n| Overseas expansion | \u2022 Identification of ODA* tasks for companies that moved to Energy Valley  \n- 7 companies participated in 5 projects (KRW 70 billion) |\n| R&D support | \u2022 Cooperative R&D (13 companies, KRW 10.1 billion)  \n\u2022 Core technology expert consulting (34 companies) |\n| Test-bed | \u2022 Completion of open T-platform  \n\u2022 Completion of Electrical Equipment Testing and Research Institute |\n\n* ODA (Official Development Assistance)\n\nCompanies Attracted to Energy Valley\n\n| Year | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| 128 power equipment companies | 177 | 280 | 360 | 430 | 501 |\n| 134 electric power ICT companies | 26% | 27% | 28% | 29% | 30% |\n| 2 research institutes | 0.4% | 0.5% | 0.6% | 0.7% | 0.8% |\n| 237 new business companies | 47% | 48% | 49% | 50% | 51% |\n\nPhase 2 Qualitative Growth Promotion Plan\n\n- Establishment of support system based on solidarity and cooperation\n  \u2022 Role assignment and regular holding of operation meetings to revitalize Energy Valley  \n  \u2022 Establishment of a voluntary win-win cooperation system between industry, academia, and research institutes  \n  \u2022 Establishment of corporate information management system for customized support\n\n- Advancement of strategic investment attraction\n  \u2022 Establishment of a specialized area* company pool and selection of priorities for attraction  \n  \u2022 Concentrated attraction of anchor companies to build a self-sustaining value chain\n\n- Establishment of a customized corporate support system\n  \u2022 Operation of customized corporate support programs that reflect corporate needs  \n  \u2022 Establishment of an integrated platform for all-cycle corporate support  \n  \u2022 Nurturing energy experts reflecting corporate demand\n\n- Creation of a good investment environment for business\n  \u2022 Establishment of support system for production and reduction in logistics costs  \n  \u2022 Promotion of branding excellent products directly produced in Energy Valley  \n  \u2022 Optimized support of order volume by improving equipment procurement process\n\n* 6 areas of specialization: Creation and operation of new and renewable power generation complexes, eco-friendly power equipment and materials, direct current transmission and distribution, energy storage and utilization, CO2 capture and storage, hydrogen fuel cells\nDesignated as the First Public Corporation-type Gangso R&D Special Zone\n\nGangso R&D special zone is a new R&D model that fosters small-scale and high-density research complexes by designating special R&D zones centered on key technology institutions located in the region to secure momentum for the innovative growth of regional bases through science and technology. The Energy Valley has been designated as the Korea\u2019s first public corporation-type Gangso R&D special zone in August 2020, with KEPCO serving as a core technology institution. Gangso R&D special zone, via the linkage of the KEPCO New Energy Technology Research Center and KENTECH, promotes the commercialization of technologies developed by companies and institutions attracted to locate to Energy Valley, as well as intensively supporting technological start-ups such as research institution companies and companies developing state-of-the-art technology.

Accordingly, SMEs are able to enhance their product competitiveness and grow into global, small but strong companies, while we are able to lay the foundation for a stable power supply by securing excellent high-quality power at a low cost.\n\nSupport for Cooperative R&D with SMEs\n\nWe support 85% of SME research expenses, up to KRW 1.5 billion, for the R&D of new products and technologies in the transmission, substation, distribution, and ICT fields. In particular, since October 2020, 17 energy public institutions with KEPCO as the leading institution have been building and operating the Energy Technology Market platform that supports technology development and early commercialization of excellent products for SMEs in the energy sector. Through this, SMEs have been able to access R&D project competition, technology transfer, public relations, and marketing operated by each public institution on a single platform. In addition, the government, local governments, and public institutions can purchase SMEs\u2019 excellent power equipment designated as innovative products through optional contracts for three years, which supports SMEs to enter the market early.\n\nExpansion of Preferential Purchase of SME Technology Development Products\n\nWe prioritize purchasing technology development products through cooperative R&D in order to contribute to securing the initial market for SMEs and increasing sales. In 2020, we preferentially purchased KRW 413.5 billion of products developed through cooperative R&D with SMEs. In addition, we also purchased KRW 90.6 billion worth of products, 22 types of power equipment and materials, designated as innovative products through the Energy Technology Market.\n\nDiscovering and Nurturing Energy Startups\n\nWe contribute to the establishment of a start-up ecosystem in the energy sector and the spread of enthusiasm for innovative start-ups through customized start-up discovery and nurturing projects. The KEPCO Energy Startup project is a total package aimed at helping startups and it includes consulting on business model establishment and exporting products. We provide funding up to KRW 100 million for selected start-ups through the Preliminary Startup Package project, and help local start-ups by inviting young and middle-aged prospective entrepreneurs to participate in the project. In addition, we are actively encouraging employees to participate in in-house ventures in order to discover excellent ideas.\n\nEnergy Start-up Discovery/Fostering Performance *\n\n* Accumulated performance from 2017 to 2020\n\nPreferential Purchase Performance of SME Technology Development Products\n\n[As of 2020]\n\nCooperative R&D products\n\nKRW 413.5 billion\n\nProducts designated as innovative products in the energy technology market\n\n22 items, KRW 90.6 billion\nProviding Overseas Marketing Opportunities for SMEs\n\nWe supported the conclusion of export contracts by holding a non-face-to-face video export conference with buyers from Southeast Asia (July/November) and Mexico/Middle East (October/December) for SMEs facing aggravated difficulties in terms of exports due to the prolonged COVID-19 crisis. Moreover, we converted the BIXPO 2020 event, which was facing potential cancellation, into an online event and secured export contracts worth USD 32.7 million through online export consultations with overseas buyers during the event. In addition, we built an online export product hall on KOTRA \u2018buyKOREA\u2019, Korea\u2019s representative B2B site, and \u2018GobizKOREA,\u2019 the Korea SMEs and Startups Agency. We also offered opportunities to promote products by registering 220 electric power equipment products from 80 KTP certified companies and companies located in Energy Valley. Meanwhile, we established the KEPCO Export Assistance Portal in order to provide overseas buyer and market information, bidding-related information, and various statistics to efficiently support the overseas expansion of SMEs.\n\nSupporting SMEs to Explore Overseas Markets by Utilizing KEPCO Brand\n\nA KEPCO Trusted Partner (KTP) is an export promotion brand that has been certified by our company. We select excellent small and medium-sized partners with overseas export capabilities and support their overseas marketing by granting them brand use rights. We publicly recruit manufacturers with a record of successfully supplying us with goods and services related to the power sector, and construction (service) companies that have carried out construction for us within the last three years. Currently, 121 companies are pioneering overseas markets using our certified brands. We prioritize KTPs when implementing various export support projects, such as export consultations and exhibitions, and provide opportunities to promote products using our export assistance portal. Moreover, we also signed business agreements with Shinhan Bank and Hana Bank to provide financial support services in terms of exports, such as a guarantee insurance premium discount by the Korea Trade Insurance Corporation and preferential export bond purchase fees, for KTP-certified companies.\n\nKEPCO Export Assistance Portal\n\nKTP Certification Emblem\n\nBUSINESS CASE\n\nSuccessfully Hosting of BIXPO 2020\n\nWe held the 2020 Bitgaram International EXPO of Electric Power Technology (BIXPO) online for 10 days, starting on November 2. BIXPO has been held every year since 2015 with a view to observing new energy trends, promoting the exports of SMEs in the electric power and energy fields, and developing new markets. In 2020, under the theme of Energy Transition & Digital Transformation, 48,000 online visitors from 88 countries participated in the EXPO via the online platform. The event was successful in terms of exchanging the latest technology trends in the energy sector in preparation for the post-COVID-19 era, via a new technology exhibition, an online conference, and an invention patent contest, etc. In particular, 163 domestic SMEs in the electric power and energy sector participated in the online export conference, which was conducted in collaboration with KOTRA and recruited 101 buyers from 36 countries, signing contracts amounting to a total of 32.7 million dollars. The conference provided an opportunity to reopen the export routes of SMEs, whose overseas sales channels had been blocked due to the COVID-19 crisis.\nImplementation of Various Social Contribution Activities\n\nRealizing Socially Responsible Management\n\nIn order to re-establish our vision of socially responsible management and thereby fulfill our social responsibility as a global company, we enhanced our strategic system for promoting social contribution activities that had previously been implemented temporarily and sporadically. Our social contribution fund is raised through the Love Fund, which is raised through voluntary fundraising by employees every month and then matching donations provided by the company. We carry out various social contribution activities centered on the KEPCO Social Volunteer Corps, the largest such group in a public corporation, and the KEPCO 119 Disaster Relief Team, the first professional rescue group of a public corporation in Korea.\n\nSocial Contribution System\n\nPromotion Strategies\n\n| Specialized social contribution | Value-creating social contribution | Customized social contribution | Global social contribution |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Discovering and promoting social contribution models reflecting the characteristics of the electric power industry | Contributing to job creation and revitalization of the local economy through social enterprise support | Promotion of activities tailored to beneficiaries, such as employee talent donation programs | Improving the global image of corporations through overseas volunteer activities |\n\nPromotion System\n\nSocial Contribution Fund\n\n- Company donations (KRW 7.5 billion)\n- Employee \u2018Love Fund\u2019 fundraising (KRW 1.5 billion)\n- Rural Community Cooperation Fund (KRW 5 billion)\n\nKEPCO Social Volunteer Corps\n\n- 313 volunteer groups nationwide\n- Over 23,000 employees participated\n- KEPCO 119 Disaster Relief Team\n\nSocial Contribution Management System\n\n- Database of volunteer activities\n- Sharing information related to social contribution (internal)\n- Response to ESG social contribution disclosure (external)\n\nEnergy Welfare Aimed at Sharing Warmth\n\nHere at KEPCO, we operate an energy welfare support program in accordance with our belief that everyone should be able to enjoy the basic right to energy regardless of income level. We guarantee the energy welfare through various support programs, such as easing the burden of electricity bills for those vulnerable in terms of energy by providing discounts on electricity bills and suspending power cuts for households dealing with electricity bill arrears.\n\nEnergy Welfare Support Program\n\n(As of 2020)\n\n| Welfare discount on electricity bills | Highly energy-efficient equipment support | Sharing the energy of love* | Sharing briquettes of love and energy* |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Discounts on electricity rates for the vulnerable, such as those with a low-income and people with disabilities | 50% support for purchasing high-efficiency heating and cooling equipment for social welfare facilities | Support for unpaid electricity bills for vulnerable people living in rural areas during hot and cold seasons | Support for providing briquettes to those vulnerable in terms of energy, and delivery service by employees |\n| Supported KRW 585.2 billion for a total of 3.5 million households | KRW 5.3 billion support for 4,716 pieces of equipment for 79 thousand welfare facilities nationwide | KRW 800 million support for 2,000 households | Provided KRW 800 million for 860,000 briquettes for a total of 4,000 households |\n\nActivation of Social and Economic Organizations\n\nWe contribute to the vitalization of social and economic organizations by providing customized support for each business cycle, such as the start-up, growth, and maturity stages. In particular, in 2020, we secured sales channels for social and economic organizations suffering from the effects of the COVID-19 crisis by utilizing non-face-to-face online platforms such as Naver and Amazon and crowdfunding*. Furthermore, we also supported fundraising throughout the early start-up stage when it is difficult to explore and enter the market.\n\n* Crowdfunding: The act of raising funds from a large number of individuals\n\nDetails of Support for Social and Economic Organizations\n\n(As of 2020)\n\n| Domestic sales support | Overseas sales support | Funding support |\n|------------------------|------------------------|-----------------|\n| Holding online sales special exhibition in cooperation with Naver | Support to enter overseas online platforms (Amazon) | Promotion of prototypes and funding support using crowdfunding platforms (Kakao, etc.) |\n| Introduction of new services such as live commerce | Package production and consulting for overseas sales | KRW 800 million support for 67 companies |\n| KRW 600 million support for 90 companies | KRW 200 million support for 20 companies | |\n\n* Accumulated performance from 2017 to 2020\nImplementation of Social Contribution Activities Aimed at Empathizing with the Public\n\n313 of our Social Volunteer Corps conduct various activities every year nationwide, such as donating money, delivering daily necessities, and distributing briquettes to underprivileged neighbors. In particular, we strive to realize social value through voluntary talent donations by our employees, for example drone experience classes for children and music performances for children with cancer. In addition, the KEPCO 119 Disaster Relief Team contributes to disaster relief and emergency medical support for national events.\n\nMeanwhile, since 2011, we have been carrying out the Eye Love Project, which hopes to provide people with the gift of improved sight by performing eye-opening surgery for patients who are at risk of blindness both domestically and overseas. Through this project, so far we have been able to provide dreams and hopes to 1,553 people in Korea and 920 people overseas. In addition, we operate a nationwide campaign aimed at preventing the disappearance and abduction of, and other such incidents involving, children. Finally, we contribute to the enhancement of safety by attaching highly visible 112 report notification stickers via the utilization of 8-digit electric pole numbers that can accurately display the location of electric poles located in the \u2018Safe journey home\u2019 areas operated by the police.\n\nPromotion of Community-based Volunteer Activities\n\nHere at KEPCO, we run various community-based volunteer activities aimed at building a relationship centered on mutual trust with the local community. We carry out activities via our 1 department for 1 sister village project, such as helping farmers during busy periods, improving living environments, delivering lunch boxes of love, sponsoring social welfare facilities, etc., targeting 37 villages in the area our headquarters was relocated to. In addition, we are expanding the purchase of local food materials in the company cafeteria in order to participate in the revitalization of the local economy. Our executives and employees also voluntarily work together to provide masks and hand sanitizer, and other forms of assistance, to small businesses and farmers with a view to helping them overcome the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nThe good deed of the meterman Sang-gu Lee from our Seodaejeon branch gained a lot of attention in August 2021. Mr. Lee, while carrying out his duty of reading meters, heard somebody shouting for help. He ran to the voice and found an 80-year-old man who had lost consciousness and collapsed, and he was able to save his life through CPR. He helped the man regain his consciousness after performing CPR for about 10 minutes. He left immediately without leaving a contact number, stating that he had a busy day and lots of work to do. However, people who had witnessed Mr. Lee\u2019s exceptional behavior relayed what had happened to the world. In an interview, Mr. Lee said that he was able to remain calm and save someone\u2019s life on account of the CPR training that we, at KEPCO, conduct every year. As a public company that provides electricity services that are closely linked to people\u2019s lives, we provide CPR training, in collaboration with local fire stations and public health centers, in order to enable our employees to respond to emergencies. As a safety keeper of the local community, we will continue to carry out activities that protect people\u2019s lives.\nGOVERNANCE\nHere at KEPCO, we work hard to build a transparent and independent governance structure centered on checks and balances with a view to increasing shareholder value and promoting the rights and interests of our stakeholders. Our management leads the company in a responsible manner based on expert knowledge and rational decision-making, while being supervised and offered guidance by the BOD, which is composed of independent outside directors. We are also striving to build a trusting relationship with stakeholders through ethical management activities and compliance with fair trade, and by respecting the human rights of stakeholders, including our employees, throughout the entirety of our business operations. In addition, we operate a risk management system in order to identify potential risk factors in advance and make company-wide efforts to prevent crises.\nEstablishing Sound Governance\n\nComposition of the BOD\n\nKEPCO\u2019s BOD consists of 7 inside directors (standing) and 8 outside directors (non-standing), including the president. One of the outside directors is elected as the chairperson of the BOD, and the chairperson objectively supervise the activities of management and facilitates the fair and transparent operation of the BOD. In addition, we ensure that the BOD has a sufficient amount of expertise at its disposal by appointing outside directors with experience across a range of industries, which thereby enables the BOD to preemptively respond to the rapidly changing business environment through flexible and rational decision-making.\n\nIndependence of the BOD\n\nKEPCO ensures the independence of the BOD in order to enable it to faithfully perform its role of providing checks and balances. With this in mind, the roles of the BOD chairperson and the president are separate and independent. In order to reflect the varied opinions of our stakeholders in decision-making processes, and to strengthen the decision-making authority of outside directors within the BOD, we ensure that the percentage of outside directors stands at more than 50% of the total BOD members. Furthermore, when appointing directors, we conduct a strict review process ensuring that they meet the qualifications stipulated in our internal independence regulations and have no special relationship with our company.\n\nDiversity of the BOD\n\nKEPCO does not discriminate against any candidates on the basis of gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, or cultural background when appointing directors, and we secure the diversity and balance of the BOD by requesting nominations from various organizations. We appoint directors with extensive knowledge and experience in diverse fields, such as academia, economics, and labor. In 2020, we appointed a new female outside director with a view to improving the gender balance of the BOD, and we currently have two active female directors.\n\nExpertise of the BOD\n\nIn order to ensure that the BOD has enough expertise at its disposal, which is increasingly important in this rapidly changing business environment, KEPCO evaluates the expertise of each candidate in relation to their job position during the document screening process, and actively promote experts from the energy sector as candidates. Moreover, the BOD regularly inspects domestic and overseas power facilities, conducts training for directors, provides reports on industrial trends and major management issues on a regular basis, and hosts serious discussions between directors in order to enhance their understanding of the industry and improve their expertise.\n\nComposition of the BOD\n\n| Classification | Name | Gender | Field of Expertise | Experience | Tenure |\n|----------------|------|--------|--------------------|------------|--------|\n| President & CEO | Seung-Il Cheong | M | Energy / Electricity | Former Undersecretary of Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy | Jun 2021 to May 2024 |\n| Comptroller & Auditor General | YoungHo Choi | M | Public / Policy | Former Expert Member of the Presidential Committee on Balanced National Development | Nov 2020 to Nov 2022 |\n| Chief Business Management Officer | HeynBin Lee | M | Energy / Electricity | Former Head of KETECH Project Department | Sep 2020 to Sep 2022 |\n| Chief Business Operations Officer | JongHwan Lee | M | Energy / Electricity | Former Chief Technology Officer | Nov 2020 to Nov 2022 |\n| Chief Financial & Strategic Planning Officer | Heon-Gyu Park | M | Energy / Electricity | Former Chief Mutual Growth Officer | May 2021 to May 2023 |\n| Chief Power Grid Officer | TaeOk Kim | M | Energy / Electricity | Former Vice President of Gwangju-jeonnam Regional HQ | Mar 2021 to Mar 2023 |\n| Chief Global & Nuclear Business Officer | HeungJoo Lee | M | Energy / Electricity | Former Head of UAE Nuclear Project Department | Oct 2021 to Oct 2023 |\n| Chairperson of the Board, Chairperson of the ESG Committee | Si-Heon Seong | M | Industry / Technology | Former Head of the Korea Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology | Jun 2020 to Jun 2022 |\n| | Jong-Bae Park | M | Energy / Electricity | Professor, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Konkuk University | Jan 2020 to Jan 2022 |\n| ESG Committee Member | Su-Ran Bang | F | Law | Senior Advisor, Seoul Energy Corporation Attorney-at-law/Partner at Law Firm S | Sep 2020 to Aug 2022 |\n| Audit Committee Member | Hyo-Sung Park | M | Public / Policy | Former Consul General of New York at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs | Apr 2021 to Apr 2023 |\n| | Kee-Man Lee | M | Technology | Professor, Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Sunchon National University | Apr 2021 to Apr 2023 |\n| ESG Committee Member | Cheol-Ho Hwang | M | Environment / Climate | Director of the Carbon Neutral Cities Research Support Group at the Climate and Environment Center | Apr 2021 to Apr 2023 |\n| | Kye-Sung Lee | M | Public / Policy | Former Chief of Political Affairs in the Office of the Speaker of the National Assembly | Jul 2021 to Jul 2023 |\n| Chairperson of the Audit Committee | Jae-Shin Kim | F | Accounting / Finance | Certified Public Accountant at Saedure Accounting Firm | Jul 2021 to Jul 2023 |\n\n(As of 31 October 2021)\nAppointment of Directors\n\nKEPCO appoints directors in accordance with the \u2018Act on the Management of Public Institutions\u2019 and the \u2018KEPCO Articles of Incorporation.\u2019 When appointing the CEO, we nominate candidates through an open nomination process followed by recommendations from the Director Nomination Committee and the Public Agencies Operating Committee, and recommendations made at the Annual General Meeting (AGM). Finally, a request is made by the Minister of Trade, Industry, and Energy, and the CEO is appointed by the President for a three-year term. Inside directors are appointed by the CEO for a two-year term following a resolution at the AGM. The Standing Director and Member of the Audit Committee is recommended by the Director Nomination Committee, approved by the Public Agencies Operating Committee, requested by the Minister of Economy and Finance, and ultimately appointed by the President. Finally, outside directors are nominated by the Director Nomination Committee, approved by the Public Agencies Operating Committee, and appointed by the Minister of Economy and Finance, and serve a two-year term.\n\nEvaluation and Compensation of the BOD\n\nThe president of KEPCO establishes a business performance plan (three-year performance goals and action plans for performance indicators) that reflects management policy and our mid- to long-term business goals during their term of office after signing an agreement with the government (the Minister of Trade, Industry, and Energy) regarding the management goals to be achieved during their tenure. The progress of the president regarding achieving these goals is reviewed by the Performance Appraisal Board for Public Corporations. Remuneration for inside directors, including the president, must not exceed the remuneration limit approved at the AGM, and incentives are determined on an individual basis based on performance. In addition, whether to reappoint outside directors is determined based on their performance assessment results, and outside directors are provided with a service allowance in accordance with internal regulations. The details of compensation for executive and outside directors are made public through our business reports and via the ALIO (All Public Information In-One) website.\n\nBOD Compensation*\n\n(Unit : thousand won)\n\n| Classification | No. of Persons | Total Compensation | Avg. Compensation per Person |\n|----------------|----------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Standing Directors (Excluding Non-Standing Directors and Audit Committee Members) | 6 | 1,252,489 | 208,748 |\n| Non-Standing Directors (Excluding Audit Committee Members) | 6 | 180,000 | 30,000 |\n| Audit Committee Members | 2 | 60,000 | 30,000 |\n| Comptroller & Auditor General | 1 | 197,406 | 197,406 |\n\n* This reflects compensation as of 2020 and differs from the list of directors newly appointed in 2021.\n\nOperation of the BOD\n\nKEPCO holds regular BOD meeting once a month, in addition to convening special director meetings whenever necessary. The minutes of board meetings are transparently disclosed to stakeholders through the ALIO (All Public Information In-One) website. In accordance with Articles 397 and 398 of the Commercial Act, and in order to prevent conflicts of interest, our directors are not allowed to use company-related business opportunities for personal or third-party interests without the approval of the BOD. In addition, any director deemed to have a relationship of interest regarding a certain agenda item is not permitted to cast a vote on that item. We purchased the highest-tier executive indemnity insurance policy (KRW 100 billion) available in Korea in order to facilitate an independent decision-making process, and are working to increase the attendance rate of the BOD by expanding non-face-to-face infrastructure, such as video conferencing systems, in consideration of the COVID-19 crisis. In addition, through discussions on issues related to management and the operation of specialized working groups, we enable management suggestions made by directors, based on their capabilities and expertise, to be actively reflected in our policies.\n\nPerformance of the BOD\n\n| Classification | Unit | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 |\n|----------------|------|------|------|------|\n| BOD Meetings Held | Number of times | 16 | 13 | 15 |\n| Agenda Approved | Cases | 48 | 36 | 37 |\n| Amended Agendas Approved | Cases | 2 | 1 | - |\n| Agendas Reported | Cases | 10 | 8 | 11 |\n\nBOD Attendance Rate\n\n(Unit : %)\n\n| Year | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 |\n|------|------|------|------|\n| 84.0 | 94.7 | 98.6 |\n\nNon-Standing Directors Attendance Rate\n\n(Unit : %)\n\n| Year | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 |\n|------|------|------|------|\n| 80.5 | 93.9 | 97.5 |\nOperation of the Subcommittees\n\nKEPCO reinforces preliminary deliberation and discussion through the operation of three subcommittees under the BOD (the Audit Committee, the Director Nomination Committee, and the ESG Committee), while also facilitating rational decision-making by the BOD. The Audit Committee appoints non-standing accounting and finance experts and is chaired by an outside director with a view to strengthening its ability to perform checks and balances on the BOD based on expertise. The Director Nomination Committee blocks internal influence and ensures transparency in appointing executives by excluding standing directors and having the BOD select external members. In addition, in December 2020, we became the first public company in Korea to establish an ESG committee for the purpose of discussing our climate change response and our implementation of policies regarding the environment, safety, and health at the BOD level, i.e., at the level of the highest decision-making body in our company.\n\nComposition of the Subcommittees under the BOD\n\n| Committee                  | Details                                                                 | Composition (\u25cf: Chairperson) |\n|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Audit Committee            | Purpose: Auditing of accounting and business as a whole                 | [Non-Standing Directors]      |\n|                            | Roles: Conducting audits on work and accounting and reporting on the results to the BOD | Jae-Shin Kim\u25cf                 |\n|                            | \u2022 Appointment, change, dismissal, and approval of non-audit work of external auditors | Hyo-Sung Park                 |\n|                            | \u2022 Matters stipulated by other laws, the Articles of Incorporation, or regulations related to the operation of the Audit Committee | YoungHo Choi                 |\n|                            | Performance: Held 13 meetings (37 deliberations / 21 resolutions, 16 reports) |                              |\n| Director Nomination Committee | Purpose: Qualification screening and recommendation of executives (president, standing audit committee member, outside directors) | The number of members is not determined as the committee is a non-permanent organization |\n|                            | Roles: Determination, screening, and recommendation of recruitment methods for executive candidates |                              |\n|                            | \u2022 Consultation on management contract with candidates for CEO (president) |                              |\n|                            | \u2022 Other duties related to the recommendation of candidates for executive directors |                              |\n|                            | Performance: Held 7 meetings (Appointed 2 outside directors and the Comptroller & Auditor General) |                              |\n| ESG Committee              | Purpose: Strengthening the management function of the BOD on major ESG-related decision-making | [Non-Standing Directors]      |\n|                            | Roles: Deliberating on major ESG-related management issues               | Si-Heon Seong\u25cf                |\n|                            | \u2022 Advice on ESG management strategy and establishment of related business plans | Su-Ran Bang                   |\n|                            | \u2022 Checking direction of sustainability management and managing/supervising performance/problems | Cheol-Ho Hwang                |\n|                            | Performance: Held 3 meetings (7 deliberations / 3 resolutions, 4 reports) |                              |\n\n1) Audit Committee and Director Nomination Committee are based on 2020 performance, ESG Committee on September 2021 performance\n2) Held three meetings for recommending a Comptroller & Auditor General and four meetings for recommending outside directors\n## Major Resolutions of the BOD in 2020\n\n| Meeting Date       | Resolutions                                                                 |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1st meeting -

In order to promote ethical and compliance management, we continuously implement effective and substantial practical activities such as establishing related systems and infrastructure, operating an organization dedicated solely to implementing ethical and compliance management, and systematic educational and promotional activities. In particular, we are working to expand our ethical and compliance management response system for issues such as fair trade and anti-corruption and integrity, while also strengthening the link between these efforts and our ESG management strategies.\n\nEthical and Compliance Management System\n\nVision\n\nA cleaner, more transparent, fairer, and safer KEPCO\n\nStrategies\n\n| Ethics | Environmental | Social | Governance |\n|--------|---------------|--------|------------|\n| Expansion of response system | Changing attitudes and behavior | Innovating ethical system | Feedback on evaluation results |\n\nTasks\n\n- Establishment and operation of working-level council at headquarters\n- Inspection, revision, and supplementation of the Code of Ethics\n- Campaign to spread an ethical culture\n- Realizing a respectful workplace based on a healthy corporate culture\n- Full-scale implementation of the Voluntary Compliance Program (CP)\n- Continuous promotion of fair trade model\n- Sharing and disseminating performance internally and externally\n- Implementing ethical management awareness diagnosis\n\nOrganization Dedicated to Ethical and Compliance\n\nHere at KEPCO, the Legal Affairs Office oversees ethical and compliance management, while ethics and compliance leaders are selected in order to facilitate the establishment of a culture of ethical compliance and the implementation of ethical and compliance management. Meanwhile, the Audit & Inspection Office is in charge of anti-corruption and integrity activities, and, operating under the person responsible for the company-wide code of conduct, promotes anti-corruption system improvement, and education and campaigns related to integrity. Furthermore, major issues and activities concerning ethical and compliance management are reported to management through the Ethics & Compliance Committee, which is under the direct control of the CEO.\n\nActivation of Ethics & Compliance Committee\n\nKEPCO established the Ethics & Compliance Committee in 2019, and it is composed of the CEO, in the capacity of chairperson, 5 inside directors, and 3 external members. In principle, the Ethics & Compliance Committee holds one meeting in both the first and second half of the year in order to deliberate on ethical and compliance management implementation plans. It also provides advice and suggestions on issues related to ethical and compliance management. In particular, going beyond issues related to ethical and compliance management, the committee has expanded the scope of its deliberations to include ESG management, fair trade, and safety management.\n\nPerformance of Ethics & Compliance Committee\n\n| Classification | Main Agenda Items | Outcomes |\n|----------------|-------------------|----------|\n| 1st meeting in 2020 (Apr 23rd, 2020) | [Resolution] 1.

In particular, in May 2020, we partially revised the Code of Conduct and related guidelines for employees with a view to preventing acts that may impede the proper performance of duties (by contracted companies and persons, retirees etc.).\n\nSystem for Implementing the Code of Ethics\n\n| KEPCO\u2019s Charter of Ethics | Declared standards for ethical management practices (Behavioral standards and sound value judgment) (Enacted in February 1996, 6th revision in December 2019) |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Code of Conduct for employees | Standards of conduct that all employees must adhere to (Enacted in May 2003, 23rd revision in May 2020) |\n| Guidelines for employees | Specific practice standards for designated persons, guidelines concerning contract work for foreign companies (Enacted in May 2003, 7th revision in May 2020) |\n| Management regulations for executive integrity agreements | Regulations on the duty of integrity for executives (Executive directors and executive director-level department heads) (Enacted in January 2007, 3rd revision in 2010) |\n| Supplier Code of Conduct | Ethical guidelines to be followed by suppliers (Ethical, social, environmental standards) (Enacted in June 2012) |\n\nConducting Integrity & Ethics Training\n\nKEPCO continuously and repeatedly implements integrity and ethics education for all employees using real-time video training and e-learning. In addition, we provide training tailored to each job position and role, such as new employees, those who are likely to soon be promoted, and senior positions. In addition, we regularly conduct special lectures on ethical compliance for business managers with a view to inducing change in terms of the leaders awareness around such issues and enabling them to lead by example. We are also making concerted efforts, centered on ethics and compliance leaders at respective business sites and the person responsible for the company-wide code of conduct, to spread awareness in terms of ethical compliance throughout the company.\n\nIntegrity and Ethics Training\n\n| Training for All Employees | Customized Training Tailored to Job Rank, Job Type, and Job Characteristics |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| \u2022 Improving awareness regarding people with disabilities | \u2022 Ethics and compliance leadership training |\n| \u2022 Prevention of child abuse | \u2022 Workplace harassment counselor training |\n| \u2022 Prevention of sexual harassment and violence | \u2022 Sexual harassment and sexual assault grievance counselor training |\n| \u2022 Prevention of workplace harassment | \u2022 Training for employees in charge of fair trade |\n| \u2022 Conflict of Interest Prevention Act | \u2022 Integrity training for executives |\n| \u2022 Solicitation and Graft Act | \u2022 Integrity training for new employees and those to be promoted |\n| \u2022 Fair Trade Act | \u2022 Special lecture by outside experts for the Ethics & Compliance Committee |\n\nEthical Compliance Pledge & Ethical Management Awareness Assessment\n\nEach year, through the Ethical Compliance Pledge, KEPCO requires all executives and employees to pledge to comply with the Code of Ethics in order to enable them to voluntarily raise their awareness of ethical compliance. In addition, we regularly conduct surveys which seek to diagnose the level of ethical management awareness such that we may identify changes in the perceptions of employees, discover weaknesses in terms of ethical management practices, and prepare measures for improvement.\n\nInternally and Externally Spreading a Culture of Integrity and Ethics\n\nKEPCO raises awareness in terms of integrity and ethics by periodically providing news cards to all employees in order to inform them of issues related to ethics and compliance management, such as workplace harassment, sexual harassment, sexual assault, bribery, and reporting procedures. In addition, we are working hard to spread a culture of integrity and ethics that reaches local communities and external stakeholders by holding the Bitgaram Integrity Culture Festival, and publishing a casebook of successes and failures in terms of integrity management by public enterprises.\nAdvancement of Internal Control System\n\nIntroduction of the Fair Trade Voluntary Compliance Program\n\nKEPCO introduced the Fair Trade Voluntary Compliance Program (CP) in December 2020 in order to facilitate compliance with the Fair Trade Act and the fair and free-market competition order. The Fair-Trade Voluntary Compliance Program is an internal compliance system which consists of training and inspection. Companies independently establish and operate this program in accordance with the Fair-Trade Voluntary Compliance Code in order to preemptively prevent violations of laws and regulations related to fair trade. Furthermore, we are making concerted efforts to establish and spread a fair and transparent trade culture by enforcing the pledge that all employees make to fulfill their responsibilities in terms of fair trade voluntary compliance, and by establishing the Fair-Trade Voluntary Compliance Council.\n\nInternal Control System\n\nKEPCO established an internal check system in order to facilitate the implementation of ethical management. This system, structured so as to enable efficient internal checks, is largely divided into self-compliance activities for preemptive measures and internal audit activities focused on retroactive audits. Self-compliance consists of institutional systems that lay the foundations for fair trade, departmental self-checks, and internal accounting control, as well as support systems such as counseling on ethics and compliance. Characterized by professionalism and independence, internal auditing covers comprehensive audits, daily audits, and performance audits across the entirety of the various stages of work. In addition, we operate external auditing systems such as the Ombudsman, the National Auditor, the Audit Advisory Committee, and our reporting system, and we have enhanced the reliability of consolidated financial information by jointly establishing an internal accounting system in cooperation with the electric power group companies. Moreover, we are enhancing the effectiveness of anti-corruption prevention by discovering and promoting anti-corruption improvement tasks based on ISO 37001 certification for the anti-corruption management system. Following the certification of our headquarters in December 2018, we are currently promoting company-wide expansion after a trial introduction phase at various business sites such as the Chungbuk Regional Headquarters and Nambu Construction Headquarters in 2020. In addition, we are expanding preventive audit functions through the activation of a pre-consulting system and an active work immunity system for tasks which are difficult to actively administer due to differences in the interpretation of laws and regulations.\n\nOverview of Internal Control System\n\n| Voluntary Compliance | Ethics & Compliance Consultation |\n|----------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Fair trade voluntary compliance | \u2022 Leaders in practicing ethics |\n| \u2022 Introduction of the Fair Trade Voluntary Compliance Program | \u2022 Those responsible for the Code of Conduct |\n| \u2022 Voluntary inspection of unfair practices | Compliance |\n| Voluntary checking of actual business operation divisions | \u2022 In-house lawyers and law firms |\n| \u2022 Conducting self-diagnosis by utilizing ordinary audit check-list | |\n| \u2022 Conducting interim reviews of all investment projects | |\n| \u2022 Continuous review of issues identified via comprehensive audits | |\n| Strict internal accounting | |\n| \u2022 Application of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act | |\n\n| Ethics | Compliance |\n|--------|------------|\n| \u2022 Leaders in practicing ethics | \u2022 In-house lawyers and law firms |\n| \u2022 Those responsible for the Code of Conduct | |\n\n| Internal Audit | Planning | Internal Implementation | External Evaluation |\n|----------------|----------|-------------------------|---------------------|\n| Audit Vision | Establishing Infrastructure | Strengthening Expertise / Increasing Independence | Ombudsman, National Auditor |\n| Medium / Long-Term Audit Strategies | Audit Consultation Committee | Constantly Providing Advice regarding Issues related to the Audit | Reporting System |\n| Annual Audit Plan | External Deliberation Committee | Enhancing the Fairness of Audit Results | \u2022 Red Whistle, Irregularity Reporting Center, etc. |\n| | Performance Analysis | Evaluating Quality of Internal Audit | \u2022 Integrity Assessment |\n| | Internal Evaluation | Audit Satisfaction Surveys (Comprehensive and Ordinary) | \u2022 Anti-Corruption Policy Evaluation |\n| | External Evaluation | | \u2022 BAI\u2019s Evaluation |\n\n\u2022 CEO declared the introduction of the Fair Trade Voluntary CP and expressed his commitment to practicing voluntary compliance\n\u2022 All employees make the Fair Trade Voluntary Compliance Pledge (once a year)\n\u2022 Establishment of Fair Trade Voluntary Compliance Operation Guidelines and operation plan\n\u2022 Production of Voluntary Compliance Manual: Presenting types of unfair practices and voluntary compliance guidelines\n\u2022 Appointment of CP operation manager (Director of Legal Affairs Office)\n\u2022 Establishment of a dedicated organization (Legal Affairs Office) and a voluntary compliance council (12 departments related to contracts with customers and partners)\nEstablishment of Multi-channel Corruption Reporting System\n\nKEPCO supplements our internal audit system by operating various corruption reporting systems, such as internal and voluntary reporting, the irregularity reporting center, and an anonymous reporting system. Both internal and external stakeholders can use these systems for consultation and reporting. In addition, we require employees to report on external lectures such as education, discussion meetings, speeches, lectures, and contributions related to their job or requested through influence derived from their position. We make sure to appropriately punish violations of ethical and compliance management and prohibit any actions that may reveal the identity of an informant. In addition, we transparently disclose the details of corruption and misconduct, the results of disciplinary measures, and internal audits, such as general audits, through our official website.\n\nOperation Anonymous Reporting System (K-Whistle)\n\nIn 2014, KEPCO introduced Red Whistle, an externally assigned anonymous reporting system, in order to promote internal reporting on corruption and misconduct. However, since 2021, we have been operating and transitioning to the K-Whistle system. K-Whistle reinforces our security system so as to completely and fundamentally guarantee the anonymity of whistleblowers, and prevent the identity of whistleblowers and the contents of reports from being leaked by reflecting the personal information protection measures outlined by the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission. In addition, the advisory group (consisting of lawyers, professors, labor attorneys, etc.) strictly prohibits the disclosure of the identity of whistleblowers by reporting and handling irregularities on behalf of the whistleblower.\n\nCase of Irregularities Received Through Reporting Channels\n\n| Reporting channel                  | Reporting Method          | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Internal / Voluntary Report       | Online (Intranet)         | 131  | 60   | 74   |\n| Irregularity Reporting Center     | Online (External Website) | 119  | 119  | 84   |\n| Anonymous Report System (K-Whistle)| Online (External Consignment) | 87   | 3    | 3    |\n| **Total**                         |                           | 218  | 182  | 158  |\n\nTargets for K-Whistle Reporting\n\n1. Disruption of fair job performance\n2. Acts that undermine sound organizational culture\n3. Acceptance of unfair advantage\n4. Suggestions for improvement, moving stories, and employee praise\n5. Violations related to information security\n6. Other unethical conduct\n\nParticipation in the Ethical Management Compliance Program (K-CP) as a Pilot Operation Organization\n\nIn August 2021, KEPCO introduced a trial version of the ethical compliance management certification system, and signed a business agreement with the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission in order to contribute to establishing a morally upright society through the spread of a culture of ethical and compliance management. The ethical compliance management certification system is a government-level diagnosis and evaluation system that has been implemented in line with the increasing importance attached to ethical and compliance management. The certification process is carried out through screening after introducing the ethical and compliance management Voluntary Compliance Program (K-CP). The main evaluation items are the CEO\u2019s will to practice anti-corruption and efforts to respond to anti-corruption risks. The Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission has selected six organizations, including KEPCO, as pilot organizations. We are taking the lead in terms of spreading a culture of ethical and compliance management and building a fair and transparent society through participation in the certification system, preparing a system for prevention, detection, and improvement of corruption risks, and preemptive system maintenance for the stable establishment of the Conflict of Interest Prevention Act.\nSpreading a Culture of Respect for Human Rights\n\nImplementation of Human Rights Management\n\nImplementation of Human Rights Protection Policy\n\nKEPCO outlined our responsibility to respect and protect the human rights of all stakeholders, including all employees, and are doing our best to prevent human rights infringements throughout the entirety of our business activities. In August 2015, we enacted and published our Human Rights Management Declaration with the aim in mind of preventing violations of the human rights of employees and stakeholders, and practicing human rights management. Through this, we presented ten practical guidelines for the protection of human rights. In addition, the Supplier Code of Conduct, which all suppliers and subcontractors signing contracts with us must be aware of and comply with, contains requirements related to the protection of human rights, such as the prohibition of discrimination based on race, religion, sex, and physical ability. Furthermore, we have clearly laid out guidelines aimed at facilitating the respect for and protection of human rights in the form of the Code of Ethics as a guideline for human rights management, including the KEPCO Ethics Charter, Employee Code of Conduct, Guidelines for Employee Conduct, etc.\n\nCompliance with Global Human Rights Standards\n\nHere at KEPCO, we comply with International Labor Organization (ILO) regulations such as the Domestic Labor Standards Act, the Convention on the Prohibition of Child Labor, and the Convention on the Abolition of Forced Labor, and prohibit any discrimination based on gender, race, age, social status, etc. We also respect and support internationally accepted human rights and labor standards, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labor Organization (ILO) Charter, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and the UN Guidelines on Business and Human Rights. In addition, after becoming the first Korean company to join the UN Global Compact in 2005, we are actively implementing ten policies in the four areas of human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption throughout our management.\n\nSystem for Promoting Human Rights Management\n\n- Awareness and status assessment\n- Review by ESG Committee, Ethics and Compliance Committee, etc.\n- Establishment of internal and external reporting system and receipt of reports of human rights violations\n- Operation of the Grievance Deliberation Committee and the Counseling and Reporting Center\n- Conducting self-assessments using the human rights management checklist\n- The identification of improvement areas and the establishment of execution plans\n- Regular inspection of human rights management performance\n- Internal and external reports and disclosures on the official website, etc.\n\nHuman Rights Risk Management\n\nKEPCO classified human rights risks into 33 detailed items across 10 areas in accordance with the Human Rights Management Guidelines set out by the National Human Rights Commission with a view to mitigating human rights risks, in addition to regularly conducting self-diagnoses using the Human Rights Management Checklist. Furthermore, if we detect human rights violations via self-diagnosis, we conduct fieldwork and continuously monitor the results of said fieldwork.\n\nChecklist for Human Rights Management\n\n1. Establishing a human rights management system\n2. Non-discrimination in recruitment\n3. Freedom of association and bargaining\n4. Prohibiting forced labor\n5. Prohibiting child labor\n6. Ensuring industrial safety\n7. Supply chain management\n8. Protecting the human rights of local residents\n9. Guaranteeing environmental rights\n10. Protecting the human rights of customers\n\nRemedies for Human Rights Violations\n\nKEPCO systematically built and are currently operating a grievance counseling window and reporting center in order to deal with instances of human rights violations such as workplace harassment, sexual harassment, and sexual violence, as well as ethical compliance counseling. We respond to reports received through the reporting center in accordance with the outlined procedure.\n\nProcedure for Remediying Human Rights Violations\n\nReceiving Reports\n- Reporting directly to service representatives through visits, phone calls, and on-line channels\n- If it is deemed that a violation has occurred, cases can be received without a report\n\nConsultation\n- Getting an understanding of the situation and deciding how to handle the case\n- Keeping the identity of victims and consultation details confidential\n- Reporting on consultation results including details of damage incurred, any victim requests, and remedial plans\n\nInvestigation\n- Securing victim statements and evidence\n- Providing information on investigation procedures and the current situation\n- Requesting that the Audit Office launch an investigation, attaching victims\u2019 opinions\n\nConsideration by the Deliberation Committee (If necessary)\n- Deliberation on cases that occur at the Head Office / Regional Offices\n- Protecting the victim, preventing revictimization, and recommending measures to prevent recurrence\n\nConclusion\n- Monitoring to determine whether negotiated terms are being observed or not\n- Taking necessary follow-up measures (separating perpetrators and victims, preventive training for perpetrators, therapy for victims, etc.)\n- Notification of final results\n\n* In cases of grievance handling for workplace harassment, the Deliberation Committee meets before the investigation\nActive Response to Key Human Rights Issues\n\nComprehensive Measures to Prevent Workplace Harassment\n\nWorkplace bullying refers to the act of inflicting physical or mental pain on other employees or causing harm to the working environment with conduct that crosses the boundary of appropriate work behavior by taking advantage of one\u2019s seniority within the company or taking advantage of a working relationship in another way. KEPCO established prevention and response guidelines aimed at eradicating workplace harassment, expanded internal reporting and counseling systems, and are striving to spread a culture of mutual respect through continuous education and campaigns.\n\nWorkplace Harassment Prevention Activities\n\n- **Mar 2020., May 2020., July 2021.**\n  Establishment and revision of Guidelines for Prevention of and Response to Bullying in the Workplace\n  - Implementation of prevention education, handling procedures in the case of an incident, the composition of the Deliberation Committee, clarification of matters concerning victim protection\n\n- **May 2020.**\n  Production and distribution of a guidebook for identifying and responding to harassment in the workplace\n  - The guidebook consists of related laws, standards for deciding whether behavior amounts to harassment, and example cases\n  - Distribution of brochures to counselors and notification to all employees\n\n- **May 2020.**\n  Conducting a joint labor-management campaign to eradicate bullying in the workplace\n  - Designated the 11th of every month as a \u2018Mutual Respect Day\u2019 (September 2019)\n  - Emphasized, once a quarter, compliance with guidelines aimed at eradicating abuse of power and implemented a self-diagnosis system for employees\n\n- **May 2020.**\n  Planning and broadcasting in-house content on the eradication of workplace bullying\n  - Hosted free panel talks and conducted quizzes using cases in movies and tv shows\n\n- **June 2020., May 2021.**\n  Workplace harassment counselor training\n  - Guidelines for identifying instances of workplace harassment and counseling\n  - Conducting group training at the headquarters and video conference at business offices (transmission training)\n\n- **June 2020., November 2020., October 2021.**\n  Conducting a survey on employee harassment in the workplace\n  - Survey contents: workplace harassment, direct and indirect experiences, perceptions, educational effects, etc.\n\nEnhancement of Activities Aimed at Eradicating Sexual Misconduct\n\nEvery year KEPCO conducts the Pledge to Eliminate Sexual Misconduct for all executives and employees in order to prevent sexual harassment and increase awareness around issues related to sexual conduct. In addition, we expanded the number of grievance counselors at our head office from 2 to 24 (2 per division), in order to enhance our grievance counseling capabilities and out ability to respond in the case of an incident of sexual misconduct, while also making it compulsory for our grievance counselors to complete external professional training with a view to enhancing their professionalism. Along with this, we improved the remedial process by ensuring that when the Grievance Deliberation Committee needs to be formed, two or more of the members are external members, and by ensuring that at least one-third of the Disciplinary Committee Members are the same sex at the victim. Meanwhile, we published the Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence Grievance Handling Manual, which outlines the concept and types of sexual harassment and sexual violence, new sexual offenses such as digital violence, internal and external grievance handling procedures, and counseling methods. We are making concerted efforts to improve the effectiveness and accessibility of our system for dealing with sexual misconduct by distributing this manual to grievance counselors, HR development heads, and union leaders.\n\nImplementation of Human Rights Education and Campaign to Protect Human Rights\n\nIn order to spread a culture of respect for human rights, KEPCO conducts various types of online and offline human rights education, such as preventing sexual harassment and violence and eradicating workplace harassment. In particular, in consideration of the spread of COVID-19, we have replaced group education with real-time online education in order to prevent educational gaps. In addition, we are striving to create an environment for human rights protection through our campaign for promoting gender equality, and our campaign for promoting self-examination regarding the risk of abuse of power.\nPreemptive Risk Management\n\nRisk Management System Operation\n\nHere at KEPCO, we operate a risk management system that enables us to plan, organize, execute, adjust, and control resources such that we are able to quickly return to pre-risk conditions by preemptively preventing and preparing for possible risks and minimizing damage and impact through effective response and recovery when a risk occurs. In particular, we constantly check risk factors and carry out practical risk reduction activities, via departments dedicated to each risk area, in order to enhance our ability to respond to the rapidly changing business environment, while also strengthening our financial risk management process which can directly affect business activities. In addition, we hold regular management meetings and business strategy meetings hosted by management with a view to sharing results regarding the internal and external business environments and risk inspection by sector. Through this, relevant departments work together to come up with a joint response plan for critical risks that individual departments would be incapable of resolving on their own.\n\nClassification of Risks by Type\n\nIn the face of constant crises on account of the diversification of the economic, social, and environmental risk types and complex domestic and international problems, KEPCO is enhancing the effectiveness of our risk management by designating departments to be in charge of each type of risk in order to enable us to respond to the rapidly changing business environment in a timely manner. We established our own crisis management work guidelines in order to establish a risk management system and outlined matters necessary for risk management activities. In addition, we carry out risk mitigation activities by conducting periodic self-diagnosis in six risk areas (management, public relations, conflict, terrorism, health, and disaster) under the supervision of the Safety and Health Department. Moreover, we established and are currently operating a crisis management portal with a view to efficiently promoting risk management and securing business continuity, and we are striving to acquire the ability to quickly respond to major risks that may arise, such as by producing a crisis management manual.\n\nRisk Management Areas\n\n| Risk Type | Management | Conflict | Health | Terror | PR |\n|-----------|------------|----------|--------|--------|----|\n| Crisis type, derivation of threat factors, monitoring, identification, and dissemination of crisis signs | Deterioration of annual profit and loss due to fluctuations in interest rates, stock prices, exchange rates, liquidity, etc. | Complaints related to transmission and substation facilities | Infection of employees due to epidemics | Damage to human life and power facilities due to the occurrence of facility terrorism | Damage to company image due to the occurrence of negative incidents related to employees |\n| Prevention | Prior removal of risk factors by type, problem solving | Power supply failure due to social factors | | Power industry crisis due to inaccurate reporting |\n| Preparation | Establishing countermeasures for a crisis scenario, securing input resources in case of crisis, inspection of general level of preparedness, pre-education and training | | | |\n| Response | Rapid operation of emergency countermeasures, operation of emergency response and mutual-assistance system, implementation of internal and external publicity | | | |\nStrengthening of Risk Governance\n\nKEPCO established a company-wide risk management system in order to identify and manage various types of risks. The vice president of Business Support, an executive in the risk management department, coordinates company-wide risk management tasks as the Chief Risk Officer (CRO). In addition, the departments in charge of each individual risk type identify signs of risks or the presence of risks, promptly report on these risks in accordance with the organizational system and procedures, and implement countermeasures. In line with diversified risk factors brought about by changes in the business environment and the nature and scale of business, the dedicated departments define risks that have the potential to affect business activities in the long term as emerging risks, and carry out risk management through organic collaboration with other relevant departments.\n\nWe also independently operate a Risk Deliberation Committee for each field composed of internal and external experts, an external auditor (Hanyoung Accounting Corporation), and an audit committee operating under the BOD. Furthermore, we established an independent head office audit organization via the establishment of an internal audit organization under the direct control of the Audit Committee. We carry out our risk inspection process via a reinforced internal control system by installing our own auditing bodies at 15 regional headquarters, 3 construction headquarters, and 7 special business offices across the country. At least half of the members of the Risk Deliberation Committee must be outside members in order to ensure its independence. In the case of financial risks, an independent external auditor periodically verifies and evaluates the financial statements and internal accounting management system and discloses the results of these evaluations. Moreover, in December 2020, we established the ESG committee composed of only outside directors. The ESG Committee operates under the BOD and deliberates on environmental, social, and non-financial risks, including governance, at the board level. Going forward, in order to expand our company-wide risk management capabilities, we will continue our concerted and diverse efforts to improve our approach to governance.\n\nRisk Management Organization\n\nRisk Monitoring Process\n\n- **Risk Factor Monitoring**: Constant monitoring through the crisis management system\n- **Risk Factor Impact Analysis**: Impact analysis by the department in charge of each risk factor\n- **Determining the Level of Risk Response**: When a risk factor occurs, the relevant committee is convened and a decision is made\n- **Response Scenario Operation**: Immediate response by the relevant department\n## Financial Performance\n\n### Consolidated Statement of Financial Position\n\n(Unit: KRW 1 Million)\n\n| Assets | The 60th | The 59th | The 58th

The organization is enabling stakeholder\u2019s participation in establishing an organization\u2019s material sustainability topics, and the developing strategic countermeasures.\n\n\u2022 Materiality\nKEPCO have conducted the materiality assessment to prepare the Report. \u2018Business impact\u2019 such as peer review, international standards, internal strategy and \u2018stakeholder interest\u2019 are considered during the materiality assessment, issue pools were used on internal and external stakeholder survey to rate the material topics and 10 material topics are prioritized accordingly. We have not found any material topics left out in the process.\n\n\u2022 Responsiveness\nKEPCO has established a communication process with stakeholders to respond to the needs, interests, and expectations of stakeholders that affect sustainability performance. We did not find anything to suggest that data and information disclosed in the Report do not give a fair representation of KEPCO\u2019 actions.\n\n\u2022 Impact\nKEPCO identifies and monitors the direct and indirect impacts of material topics of stakeholders, and reporting them to the extent possible.\n\nRecommendation for Improvement\n\nWe recommend KEPCO to entail more diverse stakeholder groups to take into account their interests in a timely manner.\nGreenhouse Gas Assurance Statement\n\nIntroduction\nKorea Electric Power Corporation implements annual MRV based on standards including ISO 14064 to comply with the GHG reduction target of Kyoto protocol.

(\"DNV\") was commissioned by Korea Electric Power Corporation (\"KEPCO\") to verify the Greenhouse Gas Inventory for the calendar year 2020 (\"the report\") based upon a limited level of assurance. KEPCO is responsible for the preparation of the GHG emissions data on the basis set out within the WRI/WBCSD\u2019s \"Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard\" and the principles set out in ISO 14064-1:2018. Our responsibility in performing this work is to the management of KEPCO only and in accordance with terms of reference agreed with them. DNV expressly disclaims any liability or responsibility for any decisions, whether investment or otherwise, based upon this assurance statement.\n\nScope of Assurance\nThe emissions data covered by our examination are for the Other indirect emissions (Scope 3 emissions):\n\u2022 Reporting boundary : KEPCO\u2019s Other indirect emissions (Scope 3) which are not included in the Direct emissions (Scope 1) and Indirect emissions (Scope 2)\n\u2022 Reporting categories :\n  - Upstream scope : Purchased goods & services, Capital goods, Fuel- and energy-related activities, Transportation & distribution, Waste generated in operations, Business travel, Employee commuting\n  - Downstream scope : Investments\n\nVerification Approach\nThe verification has been conducted by DNV in July 2021 and performed in accordance with the verification principles and tasks outlined in ISO 14064-3:2019. We planned and performed our work so as to obtain all the information and explanations deemed necessary to provide us with sufficient evidence to provide a verification opinion, concerning the reported emission figures in ton CO\u2082 equivalent. As part of the verification process:\n\u2022 We have reviewed and verified the Greenhouse Gas Inventory Tool (Excel based)\n\u2022 We have reviewed and verified the process to generate, aggregate and report the emissions data\n\nConclusions\nBased on the above verification of core elements, it is the DNV\u2019s opinion that nothing comes to our attention to suggest that GHG emissions are not properly calculated, and a significant uncertainty and error are included in the Other indirect Emissions of KEPCO for the year 2020 below.\n\nOther Indirect Emissions (Scope 3) of KEPCO for Year 2020\n\n| Other Indirect Emissions (Scope 3) | Emissions from Upstream | Emissions from Downstream | Total emissions
