You can read the full details of how in our fourth Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) Report published today. But we wanted to highlight three areas upfront:\n\nFirst, the environment: The next decade is critical if we\u2019re to manage climate change sustainably. It\u2019s why Netflix has committed to halving our emissions by 2030. We will do this by optimizing our energy use, then electrifying it and decarbonizing the rest.\n\nSecond, inclusion: Netflix is becoming more representative of the members we serve. We now have offices in over 25 countries. Almost half of our employees are women and, in the US, 50% are from historically excluded ethnic and/or racial backgrounds. We\u2019re also seeing increased representation on and off screen \u2014 with significantly more female directors and showrunners, and more people of color in leading roles.\n\nThird, governance: Our business model is well proven and Netflix is a leader in streaming entertainment in terms of engagement, revenue and profit. So we\u2019re evolving to a more standard large-cap governance structure, including the phased declassification of our board, the elimination of supermajority voting provisions and changes to our executive compensation program from 2023 onwards.\n\nOver the last 25 years, we\u2019ve worked hard to create long term value for our stakeholders \u2014 in particular members, shareholders and the creative community. While we\u2019ve made good progress, there\u2019s still more to do. For example, most of our carbon emissions come from our productions, which require a lot of power \u2014 often in remote locations \u2014 and are still heavily fossil fuel dependent. But we\u2019re investing in the technology innovations today that can optimize and electrify this energy use tomorrow.\n\nWe are excited about the great entertainment coming this year \u2014 from returning favorites like our Emmy award winning series The Crown and recently released hit action sequel Extraction 2, starring Chris Hemsworth, to must-watch new films and TV shows such as Heart of Stone, Rebel Moon, Griselda and 3 Body Problem. Our north stars remain the variety and quality of our entertainment \u2014 and, as always, we welcome your feedback.\n\nTed Sarandos\nco-Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company and Director\n\nGreg Peters\nco-Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company and Director\nAbout Netflix\n\nAt Netflix, we aspire to entertain the world \u2014 so whatever your taste, and wherever you live, we\u2019ll have something great to watch or play, all in one subscription.\n\n1 As of December 31, 2022, 2022 Annual Report (Form 10-K)\nOur Approach to ESG\n\nOur Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) framework is informed by relevant reporting frameworks \u2014 including Sustainability Accounting Standard Board (SASB), Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\nThe Netflix Board of Directors oversees the Company\u2019s ESG efforts and receives regular updates from management in these areas. For this report, we focus on the following topics: Environment, Social and Governance.\nOur Progress\nSee below for a glimpse, or \u201chighlights reel\u201d, of our continued progress in 2022 on environmental, social and governance topics.\u00b2\n\nEnvironment\n\nWe are on track to meet our public sustainability commitments \u2014 including to: (1) halve our emissions by 2030 from a 2019 baseline; and (2) bring our remaining net emissions from 2022 onwards to zero.\n\n- We upgraded our Scope 3 target to reduce these emissions 55% per million USD of value added\u00b3 by 2030.\n- Starting in 2022, we\u2019ve brought net Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions to zero by investing in nature-based solutions that retain and capture carbon.\n\nWe continue to focus on decarbonizing film and series production. Over the course of 2022:\n\n- We\u2019ve used clean technologies on over 60% of the productions Netflix manages directly; and\n- We\u2019ve committed to use at least one electric vehicle (EV) on screen in all of our directly managed productions, and our \u201cEverybody In\u201d partnership with GM will also help promote their use.\n\nWe support creators who choose to incorporate sustainability into their storytelling. 165 million households around the world \u2014 over 70% of our members \u2014 have chosen to watch one or more stories highlighting climate and/or sustainability. And we spotlight these stories during moments like Earth Month.\n\n\u00b2 All data points are for the 2022 calendar year unless otherwise noted.\n\u00b3 Value Added\u201d is a term used by SBTi. For Netflix, this is synonymous with \u201cGross Profit,\u201d derived from subtracting \u201cCost of Revenues\u201d from \u201cTotal Revenue\u201d for the business, per our public financial statements.\nOur Progress\nSee below for a glimpse, or \u201chighlights reel\u201d, of our continued progress in 2022 on environmental, social and governance topics.\n\nSocial\n\nAs our third Inclusion Report showed:\n\n- Women have the highest gender representation at Netflix; and\n- Over 50% of our US employees are from one or more historically excluded ethnic and/or racial backgrounds.\n\nIn April 2023, the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative published their latest study into representation behind and in front of the camera for Netflix\u2019s US films and series. It showed notable improvements for women and people from historically underrepresented racial and ethnic groups between 2020 and 2021.\n\nIn addition, we continue to invest in the Netflix Fund for Creative Equity, which helps increase opportunities within the entertainment industry.\n\nOur employee giving program provides a 2:1 match on employee donations. In 2022, Netflix and our employees donated $34 million to over 5,000 charities worldwide.\n\nWe have now added disclosures about product accessibility to our ESG Report given the importance of ensuring that all of our members \u2014 regardless of language, device, connectivity or ability \u2014 can enjoy our entertainment.\n\n---\n\n4 More information about how the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative defines this term is available in their full report about the study.\nOur Progress\nSee below for a glimpse, or \u201chighlights reel\u201d, of our continued progress in 2022 on environmental, social and governance topics.\n\nGovernance\n\nAt our 2022 annual meeting, stockholders approved a board proposal to make significant changes to our corporate governance, including:\n\n- A phased declassification of our board beginning in 2023. From 2025, our entire board will stand for annual elections;\n- The elimination of supermajority voting provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws; and\n- The ability for shareholders to call special meetings.\n\nWe\u2019ve also adopted a majority voting standard in uncontested director elections and evolved our co-CEO compensation program for 2023. This includes: a CEO salary cap; performance-based annual cash bonus; and a minimum 50% of compensation allocated to stock options with one year vesting.\n\nIn the last year, Netflix executives have met shareholders representing around 51% of our outstanding shares to solicit their feedback. Independent directors participated in a majority of these meetings.\nEnvironment\n\nTo entertain the world, we need a habitable planet to entertain. We\u2019re working to make our operations more sustainable, including behind the camera, and to support creators who want to highlight sustainability on screen.\nSustainability Strategy\n\nKey is decarbonizing our operations and value chain, which includes the making of our films and series. To help us meet this challenge, we created an advisory group, including scientists and other experts. This group is unpaid and entirely independent (full list available at sustainability.netflix.com).\n\nOur Public Climate Targets\n\nThe science is clear \u2014 the next decade is critical if we are to manage climate change sustainably. In March of 2021, we set two near-term climate targets aligned with consensus climate science that can be measured in years, not decades:\n\n01 Reduce our emissions by roughly half by 2030; and\n\n02 Bring our remaining net emissions from 2022 onwards to zero, in support of global net zero goals, by investing in nature-based solutions that retain and capture carbon.\n\nWhen we first set our emissions targets, we aligned to the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) standard for Scope 3 \u201csupplier engagement\u201d targets. After working to improve our Scope 3 data, we submitted an upgraded quantitative \u201cintensity\u201d target aligned to current SBTi standards for validation in 2022. The new target, which has now been approved by the SBTi, is to reduce Scope 3 emissions 55% per million USD of value added by 2030.\n\n---\n\n5 Netflix previously had a science-based target to engage 70% of suppliers to set their own science-based targets.\n\n6 Netflix\u2019s Intensity Scope 3 target was approved by SBTi on Feb 27, 2023 (see \u201cCompanies Taking Action\u201d on the SBTi website). Our validated Scope 1 and 2 target remains unchanged from 2021.\n\n7 \u201cValue Added\u201d is a term used by SBTi. For Netflix, this is synonymous with \u201cGross Profit,\u201d derived from subtracting \u201cCost of Revenues\u201d from \u201cTotal Revenue\u201d for the business, per our public financial statements.\n## Decarbonization Target\n\n### NETFLIX EMISSION REDUCTION ACTIONS\n\n| Scope 1 | Scope 2 | Scope 3 |\n|---------|---------|---------|\n| **\u201cFuel\u201d**<sup>8</sup> | **\u201cElectricity\u201d**<sup>9</sup> | **\u201cValue Chain\u201d**<sup>10</sup> |\n| Energy Efficiency | Energy Efficiency | Demand Signaling |\n| Electric Vehicles | Renewable Energy | Technology Accelerators |\n| Clean Mobile Power | Supplier Incentives | Educational Offerings |\n\n### TARGET\n\n| | 46% by 2030 absolute reduction | 55% by 2030 intensity reduction (million $ value added) |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Our \u201cSphere of Control\u201d** | **Absolute Reduction Goal** | **Intensity Reduction Goal** |\n\n### TERMINOLOGY\n\n- **Absolute Reduction Goal**\n- **Intensity Reduction Goal**\n\n---\n\n<sup>8</sup> Scope 1: fuel consumed for our self managed productions, company-owned transportation and building heating\n\n<sup>9</sup> Scope 2: electricity we purchase for our Open Connect systems and in our facilities and self-managed productions\n\n<sup>10</sup> Scope 3: emissions related to value chain activities such as purchased goods & services, capital goods, business travel and others\nAlignment with ISO Net Zero Guidelines\n\nOur sustainability strategy is aligned with the ISO Net Zero Guidelines (IWA 42:2022) developed by the International Organization for Standardization, which recently published a testimonial about Netflix. These guidelines, which are designed to be universally applicable, were developed with input from over 1,200 global experts from 100+ countries, and among other criteria, require:\n\n01 **Emissions Reduction**: Taking immediate action to maintain the climate at 1.5 degree celsius \u2014 i.e., approximately halving global emissions by the end of the decade and achieving global net zero by 2050 at the latest.\n\n02 **Counterbalancing Residual Emissions**: Investing in nature-based solutions that retain and capture carbon from the atmosphere, proportional to a company\u2019s \u201cresidual\u201d emissions. Learn more about how we are aligned in our carbon credit investments here.\n\n03 **Wider Impact**: Engage value chain stakeholders, collaborate and share knowledge, and participate in relevant advocacy on behalf of bringing global emissions to zero and promoting a just transition. Learn more about how we are aligned on the broader societal impact here.\n\nNetflix\u2019s Sustainability Strategy is music to our ears. We are delighted to see Netflix apply the same positive disruption to sustainability that they\u2019ve applied to their business, upping the ambition for achieving near-term net zero targets and harnessing the power of storytelling to educate and entertain citizens.\n\nChristiana Figueres,\nDiplomat and Architect of the U.N. Paris Agreement\n\nThe Carbon Trust, a respected think tank, found these ISO Net Zero Guidelines to be the most comprehensively aligned to the goals of COP27.\n\n---\n\n11 Including participants from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, SBTi, UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and UN Race to Zero teams.\n\n12 We are working with ISO to ensure understanding this element of their guidelines because of the limited volume of high quality carbon removal credits available today, and the IPCC\u2019s latest report shows that the mitigation options with the greatest potential global contribution to net emission reduction by 2030 are \u201cavoidance\u201d projects.\n\n13 The ISO Net Zero Guidelines define residual emissions as: Emissions that remain on an annual basis after all efforts to reduce along a 1.5 \u00b0C pathway within value-chain or boundary emissions have been implemented.\nSustainability in Our Operations and Value Chain\n\nClimate Transition Plan\n\nTo meet these objectives we are focused on four key levers:\n\n- **Energy Efficiency**: Identifying cost-effective efficiency improvements for energy used in our offices and studios;\n- **Vehicle Electrification**: Transitioning from vehicles that use fossil fuels to fully electric and/or hydrogen powered alternatives;\n- **Clean Mobile Power**: Using alternatives to diesel generators on productions; and\n- **Renewable Energy**: Using renewable electricity and fuels.\n\nWe approach these four levers using an OED framework \u2014 i.e., first optimizing energy use, then electrifying it and decarbonizing the rest.\n\n- **Optimize (O)**: We are conducting energy efficiency audits, including for our stages, studios and offices, so we can optimize vehicle fleet operations, right-size vehicles and mobile power and give preference to more efficient equipment.\n\n- **Electrify (E)**: We are working to electrify the equipment that uses the most fuel, like vehicles, buildings and generators. Where available, we use electric motors, which are more efficient and because electricity is more easily decarbonized. We\u2019ve successfully piloted the use of mobile batteries and hydrogen-battery powered generators in lieu of fossil-fuel powered generators in our productions. And we are also replacing fossil-fuel vehicles with electric, plug-in hybrid and hybrid vehicles.\n\n- **Decarbonize (D)**: When optimization and electrification aren\u2019t possible, we decarbonize the remaining emissions by installing and purchasing renewable energy. This means matching renewable electricity to any grid-connected power that isn\u2019t carbon-free and shifting to lower-carbon or zero-carbon fuel options when that isn\u2019t possible. Last year, we procured renewable electricity to match our global electricity demand and we\u2019re exploring more direct investments.\nMaximizing the solutions available today, while accelerating the market for tomorrow\u2019s solutions, is also imperative. While energy efficiency and renewable energy solutions are cost-effective and can be deployed at scale now, clean mobile power and EVs are more nascent technologies. As a result they will deliver most of their respective emissions reductions for Netflix in the latter half of this decade. Refer to the Energy Efficiency, Renewable Energy and Clean Mobile Power sections below. Each year, we continually develop and further refine our 2030 Science-Based Target transition strategy. The following chart illustrates our current planned path to our Scope 1 and 2 target, and the decarbonization levers that will get us there.\nOur Carbon Footprint\n\nWe measured our 2022 greenhouse gas emissions (i.e., carbon footprint) using the Greenhouse Gas Protocol\\textsuperscript{14}. This helps us understand our largest sources of emissions and the biggest opportunities we have to reduce them. Our independent accountants, Ernst & Young (EY), reviewed our 2022 Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions (location- and market-based). Their report and assurance letter is here.\n\nOur footprint, reductions and related data are represented in four separate tables throughout the environment section of this report:\n\n01 Greenhouse Gas Inventory including our corporate greenhouse gas data from 2019 through 2022.\n\n02 2022 Emission Reductions Summary Table shows our quantified reductions from the range of measures we have put in place to track progress towards our science-based target.\n\n03 2022 Carbon Credit Portfolio shows the carbon credits we purchased and retired for 2022.\n\n04 2022 Electricity Consumption Summary shows our electricity consumption and renewable electricity.\n\n\\textsuperscript{14} Refer to the appendix for details about our greenhouse gas emissions inventory methodology, footprint boundaries and data management process.\n## GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\n\n| Scope          | 2019 MTCO2e | 2020 MTCO2e | 2021 MTCO2e | 2022 MTCO2e |\n|----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| **Scope 1**    |             |             |             |             |\n| **Scope 2**    |             |             |             |             |\n| (market-based) | 565         | 141         | 0           | 0           |\n| (location-based)| 26,594      | 28,585      | 42,291      | 41,411      |\n| (target-based) | 26,317      | 29,356      | 31,937      | 23,622      |\n| **Scope 1+2**  |             |             |             |             |\n| (market-based) | 52,052      | 31,024      | 62,815      | 59,388      |\n| (target-based) | 77,804      | 60,239      | 94,752      | 83,010      |\n| **Scope 3**    |             |             |             |             |\n| (market-based) | 1,192,659   | 1,020,541   | 1,466,497   | 1,086,833   |\n| **Total**      |             |             |             |             |\n| (market-based) | 1,244,711   | 1,051,564   | 1,529,312   | 1,146,221   |\n\n### Carbon Credits\n\n|                | 2019 MTCO2e | 2020 MTCO2e | 2021 MTCO2e | 2022 MTCO2e |\n|----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| **Carbon Credits** | (35,506)    | (54,107)    | (1,529,312) | (1,146,221) |\n\n### Biogenic Emissions\n\n- **Renewable Fuels** (e.g., renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel)\n  - 2019 MTCO2e: 0\n  - 2020 MTCO2e: 0\n  - 2021 MTCO2e: 1,007\n  - 2022 MTCO2e: 2,033\nOver half of our emissions (all scopes) are related to the production and licensing of films, series and games (\"production\"). The second largest source of emissions is in our corporate operations (\"corporate\"), followed by our data center providers (\"streaming\").\n\n**CARBON FOOTPRINT COMPONENTS**\n\nWe track progress against our Scope 1 and 2 emissions target using target-based emissions figures noted in the carbon footprint table above. Target-based emissions only account for emissions reductions resulting from specific decarbonization actions and those related to direct renewable energy supply (e.g., onsite generation, utility and landlord supply, power purchase agreements or direct investments), but not for emissions reductions resulting from our annual purchase of renewable energy certificates (or environmental attribute certificates).\n\n- **2022 Scope 1 and 2 emissions are 12% lower** year-over-year, though they remain slightly higher than our 2019 baseline year due to growth in the business.\n- The combined impact of our emissions reductions initiatives across our four priority levers in 2022 resulted in a **30% lower** Scope 1 and 2 footprint value than would have otherwise been reported.\n- The vast majority of our emission reductions still come from renewable energy and renewable fuels. Transitioning from diesel to electric will take time to scale to a level that will have a measurable impact on emissions reductions.\n\n---\n\n15 In addition to emissions reductions from our decarbonization efforts, external factors also influence the calculated emissions total, including data improvements (e.g., improved data quality, updated emissions factors) and changes in core business activities from year to year (e.g., number of self-managed vs. partner-managed productions which can shift the emissions representation between Scopes).\n### 2022 SCOPE 1 AND 2 EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS TABLE\n\n| Emission Reduction Levers | Sub-Lever                                      | Emissions Reduced and Avoided (MT CO2e) |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n|                           |                                                | 2021 | 2022 |\n| **Energy Efficiency**     | Equipment & Controls Improvements              | 0    | 162  |\n|                           | Right-Sizing Diesel Generators                 | 0    | 51   |\n| **Renewable Energy**      | Utility-Supplied Renewable Energy              | 3,869| 9,452|\n|                           | Landlord-Supplied Renewable Energy             | 3,612| 5,705|\n|                           | Streaming Partners Renewable Energy            | 5,702| 6,764|\n|                           | Sustainable Aviation Fuel                      | 174  | 295  |\n|                           | Renewable Diesel                               | 717  | 1,738|\n| **Electric (and other low-carbon) Vehicles** | Electric Vehicles                              | 10   | 75   |\n|                           | Plug-in Hybrid                                 | 7    | 52   |\n|                           | Hybrid Vehicles                                | 12   | 31   |\n| **Clean Mobile Power**    | Hybrid Systems                                 | 0    | 4    |\n|                           | Grid Tie-In                                    | 0    | 967  |\n|                           | Batteries                                      | 85   | 127  |\n|                           | Hydrogen Systems                               | 22   | 81   |\n| **Total**                 |                                                | 14,210| 25,504|\n\n---\n\n16 There is no reporting guidance from the SBTi on tracking progress towards science-based targets on an annual basis, so we use standard greenhouse gas accounting methodologies per the Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard by The Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Our Internal Audit team validates our greenhouse gas accounting methodologies and we engage EY to perform limited assurance over our greenhouse gas emissions.\nReducing Emissions in the Workplace\n\nENERGY EFFICIENCY\n\nIn 2022, we completed energy efficiency audits at our major facilities across North America. Except for Albuquerque Studios in New Mexico and the Egyptian Theater in Los Angeles, Netflix does not own the facilities in which we operate. This makes the immediate implementation of the audit recommendations more challenging. So we engaged with our landlords in the US and have begun to implement projects within our control at several of our offices and studios including: window replacements, temperature setbacks, lighting improvements and controls, heat pump installs, plug load controls, daylight sensor installs and equipment upgrades. We will replicate this approach across priority facilities in EMEA in 2023.\n\nRENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY AND FUELS)\n\nIn 2022, as in previous years, we have matched our global operations with 100% renewable electricity, covering all electricity consumption in our offices and for productions we directly manage. This was achieved through a range of approaches that include utility-supplied clean electricity, landlord-supplied clean electricity, and renewable energy certificates (RECs).\n\n2022 Electricity Consumption Summary Table\n\n| SCOPE                  | METRIC                  | 2020     | 2021     | 2022     |\n|------------------------|-------------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Hardware Infrastructure| Electricity consumed (MWh) | 26,196   | 33,407   | 36,110   |\n|                        | Percentage grid electricity | 100%     | 100%     | 100%     |\n|                        | Percentage renewable    | 100%     | 100%     | 100%     |\n| Remaining Electricity  | Electricity consumed (MWh) | 68,089   | 123,148  | 120,857  |\n|                        | Percentage grid electricity | 100%     | 100%     | 100%     |\n|                        | Percentage renewable    | 100%     | 100%     | 100%     |\n| Total Electricity      | Total electricity consumed (MWh) | 94,285   | 156,555  | 156,967  |\n\nWe recognize that not all renewable energy supply is the same in terms of its positive impact. So we\u2019re working to increase the proportion of onsite generation, utility and landlord-supplied clean electricity and direct sourcing from offsite projects.\nThis year we partnered with Powertrust to bring high-impact distributed renewable energy projects to rural areas of India for the first time. This work is funded through distributed renewable energy certificates (D-RECs), a market instrument aligned to the International REC (I-REC) standard. These investments bring renewable energy to regions where it is needed most, thereby delivering maximal social and environmental benefits. Many of the projects we have invested in are bringing electricity to communities, and enabling others to rely less on small-scale fossil fuel generators.\n\n**POWERTRUST PARTNERSHIP**\n\n**Mon, Nagaland:** This project has connected three villages in the state of Nagaland to solar mini-grids. These villages are the first demonstration sites of a larger plan to connect 40 villages across the province over the next three years.\n\n**Dr. Shroff\u2019s Charity Eye Hospital, Uttar Pradesh:** This organization operates multiple centers for high-quality, low-cost eye care serving the rural poor and low-income communities across India. The combined network sees more than 250,000 patients and performs nearly 30,000 surgeries every year. This branch in Uttar Pradesh experienced daily power cuts lasting multiple hours, and relied on diesel generators to provide backup power. Now, a photovoltaic system reduces diesel consumption by up to 70%.\n\n**Vellore Institute of Technology, Andhra Pradesh:** The institute is a higher educational facility in Andhra Pradesh. A 700kWp rooftop system now spreads across several buildings on the institute\u2019s campus, including several student accommodation and service buildings.\n\n**Solar Irrigation Pumps, Uttar Pradesh:** \u201cIrrigation-as-a-Service\u201d enables farmers to transition from diesel-based pumping to solar irrigation. The tariffs are set to be 20-40% cheaper than the running cost of diesel groundwater pumping (including fuel, maintenance, and rental), and users only pay for the volume of water consumed for irrigation.\nReducing Emissions in the Workplace (continued)\n\nRENEWABLE FUELS\n\nWe strive to implement zero-emissions solutions where we can. But we can also achieve meaningful reductions in the near-term through the adoption of renewable fuels that have significantly lower emissions than conventional fuels such as diesel and Jet-A. In select markets, we fueled both production vehicles and mobile generators with over 185,000 gallons of renewable diesel, an important bridge fuel as we work towards longer-term decarbonization of these activities. Similarly, we have secured over 100,000 gallons of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (a Jet-A fuel replacement blended fuel with lower emissions) to help fuel Netflix aircraft.\n\nReducing Emissions in Productions\n\nProduction-related emissions account for 60% of our overall footprint, so we are focusing our efforts on: (1) using clean mobile power equipment versus diesel generators; and (2) using EVs and other low emissions vehicles. Over the course of 2022 we implemented these clean technologies on over 60% of the productions Netflix manages.\n\nWe employ sustainability experts who regularly visit production sites to identify opportunities to reduce emissions and we maintain a production resources website that contains tools and resources to introduce our productions to the latest clean technologies. This video showcases some of these technologies operating on multiple Netflix sets and partner locations, together with testimonials from crew and producers about their experience:\nCLEAN MOBILE POWER\n\nUsing diesel generators has been an entertainment industry standard for a long time and effective cleaner alternatives have not been available at scale. Cleantech solutions are starting to emerge and they can replace some generators, or at least reduce the number of hours they need to run each day \u2014 saving fuel and reducing air and noise pollution on set.\n\nIn the past year, over 50% of the productions Netflix manages incorporated clean mobile power solutions including grid tie-ins, mobile batteries, battery-hybrid generators, and hydrogen power units, resulting in fuel reductions that lowered emissions by 1,179 MTCO2e. This included the deployment of over 100 pieces of clean mobile power equipment and battery-hybrid generators deployed for the first time. Netflix also expanded the geographic reach of these solutions, deploying solutions in and around Atlanta, Austin, Dublin, Lisbon, London, Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Toronto and Vancouver. Here are a few examples of clean mobile power in our 2022 productions.\n\nClean Mobile Power Spotlights:\n\n**Batteries:** Virgin River Season 5 built on their experience from Season 4 to expand their use of batteries to power set and ancillary power needs, reducing the season\u2019s diesel generator fuel use by 44%. The Union, filmed around London, leveraged batteries to power the set and lighting, resulting in generators only being needed for 5% of filming hours, saving over 1,800 gallons of fuel.\n\n**Hydrogen Power Units (HPUs):** Hydrogen Power Units using green hydrogen were deployed on UK productions that required supplemental power at studios or long term locations. For the filming of Damsel, two large hydrogen power units were used to provide supplemental power at a studio, replacing diesel generators, saving over 4,200 gallons of fuel and reducing emissions by 44 MTCO2e. The Diplomat Season 1 employed equipment to bring clean power to a rural location in the English countryside. We partnered with a local production equipment supplier to conduct the first mobile hydrogen pilot in France on Lupin Part 3, while filming on location outside of Paris.\n\n**Hybrid Generators:** Bodkin Season 1 was the first ever production in Ireland to use a hybrid generator and to use renewable diesel. We also piloted hybrid generators for the production of the films Irish Wish, Unfrosted and Rebel Moon, the latter using a hybrid generator plus solar technology to provide remote power to construction crews and wardrobe trailers.\nFilm and series productions take thousands of vehicles that until recently have been universally fossil-fuel powered. In the past year, over 30% of the productions Netflix manages incorporated electric, plug-in hybrid, and hybrid vehicles, totaling more than 120 vehicles piloted in 2022 (a 3X increase in vehicles from 2021), resulting in fuel reductions that lowered emissions by 158 MTCO2e (a 5X increase in reductions from 2021). These vehicles were deployed on productions in Los Angeles, London, New York, Toronto and Vancouver.\n\nFrom our pilots, we have learned that EV passenger vehicles can save productions money and fuel when provided to crew that have high daily mileage, and that plug-in hybrids and regular hybrids are good transition vehicles that reduce emissions without range anxiety. As we prepare to pilot larger vehicles, including electric trucks, we know that charging infrastructure, including mobile charging, is key to the successful integration of EVs into production operations. Therefore we have begun to build out charging infrastructure at studios where we frequently produce series and films. We are installing faster level 2 stations (dispensing 16-19 kW vs the standard 6-7 kW) and have purchased DC fast chargers that will be installed in Los Angeles and at our owned studio in Albuquerque in 2023.\nINDUSTRY COLLABORATION\n\nThe film and television industry is over a century old and has been traditionally powered by fossil fuels. While we have set Netflix-specific climate targets, we can\u2019t transition entertainment to a cleaner, low carbon industry alone. This is why we partner with other studios to ensure progress made by one benefits everyone \u2014 and because we believe collective actions will yield positive outcomes, faster. We do this through:\n\nWe also actively partner with other key business and non-profit consortia to: (1) further our understanding of climate representation on screen, including through BAFTA\u2019s Albert, SPA and the Climate Entertainment Stakeholders Roll Call, a group organized by the Television Academy, Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, Creative Artists Agency, and PGA to connect the companies and organizations working in climate entertainment; and (2) advocate for more sustainable policy solutions, including CERES, C2ES, the Business Roundtable and Motion Picture Association.\n\n01 Sustainable production industry groups:\nNetflix is a member of several industry groups globally (e.g., Sustainable Production Alliance (global), BAFTA\u2019s Albert (UK and global), Reel Green/On Tourne Vert/Ontario Green Screen (Canada), Green Motion (Germany), Sustainable Screens Australia, etc.) to help bring transparency (e.g., Close Up: Carbon Emissions of Film & Television Production) and public advocacy for sector transformation (e.g., hydrogen hub).\n\n02 Clean Mobile Power Initiative:\nBy co-founding the Clean Mobile Power Initiative (CMPI) with support from non-profit Rocky Mountain Institute and its climate accelerator, we aim to identify and deliver cost-competitive zero emissions mobile power at scale for the entertainment industry. The long term goal is to eliminate diesel generators in top production markets.\n\n03 Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance:\nMaking a film or series requires air travel. To accelerate progress towards lowering the greenhouse gas emissions associated with burning jet fuel, Netflix co-founded the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA). SABA sends market signals to producers of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) to grow supply, facilitates coordinated procurement activity, and ensures the environmental integrity of their claims.\nSustainability Across the Value Chain\n\nSCOPE 3 EMISSIONS\n\nPurchased goods & services\\(^{17}\\) (PG&S) emissions, i.e., goods and services we buy from others, made up the majority of our 2022 Scope 3 footprint, primarily related to film and series production. The next biggest Scope 3 Category in 2022 was business travel emissions\\(^{18}\\), which includes air travel, hotel stays and travel-related transportation, and accounts for <10% of our total Scope 3 emissions. Compared to last year, our overall Scope 3 emissions decreased by about 25%. These emissions reductions can be attributed in part to a smaller volume of productions in 2022 compared to 2021, which experienced a jump as COVID shutdowns eased. The reductions were also driven by significant renewable energy consumption and procurement by AWS (refer to Data Centers and Content Distribution Network), and (to some degree) by EPA emissions factor changes\\(^{19}\\).\n\nSince a big part of these emissions are driven by the productions that other studios make on our behalf, as noted above, we partner closely with our peers and industry partners to engage our suppliers and shift the entertainment industry towards a more sustainable filmmaking approach. As we begin to track against our new Scope 3 targets, we will share our progress along the way.\n\nThis is what industry leadership looks like. Netflix is raising the bar by aligning operations with science, pioneering approaches to protect nature, and sending new demand signals to suppliers that sustainability is a measurable priority. Not only do we see progress against ambitious near-term goals, Netflix is also leveraging their platform for positive change. It\u2019s clear that Netflix is taking climate action seriously.\n\nElizabeth Sturcken,\nManaging Director, Environmental Defense Fund\n\n---\n\n\\(^{17}\\) Scope 3 Category 1, per the Greenhouse Gas Protocol\n\\(^{18}\\) Scope 3 Category 6, per the Greenhouse Gas Protocol\n\\(^{19}\\) Dataset and description of changes. Updates to these Scope 3 emissions factors reflect ongoing improvements by the EPA, to use updated methodologies and data where possible. Netflix tracks materiality of any methodological updates to the footprint, and follows established guidelines for re-baselining as needed.\nDATA CENTERS AND CONTENT DISTRIBUTION NETWORK (CDN)\n\nCarbon Trust\u2019s white paper on the Carbon Impacts of Video Streaming determined that the use-phase emissions associated with data center and CDN operations are small (<1%) compared to the rest of the video streaming value chain.\n\nNetflix partners with Amazon Web Services (AWS) for our data storage and cloud computation needs. AWS has a goal of using 100% renewable energy by 2025. In 2022, AWS reported via their customer carbon footprint tool that our carbon footprint was reduced by approximately 98% compared to last year. This is due to AWS\u2019s renewable energy usage and purchasing, and energy efficiency initiatives.\n\nThis trend is consistent with research findings, which show that the energy intensity of global data centers has decreased by 20% annually since 2010. This is a notable improvement compared with recent annual efficiency gains in other major demand sectors (e.g., aviation and industry), which are an order of magnitude lower.\n\nWhen it comes to distributing our content to our members, Netflix invests heavily in making this process as efficient as possible with our Open Connect program. We make 18,000 servers available for free to Internet Service Providers who operate them in their data centers across 6,000 locations in over 175 countries. So when our members press play, instead of the film or series being streamed from halfway around the world, it\u2019s streamed from around the corner \u2014 increasing efficiency for operators while also ensuring a high-quality, no-lag experience for consumers. On top of that, we\u2019ve developed encoding technology to reduce file sizes and optimize bandwidth use while maintaining high video quality for consumers. Over the past five years, we have been able to cut our bit rates by roughly 50%. This is in addition to the significant efficiency gains the telecom industry has achieved within their own networks.\n\nWe are encouraged by the strong energy efficiency and renewable energy usage trends of both AWS and our own Open Connect program, and are committed to continually decarbonizing these processes over time. Refer to our recent blog post Energy Efficiency in Streaming: Innovation Reaping Rewards to learn more.\n\n---\n\n20 E. Masanet, A. Shehabi, N. Lei, S. Smith, J. Koomey, \u201cRecalibrating global data center energy-use estimates,\u201d Science Magazine, 2020\n21 Co-CEO Greg Peters\u2019 Keynote Address to the 2023 Mobile World Congress\nINTERNET TRANSMISSION AND USER DEVICE ENERGY USE\n\nBecause internet infrastructure (including data centers) are so widely shared by so many consumers across so many services, the energy consumption of this infrastructure for individual video streams is relatively efficient (i.e., ~10% of total use-phase streaming emissions). By contrast, the physical devices used by our members (wifi routers, streaming sticks, set top boxes, and displays) drive the most energy consumption and emissions (~89%). Even so, the total carbon footprint of streaming one hour of video is approximately 55 gCO2e (grams of carbon dioxide equivalents). This equates roughly to the emissions associated with microwaving four bags of popcorn, or three boils in an electric kettle.\n\nBased on globally accepted greenhouse gas accounting standards, internet- and device-related emissions fall outside of the formal carbon footprint boundary for Netflix. Even so, we still think it is important for us to contribute to industry-wide decarbonization efforts.\n\nThrough our participation in DIMPACT, we collaborate with Internet Service Providers (ISPs), device manufacturers, and academic and industry experts to stay up-to-date on the latest research about digital service emissions and contribute to cross-sector policy suggestions that will help decarbonize video streaming globally. We\u2019ve summarized the main takeaways here.\n\nAdditionally, we are part of the DIMPACT Device Manufacturers working group, where we support research related to device energy efficiency. We are also encouraged by work with the Carbon Trust, in collaboration with companies like Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Samsung and Sky, to tackle the emissions of connected devices.\n\n---\n\n22 Based on UK emissions factors, because these comparisons vary by country depending on the carbon intensity of the user\u2019s national grid.\n\n23 The True Climate Impact of Streaming\n\n24 Per the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and also validated by our auditors, indirect use-phase emissions are optional to include. The Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi) also specifies that internet- and device-related emissions are indirect use phase emissions for software and telecommunication services, therefore optional to include in our footprint and target (Target Validation Protocol for Near-term Targets, Version 3.1, pg. 51).\nNetting Remaining Emissions to Zero\n\nTo supplement our decarbonization work, we delivered on our promise to net all remaining emissions to zero, across all three scopes, in 2022. We did this by investing in nature to retain and remove carbon (nature-based carbon credits) and match remaining electricity use to like-for-like renewable energy credits.\n\nNature-Based Carbon Credits\n\nWe align with the latest guidance from nine research, NGO and multilateral government institutions who conclude that, \u201cin addition to cutting greenhouse gas emissions in company operations and across value chains, to help get the world on track for halving global emissions by 2030, all companies need to invest in protecting, managing and restoring nature, for example by buying high-quality nature-based carbon credits.\u201d Relative to our work to decarbonize, purchasing carbon credits comes only after we have made efforts to reduce emissions at the speed prescribed by climate science. But per the science (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Nature), this needs to be done in parallel and cannot come later.\n\nOur 2022 carbon credit portfolio spans four continents, six countries, and 25+ on-the-ground partners, with 100% third-party certification for carbon measurement. Netflix does extensive due diligence before including a project in our portfolio, using a rigorous five step evaluation process to select the highest quality credits, all of which need to demonstrate their value beyond the carbon, including social impact, community and biodiversity benefits. We review transparency and integrity work from groups like VCMI and ICV-CM, and stay abreast of methodologies from third party credit standards bodies to continually refine our vetting process.\n\nNature-based projects make up 64% of our portfolio because of their ecosystem benefits and potential to bring economic value to the region, including indigenous people or those disproportionately affected by climate change.\n\n---\n\n25 All scenarios developed by the IPCC that limit climate change to 1.5\u00b0C rely on increasing the ghg sequestration potential of nature coupled with the avoidance of further damage to soils, forests, peatlands, wetlands, oceans and other critical biodiverse sinks - IPCC (2022) Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change.\n\n26 A We Mean Business coalition study showed that if the world\u2019s 1,700 biggest emitters compensated each year for just 10% of the emissions they have not yet cut, through investments in nature, it would mitigate nearly 30 gigatons of emissions and mobilize up to $1 trillion in climate finance by 2030.\n## 2022 CARBON PORTFOLIO\n\n| Project Name                                      | Country   | Project Type | Project Benefits                                                                 | Vendor                        | Tonnes  |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------|\n| Mycorrhizal Inoculation Accelerated Reforestation | Chile     | Removal: Reforestation | Advances biotechnology, biodiversity, local skilled jobs, soil rehabilitation | Mikro-Tek & Climate Impact Partners | 331,600 |\n| Carbon Removal                                   |           |              |                                                                                  |                               |         |\n| Chyulu Hills REDD+ Project                       | Kenya     | Retention: REDD+ | Biodiversity, drought prevention, education resources, local jobs and alternative livelihoods, strong local community governance | Conservation International    | 338,569 |\n| Salvador da Bahia Landfill Gas Project           | Brazil    | Methane Mitigation | Reduced pollution, local skilled jobs                                           | Climate Partners              | 266,300 |\n| Bangladesh Gas Leak Reduction                    | Bangladesh| Methane Mitigation | Reduced pollution, local skilled jobs                                           | Climate Impact Partners       | 113,872 |\n| Scott River Improved Forest Management           | USA       | Removal: IFM  | Fire prevention, biochar production, watershed restoration                      | Ecotrust Forest Management    | 31,248  |\n### 2022 CARBON PORTFOLIO (CONTINUED)\n\n| Project Name                                                                 | Country | Project Type       | Project Benefits                                                                 | Vendor                  | Tonnes  |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------|\n| Central de Res\u00edduos do Recreio Landfill Gas Project (CRRLLGP)                | Brazil  | Methane Mitigation | Reduced pollution, local skilled jobs                                             | Climate Impact Partners | 26,832  |\n| Los Bancos Community Based Improved Forest Management                        | Mexico  | Removal: IFM       | Biodiversity, local skilled jobs                                                 | Cool Effect             | 19,530  |\n| ICICO Community Based Reforestation                                          | Mexico  | Removal: IFM       | Biodiversity, local skilled jobs, fire prevention and other forest health benefits| Cool Effect             | 17,170  |\n| Indigo Ag Soil Carbon Project                                                | USA     | Removal: Soil Carbon| Biodiversity, local skilled jobs, soil health, fire prevention and other forest health benefits | Indigo AG / Cool Effect | 1,100   |\n| **Total**                                                                    |         |                    |                                                                                  |                         | 1,146,221|\n\n### RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY CREDITS\n\nFor any electricity we weren't able to decarbonize in 2022, we used like-for-like credits by retiring Energy Attribute Certificates (e.g., Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) in the US, Guarantees of Origin (GOs) in Europe) to cover all non-renewable electricity use in over 150 countries.\nSustainability in Storytelling\n\nIn 2022, 165 million, or more than 70% of our members, chose to watch at least one story on Netflix that highlighted sustainability. We\u2019ve curated over 200 of these series, films and specials into a Netflix collection: Sustainability Stories. The collection includes comedies like Don\u2019t Look Up, documentaries like the Academy Award\u00ae winning The Elephant Whisperers and Our Great National Parks, to the mystery film Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, fantasy sci-fi Sweet Tooth and political drama Borgen - Power and Glory, inspiring solutions in Down to Earth with Zac Efron, and family fare like The Sea Beast and Spirit Rangers. Visit the Netflix sustainability webpage for more.\nYoung people like myself view Netflix as a cherished form of entertainment but also as a source of education and inspiration. As more and more of our generation recognizes the implications of the climate crisis on our daily lives we feel hopeful when shows like The Crown tackle coal pollution, or when Zac Efron\u2019s Down to Earth highlights new green technologies. I\u2019m proud of Netflix for being serious about tackling the climate crisis both in-house and on-screen.\n\nXiye Bastida,\nIndigenous youth climate activist and winner of the Spirit of the UN Award\n\nEVs ON SCREEN\n\nNetflix has committed to expanding the use of EVs in shows and films we produce ourselves \u2014 and announced this in a 2023 Super Bowl ad with GM starring Will Ferrell. These titles will start to hit the service in 2023, including Murder Mystery 2, Virgin River Season 5 and more that will prominently feature EVs.\nClimate Risk\n\nRefer also to the TCFD index in the appendix to this report\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nBoard: The Netflix Board oversees the Company\u2019s ESG efforts, which includes sustainability, with the assistance of the Nominating and Governance Committee. They regularly receive updates on sustainability and enterprise risk management at Board meetings.\n\nManagement: Our Chief Financial Officer (CFO) oversees management decisions related to our sustainability programs, which are led by our Netflix Sustainability Officer. Our Internal Audit team performs an annual company-wide enterprise risk assessment, in which climate risks are considered, and the findings of this assessment are shared with the Board annually.\n\nSTRATEGY AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nWe conducted an initial climate risk assessment at the end of 2021. This evaluation looked at a range of climate risks as defined by the Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosures, including physical, regulatory, reputational, market, legal, and transitional risks. We also referenced the ESG-Specific Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\u2019 (COSO) framework and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) research to build a climate risk framework to assess Netflix risk.\nWe identified the following risks and opportunities, and mapped them against current strategies:\n\n| Risk Type          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Time Horizon | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Acute Physical     | Acute physical risks caused by disruption from wildfires, flooding and sea level rise could pose a threat to business continuity and an impact to productions in areas impacted by natural disasters. | Short Term   | We produce content all around the world and can be somewhat resilient to issues related to a particular studio or filming location.

The output of this climate risk assessment was also used as an input into our enterprise risk management (ERM) assessment. When evaluated using our ERM methodology, no standalone climate-related risks were identified as significant for the company.\n\n## METRICS AND TARGETS\n\nRefer to our public climate targets and Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions data above. Measuring our performance against these targets over time helps to inform our climate risk assessment process, in particular our transition risks.\nSocial\n\nWe are focused on a number of areas, including diversity and inclusion within Netflix, representation both behind and in front of the camera and the accessibility of our service.\nInclusion & Diversity\n\nIf we are to serve audiences globally, we want an employee base that reflects our membership and a culture that enables those employees to do the best work of their lives. Our first inclusion report, published in 2021, looked at \u201crepresentation within the company, how we plan to increase it and how we cultivate a community of belonging and allyship\u201d \u2014 and we\u2019ve been working to build on that over the last two years.\nRepresentation Today\n\nGENDER (GLOBAL)\\(^{27}\\)\n\nAcross gender identities, women make up 49.6% of our workforce and have the highest representation at Netflix, compared to 51.7% in 2021. Women leadership (Directors and above) remained steady at 51.4% (vs. 51.2% in 2021). Men and additional gender identities\\(^{28}\\) remained flat at 45% and 1.3% respectively, compared to 2021.\n\nSENIOR LEADERSHIP\n\nOf the 23 leaders in our senior leadership team in 2022, 43.5% (10) are women.\n\nGlobal Gender Identity\n\nAll Job Levels\n\n| Gender Identity | 2021 | 2022 |\n|-----------------|------|------|\n| Women           | 51.7%| 49.6%|\n| Men             | 45.7%| 45.0%|\n| Additional Gender Identities | 1.3% | 0.2% |\n\nDirector+\n\n| Gender Identity | 2021 | 2022 |\n|-----------------|------|------|\n| Women           | 51.2%| 51.4%|\n| Men             | 47.8%| 45.6%|\n| Additional Gender Identities | 0.3% | 0.2% |\n\n\\(^{27}\\) This data is based on a subset of our streaming employee population, representing approximately 9,500 streaming employees. Due to regional laws, we are not able to collect gender data in every region. 4% of the 9,500 employees represented in the data collection process chose not to disclose a gender identity.\n\n\\(^{28}\\) Netflix acknowledges and honors that gender is non-binary, so employees can self-identify from categories outside of man or woman.\nRepresentation Today\n\nRACE/ETHNICITY (US)\\textsuperscript{29}\n\nOver half of our US workforce (52.9\\%) is made up of people from one or more historically excluded ethnic and/or racial backgrounds, including Asian, Black, Hispanic or Latino/a/x, Middle Eastern or North African, Native American, and Pacific Islander\\textsuperscript{30}.\n\nSENIOR LEADERSHIP\n\nOf the 23 leaders in our senior leadership team in 2022, 34.8\\% (8) self-identify as belonging to one or more historically excluded ethnic and/or racial backgrounds.\n\n01 The number of US employees who identify as Asian accounts for 27\\% of our workforce, an increase from 25.8\\% in 2021 \u2014 and 18.4\\% of our leadership (directors and above), compared to 18.6\\% in 2021.\n\n02 The number of US Black employees accounts for 10.7\\% of our workforce, a decrease from 11.7\\% in 2021 \u2014 and 12.9\\% of our leadership (directors and above), a decrease from 13.6\\% in 2021.\n\n03 The number of US Hispanic or Latino/a/x employees accounts for 11.3\\% of our workforce, relatively flat from last year (11.2\\%) \u2014 and 7.3\\% of our leadership (directors and above), an increase from 6.8\\% in 2021.\n\n\\textsuperscript{29} In the US \u2014 where we collect and report race and ethnicity data \u2014 we had approximately 7,000 employees. Previously published results will differ due to changes in data collection methods that allow employees to share multiple self-identities (e.g., Black and Asian compared to only \u201cmulti-race\u201d); with this change, percentages can add up to more than 100\\%.\n\n\\textsuperscript{30} The Race & Ethnicity self-identification categories that Netflix uses are largely informed by US federal reporting requirements.\nRefer also to our EEO-1 reports from 2014-2021 [here](#).\nDeepening our Culture of Inclusion and Belonging\n\nIncreased representation is only part of the journey. People need to feel included and valued within an organization if they are to stay long term \u2014 and while we\u2019ve made steady progress, we have much more to do. Key is building an inclusion lens so that employees at every level can move from awareness about diversity, equity and inclusion to action and impact more quickly. In the last year, over 600 of our leaders globally have participated in small group workshops on Leading Inclusively. We also have groups of inclusion advisors in all regions and functions helping to develop best practices in hiring, compensation, onboarding, feedback, growth and development.\n\nWe conduct pay equity analyses at least annually. These are designed to help ensure that employees from historically underrepresented groups are not being underpaid based on gender (globally) and race (US) relative to others doing the same or similar work under comparable circumstances. We aim to rectify pay gaps that we find. In addition, we will increase transparency around employee retention and pay equity in our inclusion updates and ESG reporting starting in 2024.\n\nOn recruiting and development, we have expanded the number of Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI), Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), and Minority Serving Institutions (MSI) represented in our Pathways Bootcamp. This immersive 12-week program provides technical skills development to students from historically underrepresented groups. Since the program\u2019s inception in 2020, 276 students have participated in the Pathways Bootcamp.\n\nOn building a more inclusive working environment, we now have 18 Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) \u2014 with over 8,000 employees in 84 chapters globally. These ERGS help to: create a positive and welcoming environment for employees from historically underrepresented communities at Netflix; raise our collective consciousness around diversity and inclusion issues; and support recruitment, retention and employee engagement.\nCulture and Engagement\n\nAt Netflix, we seek excellence in everything we do \u2014 our product, our entertainment and our culture. To help us succeed, we\u2019ve created an employee culture that\u2019s focused on continuous improvement so we can better serve our members and build our business. Our publicly available Culture Memo outlines our approach, which we update as needed to ensure we remain flexible in our approach. And we focus on employee engagement and feedback, including through regular town halls, business reviews and memos (which we often share broadly, including comments).\n\nBenefits and Wellbeing\n\nWe offer benefits through four pillars: physical health, mental health, family and financial. On the right are a few highlights of our offerings:\n\nBenefits Highlights:\n\n- **Physical Health:** Medical benefits work differently by country. No matter what the case is in each location, we make sure our employees and their families are covered. Additionally, we focus on accommodations and workplace adjustments to enable employees with one or more disabilities to be productive and successful.\n\n- **Mental Health:** Mental health is important to overall health so we offer various programs to support employees and their dependents. Globally, we provide access to mindfulness resources, as well as free therapy and coaching sessions. In 2022, we introduced a formal Wellbeing + Resilience strategy to manage issues related to anxiety and workplace stress. Our primary goal is to enhance productivity by focusing on integrating wellbeing into our operations.\n\n- **Family Benefits:** Netflix offers a global family forming and fertility health benefit to support employees during their fertility health, surrogacy, adoption and family forming journey. This benefit is available to employees and their spouse/domestic partner, regardless of marital status, gender identity or sexual orientation. We also recognize that one of the most important events in many of our employees\u2019 lives is the birth or adoption of a child, and our parental leave policy is \u201ctake care of your baby and yourself.\u201d\n\n- **Financial Benefits:** We provide employees the opportunity to prepare for their futures through our retirement-savings benefits, which vary by country.\nPhilanthropy at Netflix is driven by employees through our Employee Giving Program. Consistent with our culture of freedom and responsibility, we enable employees to donate to causes that are meaningful to them through a 2:1 employee match. When an employee donates to a charitable organization (from over 2 million eligible charitable organizations in 200 countries), Netflix matches that with 2X the donation amount, with an upper limit of $20,000 per employee per year for all donations and matches. This democratizes giving decisions, and incentivizes employees to support causes they\u2019re passionate about.\n\nIn 2022, we expanded our giving options and ways to get involved. We added a new volunteer match program in which Netflix employees can donate time by volunteering. For every hour an employee volunteers with an eligible cause, Netflix donates $50 to the same cause as part of each employee\u2019s annual match maximum.\n\nTotal giving as part of the Netflix Employee Giving Program in 2022 was approximately $34 million supporting over 5,000 charities worldwide. Nearly 30% of our employees participated in the Employee Giving Program in 2022.\nProgress in Film/Series and Productions\n\nBetter representation on-screen starts with representation behind the camera and in the office. But we know that driving real change in film and TV, not only at Netflix but industry-wide, means continuing to think about whose voices are still missing and discovering the next generation of storytellers.\n\n**USC ANNENBERG INCLUSION REPORT**\n\nWe partner with Dr. Stacy L. Smith and the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative to examine several inclusion metrics (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity, LGBTQ+, disability) in our US-commissioned films and series. In 2021, we released our first-ever study and committed to publicly releasing our progress every two years through 2026 to help keep us accountable and effect lasting change in our industry.\n\nThis April we shared the latest round of research looking at Netflix US films and series from 2020 to 2021. The new findings showed notable gains year-over-year for women and people from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups.\n\n**Gender Equality in Leading Roles**\n\nMore than half of all Netflix films or series from 2018\u20132021 featured a girl or woman as the lead or co-lead.\n\n**More People of Color in Leading Roles**\n\nIn 2020 to 2021, nearly half of Netflix films and series featured a lead or co-lead from an underrepresented racial/ethnic group.\n\n**More Women Behind the Camera**\n\nIn 2021, 26.9% of directors on Netflix films were women, compared to 12.7% across top-grossing films across the industry that same year. And 38% of show creators in 2021 were women, substantially higher than 26.9% in 2018.\n\n**Women of Color Behind and In Front of the Camera**\n\nWomen of color increased significantly as series directors from 5.6% in 2018 to 11.8% in 2021, with similar growth for writer and creator roles. Nearly a third of films (27.7%) and more than half of series (54.75%) in 2021 had women of color as leads/co-leads.\n\nHowever, the results also reveal that gaps persist for some specific racial/ethnic groups, including Latinx, Middle Eastern/North African, Indigenous and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander communities, as well as characters with disabilities. Read the executive summary here and the full report here.\nFUND FOR CREATIVE EQUITY\n\nFrom our work with USC, we have learned that more inclusion behind the camera leads to better representation on screen. So in 2021, we established the Netflix Fund for Creative Equity, a commitment of $100 million over five years towards building new opportunities for underrepresented communities within entertainment. Through the fund, Netflix supports external organizations that are committed to creating more equitable opportunities in the TV and film industries, as well as bespoke Netflix programs that help us to identify, train and provide job placement for up-and-coming talent globally.\n\nIn just two years, we have committed $29 million towards these initiatives, supporting over 4,500 up-and-coming creatives and partnering with more than 80 organizations around the world. We\u2019ve also placed 395 creatives from our programs on Netflix productions in a variety of roles, ranging from line producers and associate editors to casting assistants and grips. Read the latest update on the Fund for Creative Equity here.\n\n- Invested more than $29 million in programs over the past 2 years\n- Partnered with over 80 organizations across the globe\n- Established more than 100 programs in over 35 countries from the United Kingdom to Brazil and Spain to India\n- Supported more than 4,500 creatives including directors, producers, writers, visual effects artists and more\nPROGRAM AND CREATOR SPOTLIGHTS\n\nHere are a few highlights of programs and creators we supported in 2022.\n\n**Paula Garcas**\nGraduate from the Netflix Series Directors Development Program in the US\n\n\u201cThe Netflix Series Directors Development Program helped me pivot my career - the team looked beyond my career as an actor, and saw the potential in me to grow as an artist. The program gave us access to major talent and a front row seat to the inner workings of directing. Thanks to Lauren Iungerich, I directed an episode on two Netflix shows as part of this. Training with Lauren has been invaluable to my career. She gave me all the time, tools and encouragement to truly succeed, while testing me and challenging me to grow along the way. Because of her, I\u2019m prepared to tackle any opportunity that comes my way.\u201d\n\n**Mirwais Sarwary**\nParticipant in the New Producers Academy Fellowship in the Netherlands\n\n\u201cThrough the NPA masterclasses and networking events, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to meet and discuss ideas with key players in the film industry. Above all, I have had the time, space, and tools to develop my vision as a producer. In a short period of only six months, the New Producers Academy has allowed me to position myself in the Dutch film industry on my terms. What has been most rewarding is to be in a position where I can work together with emerging creators that find my fresh approach as a producer valuable and essential.\u201d\n\n**Korede Azeez**\nWinner of the African Folktales, Reimagined Short Film Competition, Nigeria\n\n\u201cI learned so much from day one. It was the most tasking project I have ever worked on, but it was also the most rewarding. I got to work with some of the best talent in my country, which was an amazing experience. They treated me with so much respect and I am grateful for the immense support I got from Netflix and my mentor. I also learned a lot about how a world class production is managed, and this is definitely something I\u2019ll be taking into future work. I have grown tremendously as a filmmaker and I feel more ready to take on the world.\u201d\n\n**Aditi Sharma**\nGraduate of the Netflix x Film Companion Take Ten Initiative, India\n\n\u201cThrough the Take Ten program, I got to learn about writing a screenplay, creating characters, directing actors, along with many other filmmaking lessons. We had the opportunity to do this under the guidance of Film Companion, and being mentored by professionals who are not only good at what they do, but also truly invested in the process of teaching, was extremely helpful. There aren\u2019t any grant opportunities in India to speak of, and to have a platform like Netflix to showcase your film was a huge deal for a first time filmmaker like me. For the first time, me and my team believed that we had a real shot at this.\u201d\nProgress in Partnerships\n\nSUPPLIER DIVERSITY\n\nWe\u2019re working to ensure that our suppliers and vendors come from a diversity of backgrounds. This helps create jobs and opportunities in communities where we do business for people who\u2019ve often been marginalized historically. In 2022, we spent ~$700 million with underrepresented suppliers, a 9% year-over-year increase.\n\nSUPPORTING BLACK BANKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS\n\nIn 2020, we announced that we would plan to allocate 2% of our cash holdings \u2014 initially up to $100 million \u2014 into Black banks and similar financial institutions to help create economic opportunities for Black communities in the US. In 2021, we fulfilled our initial pledge and in 2022, we continued to expand that investment to 2% of our cash and short-term investment holdings ($106 million has been committed as of December 31, 2022).\nWith a catalytic seed investment of $25 million, Netflix collaborated with LISC Fund Management (LFM) to create the Black Economic Development Fund (BEDF). The Fund launched in 2020 to address economic challenges in the Black community and to help close the racial wealth gap. Since then, BEDF has grown into a $250 million mission-driven fund investing in Black-led developers, financial institutions, anchor organizations and businesses, with the goal of growing these organizations and strengthening their contributions to the Black community. From inception to the end of 2022, Netflix contributions supported BEDF\u2019s investment of $158 million in black-led transactions: $12 million in deposits to Black-owned banks; $18 million to Black-owned businesses; and $128 million in Black-led real estate developers.\n\nNetflix\u2019s anchor investment of $25 million has been instrumental in the creation of the Black Economic Development Fund, enabling us to invest in the Black community in a bold way. Without the support of visionary partners like Netflix, this transformative initiative may have never come to fruition. We are deeply grateful for their partnership and look forward to continuing to drive positive change together.\n\nMichelle Spivak, Senior Director, LISC Fund Management\n\nHope Credit Union was one of the first investments in the Netflix commitment to build economic opportunity in Black communities. The investment in HOPE is supporting the financing of more than 2,500 entrepreneurs, homebuyers and consumers of color. To learn more about these investments and their impact, check out the YouTube web series \u201cBanking On Us.\u201d\nAs a women-led B-Corp, we\u2019re delighted to collaborate with Netflix, a leader in promoting racial justice, in our shared goal of reimagining how corporations invest in Communities of Color. Hand in hand, we\u2019re charting a new course for corporate responsibility.\n\nCatherine Berman,\nCEO of CNote\n\nPARTNER SPOTLIGHTS\n\nNetflix leverages CNote\u2019s technology solution to support cash management into diversified deposits targeting social impact. Deposits are deployed with a network of impact-driven depository institutions that support Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) and low-to-moderate income communities and individuals, as well as women entrepreneurs.\n\nRacial Equity and Disability Loans: A Netflix fixed income commitment of $16 million focused on racial equity and disability has supported loans to 7 community development financial institutions (CDFIs) as of the end of 2022. These CDFIs provide funds to support individuals with physical disabilities, those suffering from mental illness, those recently released from incarceration or recovering from substance abuse issues and members of BIPOC communities that have been denied access to capital or services.\n\nCash Deposits: Netflix has committed $6 million to CNote Impact Cash\u00ae funds to be deposited with mission-driven depository institutions (DIs). Investments from Netflix have supported collective lending for over $1.9 billion in auto loans, over $4.2 billion in commercial loans and over $1.5 billion in housing loans.\nResponsible Products\n\nEmpowering people to easily choose and experience films, series and games they love is critical to a member\u2019s joy every time they go to Netflix. We design our products to protect the privacy and security of our members, and to be inclusive and accessible to everyone.\n\nPrivacy\n\nOur service has always been subscription-based, and when members sign up for any plan, we ask for very little information: email, name and method of payment. Our Personal Information Handling Principles ensure our engineering and business teams are aligned on our approach to privacy. Our Privacy Statement provides a detailed explanation of our privacy practices to our members, including: the information Netflix collects or receives from each member; information from our partners; how we use and disclose it (including advertising that we conduct off Netflix to promote our service); and the controls each member has in relation to this information.\n\nIn November of 2022, Netflix introduced an ad-supported plan which allows members to enjoy our service at a lower price with limited ads. For those signing up for our ad-supported plan, we also ask for date of birth and gender. Members have the ability to opt-out of the selection of ads based on third party behavioral advertising (i.e., ads selected based on use and/or interactions with unaffiliated third party websites and apps over time). We offer members the ability to exercise such opt-outs through a simple in-service control \u2014 and we do not share what individual members watch with advertisers.\nGovernment Requests Related to Content\n\nWe offer creators the ability to reach audiences all around the world. However, our catalog varies from country to country, including for rights reasons (i.e., we don\u2019t have the rights to every title in every country where we operate). In a few cases, we\u2019ve had to remove specific titles or episodes of titles in specific countries to comply with government demands. Below are the titles we removed in 2022 \u2014 three in total. We report these takedowns annually.\n\n- In August 2022, we complied with a written demand from the Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTUK) in Turkey by removing one episode - episode 9 of Season 5 - of the series *Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous* in Turkey.\n\n- In September 2022, we complied with a written demand from the Singapore Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) to remove the series *How to Change Your Mind* in Singapore.\n\n- In October 2022, we complied with a written demand from the Ministry of Information and Communication (MIC) in Vietnam and removed the series *Little Women* in Vietnam.\n\nInformation and Cybersecurity\n\nWe strive to protect sensitive information through various means, including: technical safeguards; procedural requirements and policies; a program of monitoring to detect and address unauthorized modification or misuse; continuous testing of aspects of our security internally and with outside experts; and a robust incident response program.\n\nWe regularly assess what areas of vulnerability there are, how we detect issues, how we respond and then how we let people know. We also have a Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure program, launched in 2018, that allows security researchers around the world to find and report security vulnerabilities in Netflix products and systems in exchange for compensation.\n\nThe Vice President (VP) of Security, Privacy, Assurance and Corporate Engineering oversees a team of employees dedicated to information security. Cybersecurity is discussed at every audit committee meeting and is also a board-level issue. Our VP regularly attends audit committee meetings and provides updates on cybersecurity matters.\nProduct Accessibility\n\nWe believe incredible stories and games should be enjoyed by all of our members, regardless of language, device, connectivity, or ability and that accessibility is just as important as the aesthetics, speed and stability of our service.\n\nMAKING OUR SERVICE MORE ACCESSIBLE\n\nWe have designed features like assistive listening systems, brightness controls, keyboard shortcuts, screen readers, larger font size and voice commands into our products. We also conduct research with current and prospective members aimed at identifying barriers to perceiving, navigating, and interacting with Netflix, and design solutions to remove those barriers. We take advantage of device-specific assistive technologies (e.g., native features on Apple iOS and Android platforms) as much as possible. We also create our own accessibility options, such as the ability to change the font, size, shadow, and background color of closed captions and subtitles on TV, and adjust playback speed on mobile.\n\nOur catalog of titles with subtitles for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (SDH), and audio descriptions (AD) for our members with vision needs is continually expanding. All Netflix-owned films and series support SDH for the language in which they were originally produced. We have also started expanding SDH and AD to nearly 20 languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, and French. Netflix members can browse titles with English audio descriptions in the gallery on our website, and by selecting \u201cAudio Description\u201d under the Categories menu in our mobile apps. We also introduced new badge icons for our shows and films that have AD and SDH on web, TV, iOS and Android so members can more easily discover stories suited to their needs, eliminating the inconvenient need to play a title first.\n\nWe partner with vendors across the globe who are dedicated to working with the blind and low vision community in many different capacities, from hiring blind or low vision narrators, quality controllers and co-author/editors to working with the community and local organizations to gather feedback through focus groups. Guidelines for the creation of AD, timed text style guides, gaming accessibility and minimizing photosensitivity issues \u2013 flashes or patterns that could cause ill-effects in our audiences, are also publicly available to share best practices amongst industry peers.\nMAKING OUR SERVICE MORE ACCESSIBLE\n\nOver the past year, we kicked off our first tour of barrier free accessible screenings in New Orleans, Los Angeles, London, New York City, and Seoul. Audiences came together to experience the thrill of The Gray Man, Stranger Things S4, and Jung_E in theaters with open AD and SDH.\n\nThere is more to be done. That's why Netflix is committed to working with the industry, community and policymakers to deliver more inclusive and accessible entertainment to the world.\nFrom our earliest innovation of DVD-by-mail to becoming one of the world's leading entertainment services, we've managed our business for the long term and focused on pleasing our members. This approach has served our members, employees and shareholders well over the past 25 years.\nCorporate Governance\n\nOur corporate governance structure was built to find the right balance of rights and responsibilities among shareholders, the board and management, and ensure that there are appropriate checks and balances in place. With the rapid evolution of technology and the changing media landscape, we are continually adjusting our service to meet the needs and desires of our consumers. Our governance structure has been deliberately constructed to help us to do that.\n\nBoard Composition and Structure\n\nOur board is composed of 12 highly experienced, talented and qualified directors with experience as board members and executives at some of the world\u2019s most successful companies. We believe that the board is well situated to navigate the changing competitive terrain that Netflix operates within. The board has led Netflix through its evolution from a US-only DVD business to a leading global streaming service and from a licensor of second run content to one of the biggest producers of films and series in the world, while effectively managing risk and overseeing management performance. We believe that a diverse mix of skills, experience, perspectives and backgrounds contribute to an effective board. The composition of our board has evolved over the past several years, and when looking to fill board positions, we will continue to evaluate potential candidates who we believe complement and augment our current board. The Nominating and Governance Committee considers a number of factors, including those depicted below, as well as characteristics such as gender, ethnic or racial background, and national origin when evaluating potential board candidates.\n\nInnovation\nKnowledge of how to anticipate consumer and technological trends\n\nContent\nExperience with the entertainment and media industry\n\nInternational\nExpertise in global business cultures and consumer preferences\n\nSTRATEGY ALIGNMENT\nOur board has the experience and expertise that aligns with these important facets of our long-term strategy\nAs of the end of 2022, women made up 33% of our independent directors and 27% of our overall board. One independent director comes from a historically excluded ethnic and/or racial background. We maintain our current board diversity matrix on our investor relations website.\\(^{32}\\)\nBoard Oversight\n\nThe board\u2019s role in our risk oversight process includes reviewing and discussing with members of management areas of material risk to the company, including overall enterprise, strategic, operational, financial and legal risks. The board oversees the company\u2019s ESG efforts, which includes human capital management, inclusion, diversity, sustainability and other matters. The board also oversees succession planning. The board receives regular updates from management typically in the form of an interactive memo, where directors ask questions to management, and further discuss matters at meetings. Each of the committees oversee various ESG matters, depending on the specific issues. Committees report to the full board regarding their respective considerations and actions.\n\nTHE BOARD\n\nThe board as a whole oversees matters related to enterprise, strategic, operational, financial and legal risk and the company\u2019s ESG efforts.\n\nNOMINATING AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE\n\nPrimary committee responsible for board structure, governance and director independence, as well as assisting the board in overseeing ESG matters.\n\nAUDIT COMMITTEE\n\nOversees matters of financial and legal risk, including cybersecurity risk.\n\nCOMPENSATION COMMITTEE\n\nOversees risks related to compensation issues.\n\nCOMPANY MANAGEMENT\n\nThe executive team, led by our co-Chief Executive Officers, supervises day-to-day risk management processes, including identifying, assessing, monitoring, managing and mitigating significant business risks. Company management reports to the board on an annual basis, or more frequently if needed, top areas of risk.\nGovernance Structure\n\nStreaming is now an established business, Netflix is self-funding and expects sustained positive free cash flow, and we\u2019ve substantially scaled our revenues, operating profit and margins. As such, we have recently evolved to a more standard large-cap governance structure. At our 2022 annual meeting, the Netflix Board proposed and stockholders approved significant changes to our corporate governance structure. We implemented a phased-in declassification of our board, with directors elected at this year\u2019s annual meeting serving one-year terms and the entire board standing for annual elections beginning in 2025 and beyond. We also eliminated supermajority voting provisions in our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the \u201cCharter\u201d) and our Amended and Restated Bylaws (the \u201cBylaws\u201d), provided shareholders with the ability to call special meetings, and adopted a majority voting standard in uncontested director elections. We also adopted a market standard director resignation policy. Here is a summary of our corporate governance best practices and stockholder rights:\n\n01 One share, one vote: We have a single class of shares with each share entitled to one vote.\n\n02 Majority voting standard: We have a majority voting standard in uncontested director elections. Any incumbent director who fails to receive a majority of votes cast in an uncontested election must tender their resignation to the board. The Nominating and Governance Committee would then make a recommendation to the board about whether to accept or reject the resignation or take other action.\n\n03 Annual director elections (fully declassified by 2025): We have phased-in the declassification of our board with directors elected at this year\u2019s annual meeting serving one-year terms and the entire board standing for annual elections beginning in 2025 and beyond.\n\n04 Elimination of supermajority voting: We eliminated supermajority voting provisions in our Charter and Bylaws.\n\n05 Proxy Access: A group of up to 20 stockholders, owning at least 3% of shares continuously for at least three years may nominate up to two directors or 20% of the Board (whichever is greater) for inclusion in our proxy statement.\n\n06 Stockholder right to call a special meeting: Stockholders holding a not less than 20% net-long position in the Company continuously for at least one year may call a special meeting.\nShareholder Engagement\n\nWe strive to stay in tune with our ownership base. Our board and our management team engage directly and regularly with our shareholders, and our board and its committees consider shareholders\u2019 feedback in assessing our governance structure, including our compensation program. Since our 2022 annual meeting, we have invited 26 shareholders, representing approximately 57% of our shares outstanding to participate in calls to discuss our executive compensation program and other matters that are top of mind. We conducted two rounds of investor outreach \u2013 one in the summer of 2022 and one in early 2023, to ensure we fully understood shareholder feedback, concerns and perspectives. Members of the Netflix legal and investor relations teams met with 19 shareholders, representing approximately 51% of our shares outstanding. Independent directors of the board participated in a majority of these engagements, meeting with shareholders representing approximately 45% of our shares outstanding. We also engaged with the proxy advisory firms, Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS). These engagements provide a direct opportunity to exchange information and perspectives, and the input from our shareholders will continue to inform our ongoing ESG programs as we evolve and grow.\n\nPercentages are based on shares outstanding as of December 31, 2022.\nEnterprise Risk\n\nWe review enterprise risks on an ongoing basis and seek ways of managing risk to help create, preserve and realize value for our members and shareholders. Our approach to enterprise risk management (ERM) is consistent with the COSO framework which defines ERM as \u201cthe culture, capabilities, and practices, integrated with strategy-setting and performance, that organizations rely on to manage risk in creating, preserving, and realizing value\u201d. On an annual basis, our Internal Audit team facilitates an enterprise risk assessment. We gather insights from a number of internal and external sources, including discussions with executives for their views on enterprise risks that the company is facing and compile an inventory of risks across the business. The findings of this assessment, including mitigation approaches, are presented to the board for their input and oversight. We also report these risks in our annual report.34\n\nIP Protection & Data Piracy\n\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success. We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. We employ a variety of methods to monitor potential infringement of our intellectual property, including searches conducted internally and by external vendors. A particular focus is preventing uses of our intellectual property that may lead to consumer fraud.\n\n34 Netflix, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022\nEthics and Compliance\n\nWe are committed to managing our business ethically and with integrity. Our Code of Ethics sets out our expectations for conduct among our employees and board members. We encourage reporting of breaches of our code or any unethical or inappropriate conduct to our Chief Legal Officer or, in the case of misconduct by a senior financial officer, to the Chair of our Audit Committee. We also provide access to a third-party operated service where reports of misconduct can be made confidentially and, if desired, anonymously, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year in local languages. Reports made through this service are elevated and investigated until they are resolved, and updates are provided annually to the Audit Committee.\n\nAs part of our commitment to managing our business ethically and with integrity, we seek to identify and mitigate risks that could lead to potential legal and/or regulatory violations through an annual compliance risk assessment process.\n\nOur Global Anti-Corruption Policy requires our employees and contractors to abide by global anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws. We provide regular training on compliance with this policy, in addition to conducting regular and ongoing risk assessments. A copy of our practices and policies, which includes the Global Anti-Corruption Policy and Code of Ethics, has been translated into numerous languages and remains available to all employees throughout their employment with us.\n\nOther areas of focus include commitments to compliance with applicable government mandated sanctions regimes (with leadership provided by a designated Sanctions Compliance Officer) as well as compliance with human rights legislation (e.g., the UK Modern Slavery Act35).\n\n35 UK Modern Slavery Act Statement Available on our IR Website\nAppendix\nAbout This Report\n\nThis report covers the calendar year 2022 and all data included in the report is from that time period unless otherwise noted.

This evaluation looked at a range of climate risks as defined by the Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosures, including physical, regulatory, reputational, market, legal and transitional risks. We also referenced the ESG-Specific Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\u2019 (COSO) framework and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) research to build a climate risk framework to assess Netflix risk. While the assessment was a useful exercise, the climate risks we identified were all mapped to risk mitigation strategies already in place or underway. The output of this climate risk assessment was also used as an input into our enterprise risk management (ERM) assessment. When evaluated using our ERM methodology, no standalone climate-related risks were identified as significant for the company. |\n| Describe the organization\u2019s processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risk | |\n| Describe the organization\u2019s processes for managing climate-related risks | |\n| Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organization\u2019s overall risk management | |\n\n| **Metrics & Targets: Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant climate-related risks and opportunities where such information is material** | Refer to the Public Climate Targets and Carbon Footprint sections of the ESG report for information on our metrics, emissions and targets.

Netflix GHG emissions reporting follows the operational control approach set out by the GHGP.\n\nOur reported emissions account for all GHGs covered by the UNFCCC Kyoto Protocol (Annex A) relevant to Netflix activities and are converted into metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (MTCO2e) as specified by the GHG Protocol. All emission factors are applied to the data and updated annually to reflect the latest guidance and factors published by US EPA Emission Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories (2022), US EPA eGRID2021 Electricity Grid Emission Factors (2023) and UK DEFRA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Conversion Factors (2022). Additionally, where data is not available or of sufficient quality, Netflix uses proxy data, industry-average figures, or expert assumptions. In such instances, we use third-party sources for reliability and completeness.\n\nSome of these data sets such as the average building energy use intensity values from the DOE Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (2016), are held constant to maintain consistency across years.\n\nNetflix\u2019s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reporting is consistent with the \u201coperational control\u201d approach as set out by the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard: Revised Edition. The organizational and operational boundary applies to the global company including its subsidiaries, the office and studio facilities we own and operate (e.g., Albuquerque Studios) as well as facilities we lease from others but over which we have meaningful operational control (e.g., corporate and studio offices and stages).\n\nOUR FOOTPRINT BOUNDARY\n\nScope 1 and 2: Our emissions include all Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 2 (indirect emissions) from the following: our corporate operations (offices, etc); the production of our films, series and games; and the storage and delivery of our content. Scope 2 emissions are calculated using market-based and location-based emissions accounting methods defined by the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance. Location-based estimates are calculated based on the emissions intensity of the locations where the electricity consumption occurs. The market-based method incorporates electricity procurement decisions that are chosen within the local electricity market, including zero-carbon electricity supply from utilities (i.e., opt-in \u201cgreen tariff\u201d rates) and contractual instruments such as renewable energy certificates (RECs).\nWe also use a target-based emissions accounting method relative to our science-based targets, which is custom to Netflix. Target-based emissions incorporate direct renewable energy supply (e.g., onsite generation, utility & landlord supply, power purchase agreements or direct investments) but do not account for emissions from contractual instruments such as renewable energy certificates (RECs).\n\n**Scope 3:** Netflix also estimates and reports relevant Scope 3 categories, which therefore includes activities outside of our operational control. Our Scope 3 boundary was established in alignment with the GHG Protocol Corporate and Scope 3 Standards. Netflix includes all relevant and material sources of emissions including categories 1-4, 6-8 and 11. In the future, we aim to include category 5 (emissions related to waste in operations) by improving our direct data collection. For now, most estimated waste-related emissions in our footprint are captured in category 1 (purchased goods & services) using spend-based estimates on facilities management and production operations.\n\nScope 3 emissions use location-based emissions factors except where individual suppliers provided supplier specific emissions that are market-based (e.g., AWS) or through application of RECs to Scope 3 emissions where information on the specific energy consumption by location was available (e.g., for the Open Connect network) in order to match the contractual instrument to known energy consumption in accordance with GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance. Netflix works with individual suppliers, wherever possible, to determine that any renewable contractual instruments applied to their emissions are appropriately attributed.\n\nWe include all Netflix-branded content productions, whether we manage the production directly (like *The Sea Beast, Spirit Rangers, Don't Look Up, Our Great National Parks*), or through a third-party production company (like *Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, The Elephant Whisperers*) as well as all content that we license that is Netflix-branded (like *Octonauts: Above and Beyond, Captain Nova, Down to Earth with Zac Efron*). Activities outside of our operational control present challenges to measuring and reducing emissions, but because so much of production infrastructure, crew and equipment are shared across studios, we believe that holding ourselves accountable for all emissions from Netflix-branded content (wherever it is produced) will create a positive ripple effect across our own emissions as well as the entire industry.\n\n**Data Management**\n\nWe maintain a Greenhouse Gas Inventory Management plan to ensure consistency of calculating and estimating emissions from year to year, and to provide to our 3rd party assurance providers as a basis for their audit of our emissions. We maintain documentation as evidence to support our emissions inventory and follow Netflix retention policies for these records. In 2022, we began implementing a carbon accounting software solution to help streamline and mature our data collection processes, and to help maintain related documentation.\nCarbon Credit Project Screening Criteria\n\n**Screen 1: Competitive selection**\nOur competitive requests for proposals (RFPs) are issued widely, to over 75 project developers, non-profits, brokers and credit retailers across many project types and geographies.\n\n**Screen 2: Meet core quality criteria**\nAny credits that we purchase must meet globally recognized core quality criteria: they must be additional, verified, based on a realistic baseline, not double counted and issued by a credible standard that has robust provisions in place to address permanence (the risk of reversal) and leakage (the risk of displacing emissions from one location to another). We only purchase credits that have been third-party verified and registered on a trusted registry, including \u2013 Verra, Gold Standard, Climate Action Reserve and American Carbon Registry \u2013 or have demonstrated an equivalent level of rigor.\n\n**Screen 3: Deep project-level diligence and impact screening**\nOur team then conducts due diligence on the projects and holds live interviews directly with the project developers and/or trusted project partners. This includes research on the projects, their proponents and other local stakeholders. Engaging directly with the project hosts enables a deeper understanding of the unique circumstances and conditions that surround a particular carbon credit project and how and why it came to be. We also conduct additional screens for: local community ownership and direct benefit sharing; job creation and training; women and girls empowerment; biodiversity and habitat restoration and protection (e.g., Verra Climate, Community & Biodiversity certified projects); and climate resilience impacts.\n\n**Screen 4: Use digital tools and resources to improve visibility**\nWhere feasible, we use technology to enhance project validation and verification, such as AI-powered satellite imagery, machine learning and remote sensing analysis.\n\n**Screen 5: Seek additional expert advice**\nNetflix relies on its expert advisory group to provide additional insight and guidance on an ongoing basis across a range of key issues, including our carbon credit portfolio. This helps us identify things we may have missed.\n", "source": "netflix_2022", "added": "2025-04-27", "created": "2025-04-27", "metadata": {"Source-File": "climate_reports/tp_reports/netflix_2022.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.1.59", "pdf-total-pages": 76, "total-input-tokens": 135724, "total-output-tokens": 28815, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 532, 2], [532, 2984, 3], [2984, 3222, 4], [3222, 3719, 5], [3719, 5293, 6], [5293, 6638, 7], [6638, 7703, 8], [7703, 7937, 9], [7937, 9729, 10], [9729, 10842, 11], [10842, 13262, 12], [13262, 15161, 13], [15161, 15901, 14], [15901, 17109, 15], [17109, 18622, 16], [18622, 20477, 17], [20477, 22705, 18], [22705, 24984, 19], [24984, 26972, 20], [26972, 28491, 21], [28491, 30998, 22], [30998, 32332, 23], [32332, 34637, 24], [34637, 36897, 25], [36897, 39344, 26], [39344, 41685, 27], [41685, 44298, 28], [44298, 46041, 29], [46041, 48043, 30], [48043, 48758, 31], [48758, 49642, 32], [49642, 50857, 33], [50857, 53746, 34], [53746, 56310, 35], [56310, 56497, 36], [56497, 56939, 37], [56939, 58300, 38], [58300, 59965, 39], [59965, 60023, 40], [60023, 62091, 41], [62091, 64338, 42], [64338, 65486, 43], [65486, 67690, 44], [67690, 69088, 45], [69088, 71886, 46], [71886, 72743, 47], [72743, 74382, 48], [74382, 75872, 49], [75872, 77433, 50], [77433, 79587, 51], [79587, 81967, 52], [81967, 82469, 53], [82469, 82752, 54], [82752, 84778, 55], [84778, 85062, 56], [85062, 86696, 57], [86696, 89102, 58], [89102, 90492, 59], [90492, 92156, 60], [92156, 93978, 61], [93978, 93987, 62], [93987, 96072, 63], [96072, 97964, 64], [97964, 99713, 65], [99713, 101206, 66], [101206, 102398, 67], [102398, 106189, 68], [106189, 110357, 69], [110357, 112195, 70], [112195, 114507, 71], [114507, 115578, 72], [115578, 118494, 73], [118494, 121606, 74], [121606, 123808, 75], [123808, 123808, 76]]}}
