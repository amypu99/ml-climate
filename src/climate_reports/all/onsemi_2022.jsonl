To do so, we proactively engage stakeholders both internally and externally. Thoughtful internal stakeholder engagement is critical to inspire, engage and partner with employees to innovate, exceed expectations and pursue our purpose. All this is done under a unified and powerful brand and common values, which are embodied thoughtfully in every single engagement with our external stakeholders.\n\nSpectrum of Stakeholder Engagement\nNet Zero Commitment\n\nAt our Analyst Day in 2021, we announced our goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2040 (Net Zero 2040) across Scope 1, 2 and 3 along with a commitment to use 50 percent renewable energy by 2030 and 100 percent renewable energy by 2040. This commitment will guide how we operate our business over the coming years and is essential to ensure we operate in a socially thoughtful and environmentally responsible manner. Scope 1 and 2 emissions cover direct and indirect emissions under onsemi\u2019s operational control, while Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions that occur in the value chain of the company, including both upstream and downstream emissions.\n\nBaseline Emissions Inventory\n\n2022 will serve as our baseline year for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across Scope 1, 2 and 3 for our net zero target setting efforts.\n\nAs a reflection of our commitment to continually improve, onsemi\u2019s 2022 emissions inventory is more comprehensive than the year prior. Scope 1 emissions are calculated based on discharged emissions, in line with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier 2c guidance. Scope 2 emissions inventory now includes both manufacturing and non-manufacturing operations, whereas the previous emissions inventory included only manufacturing operations. Scope 3 emissions are also calculated more comprehensively than previously. In 2021, onsemi tracked Scope 3 emissions related to our business travel. This year, onsemi\u2019s Scope 3 emissions include 10 applicable categories out of a total of 15 potential categories, as defined by the GHG Protocol. A total emission of 2,143,211 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO\u2082e) was calculated for Scope 3 alone, which accounts for 60 percent of our total GHG emissions. All emissions from Scope 1, 2 and 3 were calculated based on the GHG Protocol.\n\nTo baseline emissions for Net Zero 2040, we have excluded facility divestitures that occurred in 2022. onsemi acquired our East Fishkill (EFK), New York Fab on December 31, 2022. Due to this acquisition closing at the end of 2022, emissions from the site have not been included in this baseline calculation. We will work to include EFK emissions in our 2022 baseline calculation over the next year and will report on its impact in our 2023 Sustainability Report. For annual reporting, emissions from divested facilities are calculated through the date of divestiture and emissions from EFK will be included as part of 2023 emissions. Annual reporting of our GHG emissions can be found in the Energy Consumption and Emissions section of this report, pg. 24.\n\n| DISCLOSURE | UNITS | EMISSIONS |\n|------------|-------|-----------|\n| 2022 Baseline Emissions\u00b9 | MTCO\u2082e | 2,143,211 |\n| Scope 1 | | 769,179 |\n| Scope 2 | | 686,475 |\n| Scope 3 Total | | 2,143,211 |\n\n\u00b9Our 2022 baseline emissions do not yet account for emissions from EFK. We anticipate that our baseline emissions will increase when we incorporate EFK emissions in our 2023 reporting cycle. These baseline emissions differ from our fiscal year 2022 emissions disclosed in the Energy Consumption and Emissions section as our baseline emissions do not include emissions from sites divested in 2022.\n\n| DISCLOSURE | UNITS | SCOPE 3 SUBTOTAL BY CATEGORY |\n|------------|-------|-----------------------------|\n| GHG Protocol Scope 3 Category | | |\n| 1 | Purchased Goods and Services (PG&S) | MTCO\u2082e | 1,414,941 |\n| 2 | Capital Goods | | 102,663 |\n| 3 | Fuel- and Energy-related Activities (FERA) | | 203,238 |\n| 4 | Upstream Transportation and Distribution | | 294,171 |\n| 5 | Waste Generated in Operations | | 46,705 |\n| 6 | Business Travel | | 5,556 |\n| 7 | Employee Commuting | | 17,452 |\n| 8 | Upstream Leased Assets | | 4,484 |\n| 9 | Processing of Sold Products | | 13,992 |\n| 10 | End-of-Life Treatment of Sold Products | | 44,484 |\n\nOur 2022 baseline emissions do not yet account for emissions from EFK. We anticipate that our baseline emissions will increase when we incorporate EFK emissions in our 2023 reporting cycle. These baseline emissions differ from our fiscal year 2022 emissions disclosed in the Energy Consumption and Emissions section as our baseline emissions do not include emissions from sites divested in 2022.\nScience Based Target Initiative Alignment\n\nIn December 2022, we submitted a commitment letter signed by our President and CEO Hassane El-Khoury to set near-term science-based emission reduction targets in line with the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi).\n\nScience Based Targets (SBTs) provide a clearly defined pathway for companies to reduce GHG emissions, focusing on deep decarbonization of current business processes and decoupling business and revenue growth from increased emissions in the future. SBTi ensures our targets align with the latest science to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as defined by the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\nBy December 2024, we will develop, validate and publish near-term SBTs aligned with and approved by SBTi. These milestones are important because they present an additional level of transparency toward our Net Zero 2040 goal.\n\nClimate Transition Plan\n\nWe are working to create a climate transition plan to meet our Net Zero 2040 goal. We\u2019re exploring the use of available levers for reducing emissions across Scope 1 and 2 internally at our facilities, along with pathways for engaging suppliers and other reduction strategies in the value chain for Scope 3 emissions reductions outside onsemi\u2019s direct control. We\u2019re determining the appropriate milestone tasks, metrics and key performance indicators to use for our climate transition plan, allowing us to track our progress over time.\n\nScope 1 Emissions Reduction Strategy\n\nOur Scope 1 emissions inventory consists of emissions from fluorinated greenhouse gases used in semiconductor manufacturing processes (process gases), onsite combustion of fuels such as diesel or liquefied petroleum gas and heat transfer fluids. At onsemi, we have a tremendous opportunity to reduce Scope 1 emissions through process gas swaps and utilization of point-of-use abatement tools to treat manufacturing exhaust and destroy residual GHGs.\n\nProcess gas swaps are our largest opportunity for emissions reductions. While fluorinated gases are an essential ingredient to the semiconductor manufacturing recipe, there is interchangeability in which gas we choose. Where possible, we opt for fluorinated gases with a lower global warming potential (GWP) and higher efficiency rates, effectively reducing the emissions intensity of our process and the absolute emissions of our operations.\n\nPoint-of-use abatement systems will control remaining Scope 1 fluorinated GHG emissions that cannot be eliminated from the semiconductor manufacturing process. These systems utilize high temperature and/or plasma chemistry to convert fluorinated greenhouse gases to non-GHG products which are further treated using the factory air pollution control and wastewater treatment systems.\nScope 2 Emissions Reduction Strategy\n\nOur Scope 2 inventory consists of emissions from our purchased electricity. To align with industry best practices, we\u2019re focusing on deep decarbonization before turning to renewable energy instruments for our electricity-related emissions. Every ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO\u2082e) avoided through reduced electricity consumption is a ton we do not need to procure from renewable energy sources, which makes good business and sustainability sense. As such, we have developed a prioritization pyramid that will help us achieve Net Zero 2040.\n\nWe will continue to develop standardized protocols for equipment testing, system assessments and metering equipment that will help us understand the energy use through each of our systems at our sites. Following these, we will focus on energy conservation strategies that will involve no/low-cost improvements. We will then strategize the implementation of short-, mid- and long-term energy efficiency and system optimization projects that help reduce our overall energy use at our facilities. Typical short term energy efficiency measures at our sites may include (but not limited to) LED lighting retrofits, smart t-stat controls, variable frequency drive controls and pump overhauls. Mid- and long-term energy efficiency measures typically include measures related to equipment retrofits associated with space cooling (chillers, cooling towers), heating (boilers, furnaces) and process operations (compressors, pumps) at our facilities.\n\nAfter achieving optimal energy levels through conservation, reduction and optimization projects, we will shift our focus to distributed generation and renewable energy technologies, such as solar or wind energy, to power our remaining energy load.\n\nScope 2 Prioritization Pyramid for Net Zero 2040\n\n- Renewable Energy Credits (RECs)\n- Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs)\n- Solar, wind, etc.\n- Water Conservation\n- Process Optimization\n- Temperature Setpoint Adjustment\n- Compressed Air Leak Mitigation\n- Pump Replacing/Right sizing\n- Pump Testing\n- Compressed Air System Assessments\n\n\u00b9REI: Renewable Energy Instruments\n\nScope 3 Emissions Reduction Strategy\n\nSince Purchased Goods and Services (Category 1 of Scope 3 emissions per GHG Protocol) account for a significant percentage of our total Scope 3 inventory, we anticipate reducing Scope 3 emissions by engaging with our supply chain partners and encouraging them to disclose their own GHG emissions and set their own science-based reduction targets, per SBTi guidance. As we set near-term SBTi-aligned targets for Scope 3, we will explore other Scope 3 reduction pathway strategies.\nCarbon Removals or Offsets\nConsistent with SBTi\u2019s approach, we focus on reducing our emissions as much as possible before relying on carbon removal and offsets. For non-electricity-related emissions that cannot be eliminated, onsemi will explore the purchase of certified carbon removal or offset credits equal to the remaining emissions. Green-E and Gold Standard-certified removals and offsets are the most credible and will be prioritized.\n\nPlan Assumptions, Challenges and Uncertainties\nIn developing this climate transition action plan, some assumptions will be made including, but not limited to: (i) estimations of current emissions data where data is limited, (ii) challenges around proper knowledge sharing by employees across the organization for implementation of proposed solutions, (iii) duration of time needed to hit key milestone tasks, (iv) uncertainties around the availability of renewable energy and credible carbon removal/offset technology in different regions that we operate and (v) projected future organic and inorganic growth of the company through 2040. We\u2019re aware of these issues and will continue to mitigate them over time. Additionally, there are challenges and uncertainties associated with developing a transition plan, including:\n\n- Achieving full and accurate data collection due to inherent manual data entry processes.\n- Facilitating a standardized approach on reduction levers across our varied operations and balancing production demands.\n\nTo mitigate these challenges and uncertainties, we\u2019ve invested in GHG calculation accounting software that enables us to track, manage and report consistently across our entire enterprise. Our teams are developing education and training workshops to be conducted across manufacturing facilities and are working to insert climate-related data into more company processes for more informed decision-making, from new product development and capital expenditure decisions to mergers and acquisition due diligence assessments.\n\nMore to Come\nWith just 18 months of work under our belts since announcing Net Zero 2040, we\u2019re at the start of our journey. As we develop and validate our SBTi-aligned near-term goals, we\u2019re building a more comprehensive climate transition plan that will estimate our milestone emission reductions over time, anticipate procurement of renewable energy and develop our strategy around carbon offsets. After we publish our SBTi-aligned near term targets by December 2024, we plan to release a more comprehensive climate transition plan in our 2024 Sustainability Report, to be published in 2025.\nProduct Stewardship\n\nonsemi is focused on innovation to create intelligent power and sensing technologies that solve the most challenging customer problems. We have components in medical devices, fitness trackers and smartwatches, autonomous and EVs, charging stations, solar inverters and more. We innovate to deliver disruptive technologies to empower a strong triple bottom line product offering.\n\nOur product development efforts are directed towards:\n\n\u2022 Powering the electrification of the automotive industry with our intelligent power technologies that allow for lighter and longer-range EVs and enable efficient fast-charging systems.\n\u2022 Propelling sustainable energy evolution with our intelligent power technologies for the highest efficiency solar strings, industrial power and storage systems.\n\u2022 Enhancing the automotive mobility experience with our intelligent sensing technologies with imaging and depth sensing that make advanced vehicle safety and automated driving systems possible.\n\u2022 Enabling automation and data exchange (Industry 4.0) with our intelligent sensing technologies for smarter factories and buildings.\n\nWhile our new product development efforts continue to focus on building solutions in areas that appeal to customers in focused market segments and across high-growth applications, we regularly re-evaluate our research and development spending, to assess the deployment of resources and to review the funding of high-growth technologies. We deploy people and capital to maximize the return from our research and development investments by targeting innovative products and solutions for high-growth applications that position us to outperform the industry.\nIn 2022, onsemi had over $6,454 million in triple bottom line revenue, representing 78 percent of total revenue. onsemi\u2019s focus on intelligent power and sensing technologies and newly implemented corporate strategy resulted in a redefinition of our triple bottom line product offering in 2021. As a result, we saw a significant increase in triple bottom line revenue from 2020 to 2021.\n\nOur definition of \u201ctriple bottom line\u201d is revenue from products that fall under the intelligent power and sensing umbrella and products that contribute to the triple bottom line \u2013 People, Planet, Profit. The \u201cPeople\u201d category refers to any product that helps improve human health or saves lives. For example, our image sensors go into ADAS and automation systems leading to increased levels of safety in automotive applications.\n\nThe \u201cPlanet\u201d category refers to any product that helps reduce negative environmental impact throughout its use phase. Examples include applications that reduce carbon emissions, aid in the transition to renewable energy or enable resource conservation such as through the reduction of waste and scrap in manufacturing processes. Our SiC technologies are designed to meet the demands of higher power and density, and direct current (DC) fast charging in the EV charging application. The \u201cProfit\u201d category refers to any product that contributes to an organization\u2019s ability to provide economic benefit to society by enabling more efficient and productive operations. For example, our image sensors provide high-quality, global shutter imaging for factory automation applications including robotics and inspection systems.\n\nWe consider these products a key part of our triple bottom line product offering, which includes the following categories:\n\n- EV Charging\n- Factory Automation\n- ADAS Lidar\n- Vehicle Electrification\n- Medical\n- Machine Vision\n- Energy Infrastructure\n- Advanced Safety\n- Automotive Lighting\n\n### DISCLOSURE\n\n| DISCLOSURE                  | UNITS | 2022  | 2021  | 2020  |\n|-----------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Triple Bottom Line Revenue  | $ (Millions) | 1,462 | NR    | NR    |\n| People                      |       | 4,646 | NR    | NR    |\n| Planet                      |       | 346   | NR    | NR    |\n| Profit                      |       | 6,454 | 5,011 | 755   |\n| Percentage of Total Revenue | Percentage | 78    | 74    | 14    |\nTriple Bottom Line Products\n\nOur cutting-edge, sustainability-minded key technologies include:\n\n**ASPM16 \u2013 Exciter Module:** EV train systems rely on electromagnetic fields to operate. These electromagnetic fields can be created using permanent magnets or through induction technology. onsemi\u2019s ASPM16 Exciter Module enables the adoption of induction technology for EV traction drive applications, eliminating the need for permanent magnets. This is important as permanent magnets require the mining of rare earth elements such as neodymium and dysprosium, both of which have high rates of waste in their mining processes. According to Harvard International Review, approximately 2,000 tons of toxic waste is produced per ton of rare earth mineral.\n\nThe average hybrid or electric vehicle requires between two and five kilograms (kg) of rare earth magnets using neodymium and dysprosium. With the ASPM16 exciter modules sold in 2022, onsemi helped reduce over 662,000 metric tons of toxic mining waste by eliminating the need for permanent magnets in the EV application.\n\n**EliteSiC \u2013 SiC Power Modules:** onsemi\u2019s high-power density SiC power modules deliver the most innovative package technology to minimize parasitics and thermal resistance and offer robust package reliability using innovative interconnects. This leads to reduced power losses associated with DC to alternating current (AC) conversion along with reduced size and weight of the traction inverter, increasing performance and EV range by five percent.\n\nWith decades of superior packaging expertise in high-density power solutions for automotive applications, onsemi differentiated power module technology delivers industry-leading power traction solutions. Exceptional packaging technology alongside an evolutionary path from planar to trench cell structures in SiC enables onsemi to provide highly robust and reliable solutions to customers.\n\n**Top-Cool MOSFETs:** These devices feature top-side cooling to assist designers in challenging automotive applications, especially with motor control and DC/DC conversion. The thermal pad is on the top side which allows heat to be dissipated directly into a heatsink rather than via a typically printed circuit board (PCB). By using both sides of the PCB and decreasing the amount of heat going into it, the power density is increased and the improved reliability of the new design adds to an overall extended system lifetime. This product received the \u201cBest in Show\u201d award from Embedded Computing Design at the 2022 electronica show.\n\n**SiC \u2013 SiC is a key component of next-generation semiconductors that provides technical benefits and improves system efficiency in many applications, including EVs, EV charging and energy infrastructure. Our acquisition of GT Advanced Technologies (GTAT) secures full control of the SiC manufacturing supply chain, starting with the sourcing of silicon carbide powder and graphite raw material to the delivery of fully packaged SiC devices. This allows us to provide our customers with the assurance of supply required to meet the rapidly growing demand for SiC-based solutions.**\nProtecting Our Planet and Environment\n\nBreakthroughs for a Sustainable Future\n\nEnergy Consumption and Emissions\nWater and Waste Management\nEnvironmental Health and Safety\nEnergy Consumption and Emissions\n\nWe are dedicated to reducing our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy consumption and overall carbon footprint in alignment with our net zero by 2040 goal (Net Zero 2040). As stated in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report published in 2021\u20132022, it is unequivocal that human activities related to GHG emissions have warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. This warming has created widespread and rapid changes around the world including rising sea levels, melting glaciers and more frequent extreme weather events. Climate change is undeniable and the main driver of climate change is human-based activities.\n\nFor years, onsemi has taken steps to reduce GHG emissions and energy consumption throughout our operational footprint. We measure and report Scope 1 and 2 emissions at all our operational sites along with relevant categories of Scope 3 emissions. We know what gets measured, gets managed. Our emissions and energy management team has implemented policies and procedures to ensure our manufacturing sites are reporting accurate and complete data on a quarterly basis for emissions and energy consumption.\n\nAll emissions from Scope 1, 2 and 3 were calculated based on the GHG Protocol, an internationally recognized standard for quantifying and reporting GHG emissions. onsemi divested four manufacturing sites (various dates throughout 2022) located in Oudenaarde (Belgium), South Portland, Maine (USA), Pocatello, Idaho (USA) and Niigata (Japan). For annual reporting, energy usage and emissions from divested facilities are calculated through the date of divestiture.\n\nEnergy\n\nThe use of energy across the organization consists predominantly of purchased electricity and to a lesser extent natural gas, diesel fuel, town gas, heavy oil and liquified petroleum gas (LPG). Electricity emissions are considered Scope 2 emissions, while the other energy sources in this list are direct emissions and are considered Scope 1. Efficient use of energy across our operations is central to our success.\n\n| ENERGY CONSUMPTION BY SOURCE | UNITS | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|-----------------------------|-------|------|------|------|\n| Electricity                 | MWh   | 1,487,074 | 1,548,009 | 1,529,279 |\n| Renewable Electricity       |       | 0     | 0    | 0    |\n| Natural Gas                 |       | 172,028 | 173,332 | 166,646 |\n| Diesel Fuel                 |       | 3,170  | 4,536 | 8,957 |\n| Town Gas                    |       | 57,883 | 25,422 | 24,304 |\n| Heavy Oil                   |       | 30,121 | 28,734 | 24,993 |\n| LPG                         |       | 2,006  | 1,652 | 1,240 |\n| Energy from Grid            | Percentage | 100 | 100 | 100 |\n\n100% energy from the grid from 2020 \u2013 2022\nOur total energy use in 2022 was 1,752,282 megawatt hours (MWh) out of which 1,487,074 MWh was attributed to purchased electricity. This represents a two percent change in total energy and a 29,403 MWh reduction from our 2021 levels demonstrating our continued efforts for improvement in reducing our overall energy use. Our facilities reduced over 5,000 MWh of purchased electricity and 100,000 therms of natural gas (annualized estimate) through the implementation of customized energy conservation and energy efficiency measures at our existing manufacturing sites. These projects represent a total of roughly 3,150 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO\u2082e) saved with an estimated investment cost of over $1,200,000 spent across our enterprise. These include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Energy conservation measures associated with:\n  - Reducing chiller operational hours by sequencing chiller operations based on outside ambient temperature, which resulted in an annual energy savings of approximately 750,000 kilowatt hours (kWh) and $88,500 in annual cost savings at our Carmona (Philippines) and Seremban (Malaysia) sites.\n  - Reducing cooling tower operational hours by replacing inefficient fillers to help increase heat rejection efficiency. This measure resulted in an annual energy savings of approximately 180,000 kWh and $20,000 in annual cost savings at our Carmona and Seremban sites.\n  - Consolidation of vacuum pipelines across different facility regions to enable the shutdown of two inefficient vacuum pumps in the line, resulting in an annual energy savings of approximately 258,000 kWh and $36,000 in annual cost savings at our Carmona site.\n  - Isolation of compressed dry air pressure lines for specific process equipment needing higher pressure than the common line pressure. This measure resulted in an annual energy savings of approximately 168,000 kWh and $17,000 in annual costs savings at our ISMF (Malaysia) site.\n\n- Energy efficiency measures such as:\n  - Building Management System (BMS) upgrades with chilled water system controls to implement static pressure resets, supply air temperature reset and economizer optimizations within the air handler units at our Gresham, Oregon (U.S.) site. These energy efficiency measures resulted in annual energy and natural gas savings of approximately 347,000 kWh and 15,000 therms respectively translating to a total of about $28,000 in annual cost savings.\n  - Pre-heating of the deionized (DI) water loop using condenser heat recovered from the chillers in one of the buildings of our Roznov (Czech Republic) facility. This measure resulted in waste heat captured of around 4,000 gigajoules (GJ) per year which translates to approximately 36,000 therms of avoided natural gas use and an annual cost savings of $34,000.\n  - Replacement of 350 existing linear fluorescent bulb fixtures with light-emitting diode (LED) kits within specific areas of our buildings at our Roznov and ISMF facilities. These projects resulted in annual energy savings of approximately 100,000 kWh translating to $20,000 in annual cost savings.\n  - Installation of waste heat recuperators to recover heat from process equipment at our Bucheon (South Korea) facility, which resulted in an annual avoided gas savings of approximately 65,000 therms and $65,000 in annual cost savings.\n\nOur site personnel at each facility are committed to conserving and optimizing energy use through operational best practices and/or leveraging new technologies wherever possible, in alignment with the principle that \u201cthe cleanest energy is the energy that is not being used at our sites.\u201d\nScope 1 Emissions\n\nScope 1 emissions are direct emissions from company-owned and -controlled resources. The largest source of Scope 1 emissions is from fluorinated process gases used in manufacturing, with other examples of sources that include: fuels used in heating or furnaces and heat transfer fluids.\n\n**onsemi** Scope 1 emissions are managed jointly by our corporate ESG and manufacturing site teams across the globe. Our manufacturing site team members are responsible for updating quarterly usage data from our purchasing and consumption activities for fuels and fluorinated GHGs. At the corporate level, we monitor the data submitted by our teams to check for quality and completeness.\n\n**onsemi** uses an industry best practice calculation methodology consistent with IPCC Tier 2c guidance to calculate our process gas emissions; the methodology is thorough and accounts for the destruction of fluorinated gases within the semiconductor manufacturing process. 2022 is the first year **onsemi** is using this improved calculation methodology for our public emissions reporting, so there is a significant change in our reported Scope 1 emissions compared to the previous year.\n\n**onsemi** directly emits GHG emissions (Scope 1 emissions) from fabrication and assembly and test locations. We work to reduce Scope 1 emissions from process gases by:\n\n- Instating efficient manufacturing technologies and optimizing processes to reduce process gas usage.\n- Substituting gases that are utilized more effectively in processes or have lower global warming potential (GWP), resulting in lower emissions of unused and byproduct GHGs.\n- Installing point-of-use (POU) abatement devices that treat the exhaust of gases used in semiconductor manufacturing.\n\n### Scope 1 Emissions Intensity (MTCO\u2082e per $ Million Revenue)\n\n| Year | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|------|------|------|------|\n| Value | 0.1 | 0.1 | 0.1 |\n\n### Total Scope 1 GHG Emissions (Metric tons of CO\u2082e)\n\n| Year | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|------|------|------|------|\n| Value | 2,485,970 | 1,262,444 | 841,104 |\n\n\u00b9Starting in 2022, Scope 1 emissions are calculated based on discharged emissions, in line with the IPCC Tier 2c guidance. Per this guidance, we have claimed destruction of certain GHGs within our manufacturing process which lends to the large change in reported Scope 1 emissions compared to 2021 and 2020 emissions.\n\n\u00b2Scope 1 emissions for fiscal year 2022 include emissions from our divested facilities up to the date of divesture. Our Net Zero baseline for 2022 does not include these emissions.\n\n\u00b3Prior to 2022, **onsemi** reported Scope 1 emissions by gas type for its process gas usage only. Starting in 2022, this breakdown also includes the Scope 1 emissions from fuel usage and heat transfer fluids, aligning with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodology for reporting emissions.\n\n\u2074Includes CO\u2082 emissions from fuel combustion which was not included in our CO\u2082 emissions breakdown in previous years.\n\n\u2075Due to the claimed destruction values of NF3 within the semiconductor manufacturing process per IPCC Tier 2c guidance, there is a large decrease in NF3 emission year-over-year.\nScope 2 Emissions\n\nScope 2 emissions are indirect emissions resulting from the generation of purchased energy. For our purposes, this means our purchased electricity. onsemi indirectly emits GHG emissions from electricity purchased for the operations of our manufacturing and non-manufacturing sites. Our global Scope 2 emissions intensity, normalized by revenue for 2022, has reduced compared to our 2021 levels. This has largely been made possible due to the implementation of energy conservation and energy efficiency/optimization practices at our sites (as mentioned in the Energy Section of this report). In addition to these practices, we also implemented the following strategic initiatives in 2022 to further reduce our overall Scope 2 emissions:\n\n- Planned divestitures and downsizing of our manufacturing and non-manufacturing facilities:\n  - We divested from four of our existing manufacturing sites located in Oudenaarde (Belgium), South Portland, Maine (USA), Pocatello, Idaho (USA) and Niigata (Japan). These fab facilities consumed over 239,000 megawatt hours (MWh) in 2021 contributing to over 85,000 MTCO\u2082e in onsemi Scope 2 emissions.\n  - Downsizing and consolidation of over 25,000 square feet of non-manufacturing spaces comprised of offices and design centers throughout the world. These downsizing activities are estimated to result in approximately 150 MWh of avoided energy translating to a reduction of about 51 MTCO\u2082e from our 2021 levels.\n- Installation of energy-efficient equipment within newly acquired sites and site expansions:\n  - These include but are not limited to interior and exterior LED lighting systems; high efficiency packaged/split heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems; heat reclaim chillers; and dry cooling towers.\n\nScope 2 Emissions Intensity (MTCO\u2082e per $ Million Revenue)\n\n| Year | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|------|------|------|------|\n| 0    | 30   | 60   | 90   |\n| 120  | 150  | 180  | 210  |\n\nTotal Scope 2 GHG Emissions (Metric tons of CO\u2082e)\n\n| Year | 2021 | 2022 |\n|------|------|------|\n| 0    | 782,790 | 741,934 |\n| 100,000 | 774,849 |\n\n\u00b9Scope 2 emissions for fiscal year 2022 include emissions from our divested facilities up to the date of divesture. Our Net Zero baseline for 2022 does not include these emissions.\nScope 3 Emissions\n\nScope 3 emissions are indirect emissions that occur in the value chain of the company, including both upstream and downstream emissions. In 2021, onsemi tracked Scope 3 emissions related to our business travel. This year, onsemi\u2019s baseline Scope 3 emissions are more comprehensive and include 10 out of the 15 categories outlined in the GHG Protocol. Through our baselining process, five Scope 3 categories were concluded to be inapplicable to onsemi operations.\n\nFor 2022, a total emission of 2,143,211 MTCO\u2082e was calculated for Scope 3 alone, which accounts for 58 percent of our total GHG footprint. Since Purchased Goods and Services (Category 1 of Scope 3 emissions per GHG Protocol) account for a significant percentage of the total Scope 3 inventory, we anticipate reducing Scope 3 emissions by engaging with our supply chain partners and encouraging them to disclose their own greenhouse gas emissions and set their own science-based reduction targets, per Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) guidance. We are in the process of setting science-based targets for Scope 3 and will disclose more information, including pathways for Scope 3 emissions reduction, after the process.\n\n| GHG PROTOCOL CATEGORY | SCOPE 3 EMISSIONS CATEGORY\u00b9 (MTCO\u2082e) | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| 1                      | Purchased Goods and Services (PG&S)  | 1,414,941 | NR\u00b2 | NR\u00b2 |\n| 2                      | Capital Goods                        | 102,663 | NR\u00b2 | NR\u00b2 |\n| 3                      | Fuel- and Energy-related Activities (FERA) | 203,238 | NR\u00b2 | NR\u00b2 |\n| 4                      | Upstream Transportation and Distribution | 294,171 | NR\u00b2 | NR\u00b2 |\n| 5                      | Waste Generated in Operations        | 46,705 | NR\u00b2 | NR\u00b2 |\n| 6                      | Business Travel                      | 5,556 | 617 | 1,565 |\n| 7                      | Employee Commuting                   | 17,452 | NR\u00b2 | NR\u00b2 |\n| 8                      | Upstream Leased Assets               | 9 | NR\u00b2 | NR\u00b2 |\n| 10                     | Processing of Sold Products          | 13,992 | NR\u00b2 | NR\u00b2 |\n| 12                     | End-of-Life Treatment of Sold Products | 44,484 | NR\u00b2 | NR\u00b2 |\n| Total                  |                                      | 2,143,211 | 617 | 1,565 |\n\n\u00b9Applicable Scope 3 emission categories in line with GHG accounting standards from the GHG Protocol\n\u00b2Not Reported\n\n58% of our total GHG footprint was calculated to be from Scope 3 emissions.\nWater and Waste Management\n\nWater Stewardship\n\nWe\u2019re committed to ensuring our operations have a positive impact on the communities where we operate. We actively seek to avoid negative water-related impacts and strive for transparency with stakeholders, displaying deliberate stewardship of water as the important resource it is. We firmly believe that our reduction in water usage protects the shared commons of water resources, while also reducing the cost of processing. We continue to seek out opportunities to reduce, reuse and recycle water.\n\nAt onsemi, these opportunities include our ultrapure water (UPW) treatment process, mechanical cooling systems and recycling of treated water from wastewater plants (retreatment of process reject water, reverse osmosis reject water to flush facility toilets and retreatment of water after it\u2019s used in manufacturing processes).\n\nonsemi tracks water withdrawals at our manufacturing sites, which account for approximately 20 percent of our total facilities by count. Due to the massive amount of water used in our manufacturing processes, we estimate that our manufacturing facilities account for 85 percent or more of our total water use. We are exploring tracking our water use at our non-manufacturing sites to ensure we have the full scope of our water usage at onsemi.\n\nIn 2022, 515 megaliters of water were withdrawn from high water-stressed regions, out of the total 13,692 megaliters of water withdrawn (3.8% of total water withdrawn). As part of our commitment to water-use efficiency, 5,776 megaliters of water were recycled in 2022 (42% recycling rate).\n\nWater Usage\n\nUPW is a crucial ingredient in the semiconductor manufacturing process and is defined as having one to two parts of contaminating molecules per one million water molecules. onsemi treats water received from our municipal suppliers and other water sources to ensure that water used in relevant manufacturing processes meets this threshold. In 2022, onsemi produced around 6,000 megaliters of UPW.\n\nUPW is used in semiconductor manufacturing for washing excess chemicals and materials off surfaces of wafers and packaged products, to dilute chemicals used in the manufacturing process or as replacement water in cooling systems for critical applications. UPW can even be used as a humidification source for our cleanroom environments.\n\nonsemi also uses non-UPW in our facilities for operations outside of our manufacturing processes, such as facility cooling and heat transfer, drinking water, onsite kitchens and running our sanitary plumbing.\n\nBelow outlines the general process for creating UPW at our sites:\n\n| Step 1 | Pretreatment |\n|--------|--------------|\n| Step 2 | Reverse Osmosis |\n| Step 3 | Primary Ion Exchange |\n| Step 4 | Secondary Ion Exchange |\n| Step 5 | UV |\n| Step 6 | Final Filter |\n\nWATER USAGE\n\n| WATER USAGE | UNITS | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|-------------|-------|------|------|------|\n| Water Withdrawal | Megaliters | 13,692 | 13,599 | 14,332 |\n| Total Water Withdrawal | | | | |\n| Surface Water | | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Groundwater (renewable) | | 1,129 | 885 | 1,031 |\n| Seawater | | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Third Party Water | | 12,563 | 12,714 | 13,301 |\n| Water Withdrawal Intensity | | | | |\n| Revenue | Dollars (Billions) | 8.33 | 6.74 | 5.25 |\n| Water Withdrawal Intensity | Megaliter per $ Million Revenue | 1.64 | 2.02 | 2.73 |\n| Water Withdrawal in Water-Stressed Regions | | | | |\n| Extremely High\u00b9 | Megaliters | 0 | 271 | 275 |\n| High\u00b2 | | 515 | 1,727 | 1,081 |\n\n\u00b9Extremely high water-stressed regions include Oudenaarde (Belgium). onsemi divested from this site in 2022.\n\u00b2High water-stressed regions for 2021 and 2020 include Pocatello, Idaho (USA); Suzhou (China); and Tarlac (Philippines). For 2022, Tarlac (Philippines) was considered a medium-high water-stressed region, a change from 2021 during which it was reported as a high-water stressed region.\nWastewater Treatment\n\nAll wastewater produced in our manufacturing facilities is treated using advanced onsite wastewater treatment techniques before it is discharged to a municipality or other discharge point. Our wastewater treatment systems are complex, as the chemicals used in semiconductor manufacturing must be precipitated, removed and neutralized before the wastewater is discharged. The treatment process can include physical-chemical treatment, pH neutralization, carbon absorption treatment, biological treatment and tertiary treatment including ion exchange treatment and membrane treatment.\n\nThe level of treatment is stringent and meets the local government requirements in the areas we operate. onsemi monitors various metrics associated with our wastewater discharge to ensure compliance with pH, temperature, chemical oxygen demand (COD), color, heavy metals, fluorine and other regulated discharge parameters. In addition to our discharge monitoring systems, we perform laboratory analysis on our water discharge under local regulations. The laboratory analysis can occur on a weekly, monthly or quarterly basis depending on the region; however, some regions require real-time monitoring of wastewater discharge. onsemi is compliant with all applicable local regulations and requirements.\nWaste Management\n\nSemiconductor manufacturing generates both hazardous and non-hazardous waste, as classified under local government regulations. onsemi is committed to compliance with all legal and other requirements related to our waste management practices. We ensure there are processes and controls in place to effectively manage our waste streams and we strive to reduce the amount of waste directed to disposal through waste reduction and diversion. Our manufacturing sites provide waste diverted from disposal and waste directed to disposal data for both internal analysis and external reporting.\n\nWaste Diversion Rate (Percentage)\n\n| Year | Hazardous | Non-Hazardous | Total Waste Diversion Rate |\n|------|-----------|---------------|---------------------------|\n| 2022 | 40%       | 60%           | 80%                       |\n| 2021 | 45%       | 55%           | 80%                       |\n| 2020 | 50%       | 50%           | 80%                       |\n\n\u00b9Due to a redefinition of waste categorization, the amount of hazardous waste directed to disposal increased from 2020 to 2021. This lowered our hazardous waste diversion rate.\n\nTotal Waste Generated (Metric tons)\n\n| Year | Hazardous | Non-Hazardous | Total Generated |\n|------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| 2022 | 2,500     | 7,500         | 10,000          |\n| 2021 | 2,000     | 7,000         | 9,000           |\n| 2020 | 1,500     | 6,500         | 8,000           |\n\nWaste Diverted from Disposal\n\nWe strive to maximize waste diverted from disposal through the reduction of waste in manufacturing processes, reuse, recycling and other recovery operations. onsemi categorizes our waste diverted from disposal as shown below:\n\nHazardous and Non-Hazardous:\n\n- Preparation for reuse \u2013 by way of checking, cleaning or repairing, materials that have become waste are prepared to be used for the same purpose for which they were conceived.\n- Recycling \u2013 reprocessing of materials that have become waste to make new materials.\n- Other recovery operations \u2013 materials that have become waste are prepared to fulfill a purpose in place of new products that would otherwise have been used for that purpose.\n- Fuel Blending (not to incineration) \u2013 mixing waste and commercial fuel to meet the specifications needed for other use.\n\nTotal Waste Diverted from Disposal (Metric tons)\n\n| Year | Hazardous | Non-Hazardous | Total Diverted |\n|------|-----------|---------------|---------------|\n| 2022 | 1,500     | 6,000         | 7,500         |\n| 2021 | 1,000     | 5,500         | 6,500         |\n| 2020 | 500       | 5,000         | 5,500         |\n\nHazardous Waste Diverted from Disposal (Metric tons)\n\n| Year | Preparation for Reuse | Recycling | Other Recovery Options | Fuel Blending for Fuel (not for incineration) |\n|------|-----------------------|----------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| 2022 | 10%                   | 50%      | 30%                    | 10%                                         |\n| 2021 | 15%                   | 45%      | 30%                    | 10%                                         |\n| 2020 | 20%                   | 35%      | 30%                    | 10%                                         |\n\nNon-Hazardous Waste Diverted from Disposal (Metric tons)\n\n| Year | Preparation for Reuse | Recycling | Other Recovery Options | Fuel Blending for Fuel (not for incineration) |\n|------|-----------------------|----------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| 2022 | 10%                   | 50%      | 30%                    | 10%                                         |\n| 2021 | 15%                   | 45%      | 30%                    | 10%                                         |\n| 2020 | 20%                   | 35%      | 30%                    | 10%                                         |\nWaste Directed to Disposal\n\nDue to local regulations or limited opportunities for waste diversion, we must often direct the waste generated by our operations to disposal or incineration. We look for ways to reduce the amount of waste directed to disposal/incineration, as these solutions tend to reduce our waste management costs, as well as avoid negative impacts on human and environmental health, making waste reduction an overall good business strategy.\n\nHazardous and Non-Hazardous:\n\n- Incineration (with and without energy recovery) \u2013 controlled burning of waste at high temperatures.\n- Landfill \u2013 depositing solid waste at, below or above ground level at engineered disposal sites.\n- Other disposal operations \u2013 operations without recovery of materials sent to disposal.\n- The waste definitions that onsemi uses are from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards.\n\nHazardous Waste Directed to Disposal by Type (Metric tons)\n\n- Incineration (energy recovery)\n- Incineration (no energy recovery)\n- Landfilling\n- Other Disposal Options\n\nNon-Hazardous Waste Directed to Disposal by Type (Metric tons)\n\n- Incineration (energy recovery)\n- Incineration (no energy recovery)\n- Landfilling\n- Other Disposal Options\n\n*Due to a redefinition of waste categorization, the amount of hazardous waste directed to disposal increased from 2020 to 2021.\nReclamation Operation\n\nOur global reclaim objectives reflect our commitment to environmental sustainability and resource conservation while optimizing our network, protecting our intellectual property and maximizing and recapturing profits. onsemi\u2019s manufacturing scrap reclamation operations are considered to operate to industry best practice standards. Subcontractors are required to return dies (or wafers), trimmings in assembly and rejected units from assembly and test fallouts that are considered onsemi property. The manufacturing scrap collected from this process is separated into two categories: precious metals bearing material and non-precious metal bearing material.\n\nPrecious metal bearing materials include scrap devices, spent bead blast material, gold targets, wire and evaporator metallic, platinum targets, evaporator metallic and printed circuit boards. Precious metals have high intrinsic value and include gold, silver, platinum, palladium and rhodium.\n\nNon-precious metal bearing materials include copper and alloy 42 lead frames, plastics, stainless steel, aluminum, silicon and copper wire and tubing. Our manufacturing sites work with local vendors to sell or recycle the material recovered in the manufacturing scrap reclaim operation.\n\nIn June 2022, onsemi decentralized the scrap reclaim process eliminating the need to ship reclaimed material across the world for processing. We are working to aggregate our reclaim data at the corporate level since decentralizing this operation. From January through June 2022, prior to this decentralization, approximately 291,293 kg of scrap non-precious materials and 602 kg of scrap precious metals from our worldwide manufacturing facilities were processed, sorted and sold for reuse. The reclamation of these materials recouped more than $12 million.\n\nProjects diverting waste from disposal include the following examples:\n\nRoznov (Czech Republic) \u2013 We use iron wire to cut our silicon boules into raw wafers. These wires come shipped on a coil that gets loaded into our tools for use within our manufacturing process. Once the iron wire is spent, the coils are removed from our tools and repackaged to be returned to the supplier. The supplier then reuses the coil for future shipments of iron wire. Each coil sent back to the supplier weighs approximately 48 kilograms (kg). In 2022, onsemi returned 103 iron wire coils to our supplier, diverting about 5,000 kg of waste from disposal.\n\nBucheon (South Korea) \u2013 Our manufacturing process creates waste in the form of wastewater sludge. Normally, this waste would be directed to disposal, but our team in Bucheon has partnered with a local cement manufacturing facility to recover the wastewater treatment sludge and use it as a new material in the manufacturing of cement. Our wastewater sludge is high in nitrogen, which makes it an attractive additive in the cement manufacturing process. Through this partnership, we diverted 7,529 metric tons of waste from disposal and realized cost savings of over $182,000 in 2022.\n\nSeremban (Malaysia) \u2013 A key component of back-end semiconductor manufacturing is the plating process. In this process, metal is deposited onto the surface of semiconductor products, which protects against outside elements, enhances electrical conductivity and improves heat resistance. Through this process, water is used to wash away excess metals that were not deposited onto semiconductor products. Used water is then sent to our wastewater treatment plant to remove the metal and undergo other treatment processes before it is discharged from our facility. Once removed, metals are recovered and turned into metal hydroxide sludge that is diverted to a local reclaim operation and turned into metal concentrates, powders or ingots. In 2022, onsemi diverted roughly 202,000 kg of metal hydroxide sludge from the disposal.\nEnvironmental Health and Safety\n\nThe onsemi Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) team is committed to protecting people and ensuring compliance through our EHS Policy and Statement.\n\nEHS Policy\n\nonsemi protects people and minimizes our environmental impact through efforts to prevent injury, illness and pollution.\n\nEHS Statement\n\nonsemi consults with workers and encourages participants to identify hazards and reduce health and safety risks.

We encourage our managers to use fair performance management processes by setting clear expectations, delivering regular feedback and identifying career paths and development opportunities.\n\nPerformance Management\n\nonsemi\u2019s performance management process reinforces our commitment to recognize and distribute rewards that reflect each employee\u2019s personal contribution and ensures we distinguish top performers. We do this through our year-long performance management cycle, which will look different for each employee based on their role. The cycle includes goals, quarterly check-ins, self-assessments, 360 feedback, performance appraisals and annual performance conversations with a manager.\n\nIn 2022, all eligible employees received and completed a performance appraisal.\n\nCompensation and Awards\n\nTo recognize employees who make a positive impact at onsemi, we offer a variety of reward and performance recognition programs.\n\nThese programs include competitive base salaries, performance-based cash incentives and equity awards, an employee stock purchase plan (subject to location), comprehensive health-care plans and company contributions to retirement plans, which ensure employees have the means to adequately prepare for life after onsemi.\n\nBenefits and Programs\n\nonsemi offers a competitive benefits package that meets the needs of our diverse workforce.

To do this, employee feedback highlights what we are doing well and where we need to focus. In 2022, we had two important touchpoints: a monthly onboarding survey for new employees at their 90-day anniversary and a total company pulse survey at the end of the year to monitor progress on key initiatives and focus areas.\n\nNew Hire Onboarding Survey Highlights\n\nIn 2022, we launched a 90-day onboarding survey to check in on how things were going with our new hires. The purpose of the survey was to identify what was working well and what improvements were needed as we introduced new employees to the company. From the feedback collected, there was consistency in new employees understanding how their work contributed to company business objectives and feeling very positive overall about their onboarding for the first 90 days. Areas of improvement that were identified from the feedback included needing equipment, tools and resources to do their job effectively and providing information more readily to do their job. Improvement actions were taken to target the issues identified.\n\nPulse Survey Highlights\n\nIn 2022, the total company pulse survey was completed by 75 percent of our employees representing all company locations across the globe. The overall engagement score was 90 percent, a two-point increase from the previous year\u2019s score, suggesting that employees continue to feel very positively toward the company.\n\nOne way to ensure we understand employee sentiment and focus on the right improvement actions is to look at the progress made in the previous survey\u2019s focus areas.\n\nThe company exceeded target scores for the two 2021 focus areas: mitigate obstacles (goal 81 percent; actual 84 percent) and improve cross-organization communication (goal 78 percent; actual 84 percent). Several actions were implemented during 2022 to impact these focus areas.\n\nA new Goals Planning system was implemented to better align employee goals across the organization and enhance employee understanding of how their work supports the company strategy.\n\nA new Memo tool was deployed to document important information and decisions to be shared across organizations. This tool serves as a knowledge management system that is searchable and keeps a historical record for current and future reference.\n\nAnother improvement came with the deployment of the Beekeeper Mobile App for global employees. This app provides a platform for broadly communicating relevant company-wide information as well as building customized streams to communicate with specific groups. And most importantly, it connects employees without regular access to a computer to company and site-specific news and updates. Employees overall are satisfied with the company and would recommend it as a good place to work. They also enjoy good relationships with their peers and are aligned with the mission and vision of the company.\nCreating Meaningful Change\n\nGiving Now Program, Community Investments and Commercial Initiatives\nGiving Now Program, Community Investments and Commercial Initiatives\n\nCombined with our mission to propel the world forward with intelligent technology and a goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2040, we understand that how we work, impact the environment and give back makes a difference to the customers we serve and the communities in which we live.\n\nonsemi invests in our communities in three broad ways: through our corporate philanthropic Giving Now Program, Community Investments and Commercial Initiatives.\n\nWe have a passion to drive change and make the world a better place, building trust with stakeholders by empowering people through technology and advancing social impact initiatives. We demonstrate our commitment to social impact through our Giving Now philanthropic program, investments in our communities and commercial initiatives.\n\nThe Giving Now program was launched in early 2022 as part of our Tomorrow, today campaign. This campaign includes championing social responsibility, protecting our planet and the environment, adhering to responsible business practices and serving our communities through the investment of resources.\n\nonsemi supports giving activities through the ON Semiconductor Foundation (the Foundation), which is part of the onsemi Giving Now program. The Foundation, which was created in 2019, is overseen by an employee-based Board of Directors, who manage its daily operations and approve recommendations from global employees acting as local grant advisors.\n\nSince 2016, onsemi has funded more than $9 million in grants, disaster relief efforts, employee matching and dollars-for-doers for employee volunteerism, etc. Through our diverse network of grant advisors, we can carefully select our community partners based on need, while also considering cultural, institutional and operational differences across regions.\n\nThe Giving Now program drives positivity forward by creating meaningful change for our planet and the global communities where we have a presence. The Giving Now program prioritizes giving in three simple ways:\n\n1. **Give to Donate**\n   - Match employee giving and support volunteerism for causes they care about most.\n\n2. **Give to Educate**\n   - STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math) Education grants to help students in underserved communities achieve their dreams.\n\n3. **Give to Help**\n   - Provide local disaster relief and revitalize communities after emergencies.\nGive to Donate\n\nTo further engage employees in our social impact work, we also support employees in their monetary giving efforts by matching donations dollar-for-dollar up to $1,000 (or country equivalent) per year, per person, with a minimum of $1 (or country equivalent), to qualified organizations.\n\nWe understand the importance of having the company and its employees not only perform well, but also make a positive impact on people\u2019s lives. To increase employee engagement and enrich communities around the world, we expanded volunteer program benefits to employees in Asia and Europe. We initially introduced the employee volunteer program in North America in 2017, inspiring employees to volunteer their time, talent, energy and effort in their local communities.\n\nThrough our employee volunteer program, employees may volunteer with eligible organizations during company time for up to one day, traditionally eight to 12 hours per year depending on their role at the company, while receiving their typical pay for the time spent. Employees are also encouraged to participate in volunteer events organized by the company.\n\nTo incentivize these positive contributions, we also match employees\u2019 volunteer efforts through a dollars-for-doers program, where onsemi donates $10 (or country equivalent) per hour to approved charities and educational institutions for each hour volunteered up to $1,000 (or country equivalent) per year, per employee (this equates to a volunteer matching grant, which goes directly back to the cause they supported as a volunteer). These employee volunteer program benefits are now offered to all employees globally and over 1,800 hours were logged by employees in 2022.\n\nWith these expanded benefits being offered globally in 2022, many of our sites hosted days of service to our employees to give them the ability to volunteer their time conveniently and in a meaningful way. Learn more here.\n\nonsemi also held special activities during Global Volunteer and Earth Months in April 2022. The environmental, social and governance (ESG) team organized local in-person events in partnership with previous grantees for headquartered employees in Arizona. Employees packed School Readiness Kits with the Valley of the Sun United Way, cleaned the Rio Salado Habitat Restoration Area with the Arizona Sustainability Alliance and kept public lands clean at the Lower Salt River with Natural Restorations.\n\nIn addition to these in-person events, onsemi organized global virtual volunteer events in partnership with Visit.org, including having employees volunteer to learn more about how to make a positive impact by practicing environmentally friendly habits for one month and meeting with a climate scientist to deepen their knowledge around climate change. In one of the online sessions, onsemi employees learned about five focus areas created by Ecochallenge using the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Each focus area contained 11 actions that individuals can take daily to integrate sustainability into their lives.\n\nOverall, we doubled employee impact with over $235,000 in matching support tied to these programs. These initiatives allowed us to harness the collective goodwill of our people and channel it to make a difference in the world while also enabling our employees to have a powerful impact as a volunteer.\nGive to Help\n\nWe provide local disaster relief support, helping to revitalize communities after emergencies. In 2022, we supported these efforts with direct donations of $195,000 to various agencies.\n\nIn February 2022, we aided the humanitarian crisis in Europe. We not only assisted the Ukrainian people but those affected by other ongoing humanitarian crises around the world and provided $150,000 in support for two organizations providing immediate relief and assistance.\n\nThe Global Giving Foundation\u2019s Ukraine Crisis Relief Fund received $100,000 to support impacted communities in Ukraine and surrounding regions, including Romania, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, where Ukrainian refugees fled. The U.S. Association for UNHCR received $50,000 to support the United Nations (UN) Refugee Agency, which works in 132 countries and territories providing disaster relief and support for the over 82.4 million people around the world who have been forced to flee their homes.\n\nAdditionally, we matched our employees\u2019 donations dollar-for-dollar and these campaigns resulted in more than $65,000 being given to causes globally that helped during these disasters to provide shelter, food and medicine.\n\nGive to Educate\n\nonsemi, through the Foundation, is committed to building brighter futures through funding science, technology, engineering, the arts and math (STEAM) activities for underprivileged youth in underserved communities. These efforts help to inspire young scholars to get excited about STEAM. In Fall 2022, the Foundation was able to award approximately $738,000 in grants to 39 organizations globally. Funding for various STEAM projects included afterschool programs, field trips, summer camps, experiential learning for students and educator/teacher upskilling. Learn more about the organizations that received funding during the fall 2022 grant cycle here.\n\nTOP FIVE GLOBAL PHILANTHROPIC CAUSES SUPPORTED BY EMPLOYEE AND COMPANY MATCH DONATIONS\n\n| Cause Name | Total Employee and Company Match Donations ($) | Cause Country | Cause Category |\n|------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------|\n| CLOVEK V TISNI, O.P.S.

Suspected child abuse cases in Bucheon City have significantly increased over the past few years \u2013 in 2022 alone, there were approximately 700 child abuse cases reported. This project addresses the emotional aftereffects of abuse and prevents its recurrence. The initiative is in its third year of implementation and is continuing to support abused children and their families, while introducing a safeguarding policy in child welfare institutions.\n\nIn March 2022, onsemi leaders participated in a teambuilder activity located in Phoenix, AZ (USA), during the first Leadership Summit, which resulted in a hands-on volunteer project for Boys & Girls Clubs of the Valley. As part of their tasks, over 100 managers assembled 60 mBot kits and 240 circuitry science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) kits benefiting after-school STEM programs at two of the charity\u2019s local branches. This project equated to an in-kind donation of $6,700 and 170 hours of volunteer time logged, producing a volunteer matching grant of $1,700 for the charity. This investment of new resources helped these clubs accomplish their STEAM programming efforts as well as increased interest from participating youth in their computer and technology skills.\n\nIn an effort to donate office goods while in the process of preparing for the move of our corporate headquarters, we worked with local Phoenix, AZ (USA) charities to accept new and gently used items, calculated at over $22,000, which were given to following organizations: The Salvation Army, Arizona; Habitat for Humanity of Central Arizona and Stardust Building Supplies. The donated materials include food/drinks, paper products, file cabinets and more.\n\n**Leshan Special Education School.**\n\nSchool uniforms and air-conditioning units were donated to improve the quality of life of students. Founded in 1985, the public school provides basic, vocational and rehabilitation education for blind, deaf and mentally handicapped students.\n\nIn December 2022, our Leshan (China) site supported the Leshan Special Education School. School uniforms and air-conditioning units were donated to improve the quality of life of students. Founded in 1985, the public school provides basic, vocational and rehabilitation education for blind, deaf and mentally handicapped students.\n\nWe donated over 4,600 items (former company branding items and various office supplies) at fair market value of more than $23,000 to Phoenix-based charity, Treasures 4 Teachers, a member-based resource and supply store serving the educators of Arizona. These items helped students get access to a wide selection of materials to help expand their learning process.\n\nThe onsemi team at our Leshan (China) site has been a dedicated supporter of the Yanfeng Hope School since the school opened its doors in 2000, providing a safe and nurturing environment for the 700 students enrolled there. In December 2022, we donated new uniforms, a ping-pong table and a badminton net. These items helped to foster an atmosphere of learning and growth among the students, promoting their potential while also providing them with enriching pastimes.\n\nIn an effort to donate office goods while in the process of preparing for the move of our corporate headquarters, we worked with local Phoenix, AZ (USA) charities to accept new and gently used items, calculated at over $22,000, which were given to following organizations: The Salvation Army, Arizona; Habitat for Humanity of Central Arizona and Stardust Building Supplies.

The board and its standing committees have at least four scheduled meetings annually to review and discuss reports by management, as well as the performance of the company. Our corporate governance principles set forth certain requirements under which the board and management operate.\n\nBoard of Directors Summary\n\nThis summary represents the members of onsemi\u2019s Board of Directors and committee representation, effective immediately following the Annual Meeting in May 2023.

To measure its own operation against such principles and practices and to identify and act on areas for improvement, each member of the board and its committees performs an annual self-evaluation. The Governance and Sustainability (GS) Committee is charged with overseeing the self-evaluations, and in 2022, the GS Committee used the following process to conduct the board\u2019s self-evaluation:\n\n- Input from Board Chair and Chair of the GS Committee\n- Input from Corporate Secretary\n- Development of Self-Assessment Tools\n- Results sent to Board Chair and are reviewed by Board Chair and Chair of the GS Committee\n- Self-Assessment Launch and Processing of Results\n- Board Chair and Chair of the GS Committee review results with full board in executive session\n- Board Review\n- Changes to practices are considered and implemented, as appropriate\n- Results inform the board\u2019s refreshment, recruitment and selection process\n\nCommittee Details\n\nonsemi\u2019s Board of Directors has established four standing committees:\n1. Audit Committee\n2. Governance and Sustainability Committee\n3. Human Capital and Compensation (HCC) Committee\n4. Executive Committee\n\nEach committee is tasked with overseeing various aspects of the company and carrying out the responsibilities specified in its respective charter. To view a copy of the formal written charter pertaining to each standing committee, please visit the Investor Relations section of our website.\n\nCommittee Meetings\n\n| COMMITTEE MEETINGS | CHARTER REQUIRED MIN. | IN 2022 |\n|--------------------|-----------------------|--------|\n| Audit              | quarterly meetings    | 9      |\n| Executive          | meet as needed        | 2      |\n| Governance and Sustainability | quarterly meetings | 5      |\n| Human Capital and Compensation | quarterly meetings | 6      |\n\nBoard Oversight of ESG\n\nThe GS Committee has the responsibility of overseeing environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters unless there is a specific matter connected to ESG initiatives that is assigned to another committee of the board.\n\nFor example, the HCC committee has the responsibility of overseeing the company\u2019s policies and strategies with respect to human capital, which includes diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). The HCC committee considers DEI in its broader review of pay equity within the company; however, both the GS committee and the HCC committee play a role in the management and oversight of DEI. Meanwhile the GS Committee has also been tasked with oversight of climate- and sustainability-related initiatives and our other actions associated with the environment. In turn, the GS Committee will assist the board in providing guidance and oversight in respect of strategy, risk management, capital expenditures, opportunities and investments in the context of climate change.\n\nOne way the board and the HCC committee sought to oversee ESG and ensure such initiatives were a priority in 2022 was by tying aspects of onsemi\u2019s 2022 compensation program to Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Our 2022 long-term incentive compensation program was designed so that part of the payout for performance-based restricted stock units for our executive team related to the establishment of baseline Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions in connection with our roadmap to achieving net zero emissions by 2040.\nEnterprise Risk Management and Business Continuity\n\nThe mission of our enterprise risk management (ERM) program is to drive strategic capabilities that preserve and create value for our company by embedding a risk-aware decision-making culture across all functions. To that end, we have developed a process and framework to effectively identify, evaluate, prioritize, manage and report key risks that can impact our company\u2019s ability to achieve strategic goals and objectives.\n\nWe identify critical risks by interviewing key stakeholders within the company and reviewing external research on the risk landscape. The risks identified and prioritized for action are closely tied with the company\u2019s operating and strategic plan. Risk response actions and commitments are tracked for completion on a regular basis. Ultimately, ERM is not considered a separate stand-alone activity, but is rather integrated into the fabric of how we operate and included within the activities and functions we engage in to run our business and successfully achieve our goals and objectives.\n\nWe consider risks across multiple time horizons to align with our business strategy and financial planning activities. We also look at longer-term horizons to capture emerging risks and long-term trends.\n\nManagement Approach\n\nOur ERM program is overseen by a risk committee comprised of the CEO, chief financial officer (CFO), chief legal officer (CLO), executive vice president (EVP) of Operations and Manufacturing and chief strategy officer (CSO). To maintain accountability at the highest functional level, executive staff members are appointed as risk sponsors for individual risks and work with risk owners who manage the risk on a day-to-day basis. The Board of Directors have oversight responsibility as they ensure appropriate risk management systems are in place and that risk-awareness is incorporated in the business strategy and decision-making.\nClimate Scenario Analysis & Risk Disclosure\n\nClimate-related risks and opportunities impact business units (BUs) and functional departments across the organization in unique and nuanced ways. At onsemi, climate-related risks and opportunities are assessed, managed and realized at the highest level of the organization; we believe that the responsibility of operationalizing mitigation and adaptation strategies in response to climate-related risks and opportunities must be integrated at every level of the company, ensuring the success of our risk management program and giving us the ability to act nimbly at all levels when needed.\n\nClimate Scenario Analysis\n\nonsemi uses scenario analysis to understand the impacts of climate change on our business operations, corporate strategy and value chain. By understanding the presumed operational context of different decarbonization trajectories, we can identify potential climate-related physical and transitional risks that could conceivably pose a material impact. These scenarios are not intended to predict the future, but instead, help us understand our potential risk exposure and build resilience through activities to enhance our preparedness.\n\nUsing three plausible, distinctive, consistent, relevant and challenging climate scenarios, onsemi executive leadership, various functional owners and the ESG team participated in a climate scenario analysis. Led by an external advisory firm, this analysis informed the development of a climate adaptation and resilience plan for implementation at the company. Scenarios used assume various degrees of warming by 2100 and include social, technological, economic and political developments considered plausible under each warming trajectory.\n\nThe three scenarios used to inform the development of a climate action plan for onsemi include:\n\n1. **Failure to Decarbonize:** Runaway climate change resulting in warming above 3\u00b0C by 2100, international cooperation breakdowns and increased potential for irreversible effects of climate change.\n\n2. **Orderly Decarbonization:** Orderly decarbonization resulting in warming limited to 1.5\u00b0C by 2100, advancement development, adoption of sustainable technology and global policies for decarbonization, including carbon pricing.\n\n3. **Disorderly Decarbonization:** Disorderly decarbonization resulting in warming around 2\u00b0C by 2100, the abrupt and uneven introduction of climate policies and increased financial consequences of climate change.\n\nThrough this exercise, relevant climate-related risks and opportunities were identified and socialized for inclusion in our overall business strategy.\nRisk & Opportunity Disclosure\n\nAt onsemi, we have identified potential climate-related risks and opportunities, which could impact our business continuity, strategy and financial planning. Risks identified include transitional and physical risks with the capacity to impact our own operations and value chain including our financials, supply chain, workforce, company disclosures and reputation.\n\nClimate-related opportunities identified include transitional and physical opportunities related to increasing demand for onsemi products and an increase in tangible and intangible asset values. Our identified climate-related risks and opportunities can impact onsemi over the near, medium and long term depending on the risk or opportunity development and maturity.\n\nFor a full list of onsemi\u2019s climate-related risks and opportunities see the Risk and Opportunity Disclosure tables within our Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure in the appendix of this report, pg. 92.\n\nManagement Response to Risk and Opportunities\n\nThrough our scenario analysis, we have identified various action planning and trigger monitoring activities to build resilience to potential climate-related risks. We\u2019re exploring the development of internal controls and procedures, adaptation and mitigation plans, identification of trigger events to inform future action and no-regret actions to be taken in response to the outcomes of our climate scenario analysis. Owners will be assigned to monitor and manage relevant climate-related risks to ensure actions are being taken when appropriate to ensure the resilience of business operations and strategies.\n\nOur scenario analysis detailed important metrics to help us assess and monitor climate-related risks and opportunities in line with our strategy and risk management process. onsemi will explore monitoring the following metrics:\n\n- Product energy, water and emissions intensity\n- R&D expenditures for low-carbon products\n- Percentage of expenditure on energy efficiency\n- Total energy consumption included percentage from renewables\n- Total greenhouse gas emissions\n- Investment in climate adaptation measures\n- R&D expenditure on products that support customer decarbonization\n\nBy identifying and monitoring our climate-related risks and opportunities, we can work to set further targets used to build resilience and reduce potential negative impacts from identified risks and realize potential positive impacts from identified opportunities.\n\nBusiness Continuity\n\nonsemi understands the importance of business continuity and having systems of prevention, preparation and recovery in place to assist with the disruption of business functions and processes that could affect our customers, partners and other stakeholders. Our business continuity program systematically, consistently and effectively identifies and evaluates priorities and manages key risks and opportunities affecting the company.\n\nWe engage with internal and external industry experts to conduct risk assessments at our facilities and suppliers to identify areas of opportunity. The types of risks we face include: 1) key equipment failures; 2) interruption from externally provided products, processes and services; 3) recurring natural disasters (such as earthquakes, floods, volcanic eruptions); 4) fires; 5) utility interruptions, such as power outages; 6) cyber-attacks on information systems; 7) labor shortages; 8) infrastructure disruptions, such as breakdown of transportation, water or sewage; and 9) pandemics. Additionally, we mitigate certain risks proactively through the qualification of certain products to a secondary production source.\n\nWe maintain a rigorous process in which we are consistently analyzing risks and working to reduce the likelihood and impact of negative events, while identifying how to capitalize on the opportunities provided by the dynamic market and supply chain in which we operate. We recognize that no amount of mitigation and prevention can stop all negative impact events from occurring and engage in a robust process of planning for the response and recovery operations required to minimize impact to our customers, partners and stakeholders.\nEthics and Compliance\n\nonsemi's ethics and compliance program is designed to assist us in preventing, detecting and responding to unethical or illegal conduct, and promote an organizational culture of integrity, accountability and compliance with the law. To do this, ethics and compliance are integrated into every level of our company from the Board of Directors and CEO to individual employees across the globe.\n\nEthics and Compliance Program\n\n- Provide Oversight and Accountability\n- Develop Policies, Procedures and Tools\n- Assess Risk\n- Communicate and Train\n- Engage, Investigate and Report\n- Continue to Improve\n\nCode of Business Conduct\n\nonsemi's Code of Business Conduct outlines the broad principles of legal and ethical conduct embraced by our company core values of respect, integrity and initiative, which guide every business decision. It is the responsibility of our directors, officers and employees to comply with local laws and regulations, embrace our core values and exemplify our commitment to operating ethically.\n\nThe Code is structured to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977; the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and the Listing Rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc., among other laws and regulations. The ethics and compliance team reviews the Code regularly and ensures the Code is available for employees to review in 14 languages, making it easily accessible to employees in all regions where we do business. Every year, the Board of Directors and all employees are required to read and acknowledge their understanding of the Code by taking an online training course. Managers and employees are required to complete workplace harassment awareness training on an annual basis and as tailored to meet any specific legislative requirements based on their work location. We also require managers and other select individuals to complete additional compliance-related training courses related to topics such as data privacy, trade compliance, etc., depending on areas of focus.\n\n14 languages make the Code accessible to employees in all regions where we do business.\nEthics and Compliance Program\n\nThe program aims to implement ethical principles into everyday business operations by providing relevant training and practical guidance, targeted communications and dedicated resources. onsemi aspires to be a global leader in demonstrating the power of aligning business objectives with doing the right thing. The ethics and compliance team administers and executes the full program that manages the Code of Business Conduct (Code), related training and education, and oversees the intake, triage and resolution of complaints and questions from our company helpline or other reporting channels. Our employees are empowered and encouraged to report potential ethics and compliance violations. Working closely with key onsemi partners, the ethics and compliance team ensures all concerns are promptly and thoroughly investigated without retaliation.\n\nonsemi always strives to comply with the law, and in certain areas, we have adopted policies and practices that go beyond what the law requires to foster a culture of integrity and accountability. The law department\u2019s programs for anti-corruption, trade compliance and data privacy are designed to include all the essential elements for effective compliance, including risk assessments, policies and procedures, training, and monitoring and auditing thorough investigations and remediation of misconduct. These legal compliance programs are dynamic and continually evolving as our company grows and the business landscape changes.\n\nThe BEL network is essential to the continual strengthening of the company\u2019s ethical foundation and culture of integrity.\n\nEthics is a top-down and bottom-up process at our company, and every employee is encouraged to talk about ethics, raise concerns and share their experiences.\n\nonsemi Business Ethics Liaisons\n\nOur network of Business Ethics Liaisons (BELs) across the globe serves a critical role in promoting and institutionalizing an ethical culture throughout our global operations. The CEO sets the tone at the top by communicating expectations and holding managers accountable for delivering on those expectations. BELs further amplify these expectations at the local and site levels, serving as a trusted resource for employees seeking guidance or wishing to raise a concern. The BEL network, which is comprised of employees of many job functions and grade levels, is essential to the continual strengthening of the company\u2019s ethical foundation and culture of integrity. Through quarterly calls, BELs get the chance to review reporting metrics, share best practices, receive training and discuss benchmarking trends in ethics and compliance.\n\nThe availability of BELs often gives employees access to a peer with whom they may raise potential concerns outside HR and their management chain. The accessibility of this additional reporting channel helps our company integrate ethics and compliance into our culture by building trust at the local level. We consider the fact employees choose to raise concerns to BELs, more than any other reporting channel, to reflect the strength of the ethics and compliance programs.\n\nAvenues for Reporting\n\nEmployees have access to several reporting channels including a helpline (managed by a third party and available 24x7 with translator availability to support locations where we do business); the BELs; members of the ethics and compliance team; and direct access to the chief compliance officer and senior director, ethics and compliance. Further, unless restricted by local law, employees may report to the helpline anonymously.\n\nGovernance Structure\n\nCEO and President\n\nBoard of Directors, Audit Committee\n\nChief Legal Officer, Chief Compliance Officer\n\nSenior Director, Ethics and Compliance\n\nEthics and Compliance\n\nBusiness Ethics Liaisons, CSR Site Champions, and Subject Matter Experts\n\nKey Stakeholders\n\nEnvironmental Health and Safety, Global Security, Global Supply Chain Operations, Human Resources, Internal Audit and other Members of the Law Department\n\nHelpline\n\nU.S.: 1-844-935-0213\n\nAll other locations: Click here for country-specific instructions.\n6 sites were recognized for their efforts in supporting our global commitment to being a model corporate citizen.\n\nFair Treatment\n\nonsemi is committed to preserving and promoting the fundamental rights of others and ensuring everyone is awarded fair treatment. Our company Code of Business Conduct, as well as the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) code covers human rights in several areas, ensuring we have a comprehensive stance on human rights and fair treatment that applies to all onsemi employees, joint ventures, major suppliers, select service providers, contractors and products and services. We have several sites with collective bargaining agreements and we respect our employees freedom of association with these groups.\n\nTo ensure our approaches are regularly updated, we engage all relevant groups including, but not limited to, ethics and compliance, environmental, health and safety, HR, legal, global security and supply chain in our review and due diligence process. Every individual and department are responsible for understanding and upholding the fundamental rights of others.\n\nRBA Member\n\nThe RBA is the world\u2019s largest industry coalition dedicated to corporate social responsibility (CSR) in global supply chains. As an RBA member, onsemi is required to commit to and be held accountable to a common Code of Conduct and utilize a range of RBA training and assessment tools to support continual improvement in the social, environmental and ethical responsibility of their supply chains. The RBA regularly engages in dialogue and collaborations with workers, governments, civil society, investors and academia to gather the necessary range of perspectives and expertise to support and drive its members toward achieving the RBA mission and values of a responsible global electronics supply chain.\n\nonsemi has been a member since 2009 and we reaffirm our commitment to the alliance annually.\n\nValidated Assessment Program (VAP)\n\nOne of the most fundamental RBA programs is the Validated Assessment Program (VAP). It is the leading standard for onsite compliance verification and effective, shareable audits.\n\nAbout half of our manufacturing facilities are scheduled for VAP audits through RBA annually. We conduct internal RBA audits annually to ensure those facilities not slated for an official RBA VAP audit are remaining compliant to RBA Code standards. In 2022, 10 out of 18 onsemi manufacturing facilities were subject to internal audits and 10 manufacturing sites participated in initial or closing RBA VAP audits. Two onsemi manufacturing sites, Gresham, Oregon (USA) and Nampa, Idaho (USA) were audited both internally and externally due to the rescheduling of our internal audits in 2022.\n\nThe primary value of an onsite compliance audit is the correction of identified issues. The RBA recognizes factories that show a commitment to corporate responsibility through verified closure of the issues identified in a VAP audit.\n\nIn 2022, six out of 10 onsemi sites were recognized for their efforts in supporting our global commitment to being a model corporate citizen. The sites were awarded certificates from the RBA.\n\nDuring 2022, VAP external audits were conducted by independent third parties and we received the following recognitions:\n\n- Platinum (minimum VAP score of 200 and all Priority, Major and Minor findings closed): Nampa, Idaho (USA) and Roznov (Czech Republic)\n- Gold (minimum VAP score of 180 and all Priority and Major findings closed): Aizu (Japan) and OSBD (Vietnam)\n- Silver (minimum VAP score of 160 and all Priority findings closed): Seremban Site One (Malaysia) and Gresham, Oregon (USA)\nHuman Rights\n\nOur formalized Human Rights Policy demonstrates our commitment to preserving, protecting and promoting the fundamental rights of others as reflected in the RBA Code of Conduct, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and UN Global Compact to which we are a signatory. Our commitment to international human rights standards and local laws are rooted in our core values and reinforced through our Code of Business Conduct and other company policies.\n\nPrevention of Slavery and Human Trafficking\n\nTo prevent slavery and human trafficking, we implemented our Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy Statement, which ensures we are aware of and have zero tolerance toward human rights violations. We have implemented policies, procedures and management systems to ensure that all work at our company is voluntary and that workers are legally entitled to leave the company without penalty. onsemi also ensures that workers\u2019 government-issued identification, original work permits and original personal documentation are not withheld or otherwise destroyed, concealed or confiscated by our company or its labor agents. We train our HR staff and labor agents on the company\u2019s practices related to anti-human trafficking and conduct onsite verification to ensure compliance. Incidents of slavery and human trafficking are also verified in our supply chain using risk assessments and site visits. Our employees and other stakeholders are encouraged to report any concerns they may have on human trafficking through our ethics hotline, the global trafficking hotline at 1-844-888-FREE or emailing help@befree.org.\n\nPrevention of Child Labor\n\nOur practice on the use of child and young labor is based upon our global minimum employment age policy, which is reiterated in our Human Rights policy. The purpose of this policy is to define and ensure that sufficient measures and controls are in place to verify the minimum age of individuals working at our company. As a rule, we only employ individuals who are at least 18 years of age by the first day of employment. The only exception to this rule is in China, where the minimum age for employment is 16 years old. To confirm candidates for employment meet the minimum age requirement, members of our HR department perform due diligence to make sure we are complying with federal, state, regional and local requirements. The global minimum age policy also describes the process to be followed and protection afforded to discovered child laborers.\n\nWe apply the same minimum age requirement for employment at our supplier companies and labor agencies. We work to ensure that our suppliers have the necessary policies, procedures, measures and controls in place through risk assessments and onsite verification to avoid incidents of child labor within our supply chain.\n\nFreedom of Association\n\nIn accordance with local laws, we recognize the freedom of employees to establish or join an organization of their choosing, to bargain collectively, to engage in peaceful assembly or to refrain from such activities. We respect the right of our employees to associate without fear of pressure, retaliation or reprisal. We also encourage open communication on work-related topics, guidance or concerns with direct managers, department heads, division general managers, human resources, BELs or a member of the ethics and compliance team.\n\nEmployees Covered by Collective Bargaining Agreements (Percentage)\n\n| EMPLOYEES COVERED BY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Total workforce                                       | 26.5 | 26.2 | NR   |\n\n1-844-888-FREE is our global trafficking hotline where employees and other stakeholders are encouraged to report any concerns.\nSupply Chain\n\nWe are committed to ensuring the highest standards of social responsibility where we live and work. We require that our suppliers provide safe working conditions, treat workers with dignity and respect, prohibit human trafficking and slavery (including the procurement of commercial sex acts and the use of forced or child labor), promote ethical behavior, as well as use environmentally responsible manufacturing processes and follow principles like those in our Code of Business Conduct. As outlined in our Supplier Handbook, the supplier must conform to all environmental and other applicable laws and regulations, behave ethically, comply with all social responsibility and conflict mineral requirements that are required by onsemi\u2019s CSR Statement of Commitment and provide any requested certifications and cascade all applicable requirements through their supply chain.\n\nManagement Approach\n\nWe operate a flexible, reliable and responsive supply chain that is compliant with IATF-16949 and ISO 9001 requirements as defined in our internal policies. We continually develop business partnerships with selected key suppliers and ensure that all purchased materials used in product manufacturing satisfy current governmental, environmental and safety criteria applicable to the country of manufacture and sale. Our transportation packaging meets electrostatic discharge requirements and appropriate use of packing is used to prevent physical damage. Through our sales and operations planning process, we work directly with our business units and sales teams to align capacity and demand to support customer requirements.\n\nOur Suppliers\n\nOur supply chain has a multifaceted supply structure of direct materials suppliers, foundry and subcontractor providers, indirect material suppliers and professional service providers deployed across a global sourcing and procurement organization. In 2022, onsemi worked with 9,700 suppliers and service providers globally, of which, approximately 7,100 were production related.\n\nSupplier Diversity\n\nWhen possible, we prioritize purchasing from local suppliers. The following graphic shows the percentage of our 2022 procurement budgets which were spent on suppliers local to the site\u2019s region. In 2021 and 2020, we tracked this information only at the manufacturing level. Moving forward, this data will represent total company procurement.\n\nAdditionally, in the United States, we track suppliers that are owned by minority populations. During our supplier onboarding process, suppliers are asked to disclose whether they belong to a minority group as defined in the Spend by Minority Group table. We then track our annual spend towards these suppliers against the total U.S. spend.\n\n| SPEND ON LOCAL SUPPLIERS | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|--------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Asia                     | 87.9%| 90.5%| 91.9%|\n| EMEA                     | 76.3%| 83.7%| 82.9%|\n| North America            | 86.9%| 90.3%| 91.2%|\n| onsemi total             | 83.7%| 88.2%| 88.7%|\n\n| SPEND BY MINORITY GROUP | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|-------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Small Business          | 4.05%| 4.32%| 4.86%|\n| Woman Owned             | 0.15%| 0.17%| 0.23%|\n| Minority Owned          | 0.05%| 0.04%| 0.03%|\n| Small Disadvantaged     | 0.02%| 0.04%| 0.03%|\n| onsemi total U.S. spend on minority owned businesses | 4.27%| 4.57%| 5.15%|\n\nIn 2022 onsemi worked with 9,700 suppliers and service providers globally.\nManaging Risk in the Supply Chain\n\nWe understand that supply chain risks have the potential to cause disruptions to our manufacturing process, alter our ability to deliver our products to our customers and create a ripple effect impacting all stakeholders. Our procurement team currently uses several models to manage risk in our supply chain.\n\nFor new supplier selection, we consider the financial strength, quality track record, geography, social responsibility compliance and technology of such supplier. Once selected, they are required to adhere to the onsemi Supplier Code of Conduct outlined in our Supplier Handbook. We conduct bi-annual RBA conformance certification and engage with our suppliers in regular cycles by clearly communicating our expectations, deploying risk assessments, conducting business reviews, launching verification audits and addressing any non-conformance.\n\nonsemi identifies and monitors suppliers that fall in the top 80 percent annual production-related spending as required by being a full member of RBA. These suppliers are required to complete RBA\u2019s online self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ) annually. The SAQ evaluates suppliers on a host of different risk parameters including labor, environment, health and safety and ethics. Suppliers that fall within the identified threshold must share and release the SAQ to onsemi through the RBA online platform after completion. Our teams work with suppliers flagged as high risk through RBA\u2019s SAQ process to develop corrective action plans and ensure these risk areas are addressed accordingly.\n\nResponsible Minerals Sourcing\n\nResponsible minerals sourcing has progressed beyond tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold (3TG) to address global human rights violations especially with the emerging focus on forced labor. As an active member of the RBA and Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), onsemi continually engages in reasonable and responsible due diligence with its key suppliers, consistent with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (CAHRAs).\n\nonsemi has included cobalt in the Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy posted on our website. We required our key suppliers to engage in due diligence by completing the RMI\u2019s Conflict Extended Minerals Reporting Template (EMRT) for cobalt.\n\nUsing RMI\u2019s Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT) for 3TG due diligence, onsemi sets the target of using 100 percent conformant smelters and refiners from the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP) assessment. We achieved this target in 2019 and again in 2022, which included the removal of sanctioned gold smelters from Russia.\n\n| REPORTING YEAR | CONFORMANT | ACTIVE | NON-CONFORMANT | NOT ELIGIBLE | TOTAL |\n|----------------|------------|--------|----------------|--------------|-------|\n| 2022           | 100%       | 0.0%   | 0%             | 0%           | 100%  |\n| 2021           | 98%        | 1.0%   | 1%             | 0%           | 100%  |\n| 2020           | 99.6%      | 0.4%   | 0%             | 0%           | 100%  |\n| 2019           | 100%       | 0%     | 0%             | 0%           | 100%  |\nWe act promptly to review the circumstances and conduct due diligence as soon as we become aware that our supply chain includes non-conformant or high-risk smelters or refiners sourced from CAHRAs. Customers often request updated CMRTs or EMRTs when there are changes in the smelters\u2019 RMAP status. In 2022, onsemi responded to and completed approximately 1,600 conflict minerals customer requests, which is about 44 percent higher compared to the previous year.\n\nMembers of onsemi\u2019s conflict minerals team actively participate in regular RMI annual conferences, monthly plenary calls, as well as workgroups to obtain updated information on smelters, RMI programs and emerging global responsible sourcing regulations. onsemi also joins peer companies in various supply chain training sessions and local work group discussions on relevant topics including due diligence, sourcing regulations and more.\n\nOur responsible sourcing records can be found online including the latest filing of the SEC Form SD, Conflict Minerals Sourcing Policy, as well as latest company-level CMRT and EMRT.\n\nSupplier Hazardous Substances Commitment onsemi is committed to providing our customers with products that are compliant with industry environmental best practices, now and in the future. We meet all applicable REACH requirements and all products manufactured by onsemi comply with the amended RoHS directive. To support this commitment, we have environmental requirements for our suppliers related to the hazardous materials in their products. All purchased materials, services and products used in part manufacturing are required to satisfy current governmental, statutory and regulatory requirements, and safety constraints on restricted, toxic and hazardous materials; as well as environmental, electrical and electromagnetic considerations applicable to the country of manufacture and sale. All purchased materials, services and products must conform to onsemi\u2019s environmental requirements described in our Product Chemical Content Brochure. Suppliers must be prepared to provide supporting evidence of conformance.\nInformation Protection\n\nWe work around the clock to protect our company, technology and intellectual property from potential cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities. We take privacy and cybersecurity seriously and strive to identify and eliminate potential threats to our IT infrastructure, proprietary technologies and confidential information.\n\nPrivacy\n\nWe have developed a global data privacy program designed to comply with applicable laws around the world and to protect the personal information of onsemi employees, customers and others who have entrusted us with their personal data.\n\nWe also have a Data Privacy Committee comprised of global leaders from key functions such as human resources, procurement, legal and information security who provide strategic guidance and oversight to support our data privacy and compliance efforts. In addition, our Chief Privacy Officer has appointed employees of various roles and grade levels throughout the company as \u201cdata privacy champions\u201d who advocate the importance of our data privacy program, maintain awareness of key data privacy laws and help reinforce best practices around data privacy matters.\n\nAll onsemi employees receive foundational data privacy training annually; however, employees in specific functions complete an additional, in-depth data privacy course annually. For more information, please visit our Privacy Policy.\n\nInformation Security and Risk\n\nThe Information Security and Risk (ISR) team is composed of several support teams that address all aspects of cyber risk: risk, security architecture and engineering, identity and access management and security operations. onsemi adopted the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) in 2014 as the foundation of the ISR program. This comprehensive framework provides an intuitive and comprehensive set of control objectives that align with several other standard frameworks such as ISO 27001:2013 and Control Objectives for Information Technology (COBIT) 5.\n\nIn 2022, onsemi became Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange (TISAX) certified at our Munich, Germany site. In 2023 and beyond, onsemi will work to certify additional sites across the globe.\n\nManagement Approach\n\nOur ISR team is led by our Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). The team oversees compliance with the Information Technology General Controls (ITGC) framework, coordinates the Information Security program and facilitates risk management activities within Information Technology (IT). The ISR team also assists with the review and approval of IT policies, completes benchmarking against NIST CSF standards, maintains a cyber risk registrar and oversees the security awareness program including trainings, phishing simulations and cyber awareness month (CAM). During 2022 CAM, the ISR team introduced a cyber game/quiz that was well received and had high participation from the enterprise. Prizes were awarded for those with 100 percent scores, reinforcing security hygiene across the employee base.\n\nThe ISR team manages the ongoing monitoring of company systems identifying and tracking any threats that arise. In the event of a serious or material data breach, the Information Security Program has chartered a Cyber Incident Response team (CIRT) to act. The CIRT is comprised of subject matter experts from the global IT team. In addition, the Information Security team has contracted with providers on a rapid retainer basis. In the event of a serious or material data breach, these rapid response services provide security and forensic expertise immediately via phone and onsite within 24 hours. Also, the ISR team collaborated with onsemi\u2019s Treasury Department to obtain cybersecurity insurance. This type of insurance reimburses the company for costs incurred in responding to and recovering from a data breach. The CISO has accountability for Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the information security program. The CISO reports KPIs and status of key IT risks to Executive Management and the Board of Directors on a regular basis.\nPublic Policy\n\nonsemi supports public policies that encourage the innovation, investment and open markets that enable us to create the intelligent power and sensing technologies that solve the world\u2019s most complex challenges leading the way to a safer, cleaner and smarter world. Our public policy program reflects our profile as a global company headquartered in the United States, which interacts regularly with government agencies around the world. Much of our public policy advocacy is performed through the U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), although our company is also a member of other industry associations as well as local associations and chambers in the regions in which we operate.\n\nonsemi is a founding member of the Semiconductor Climate Consortium (SCC), an industry group formed in 2022, focused on the challenges of climate change and working to speed industry value chain efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emission in member company operations and in other sectors of the semiconductor value chain.\n\nWe are an active participant in the World Semiconductor Council (WSC), an organization composed of the world\u2019s leading semiconductor industry associations from China, Chinese Taipei, Europe, Japan, South Korea and the United States. The organization meets annually at the CEO level to make recommendations to governments and authorities on issues such as expanding the global market for information technology products by promoting fair competition, sound environmental and health and safety practices, intellectual property rights and open markets.\n\nTHE PUBLIC POLICIES WE SUPPORTED IN 2022 ARE THE FOLLOWING:\n\n| Policy Area                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Pro-Innovation, Pro-Growth Business Environment  | We work with the SIA and our other associations to support United States government policies that promote innovation and growth. This includes the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) for America Act that was included in larger legislation that was signed by the president in August 2022. The CHIPS Act provides $52 billion in federal incentives for semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. to increase the share of global wafer fabrication capacity located in the U.S. from its current level of only 12 percent, for semiconductor related research and development at universities and national laboratories and for government actions to ensure a well-educated semiconductor workforce. |\n| Open Markets and Fair Competition               | We actively work to promote policies that open markets and create fair competition. Working through our trade associations, we oppose tariffs on semiconductors, including the 25 percent tariffs that the U.S. imposed in 2018 on imports of discrete semiconductors and integrated circuits imported from China. We work through the WSC to promote transparency on government subsidies, which depending on size, scope and discriminatory application have the potential to distort fair competition in global semiconductor markets. We also recommend that the U.S. government carefully consider the adverse impacts of export controls on the U.S. semiconductor industry and its need to compete in global markets to generate the revenues used to maintain technology leadership, and avoid imposing controls when uncontrolled foreign products are readily available. |\n| Stopping Counterfeit Semiconductors              | Counterfeit semiconductors are unreliable and can fail at any time. The semiconductor industry has found counterfeits in air bags, train-braking systems and other applications where a failure can have serious health or safety consequences. In 2022, we assisted law enforcement to identify and seize counterfeit goods and remove them from the marketplace. |\n| Energy Efficiency, Fuel Economy and Automotive Safety | We are an ally member of American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), a thought leader on energy efficiency policies such as deployment of Electric Vehicles. Additionally, we are a member of Motor & Equipment Manufacturing Association (MEMA) that advocates for legislation and regulations related to fuel economy and automotive safety such as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) including automatic emergency braking and policies to facilitate the introduction of autonomous vehicles. |\n\nHudson Inauguration Ceremony\n\nIn August 2022, onsemi hosted local and federal government officials at our inauguration ceremony for our silicon carbide (SiC) facility in Hudson, New Hampshire (USA). Dignitaries on hand for the event included U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Representatives Chris Pappas (NH-01) and Annie Kuster (NH-02), as well as local governmental officials. Our Hudson SiC facility enables onsemi to provide end-to-end power solutions from SiC crystal growth to the fully integrated power modules critical to a carbon-free economy. Our SiC products enable important decarbonization technologies including electric vehicles and renewable energy. Compared to semiconductors made with silicon, SiC devices can handle higher voltages and are more efficient in the conversion of alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) and back. This greater efficiency translates into more miles per charge thereby reducing consumers\u2019 \u201crange anxiety,\u201d the fear that an electric vehicle will not have enough battery charge to reach its destination, which can impede adoption of electric vehicles.\n\nOur Hudson facility inauguration and support from leading public officials highlight the technology advances by onsemi that enhance sustainability and drive green job creation, both within our company and in the broader community.\nStatement on Political Contributions\n\nParticipating in political activities is a very sensitive and complex area and strict laws govern our political activities as a United States company. For this reason, onsemi does not make political contributions to individual candidates. In the United States, companies and other organizations may organize political action committees (PACs); however, we chose not to have a PAC and did not make political contributions in the company\u2019s name in 2022.\n\nExternal Initiatives & Industry Associations\n\nonsemi is a member of many external initiatives and industry associations. These organizations connect us to peers and stakeholders, providing a space to share ideas, collaborate and grow as an industry and partner with our local communities. Some of our employees hold leadership positions within these organizations, as noted below.

The GS committee oversees issues related to the company's governance principles and the GS committee charter including risk and opportunities arising from climate change. The committee also oversees ESG and climate-related and sustainability-related initiatives including oversight of strategy, risk management, opportunities, major capital expenditure and investments. The GS Committee holds at least quarterly meetings per year and is comprised of three or more independent members of the board. Additionally, the entire board reviews progress against climate and sustainability-related goals and targets including progress towards onsemi's goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2040 (Net Zero 2040) across Scope 1, 2 and 3 and other metrics including energy usage, waste generation and water withdrawal. Progress of the company's sustainability projects is communicated by the Chief Marketing Officer on a quarterly basis for review by the board. In 2022, the company ensured ESG initiatives were a priority by tying aspects of onsemi's 2022 equity compensation program to Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. |\n\n| Governance                  |                        | (b) Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities. |\n|                            |                        | At onsemi, climate-related risks and opportunities are assessed, managed and realized at the highest level of the organization. We believe that the responsibility of operationalizing mitigation and adaptation strategies in response to climate-related risks and opportunities must be integrated at every level of the company, ensuring the success of our risk management program and giving us the ability to act nimbly at all levels when needed. Our ERM program is overseen by a Risk Committee comprised of the CEO, CLO, CFO, CSO and EVP of Operations & Manufacturing. The Risk Committee is responsible for the identification, management and mitigation of risks faced by onsemi. To maintain accountability at the highest functional level, executive staff members are appointed as risk sponsors for individual risks and work with risk owners who manage the risk on a day-to-day basis. ERM findings are communicated to the Risk Committee quarterly to ensure that this information is communicated to executive staff and our Board of Directors. Climate-related risks and opportunities impact business units (BUs) and functional departments across the organization in unique and nuanced ways. BU and department leaders are responsible for understanding, monitoring and acting as the risk and opportunity landscape changes, ensuring they have the information, capacity and resources needed to respond quickly and effectively to trigger events. Groups engaged in climate-related risk and opportunity assessment include our three BUs, finance, legal, manufacturing, business continuity, new product development, supply chain, ESG, human resources and customer experience. |\n## Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Framework\n\n| TCFD RECOMMENDED DISCLOSURE | LOCATION OF DISCLOSURE | BRIEF DESCRIPTION |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Strategy**                |                        |                   |\n| (a) Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the organization has identified over the short, medium, and long term. | CDP Climate Change, Questions C2.3, C2.3a, C2.4, C2.4a | At onsemi, we have identified potential climate-related risks and opportunities that could impact our business continuity, strategy and financial planning. Risks identified include transitional and physical risks with the capacity to impact our own operation and value chain including our financials, supply chain, workforce, company disclosure and reputation. Climate-related opportunities identified include transitional and physical opportunities related to increase demand of onsemi products and an increase in tangible and intangible asset values. Our identified climate-related risks and opportunities can impact onsemi over the near, medium and long term depending on the risk or opportunity development and maturity. For a full list of onsemi's climate-related risks and opportunities see the Risk and Opportunity Disclosure tables. |\n| (b) Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization's businesses, strategy and financial planning. | CDP Climate Change, Questions C3.1, C3.1a, C3.3 | Identified climate-related risk and opportunities pose potential impacts to our business across different impact categories such as finance, supply chain, customer demand and direct operations. These impacts can be general and applicable across our business and value chain or they can be location-based, requiring specific plans and actions localized to the region or country where the risk or opportunity is realized. Realized potential impacts of the identified climate-related risk and opportunities are to be integrated into strategic decision-making across onsemi in business continuity planning, capital expenditure planning and new product development. |\n| (c) Describe the resilience of the organization's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios including a 2\u00b0C or lower scenario. | CDP Climate Change, Questions C3.2, C3.2b | Using three plausible, distinctive, consistent, relevant and challenging climate scenarios, onsemi executive leadership, various functional owners and the ESG team participated in a climate scenario analysis to inform a climate adaptation and resilience plan for implementation at the company. Scenarios used assume various degrees of warming by 2100 and include social, technological, economic and political developments considered plausible under each warming trajectory. The three scenarios used to inform the development of a climate action plan for onsemi include: 1. Failure to Decarbonize: runaway climate change resulting in warming above 3\u00b0C by 2100, international cooperation breakdowns and increased potential for irreversible effects of climate change. 2. Orderly Decarbonization: orderly decarbonization resulting in warming limited to 1.5\u00b0C by 2100, advancement, development and adoption of sustainable technology and global policies for decarbonization, including carbon pricing. 3. Disorderly Decarbonization: disorderly decarbonization resulting in warming around 2\u00b0C by 2100, the abrupt and uneven introduction of climate policies and increased financial consequences of climate change. Through this exercise, relevant climate-related risks and opportunities were identified and socialized for inclusion in our overall business strategy.

This commitment will guide how we operate our business over the coming years and is essential to ensuring we operate in a socially thoughtful and environmentally responsible manner. We are working to create a climate transition plan to meet Net Zero 2040. We're exploring the use of available levers for reducing emissions across Scope 1 and 2 internally at our facilities, along with pathways for engaging suppliers and other reduction strategies in the value chain for Scope 3 emissions reductions outside onsemi's direct control. We're determining the appropriate milestone tasks, metrics and key performance indicators to use for our climate transition plan, allowing us to track our progress over time. By identifying and monitoring our climate-related risks and opportunities, we can work to set further targets used to build resilience and reduce potential negative impacts from identified risks and realize potential positive impacts from identified opportunities. |\n## Risk and Opportunity Disclosures\n\n### Transition risks\n\nTransition risks were most prevalent under the Orderly Decarbonization and Disorderly Decarbonization scenarios.\n\n| RISK | VALUE CHAIN | FINANCIAL IMPACT | TIMEFRAME OF IMPACT | ONSEMI RESPONSE |\n|------|-------------|------------------|---------------------|-----------------|\n| **Risk Management** | | | | |\n| Introduction of national carbon pricing schemes and/or carbon border adjustment mechanisms | Own operations | Increased expenditure associated with manufacturing and corporate activity.

Governance\n\n### 2-9 Governance structure and composition\n\nSee Overview of our Corporate Governance Practice and Committees of the Board in our 2023 Proxy Statement, pg. 11-12, 15-18.\n\n### 2-10 Nomination and selection of the highest governance body\n\nSee Charter of the Governance and Sustainability Committee and 2023 Proxy Statement, pg. 13-14\n\n### 2-11 Chair of the highest governance body\n\nAlan Campbell is a non-employee director and serves as Chair of the Board. See Overview of our Corporate Governance Practice in our 2023 Proxy Statement, pg. 11\n\n### 2-12 Role of the highest governance body in overseeing the management of impacts\n\nSee Amended and Restated On Semiconductor Corporation Corporate Governance Principles.\nThe Board of Directors effectively views each of its committees as key in managing the company's impacts on the economy, environment and people. The Board of Directors delegates responsibility by empowering and entrusting its various committees to handle specific matters tailored to each committee's allotted areas of expertise.\n\nWhile management is responsible for the day-to-day management of our risk, the board plays an ongoing and active role in the oversight of such risk by regularly reviewing and discussing with management areas of material risk and mitigation measures being taken to address such risks. During the 2022 fiscal year, the board and its committees regularly discussed, among other things, the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflationary pressures, supply chain issues, geopolitical risk and macroeconomic uncertainty across the globe. While the board has primary responsibility for risk oversight, each of its committees support this effort by regularly addressing risks in their respective areas of oversight. The chair of the relevant committee then reports on risk discussions to the full board to the extent appropriate. This combination of direct board and targeted committee oversight is intended to ensure a thorough assessment and foster a fulsome discussion between management and the board of risks we face.\n\nToday, the CEO works directly with the ESG department team on climate- and sustainability-related initiatives through their supervisors. The CEO, CFO and other members of management report on the Company's impacts on the economy, environment and people to the board at its meetings and in between meetings, as needed.\n\nThe company's internal ESG team oversees drafting and publishing the company's annual Sustainability Report, however, the team receives input, guidance and direction from members of the board before publishing the report and its data. This naturally flows from the board role in overseeing climate, sustainability and other ESG-related initiatives. Particularly as climate change continues to impact the company's operations and, in turn, factor into its strategy moving forward, the Board of Directors has taken a heightened interest in the company's emissions mitigation strategies and sustainability reporting.\n\nWe have a written policy on related party transactions to which all employees are required to adhere. We disclose conflicts of interests with stakeholders, including with respect to cross-board membership, the existence of controlling shareholders, and related parties and their relationships and transactions with related parties.\n\nSince January 1, 2022, there have been no related party transactions that are required to be reported as such under SEC rules.\nGlobal Reporting Initiative (GRI) Index\n\n| GRI STANDARD | DISCLOSURE | CROSS REFERENCE OR ANSWER |\n|--------------|------------|---------------------------|\n| 2-16         | Communication of critical concerns | Critical concerns are communicated during regular (quarterly) and special (interim) meetings with the Board of Directors. Management and the members of the board communicate as needed, often directly regarding developments and critical items. With respect to ethics and compliance, the company has also established reporting channels for external parties to raise ethics and compliance concerns regarding our employees, directors and other third parties doing business with us. Reports may be made directly or anonymously, where allowed by local law, via any of the methods outlined in our Code of Business Conduct. |\n| 2-17         | Collective knowledge of the highest governance body | The Governance and Sustainability Committee of the board is tasked with encouraging and facilitating directors\u2019 continuing education, including coordinating training sessions and informative presentations from external parties for the directors on various topics and aspects related to corporate governance and other aspects of board service. The company allows and encourages directors to select continuing director education offerings to attend, so directors are empowered to further develop their skillsets and attend offerings that will serve to complement their existing knowledge bases. |\n| 2-18         | Evaluation of the performance of this highest governance body | See Corporate Governance section of our 2022 Sustainability Report, pg. 65. |\n| 2-19         | Remuneration policies | See 2022 Compensation of Directors and Compensation Discussion and Analysis in our 2023 Proxy Statement, pg. 23-24, 26-41. |\n| 2-20         | Process to determine remuneration | See Processes and Procedures for Considering and Determining Executive Compensation in our 2023 Proxy Statement, pg. 38-41. |\n| 2-21         | Annual total compensation ratio | (a) Annual total compensation ratio 1,029:1 for all employees 101:1 for U.S.-based non-manufacturing employees See our 2023 Proxy Statement, pg. 55.
