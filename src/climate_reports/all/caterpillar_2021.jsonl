In 2021, Caterpillar leadership regularly reported to the board\u2019s Public Policy and Governance Committee (PPG) regarding sustainability and climate strategies, priorities, goals and performance. The PPG was also briefed on these and other ESG issues as well as the perspectives of investors, customers, employees and other stakeholders. The PPG also reviewed Caterpillar\u2019s annual political contributions and recommended the amount the company should contribute to the Caterpillar Foundation. The PPG provided regular updates to the board on these matters.\n\nRecognizing the increasing complexity and stakeholder interest in climate, sustainability and other ESG issues, in April 2022, the board decided to restructure certain of its committees. The board created the Sustainability & other Public Policy Committee (SPPC) to oversee all of the public policy matters previously overseen by the PPG. In addition, the SPPC will have explicit oversight over sustainability, social and public policy matters, including those related to the environment, climate change, human rights and lobbying. This restructuring will be effective immediately following the annual shareholder meeting on June 8, 2022.\n\n| GOVERNANCE HIGHLIGHTS* |  |\n|------------------------|--|\n| Size of Board          | 10 |\n| Number of Independent Directors | 9 |\n| Average Age of Directors | 64 |\n| Average Director Tenure (in years) | 8 |\n| Annual Election of Directors | Yes |\n| Mandatory Retirement Age | 74 |\n| Women                  | 30% |\n| Diversity              | 20% |\n| Majority Voting in Director Elections | Yes |\n| Independent Presiding Director | Yes |\n| Code of Conduct for Directors, Officers and Employees | Yes |\n| Supermajority Voting Threshold for Mergers | No |\n| Proxy Access           | Yes |\n| Shareholder Action by Written Consent | No |\n| Shareholder Ability to Call Special Meetings | Yes |\n| Poison Pill            | No |\n| Stock Ownership Guidelines for Directors and Executive Officers | Yes |\n| Anti-Hedging and Pledging Policies | Yes |\n| Clawback Policy        | Yes |\n\n* The information in this table reflects only the director nominees standing for re-election at the annual meeting of shareholders on June 8, 2022.\nETHICS & COMPLIANCE\n\nCaterpillar operates according to Our Values in Action \u2014 Caterpillar\u2019s Code of Conduct.

Through robust programs including Enterprise Risk Management, Compliance and Audit, we engage across the enterprise to identify, prioritize and manage risks.\n\nEnterprise Risk Management and our enterprise strategy are linked: To better inform our decision-making, we evaluate risks at both the business unit and enterprise levels, considering the likelihood and potential impact of each risk. These evaluations guide our approach for risk management, allow us to understand the challenges these risks bring and position our business for the opportunities they present.\n\nWe consider risks across many categories, including strategic, operational, financial, compliance and hazard risks. We embed ESG risks into each risk category as part of our commitment to sustainability. We treat these ESG risks with the same priority and rigor as other risks across the business.\n\nAs risk management is fundamental to our culture, there is strong engagement in risk management from the CEO, executives, and senior leaders. The company\u2019s officers share accountability for business risks, and the board has oversight of the enterprise process. The board and its committees oversee risk and have regular updates on topics that are identified through the risk management process. Outputs from risk management drive strategic initiatives and disclosures.\n\nOur risk management culture enables us to critically evaluate risks to our business and identify opportunities to create value for our employees, customers and shareholders. Our commitment to sustainability is reflected in our risk management practices as we strive to build a better world.\n\nPOLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nWe advocate for policies, agreements, legislation and regulations that enable us to help our customers build a better, more sustainable world.\n\nWhere allowable by law, Caterpillar may make corporate contributions to campaigns, individual candidates or political committees to support public policies we believe will promote our business interests. Any political contributions by Caterpillar must be approved by our vice president of Global Government & Corporate Affairs. In addition, the board annually reviews the company\u2019s political spending policy and its political activities including corporate political contributions, political contribution activities of the Caterpillar Political Action Committee (CATPAC), trade association participation and Caterpillar\u2019s significant lobbying priorities.\n\nCATPAC contributions are made only in U.S. federal and state elections. CATPAC is funded through voluntary contributions by eligible individuals. A steering committee comprised of Caterpillar non-officer employees representing a diverse mix of U.S. locations and business units oversees all CATPAC disbursements to ensure they promote the company\u2019s business interests.\n\nCaterpillar also maintains memberships in trade associations and business groups that may advocate on behalf of business community segments. We are committed to supporting these organizations, as they champion public policies that contribute to the business community\u2019s growth and success.\n\nAdditional information regarding Caterpillar\u2019s corporate contributions, CATPAC contributions and trade association memberships is available on our political engagement website.\nENERGY, FUEL ECONOMY AND EMISSIONS\n\n2021 HIGHLIGHTS\n\n- Continued investment in alternative and renewable power generation sources to reduce our operational emissions\n- Supported customers in their sustainability and climate journey by introducing product innovations that are more fuel efficient and lower-carbon generating in their operation\nCaterpillar supports global efforts to mitigate climate change.\n\nCaterpillar shares the concerns of governments and the public about the risks of climate change and supports global efforts to mitigate it.\n\nWe are committed to a reduced-carbon future. We demonstrate this in many ways, including our significant progress in reducing GHG emissions from our operations and our continued investment in new products, technologies and services to help our customers achieve climate-related objectives.\n\nWe have a legacy of providing products and services that continually improve the quality of life and the environment by fulfilling society\u2019s need for infrastructure including shelter, clean water, transportation and reliable energy \u2014 in a sustainable way.\n\nLearn more about Caterpillar Climate and Energy Statement\nCaterpillar manages hundreds of facilities worldwide, all of which require energy. Some of these operations, especially our manufacturing sites, are energy intensive. To reduce our energy consumption and our GHG emissions, we are improving energy efficiency, investing in alternative and renewable power generation sources, and considering new technologies as they become available. Likewise, we are making other environmental improvements to conserve water and manage waste.\n\nOur enterprise energy management team builds awareness, encourages action and develops improvements in energy efficiency and alternative/renewable power generation. These solutions include purchasing renewable energy certificates and installing renewable energy sources, such as photovoltaics (PV) or a microgrid installation that combines PV with battery storage to supplement and offset electricity generated with diesel fuel at an off-grid location. One significant contribution to alternative energy consumption is the operation of combined heat and power (CHP) systems to power several manufacturing facilities. The energy management team evaluates opportunities for replication of CHP, PV and microgrids at other locations. We also continue to assess new ways to upgrade systems and make facilities more efficient.\n\nOur high-performance standards for environmental, health and safety (EHS) encourage going beyond merely complying with EHS laws and regulations. Our EHS assurance manual outlines Caterpillar\u2019s EHS Management System and establishes fundamental requirements for all workplaces globally, including majority-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned joint ventures. Our facilities assess compliance with our requirements annually, and our EHS assessment team reviews those assessments while also conducting more in-depth reviews of select facilities each year.\n\nBeyond meeting standard expectations, facilities implement their own initiatives to improve safety, decrease energy use and increase productivity. As facilities evaluate potential environmental initiatives, they also consider annual investment required, total anticipated cost savings and average pay-back period. We also invite facilities to report emissions reduction activities through internal awards and recognition processes.\nKEY PERFORMANCE METRICS: GHG EMISSIONS, ENERGY, WATER & WASTE\n\n**GOAL:**\nWe have set a science-based Scope 1 and 2 goal to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions from our operations by 30% from 2018 to 2030.\n\n**Absolute GHG emissions**\nMillion metric tons CO2e\n- Scope 1\n- Scope 2\n\n| Year | Scope 1 | Scope 2 |\n|------|---------|---------|\n| '18  | 0.94    | 1.28    |\n| '19  | 0.91    | 0.87    |\n| '20  | 0.70    | 0.77    |\n| '21  | 0.74    | 0.77    |\n| '30  | 1.55    |         |\n\n**GHG Emissions Intensity**\nAbsolute metric tons CO2e/million dollars of revenue\n\n| Year | '18 | '19 | '20 | '21 |\n|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| 40.6 | 33.0| 35.0| 29.7|\n\n**32%**\nReduction in absolute GHG emissions from 2018 through 2021\n\n**ENERGY**\n\n**Energy Intensity**\nAbsolute gigajoules energy use/million dollars of sales and revenues\n\n| Year | '18 | '19 | '20 | '21 |\n|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| 461  | 445 | 463 | 404 |\n\n**Total Energy Consumption**\nAbsolute energy use million gigajoules\n\n| Year | '18 | '19 | '20 | '21 |\n|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| 25.2 | 23.9| 19.3| 20.6|\n\n**Total Electricity Consumption**\nSum of purchased and self-generated electricity in million MWh\n\n| Year | '18 | '19 | '20 | '21 |\n|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| 2.55 | 2.38| 2.09| 2.25|\n\n**Renewable Energy**\nRenewable electrical energy use/total electrical use x 100\n\n| Year | '18 | '19 | '20 | '21 |\n|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| 17.4 | 21.2| 21.0| 24.2|\n\n**WATER**\n\n**GOAL:**\nImplement water management strategies at 100% of facilities located in water high-risk areas by 2030.\n\n**11%**\nFacilities achieved goal of water strategy implementation\n\n**WASTE**\n\n**GOAL:**\nReduce landfill intensity by 50% from 2018 to 2030.\n\n**34%**\nReduction in landfill intensity from 2018\nCaterpillar provides U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Tier 4 Final, European Union Stage V or equivalent products in North America, Europe and select regions around the world. These products provide up to a 90% reduction in emissions (nitrogen oxides and particulate matter) compared to Tier 3 or Stage IIIA emission standards. Product improvements in each segment provide customers with cost-saving benefits of improved fuel efficiency and fuel flexibility. Modular offerings allow customization of products to optimize technology and emissions profile that helps customers achieve their climate-related goals.\n\nAs an industry leader, we have a talented and experienced team that constantly innovates to improve product emissions, efficiency and safety. Caterpillar continues to engage with regulators and other governmental entities, industry organizations and nongovernmental organizations around the world to share that expertise, which supports advanced technology and informs decisions.\nENABLING CUSTOMER SUCCESS\n\nWe collaborate with dealers and customers to deliver customized solutions that help optimize energy use and provide training for operators on how to use our equipment more efficiently. For example, our efficiency experts can help customers evaluate and achieve emissions goals, reduce noise and dust, implement fuel-saving techniques, and optimize idle management practices and fuel and fluid usage.\n\n2030 GOAL\n\nCustomer Safety\n\nProvide leadership in the safety of people who work in, on and around our products.\n\nCaterpillar\u2019s commitment to safety goes beyond our employees and facilities. Caterpillar Safety Services\u2019 products, solutions and expertise support companies of all sizes in many industries, helping achieve and sustain safety excellence. This team supports dealers, suppliers and customers using cultural assessment tools, continuous improvement processes, technology that identifies and mitigates risk, and a wealth of industry-specific safety resources.\n\nPartnering for Zero-Incident Performance\n\nStacy and Witbeck is a construction contractor that specializes in complex transportation and transit projects. They engaged with Caterpillar Safety Services more than two years ago to transform their safety culture, including establishing safety steering teams to guide culture change. Because they have three regional offices, geographic diversity was an important consideration. By ensuring Stacy and Witbeck has representation from all regions on its safety steering teams, safety messages are shared with all employees. The company has since rebranded the Caterpillar safety program as its own to create buy-in and ownership.\n\nMaking Safety Everyone\u2019s Job\n\nCreating a lasting safety culture often requires an all-in approach \u2014 meaning everyone. Lehman-Roberts, a hot mix asphalt producer and paving contractor, partnered with Caterpillar Safety Services to foster ownership of safety at all levels of its organization. The company began measuring leadership engagement as a leading indicator and conducted regular surveys of its front-line workers. Says Jeremy Ramberg, Senior Vice President of Construction at Lehman-Roberts, \u201cwe truly believe safety is a 24/7/365 endeavor. Now that we have a plan, we must continually communicate it.\u201d\n\nKeeping People Safe at Work and at Home\n\nEighty-five percent of injuries that require medical treatment in the U.S. happen off the jobsite, according to the National Safety Council. That\u2019s why the work of Caterpillar Safety Services extends to keeping people safe at home. In 2021, we launched a Corporate Safety Campaign to educate workers on topics like talking to kids about safety and developing a home safety plan. The campaign received over 20 million views across a range of media.\nSUPPORTING OUR CUSTOMERS\n\nPower is at the heart of our customers\u2019 work. Innovation and integration are at the heart of ours. And we\u2019re structured to deliver innovation and integration. Our engineers innovate at the component, system, product and worksite levels to develop integrated solutions to address customers\u2019 specific goals \u2014 including lower GHG emissions, energy flexibility and business sustainability.\n\nCaterpillar\u2019s approach to the energy transition is to offer multiple solutions made to match our customers\u2019 work. Many of our advanced power offerings are already at work on customer sites in each of our primary business segments, either complementing our existing products or as stand-alone solutions. Others are in development. In order to continue to help our customers achieve their climate-related goals, our advanced power solution development is focused in five technology areas:\n\n1. LOWER-CARBON INTENSITY FUELS\n\nFuel choice is one way customers can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from in-use products. Many Caterpillar products are operating on lower-carbon alternatives to diesel and natural gas today, including biodiesel, renewable diesel, and biogas. For example, renewable liquid fuels like hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) are being used in our C175-20 engines to provide stand by power at a Microsoft data center in Sweden. HVO can reduce carbon intensity by 45% to 85% versus diesel. All Caterpillar diesel engines are capable of operating on 100% HVO right now. Caterpillar engines operating on natural gas blended with up to 80% hydrogen are being demonstrated in power generation projects today. Turbines can operate on up to 100% hydrogen. These and other projects are helping to demonstrate the viability of potential fuel sources like hydrogen while the infrastructure to support availability of renewable hydrogen is being developed.\n\nIn 2021, we announced that some Caterpillar gas generator sets are being configured to use 100% hydrogen on a design-to-order basis, and some commercial sets will be configured to operate on natural gas blended with up to 25% hydrogen.\n2. HYDROGEN FUEL CELL\nFuel cells use renewable hydrogen fuel as a scalable electric power source for stationary and mobile equipment. We announced a three-year project through a collaboration with Microsoft and Ballard Power Systems to demonstrate a power system incorporating large-format hydrogen fuel cells to produce reliable and sustainable backup power for Microsoft data centers. The project is supported and partially funded by the U.S. Department of Energy under the H2@Scale initiative and backed by the National Renewable Energy Lab. Caterpillar is providing the overall system integration, power electronics and controls that form the central structure of the power solution. In addition, Progress Rail announced a memorandum of understanding with BNSF Railway and Chevron to advance the demonstration of a locomotive powered by hydrogen fuel cells.\n\n3. ELECTRIFICATION\nElectric drivetrains and hybrid powertrains employ an electric drive transmission with power components to improve energy efficiency and productivity. The D6E XE high-drive dozer, for example, offers up to 35% better fuel efficiency and up to 23% less fuel usage than previous models. The 795 electric drive mining truck with a diesel-electric drivetrain has been paired with a trolley-assist system that allows the truck to use electric power while traveling uphill, and then switch back to diesel operation if electricity isn\u2019t readily available. The trolley system reduces fuel burn by more than 90% while on trolley.\n\n4. BATTERY-STORED POWER\nBatteries power work with stored electrical energy, instead of, or in addition to, an engine. In 2021, we debuted our first 100% battery-powered electric drive mining machine and made-to-match charger. We\u2019ve also designed a worksite power solution for a land-drilling operation that pairs a G3512 Natural Gas Generator with the Cat Energy Storage System with fully integrated controls. The combination allows the customer to make use of readily available field gas reducing the operation\u2019s fuel costs and carbon intensity.\n\n5. MICROGRIDS\nMicrogrids integrate renewable energy sources into electric power systems. These worksite installations are particularly valuable in remote locations where renewable energy sources like solar or hydropower are readily available and electrical grids may deliver inconsistent power. Barrick Gold Corporation collaborated with Cat dealer Tractafric to install 7.5 MW of battery energy storage capacity for its microgrid at the Kibali gold mine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Now operational, Tractafric\u2019s solution deploys the battery energy storage and Cat bi-directional power inverters to provide grid stability, while the Cat Microgrid Controller seamlessly integrates up to 45 MW of power generated by three hydroelectric power stations and 36 Cat 3512 diesel generator sets.\nPRODUCT INNOVATION\n\nWe provide the products and services needed to build a better, more sustainable world.\n\nWe are proud to support our customers in their sustainability and climate journey.\n\nOur teams are developing some of Caterpillar\u2019s most fuel-efficient, lower carbon-emitting products.

With a strong base of diverse suppliers already in place, we are investing in tools that will help identify diverse suppliers for new business opportunities. This is key to delivering on our commitment to foster and increase business purchases with diverse suppliers.\n\nRESPONSIBLE MINERAL SOURCING\n\nMany considerations go into the responsible sourcing of minerals used in our products. Tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold (3TG), collectively known as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d have been associated with human rights violations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. Our Conflict Minerals Position Statement contains clear expectations for our suppliers regarding their sourcing of these materials. We have established a process that identifies areas of risk on an ongoing basis, and corrective action plans to mitigate or remediate such risks relating to conflict minerals. A supplier\u2019s failure to take corrective actions when required may lead to additional actions, up to and including the termination of our business relationship.\n\nCaterpillar supports the Responsible Minerals Initiative to help influence smelters\u2019 engagement to support supply chain transparency and leverage industry collaboration toward greater business intelligence. Year over year, we strive for an increased supplier response rate, emphasizing 3TG priority suppliers. Caterpillar also publicly discloses the results of our Reasonable Country of Origin process and any necessary due diligence in Form SD and Conflict Minerals Report as required by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which discloses metrics and results of inquiries we execute within our first-tier suppliers. In these reports, we describe our due diligence efforts, including risk mitigation and process improvements we expect to implement in the following year.\n\nLearn more about our Conflict Minerals Position Statement\nREMANUFACTURING\n\n2021 HIGHLIGHTS\n\n- Introduced new Cat Reman parts that supported more than 400 unique engine and machine models\n- 127 million pounds of end-of-life material returned in 2021\nNearly 50 years of providing high-quality equipment with lower owning and operating costs.\n\nCaterpillar\u2019s remanufacturing and rebuild operations have provided customers with quality equipment that helps deliver lower owning and operating costs.\n\nOur engineering and manufacturing expertise, field population and dealer organization make it possible for us to offer remanufactured products and components through many of our brands and rebuild options through our dealers.\n\nRemanufacturing and rebuild options deliver multiple sustainability benefits and help Caterpillar contribute to the circular economy. Through these activities, we recycle millions of pounds of end-of-life products annually. Because we are in the business of returning end-of-life components to like-new condition, we reduce waste and minimize the need for raw material, energy and water associated with producing new parts. Through remanufacturing, we contribute to sustainable development \u2014 extending the value of the energy and water consumed in a component\u2019s original manufacture and keeping high-value nonrenewable resources in circulation for multiple lifecycles. The company\u2019s enterprise strategy focused heavily on increasing services that offer superior customer value. With steady customer demand for remanufacturing products and components, we are well-positioned to help achieve this enterprise goal. Reducing waste through remanufacturing and rebuilding can provide benefits to the environment, customers and the enterprise.\n\n127 million lbs of material returned in 2021\n\n88% end-of-life eligible returns collected\n\n2030 GOAL\n\nRemanufacturing\n\nIncrease sales and revenues from remanufacturing offerings by 25% from 2018 to 2030.\n\nSustainability Benefits of Remanufacturing*\n\n- 85% less energy use\n- 61% less GHG emissions\n- 85% less material used\n- 85% less water used\n\n* Represents environmental impacts from remanufacturing process for a Cat Reman engine and components as compared to manufacturing a new, comparable engine and components. Does not include impacts elsewhere in our value chain. Based on a 2006 study done by Caterpillar on the 3412 cylinder head.\nREMANUFACTURING ACROSS OUR BRANDS\n\nCaterpillar machines and components are built to last. They are designed to withstand heavy-duty operating conditions and to be restored and used for multiple lifecycles.\n\nDesigning products and components to be used throughout multiple service lifecycles is the essence of our remanufacturing approach, which takes many different forms across our brands.\n\nCAT REMAN\nThe Cat Reman process returns component products at the end of their initial serviceable lives to like-new condition. Engineers use design guidelines to build key products with remanufacturing in mind, ensuring they are highly durable, even under heavy-use conditions. When a component reaches the end of its initial serviceable life, dealers can return the used component, referred to as core, to Caterpillar, where it is cleaned, inspected, salvaged and remanufactured to original factory specifications, including any relevant engineering updates. Cat Reman uses state-of-the-art salvage techniques, strict reuse guidelines, and advanced remanufacturing processes and quality controls to ensure remanufactured products provide like-new performance, coupled with a same-as-new warranty. We charge a deposit along with the purchase of each Cat Reman product, which gives customers an incentive to return their used components so that we can continue to give materials new life.\nSOLAR TURBINES\nSolar Turbines remanufactures turbine components and gas compressor components. Through advanced remanufacturing processes, components are returned to like-new condition. Once components have been certified, they are placed back into service, typically through an exchange program. This allows customers to exchange major components in days rather than months of downtime. The exchange equipment is tested and certified to the same performance and emission specifications, as well as implementing the latest design improvements. Solar continues to expand remanufacturing capabilities and invest in condition-based engineering, which allows for more finite determination of remaining useful life. Condition-based engineering improves reman content and extends overhaul cycles while ensuring quality at every step. Solar continues to invest in facilities around the world to expand capabilities with the goal of reducing transportation and provide a faster customer response.\n\nPROGRESS RAIL\nProgress Rail extends the use of existing locomotives by providing rebuild, overhaul and repower options. These modernization programs upgrade electrical and mechanical systems and other components to extend locomotive life by 10 years or more with appropriate maintenance. Repower upgrades meet or exceed current emissions standards in certain regions while improving reliability, reducing exhaust emissions and maximizing fuel economy. We also offer reconditioning or repair services for freight cars and a wide range of components, ensuring value-added returns are available for customers, reducing annual maintenance cost. When locomotives and railcars finally reach the end of their usable lives, they can be recycled for other uses through Progress Rail\u2019s scrap management services. We also provide rail take-up and inspection services, including grading of previously used rail, which is then recycled, repurposed for other non-rail uses or relayed into track. In 2021, Progress Rail processed about 95,000 gross tons of material.\nCATERPILLAR ENERGY SOLUTIONS X-CHANGE\nThe X-Change program is a parts replacement program for medium and large MWM branded engines and a perfect example of circular economy principles. By remanufacturing and selling X-Change parts, engines and gensets, customers benefit from quick and cost-effective overhauls and repair services on-site. This maximizes uptime of the power and heat-generating power plants for both MWM and Cat branded product lines.\n\nThe replaced parts that reached the initial serviceable lifetime are returned to Caterpillar Energy Solutions where they are cleaned, disassembled, inspected and remanufactured to like-new condition. Technology updates that reduce emissions and increase efficiency while improving reliability are included. In this way significant lifecycle extension, including greenhouse gas emission reduction, is achieved.\n\nCATERPILLAR DEFENSE\nDuring disaster response or aid delivery, amid surge or rapid deployment, in wartime or peacetime, Caterpillar Defense responds to each operation\u2019s needs, including offering solutions that extend the lifecycle of products. Through the military Service Life Extension Program, Cat dealers give machines a complete second lifecycle at a fraction of new replacement cost. We also have Caterpillar trained, qualified technicians who conduct repairs on military bases and customize replacement parts to local needs.\n\nCAT CERTIFIED REBUILD\nIn the same spirit as Cat Reman, Cat Certified Rebuild programs increase the lifespan of equipment by providing customers with product updates at a fraction of the cost of buying a new machine, enabling us to extend the life of materials.\n\nA complete Cat Certified Rebuild includes more than 350 tests and inspections, automatic replacement or reconditioning of approximately 7,000 parts and a like-new machine warranty. Trained dealer service professionals perform rebuild work using genuine equipment and parts while incorporating the latest engineering updates. Caterpillar provides information, data, training and service tools to help dealers decide which parts to reuse to achieve the expected longevity of rebuilt components. Since 1985, Caterpillar and our dealers have rebuilt more than 37,000 machines, powertrains and components.\n2021 HIGHLIGHTS\n\n- Delivered our best recordable injury frequency (RIF) performance on record for the third year in a row\n- Offered 1,720 new virtual training courses on topics ranging from safety to lean to leadership with more than 1.8 million courses completed\n- Increased or maintained scores on our employee experience and engagement surveys\nWe strive to create an environment where our employees can reach their full potential.\n\nOur Values-driven culture reflects our commitment to the health, safety, integrity, excellence, teamwork and diverse backgrounds and experiences of our 107,700 employees.

We encourage employee feedback and continually make improvements to help our team members do the work that matters.\nEMPLOYEE HEALTH AND SAFETY\n\nThe health and safety of our employees is an important focus at Caterpillar, and we strive to continuously reduce injuries. Safety is forefront in our strategic goals and metrics, with visible commitment and support by leadership. In addition to metrics, we believe the best way to drive a culture of safety excellence is to create an environment where our team is accountable for their own safety and the safety of those around them. We relentlessly strive to ensure our workforce returns home safely every day.\n\nOUR GLOBAL RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC\n\nProtecting the health of our employees is ingrained in Caterpillar\u2019s culture at every level. In 2021, our safety-first culture led the company\u2019s continued response to the COVID-19 pandemic by maintaining a global, enterprise-level task force comprised of business, environmental, health and safety (EHS), medical, human resources, facilities, legal and communications leaders. The task force further strengthened our response to the existing enhanced safety measures and improved benefits by increasing vaccination opportunities in many workplaces and paid time off to receive vaccinations away from work. The task force also developed and implemented a playbook for our businesses to support a limited, voluntary return to the workplace for some of our employees who were working remotely. This helped ensure employees returned to the office in a consistent and safe manner.\n\nSupervisors, managers and leaders in every region of the world delivered frequent communication with employees to help facilitate resiliency throughout the year. In return, our employees responded by focusing on driving business results, despite the challenges created by the pandemic.\n\nIn 2020, the Caterpillar Foundation donated $10 million to support response efforts and organizations directly impacted by COVID-19. The Foundation donated an additional $3.8 million in 2021 to relief organizations to provide essential medical supplies and support increased access to vaccines. In addition, many employees also continued to help fight the spread of COVID-19 in the communities where they live and work through donations to local families and volunteer work supporting local efforts.\n\nCREATING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR EVERYONE\n\nWe track enterprise metrics and targets as well as individual business unit goals. Common enterprise targets create structure and accountability, while business unit strategies focused on safety culture and involving leaders and employees in developing their culture create opportunities for innovation. We drive clear accountability and have an EHS management system, as described on page 17, that establishes expectations worldwide. From day one, we provide every newly hired employee with the knowledge they need to perform their job safely, and leaders regularly receive training on their role in safety compliance and setting an example for our strong safety culture. These actions help us manage risk while creating a culture focused on worker health and safety.\nOUR PROGRESS REPORT CARD\n\nIn 2021, driven on by our relentless focus on safety, we delivered our best recordable injury frequency (RIF) performance on record for the third year in a row. We improved our RIF rate by 23% from our 2018 base year and by 2% from the previous year. We accomplished this result while leading our organization through the global pandemic, effectively deploying enhanced safety measures and encouraging and making available vaccinations. While we are proud of our progress, we are also very saddened that a contractor suffered a fatal workplace injury at one of our facilities in 2021. This incident highlights that safety must always remain the number one focus of all workers, and it further strengthens our safety resolve.\n\nSETTING THE BAR HIGHER\n\nAs we pursue our 2030 goal, business unit leaders are engaged in the evolution of our safety vision. Our plan includes further strengthening our safety-first culture by continuing to involve employees in developing solutions, listening to their concerns and ensuring they feel comfortable talking to their peers about potential hazards or unsafe behaviors. Continuing to provide safety learning opportunities for our leaders, safety professionals and employees will enhance our efforts. We know the journey ahead will be challenging but vitally important as we continue to prioritize the safety of our employees and their families.\n\nHere are some ways our various locations have helped us achieve a safer work environment.\n\nUnited States\n\nSafety is a priority starting on day one. Within our Large Power Systems Division in East Peoria, Illinois, we incorporated feedback from operators, manufacturing engineers and subject matter experts to define the key skills for each job, improved standard work and provided job-specific training by validated trainers to certify new hires prior to releasing them to perform their jobs. Since this change, recordable injuries to newly hired employees have been dramatically reduced.\n\nEurope\n\nPracticing good ergonomics protects employees against injury. Our Grenoble, France, facility implemented several innovative approaches to ergonomic design. This included evaluation of traditional ergonomic risks, as well as an assessment of the work environment within the area and operator feedback about the work. These approaches identified several ways we could use technology to perform a task and protect employees from potential harm. This facility recently celebrated one year free from ergonomic-related injuries.\n\n2030 GOAL\n\nSafety\n\nWe aspire to prevent all injuries and will further our industry-leading safety results by reducing RIF by 50% from 2018 to 2030.\n\nRecordable Injury Frequency (RIF)\n\nRecordable injuries per 200,000 hours worked\n\n| Year | RIF |\n|------|-----|\n| 2018 | 0.53 |\n| 2019 | 0.43 |\n| 2020 | 0.42 |\n| 2021 | 0.41 |\n| 2030 | 0.27 |\nIndia\nThe Caterpillar facility in Thiruvallur produces structures for off-highway truck frames. We formed a diverse team of line operators, line section facilitators, section managers, manufacturing engineers and the operations excellence team to review the risk analyses for the various stations. As a result of the project, we implemented a collaborative robot in two stations to eliminate fall risks, bending at the waist, pinch points and repetitive motions of loading and unloading the station manually. In another station, we installed a common adapter to eliminate the need for manual change-out in between models, reducing the risk for pinch points, slips and trips, as well as grip force injuries. These improvements not only improved safety, but they also engaged employees with the workstations to identify issues and develop solutions. Safety, efficiency and employee fatigue all improved substantially.\n\nGlobal\nThe development of our Product Support & Logistics Division\u2019s Safety Application Suite has allowed for a one-stop location where facilities can access all available safety resources in a multitude of languages.

We respect the principles of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. We have compassion for all persons affected by conflict wherever it occurs and we expect our directors, officers, employees, business partners and suppliers, including in conflict-affected areas, to comply with all applicable laws and conduct activities in a manner that respects human rights.\n\nRead our Human Rights Policy\nPHILANTHROPY\n\n2021 HIGHLIGHTS\n\n- Invested more than $41 million in 2021 to improve the lives of people in 39 countries\n- Participated in a campaign to establish natural infrastructure by planting 290,000 trees in 95 communities\nSince 1952, the Caterpillar Foundation has been on a mission to improve lives by focusing on the human, natural and basic services infrastructure needed for individuals to thrive and communities to be resilient.\n\nCaterpillar works alongside our dealers and customers to build the social infrastructure needed to make the world run. Our success contributes to the stability of regions around the world.\n\nCATERPILLAR FOUNDATION\n\nThrough the Caterpillar Foundation we have been on a mission to improve lives since its founding in 1952. As a Foundation, we focus on the human, natural and basic services infrastructure needed for individuals to thrive and communities to be resilient. Our philanthropic purpose builds on Caterpillar\u2019s historical legacy of improving lives \u2014 finding new ways to tackle modern issues and identifying room for continuous improvement.\n\nFOUNDATION FOCUS AREAS\n\nThe Foundation invests in the skills people need to join the modern workforce, and the natural and vital infrastructure they rely upon.\n\n- **Empowering the workforce of the 21st century**\n  We invest in skills development and STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) to equip people with the skills required for tomorrow\u2019s economy, putting them on a path to prosperity. Skills-based education leads to better jobs, and better jobs lead to better futures.\n\n- **Building resilient communities to address critical environmental challenges**\n  We support natural infrastructure development and access to basic services, such as water resource management and energy.\n\n- **Giving back in our communities**\n  Caterpillar\u2019s global team helps build a better world using their passion, time and talent to give back, maximizing impact through the Foundation\u2019s disaster and matching gifts programs, United Way and volunteer efforts.\n\nNearly $851 million invested in global communities since 1952.\nIn 2021, the Foundation invested more than $41 million helping improve the lives of people in more than 39 countries around the world. Together with the help of the Foundation\u2019s partners:\n\n- **3.3 million** individuals will have better access to industry-aligned STEM education programs.\n- **Over 530,000 acres** will be restored through reforestation, ecosystem restoration and more sustainable land use management practices.\n- **Nearly 15,000 individuals** are projected to enter the workforce after successful completion of technical and vocational education programs.\n- **Approximately 500 water system interventions** are projected to be installed to connect communities with reliable water sources.\n- **Around 12,000 individuals** will earn one or more industry-recognized credentials.\n- **More than 2.5 million** short tons of carbon are projected to be removed, sequestered or captured.\n- **Over $4 million** in disaster damage costs reduced.\n\nThe \u2018It Starts with a Tree\u2019 campaign aims to plant 290,000 trees in 95 communities. Along with Foundation partner One Tree Planted, we are addressing individual communities\u2019 natural and economic infrastructure needs on a global scale. This innovative campaign serves as a launch pad to establish natural infrastructure that protects and strengthens communities.\n\nSome of these impacted communities include the 40 beekeepers who work in the Biobio region near Santiago, Chile, whose local businesses suffered due to recent brushfires. With 4,000 new trees planted, the habitat will be protected \u2014 allowing for the reproduction of bees. This will enable the beekeepers of Santiago to reactivate their businesses, putting them on a path toward economic success and financial independence.\nCREATING THE WORKFORCE OF THE 21ST CENTURY\n\nTo thrive in our changing world, individuals and communities need the skills, resources and services. Investments in workforce readiness and STEM aim to create human infrastructure through an empowered, prepared and skilled workforce.\n\nAcross Latin America, unemployment and a lack of education among young people are critical problems. Through a program that teaches students skills that align with the most relevant and profitable in-country sectors such as advanced manufacturing, agriculture, automotive, IT and logistics, Adriana enrolled in a welding course provided by International Youth Foundation. She was hired by a company that valued her skills and abilities and is now happily working as a computer numerical controlled machine operator.\n\nDISASTER RELIEF\n\nThe Caterpillar Foundation is a member of the Red Cross Annual Disaster Giving Program (ADGP). Our $1 million annual global investment helps provide a funding base, allowing the Red Cross to provide immediate relief to those impacted by disasters. This model ensures that the Red Cross has funds to prepare for disasters before they occur. In addition to the Foundation\u2019s initial investment, Caterpillar team members eager to help in a time of crisis contributed more than $20,000, which was matched by the Foundation to make an even greater impact.\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s support enabled the Red Cross to respond to disasters such as the Mayfield, Kentucky area when tornadoes ripped through the center of the United States, catastrophic flooding in several European countries and the Category 4 hurricane that made landfall near Port Fourchon, Louisiana.\nSOCIAL JUSTICE\n\nCaterpillar believes communities are strongest when there is equality for all. Partnerships with the Legal Defense Fund, U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation and Aspen Institute support community programs that address the destructive effects of racism and the fight for equal justice. Through its partnerships and initiatives, the Foundation is creating pathways for underserved and underresourced individuals to gain 21st century jobs through workforce readiness, vocational training and STEM education.\n\nIn 2021, the Foundation announced the creation of the first-ever Caterpillar Curator of African American Innovation and Entrepreneurship at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC). Through a $2 million grant, this position will direct initiatives to help NMAAHC advance new conversations and understanding of diversity and inclusion through the lens of African American innovation and entrepreneurship in science and technology.\n\nCATERPILLAR FOUNDATION AND THE UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (UN SDGs)\n\nThe Caterpillar Foundation\u2019s investments align with several of the UN SDGs. The Caterpillar Foundation works to build resilient communities in the places where we live and work and where there is need.\nREPORTING\n## ESG DATA\n\n### PEOPLE DATA\n\n|                        | 2018  | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  | GOAL 2030 | PERSPECTIVE |\n|------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-----------|-------------|\n| Total number of employees | 104,000 | 102,300 | 97,300 | 107,700 | N/A       |             |\n| Number of employees outside U.S. | 59,400 | 58,700 | 57,000 | 63,400 | N/A       |             |\n| Women in enterprise     | 20%   | 20%   | 20%   | 23%   | 29% (2022) | Caterpillar is committed to increasing female representation throughout the company and has an aspirational goal of 29% women in the enterprise and 25% women in leadership. |\n| Women in leadership     | 19%   | 20%   | 20%   | 21%   | 25% (2022) |             |\n| Collective bargaining % of employees covered | 40%   | 41%   | 40%   | 40%   | N/A       | We respect the right of our employees to form, join or not to join any lawful organization of their choice without fear of reprisal, interference, intimidation or harassment.

We have updated our reporting for 2021 and prior years to include this additional water use.\n\nNote: Photos in this report reflect different periods of the COVID-19 pandemic, complying with various safety protocol requirements.\nPRIORITIZATION AND MANAGEMENT OF ESG ISSUES\n\nIn 2020, we prioritized ESG topics by reviewing Caterpillar\u2019s strategies, risks and future plans, and examining the external industry landscape to understand both evolving trends as well as expectations of leading ESG standards, frameworks and disclosures.\n\nWe prioritized topics based on interviews with Caterpillar leadership, external research, benchmarking of industry peers and input from third-party consulting expertise, including:\n\n- Potential impact the topic may have on Caterpillar\u2019s business\n- Level of awareness and concern about the topic by business stakeholders (e.g., customers, dealers, suppliers, investors, nongovernmental organizations, and others)\n- Degree to which Caterpillar has influence over the topic\n\nOur final step was to select issues that were highest priority. These issues guide our initiatives and decision-making throughout our global operations and are closely aligned with topics covered by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), Resource Transformation sector and Industrial Machinery & Goods industry.\n\nWe will continue to analyze and update these topics periodically as the ESG landscape and our business continues to evolve. We are committed to demonstrating shareholder responsiveness as we strive for continuous improvement throughout our sustainability journey.\n\n| ISSUE                        | RELEVANCE                                                                                                                                 |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Employee Health & Safety     | The health and safety of our employees is an important focus at Caterpillar, and we relentlessly strive to ensure our workforce returns home safely every day. |\n| Customer Health & Safety     | Our commitment to safety includes people who work in, on and around our products \u2014 from designing products for safe operations to providing safety services for our customers. |\n| Product Emissions & Energy Efficiency | With more than 4 million products operating globally, Caterpillar is committed to contributing to a reduced-carbon future.

We interviewed relevant staff, reviewed site data capture and reporting methods, checked calculations and assessed the local internal quality assurance processes;\n- Desk-based review of source data for the significant contributing sites to each key corporate EHS metrics (e.g. energy, water, hours worked) including a sample of invoices and local incident logs, among others.\n\n**The limitations of our engagement**\n\nThe reliability of the assured information is subject to inherent uncertainties, given the available methods for determining, calculating or estimating the underlying information.

Caterpillar is headquartered in Deerfield, Illinois, USA.\n\nThis report has been prepared in accordance with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standards and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards: Core option. SASB publishes sector-specific reporting standards based on expert input and GRI publishes reporting standards based on company-conducted materiality assessments, both designed to allow businesses to identify the sustainability issues of highest importance to investors and most relevant in their industry. We are also working toward a common global purpose with contributions to the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). Further, we have committed to enhancing our reporting in alignment with the framework provided by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) starting in 2023.\n\nGiven the breadth of our products, services and solutions, our advocacy on behalf of policies that enable sustainable development and the Caterpillar Foundation\u2019s effort to build resilient communities, Caterpillar and our customers are helping build a more sustainable future. Report content represents 100% of the products and operations of Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries where we have a controlling financial interest. Where noted, Caterpillar\u2019s independent dealer network and supplier network are also represented. Caterpillar and subsidiary brands are listed on our website.\n\nCaterpillar\u2019s environmental and safety metrics for operations are consolidated based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol \u201coperational control\u201d approach. Environmental data excludes office locations with fewer than 500 employees and minor operations with fewer than 50 employees that will not have a significant impact on reported metrics. Safety data includes employees and agency workers in all workplaces within Caterpillar\u2019s reporting boundary.\n\nERM Certification and Verification Services (ERM CVS) has conducted independent assurance of selected 2021 environmental and safety data. To understand the scope, activities and conclusions of the assurance process, please see the ERM CVS Assurance Statement.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nCertain statements in this press release relate to future events and expectations and are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
