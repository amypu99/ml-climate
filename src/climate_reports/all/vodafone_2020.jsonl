I am immensely proud of our 104,000 strong team of dedicated people across all of the markets in which we operate. The determination, delivery and devotion from the whole Vodafone team is enabling our digital society to function and succeed during this intense period of need.\n\nOur customers have relied on the critical connectivity we provide more than ever before. The services and solutions we provide have helped businesses to continue to operate, children to continue schooling, healthcare to be provided and ensured governments can lead the response effectively. Also during periods of physical isolation, we have enabled families, friends and loved ones to remain connected.\n\nWe connect for a better future\n\nGiven the situation we have all experienced over the last few months, Vodafone\u2019s purpose to connect for a better future has become even more central in our decision-making process and response. In November 2019, we held an event for institutional investors to further set out our purpose, which we framed across three core areas:\n\nDigital Society\nWe believe in a connected digital society, where data flows at speed, connecting people, communities and things to the internet like never before.\n\nInclusion for All\nWe believe that the opportunities and promise of a better digital future should be accessible to all, and we are committed to ensuring that the more vulnerable are not left behind on the journey to that future.\n\nPlanet\nWe believe that urgent and sustained action is required to address climate change and that business success should not come at a cost to the environment.\n\nDuring the year, we have made strong progress against each of these areas, which is set out later in this report. The digital society has never been so important than in the last few months and we will continue to work with policy makers and regulators in a constructive manner to ensure we can continue to invest in the critical infrastructure and digital services our society deserves.\n\nWe also expanded upon our proposal of a \u2018social\u2019 contract between the communications services and technology providers, our customers and the industry regulators. The \u2018social\u2019 contract comprises three broad commitments:\n\n1. Trust: earning and retaining customer trust through quality networks and fair pricing, whilst avoiding micro-regulation;\n\n2. Fairness: enabling us to deliver quality infrastructure for all, whilst earning a fair return; and\n\n3. Leadership: partnership between small businesses, hardware manufacturers, technology firms, service providers and regulators throughout our ecosystem to drive innovation and deliver the digital society.\nStrong strategic progress\nFollowing the evolution of our strategy under Nick Read, we have delivered significant progress over the last year. With the completion of the acquisition of Liberty Global\u2019s assets in Germany and Central and Eastern Europe in July 2019, we have completed our transformation into Europe\u2019s leading converged operator.\n\nFurthermore, during the year we delivered strong progress against our key strategic objectives:\n\nDeepening customer engagement\nWe have consistently improved the quality and experience of service for our customers in both Europe and Africa, for both business and consumers.\n\nAccelerating digital transformation\nWe have further strengthened our digital channel capabilities, which delivers a better experience for our customers, whilst also reducing our costs.\n\nImproving asset utilisation\nWe have completed a number of network sharing arrangements and improved our return on capital and leverage through a successful infrastructure asset sale in Italy.\n\nOptimising the portfolio\nFollowing successful disposals of New Zealand and Malta and ongoing activity in Egypt and Australia, we have now substantially completed the reshaping of our business to focus on two scale platforms in Europe and Africa.\n\nGood financial performance\nIn a challenging industry and against a backdrop of unprecedented global uncertainty, we delivered good financial performance, in-line with our guidance. Total revenue grew by 3.0% to \u20ac45.0 billion, adjusted EBITDA grew by 2.6%* to \u20ac14.9 billion and free cash flow (pre-spectrum) grew by 4.7% to \u20ac5.7 billion.\n\nThis good financial performance was driven by strong commercial momentum in each of our markets. In Germany, our largest market, we delivered solid retail growth and record cable net customer additions in H2.\n\nIn the UK, we returned to service revenue growth supported by our strong commercial momentum in both mobile and fixed line. In both Italy and Spain, trends improved throughout the year despite the significant low-end price competition, and in Africa we continued to grow despite regulatory and macro pressures. This strong commercial momentum was supported by further progress on our ambitious cost saving programme. During the year, we delivered a further \u20ac0.4 billion of savings.\n\nOver the last two years, we have worked hard to strengthen our financial position. This has ensured we have longer tenure debt, no significant short-term refinancing needs and good liquidity headroom.\n\nThe good financial performance, strong commercial momentum and robust financial position mean that the Board have confidence to declare a total dividend per share of 9.00 eurocents for the year, implying a final dividend per share of 4.5 eurocents which will be paid on 7 August 2020.\n\nBoard composition\nAs I anticipated in my letter to you in last year\u2019s Annual Report, since I have now completed nine years on the Board a search was conducted during the period covered by this Report to find my successor as Chairman. Valerie Gooding, our Senior Independent Director, led a subcommittee of the Nominations & Governance Committee (excluding me) in this work. Further information on the search process is described on page 88.\n\nThe search was successful and I am pleased to announce the appointment of a new Non-Executive Director, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois van Boxmeer, who, subject to his election at our 2020 AGM, will succeed me as Chairman of the Board with effect from close of business on 3 November 2020.\n\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois van Boxmeer will step down as Chief Executive of Heineken in June 2020 after 15 years in role and 36 years with the company. In that period, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois transformed Heineken into a truly global organisation through a balance of strategic transactions and organic growth. The success of his strategy resulted in a nearly threefold increase in Heineken\u2019s share price and he is credited with creating significant shareholder value. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois is a member of the Shareholders Committee of Henkel and a non-executive director of Mondelez International. He will join Heineken Holding as a Non-Executive Director in June 2020. He is Vice-Chairman of the European Roundtable of Industrialists and in this role has led discussions with the European Commission across a range of issues.\n\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois brings this experience, together with his leadership skills and excellent network to Vodafone\u2019s Board. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois\u2019 biographical details are provided on page 77. I am confident that he will be effective in leading your Board, driving Vodafone forward in the execution of its strategy and engaging with our key stakeholders.\n\nThe year ahead\nThe Board and I remain focused on delivering on our purpose of connecting for a better future. A digital future that will drive further improvements in commercial performance and return on capital, making Vodafone the best value proposition in our industry for customers, shareholders and wider stakeholders.\n\nGerard Kleisterlee\nChairman\nOur business at a glance\n\nWhere we operate\n\nWe manage our business across two scaled and differentiated regional platforms \u2013 Europe and Africa.\n\nControlled operations\n\nEurope\n\nA converged leader\n\nAlbania\nCzech Republic\nGermany\nGreece\n\nHungary\nIreland\nItaly\nPortugal\n\nRomania\nSpain\nTurkey\nUK\n\n77% of Group service revenue\n\nMobile customers (m)\nMobile revenue market share (%)\nFixed broadband customers (m)\nFixed revenue market share (%)\nConsumer converged customers (m)\nConvergence penetration (%)\n\nGermany\n30.1\n30.5\n10.8\n34.9\n1.5\n13.4\n\nItaly\n19.2\n32.3\n2.9\n10.6\n1.0\n43.8\n\nUK\n18.0\n20.5\n0.8\n6.9\n0.4\n55.4\n\nSpain\n13.5\n16.2\n3.2\n16.2\n2.3\n91.6\n\nOther Europe\n29.5\nnm\n4.0\nnm\n0.6\n16.8\n\nProportionate sites\n\nEuropean TowerCo\n\nc. 60,000\n\nAfrica\n\nMobile data and payments leader\n\nVodacom Group:\nSouth Africa\nTanzania\nDemocratic Republic of Congo\nMozambique\nLesotho\n\nEgypt\nGhana\n\n16% of Group service revenue\n\nMobile customers (m)\nMobile revenue market share (%)\nFixed broadband customers (m)\nData customers (m)\nM-Pesa customers (m)\n\nSouth Africa\n45.1\n46.6\n0.1\n21.9\nnm\n\nEgypt\n40.2\n39.0\n0.7\n18.8\n1.0\n\nOther Africa\n47.4\nnm\n0.1\n22.2\n15.6\n\nOther\n\n7% of Group service revenue\n\nincludes partner markets and common functions\n\nJoint ventures and associates\n\nVodafoneZiggo\n(50% owned)\n\n5.1\n28.0\n3.4\n40.4\n1.4\n41.0\n\nVodafone Idea\n(44.4% owned)\n\n297.0\n28.0\n0.3\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\nVodafone Hutchison\n(50% owned)\n\n5.4\n171\n0.1\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\nSafaricom\n(26.1% owned)\n\n35.6\n\u2013\n0.1\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\nINWIT\n(33.2% owned)\n\n5.1\n28.0\n3.4\n40.4\n1.4\n41.0\n\nIndus Towers\n(47% owned)\n\n5.4\n171\n0.1\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\nWorldwide reach\n\n43 partner markets\n\nTo extend our reach beyond the companies we own, we have partnership agreements with local operators in 43 countries.\n\n182 countries with SD-WAN\n\nIn 2020, Gartner named us as a global leader in network services, including Software Defined \u2013 Wide Area Networking (SD-WAN) where we can currently service 182 countries.\n\n>100 5G cities\n\nWe have launched 5G in over 100 cities across 11 of our markets.\n\nNotes:\n\n1.

Service revenue includes mobile, fixed and converged services.\nKey trends shaping our industry\n\nOperating in a rapidly changing industry\n\nRising global smartphone penetration, ubiquitous superfast internet access, increasingly converged solutions and remarkable new technologies are rapidly transforming the way that we live and work, while simultaneously creating a range of new commercial, regulatory and societal challenges. These long-term opportunities and risks are reflected in our strategy.\n\nEurope Consumer\n\nFixed line\nThe demand for high-speed NGN broadband services over cable or fibre is growing rapidly. Over the next five years, Analysys Mason estimates that 35 million households will move to NGN services within Vodafone\u2019s Europe footprint. This represents a significant window of opportunity for operators with access to high quality Gigabit capable infrastructure. Fixed revenues in Europe grew by 1.1% over the last year, supported by this shift to NGN services.\n\nConvergence\nConsumers are increasingly buying converged bundles, which are a combination of mobile, voice, broadband and TV services.\n\nFor the consumer this provides the benefit of simplicity \u2014 one provider of multiple services \u2014 and better value. For operators this increases customer loyalty, improves customer retention and drives operational efficiencies. Demand for converged services is expected to continue to rise across all markets in Europe, although the pace of adoption will vary by market.\n\nMobile\nDemand for mobile data continues to grow rapidly. Over the last five years, mobile data traffic per user increased by over 55% per annum and growth over the next three years is expected to remain strong.\n\nThe challenge for operators is how to monetise this strong volume growth. European total mobile service revenues were flat in 2019, due to substantial unitary price deflation, driven by technological improvements, regulation and a high level of competition. We have launched speed-tiered unlimited data plans, which provides us with an opportunity to upsell customers to higher speed plans, while customers benefit from \u201cworry-free\u201d data usage. The roll-out of 5G services, which began last year, also represents an opportunity for operators to significantly reduce the cost of carrying data on their network. 5G will provide a range of new revenue opportunities over the medium term by enabling operators to offer innovative new products and services to customers.\n\nNote:\n1 Source: Analysys Mason.\n\nAfrica Consumer\n\nIn Africa, mobile data is growing rapidly, with data traffic increasing on average by 70% per annum over the last five years. This trend is expected to continue, driven by a lack of fixed line infrastructure and the rapid adoption of smartphones. The GSMA estimates that smartphone penetration will rise from 45% to 67% between 2018 and 2025.\n\nThis growth in smartphone penetration provides operators with the opportunity to go beyond connectivity and offer an expanding range of digital services to consumers for the first time, such as international money transfers, loans, handset financing, insurance and recently even merchant payments.\n\nNote:\n2 Source: Analysys Mason \u2013 Sub-Saharan Africa data.\n\nBusiness\n\nFixed line and convergence\nBusinesses are currently transitioning from traditional Wide Area Networks (WAN) to Software Defined Networks (SDN) in order to simplify their operations, increase their speed of execution, automate their networks and save costs. For operators, who have the expertise to take advantage of this, it represents a significant opportunity.\n\nThe demand for converged services is also growing, similar to the Consumer segment, with operators bringing together communication tools for businesses that work across all fixed and mobile end points.\n\nThe Internet of Things (\u2018IoT\u2019)\nThe demand for IoT is growing rapidly with a vast array of use cases, which range from sensors used to control industrial machinery and count stock levels to automated self-driving vehicles. The GSMA estimates that the number of business IoT connections will triple from 2019 to reach over 13 billion by 2025.\n\nMobile\nBusiness demand for mobile services has remained strong, enabling employees from large corporates to Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) safe and secure access to voice and data services.\n\nHowever, there continues to be significant price competition, which operators try to offset by cross-selling additional products and services. 5G is a significant medium-term growth opportunity for businesses, as it enables new technologies such as mobile edge computing and mobile private networks.\nRapid technological change\n\nOver the last 30 years, mobile and fixed networks have evolved significantly. In the 1990s, second generation (2G) mobile networks primarily carried voice calls and SMS data traffic (i.e. texts). Today, mobile users can experience 4G+ download speeds in excess of 800Mbps (~4,000 times faster than 2G) supported by the latest technological advancements, such as carrier aggregation and massive MIMO (multiple input and multiple output) antennae.\n\nThe latest evolution of mobile network technology is the deployment of 5G, supported largely by the infrastructure deployed for 4G, combined with new 5G radio spectrum and antennae. 5G enables download speeds of over 1Gbps combined with extremely low latency. Additionally, it will also support up to one million connected devices per square kilometre, 500 times more than 4G \u2013 vital for the IoT era.\n\nThe evolution of fixed networks has been equally rapid, with legacy copper technology being superseded by NGN infrastructure such as cable and fibre-to-the-home (FTTH). Broadband download speeds have evolved quickly from sub-64Kbps via a dialup modem in the late 1990s to download speeds of 1Gbps today, through high-speed NGN services. Further technological advancements, such as full duplex DOCSIS 3.1 and deeper fibre for cable, will deliver even faster speeds of up to 10Gbps in the future.\n\nDigital transformation opportunity\n\nThe world is undergoing a rapid digital transformation. New technologies including cloud computing, artificial intelligence and robotic process automation are enabling companies to connect with customers directly, proactively offering personalised solutions, while simplifying and automating operational processes and improving the efficiency of all commercial and technological decisions.\n\nDigitalisation is a key operational theme for the telecoms industry, which has a significant proportion of activities that can be automated, while also having unrivalled insight into customer usage trends. By using advanced digital technologies, operators will be able to enhance their customers\u2019 experience, generate incremental revenue opportunities, and reduce costs.\n\nThe cost cutting opportunity alone for European telecoms has been estimated to be as much as \u20ac60 billion3.\n\nSpeed of execution will be key in order for operators to further differentiate their services and retain the benefits from digitalisation.\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 is also likely to accelerate the adoption of digital services.\n\nNote: 3 Goldman Sachs.\n\nRegulatory intervention\n\nThe remit of regulators is extensive, including wholesale charges between operators, spectrum allocation, and obligations in relation to consumer rights. Regulators are also responsible for topics relating to data protection and cyber security. The decision to regulate or not has material consequences. Within the broad remit of ensuring sustainably competitive markets, regulators are tasked with striking the right balance between short-term consumer welfare through measures such as regulated prices and longer-term consumer welfare by incentivising investment. In 2018 the European Electronic Communications Code was finalised and will be transposed into national law by the end of 2020. The Code overhauled the existing telecoms rules and sought to tip the balance towards longer-term consumer welfare through measures to incentivise the roll-out and take-up of NGN high capacity networks. It also includes a broader set of services in its remit, including over-the-top communication services for the first time.\n\nHowever, the Code also introduces new regulation in relation to international calls within the EU. We await the implementation of the Code at a national level. Overall, Governments and policy makers have recognised that Gigabit networks will underpin the digital competitiveness of the entire economy. We therefore expect an enabling policy environment to ensure that investors in networks are able to earn a fair return on their investments, ensuring that societies realise their full potential for economic growth.\n\nHighly competitive markets\n\nThe European telecommunications industry is highly competitive, with many alternative providers giving customers a wide choice of suppliers. In each of the countries in which we operate, there are typically three or four mobile network operators (MNOs), such as Vodafone, which own their own network infrastructure, as well as several resellers that \u201cwholesale\u201d network services from MNOs.\n\nIn addition, there are an increasing number of over-the-top operators that provide internet-based apps for content and communication services. In fixed, there is usually one national incumbent (typically the former state owned operator), who is generally required to offer wholesale access to its network at regulated prices to resellers, while most markets will also have one or two cable or satellite operators.\n\nIn some markets, the uncompetitive wholesale access terms offered by incumbents and the slow pace of NGN infrastructure roll-out has seen the emergence of alternative fibre builders, who are looking to capitalise on the growing customer demand for Gigabit speeds by offering attractive wholesale access terms to resellers.\n\nChanging customer and societal expectations\n\nTechnology and connectivity can create a more positive future for societies around the world. Every day, we work to help our customers, partners and other stakeholders understand how new technology can enhance their business and contribute to socio-economic progress.\n\nHowever it is important to recognise that the benefits of a connected society need to be accessible to all and cannot come at the cost of the future of our planet. Society expects companies to find ways to minimise their impact on the environment while continuing to grow. They also expect organisations to help to bridge the divides that exist and find ways to address inequalities.\n\nWe believe that our technology can give marginalised communities access to the transformative power that connectivity delivers, as it democratises access to better health information, education resources and financial services for people around the world.\n\nWe are also doing our utmost to support society during the COVID-19 outbreak \u2013 providing critical connectivity and communications services to help the communities in which we operate.\nOur business model\n\nUsing our leading scale and superior Gigabit infrastructure to create value\n\nDifferentiated assets\n- Leading scale\n- Unique platforms\n- Our people\n- The \u2018Spirit of Vodafone\u2019\n- Our brand\n\nGrowth opportunities\n- Europe Consumer\n  - A converged leader\n- Africa Consumer\n  - Mobile data and payments leader\n- Business\n  - Unique global footprint\n\nFinancial strength\n- Revenue\n- Cost\n- Free cash flow\n- Balance sheet\n\nOur business model is underpinned by our...\n- Sustainable business focus\n- \u2018Social\u2019 contract\n- People and our culture\n- Risk management\n- Strong governance framework\nCreating value for society and returns for our shareholders\n\n**Shareholders**\n- Total dividend per share in FY20: 900 eurocents.\n\n**Society**\n- Improving one billion lives and halving our environmental impact.\n\n**Our people**\n- COVID-19 pulse survey results: 84% of employees feel well connected to their team.\u00b9\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Based on our third Global Pulse Survey.\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nEngaging regularly with our stakeholders is fundamental to the way we do business. This ensures we operate in a balanced and responsible way, both in the short and longer-term. We are committed to maintaining good communications and building positive relationships with all our stakeholders, as we see this as essential to strengthening our sustainable business.

We have also continued to invest in our fixed and mobile Gigabit network infrastructure and digital services, to provide faster speeds for our customers, as well as successfully managing the recent surges in demand.\n\nThe services Vodafone provides are more important than ever and we are committed to playing a key role in society\u2019s recovery to the \u201cnew normal\u201d.\n\nI am pleased with the rapid, comprehensive and coordinated way we responded to the COVID-19 crisis. I want to give my personal thanks to the entire Vodafone team, who through their dedication, expertise and professionalism, have kept families, friends and communities connected, enabled students to continue their education, helped businesses operate and proactively supported governments to deliver critical services.\n\nCOVID-19 response: Rapid, comprehensive and coordinated response to support the digital society\n\nWe are committed to doing our utmost to support society during this period of uncertainty and change. As a provider of critical connectivity and communications services enabling our digital society, we announced a five-point plan to help the communities in which we operate. Our plan is to:\n\n- maintain network service quality;\n- provide network capacity and services for critical government functions;\n- improve dissemination of information to the public;\n- facilitate working from home and help small and micro businesses within our supply chain; and\n- improve governments\u2019 insights in affected areas.\n\nTeams throughout our markets have worked tirelessly to deliver our five-point plan and to support all the communities in which we operate. So far, the actions we have taken have totalled donations of goods and services of approximately \u20ac100 million, reaching 78 million customers.\nOur purpose: We connect for a better future\nWe work hard to build a digital future that works for everyone. It is our ambition to improve one billion lives and halve our environmental impact by 2025. We are driving progress towards the delivery of our 2025 targets across three pillars: Digital Society, Inclusion for All, and Planet. We also remain dedicated to ensuring that Vodafone operates responsibly and ethically.\n\nTo demonstrate our commitment to delivering on our purpose, we will be introducing a number of purpose-led ambitions into our Executive global long-term incentive plan. Subject to shareholder approval at our 2020 AGM, these ambitions will be included from the FY21 grant onward, and will be directly linked to the progress made across our three pillars. Further details on this can be found in this year\u2019s Remuneration Report.\n\nOur performance: Good financial performance\nGroup revenue increased by 3.0% to \u20ac45.0 billion, reflecting the underlying improvement in commercial performance and the contribution from the acquired Liberty Global assets, which were consolidated from August 2019, partially offset by the disposal of Vodafone New Zealand. Group organic service revenue increased by 0.8%* to \u20ac37.9 billion and adjusted EBITDA increased by 2.6%* to \u20ac14.9 billion driven by our commercial momentum and strong delivery of our multi-year cost saving programme. Free cash flow (pre-spectrum) increased by 4.7% to \u20ac5.7 billion.\n\nAs a result of the good financial performance, robust financial position and our liquidity position, I am pleased that the Board has declared total dividends per share for the year of 9.00 eurocents (FY19: 9.00 eurocents). A further review of our financial performance is detailed on pages 30 to 39.\n\nOur strategy: Strong progress on all four strategic priorities\nAt the start of the financial year, we set out four strategic priorities that would guide our actions and ambitions:\n\n- deepening customer engagement;\n- accelerating digital transformation;\n- improving asset utilisation; and\n- optimising the portfolio.\n\nThroughout the year we have executed at pace across all four priorities. Whilst much work remains to be achieved in the years ahead, we have delivered a significant step-change in progress against our transformation agenda. Pages 20 to 25 detail our progress against each of these priorities. Particular highlights during the year include:\n\n- successfully launched 5G services in 11 markets, together with new unlimited plans;\n- delivering a sixth consecutive quarter of improvement in customer loyalty;\n- adding more than 1.4 million new NGN fixed-line customers;\n- delivering two-thirds of our ambitious, multi-year digital transformation strategy, with a cumulative \u20ac0.8 billion of net operating cost savings in Europe generated so far;\n- becoming the first telecommunications operator in Europe to reach an agreement with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to support ultra-low latency mobile edge computing services;\n- concluding a range of network sharing partnerships across Europe including with Deutsche Telekom in Germany, Telecom Italia in Italy, Orange in Spain and Romania, Telefonica in the UK, and Wind in Greece;\n- completing the merger of our passive tower infrastructure in Italy with INWIT, which generated \u20ac2.35 billion in cash and a 37.5% shareholding in INWIT (which we subsequently sold down to 33.2% in April 2020); and\n- completing a significant amount of portfolio simplification activity to enable greater focus on our two regional platforms in Europe and Africa.\n\nOutlook: Accelerating strategic priorities to support societal recovery\nWhilst we are not immune to the pressures facing the economies in which we operate, we have a relatively resilient operating model and we are accelerating key aspects of our strategic priorities to support societal recovery. The events of the last few months have reaffirmed the importance that governments, businesses and societies place on high quality, reliable and affordable technology and connectivity. This is providing us with an opportunity to accelerate the pace at which we can provide new products and services to meet the increasing connectivity demands of our customers, across all of our markets.\n\nWe are transforming our channel mix and digital customer care teams at pace and are radically simplifying our cost structures through the use of technology. We are driving down the costs and environmental impact of our networks through network sharing arrangements and our European tower company is now fully operational. Our focus will remain on executing our strategic agenda at pace, managing the shorter-term challenges that are undoubtedly present, whilst continuing to connect for a better future.\n\nChairman succession\nI would like to thank Gerard personally for his substantial contribution to the Company since he became our Chairman nine years ago. We have all benefited considerably from his leadership, experience and wise counsel during a period of significant strategic transformation. I look forward to welcoming Jean-Fran\u00e7ois van Boxmeer to the Board. He has presided over a highly successful period of transformation and value creation at Heineken, has extensive international experience in driving growth, and is highly-regarded as one of the longest standing and most successful CEOs in Europe.\n\nNick Read\nChief Executive\nOur purpose\n\nWe connect for a better future\n\nWe are a communications technology company connecting over 334 million people, and organisations of all sizes, to the digital society. We are optimistic about how technology and connectivity can enhance the future and improve people\u2019s lives.\n\nThrough our business, we aim to build a digital society that enhances socio-economic progress, embraces everyone and does not come at the cost of our planet.\n\nThat is why we have committed to improve one billion lives and halve our environmental impact by 2025, by taking concrete action in three areas:\n\nDigital Society | Inclusion for All | Planet\nWe believe in a connected digital society, where data flows at speed, connecting people, communities and things to the internet like never before. Gigabit networks, IoT and mobile financial services enable incredible innovation and technologies to be developed to help make our lives easier, healthier, smarter and more fulfilling.\n\nCitizens will access an ever-growing range of services in real-time and businesses can develop new products and services to meet the needs of future generations.\n\nConnecting over 250m people to our next generation networks by 2025\n\nConnecting over 150m vehicles to the IoT by 2025\nWe will create more efficient, safer and smarter transport.\n\nWith a mobile phone and an M-Pesa account, people on low incomes can send, receive and store money safely and securely, giving them more control over their financial affairs.\n\nConnecting over 50m people and their families to mobile money services by 2025\nOur purpose (continued)\n\nWe believe that the opportunities and promise of a better digital future should be accessible to all and are committed to ensuring that the more vulnerable are not left behind on the journey towards that future. Through our technology, we will work to bridge the divides that exist and help people to contribute equally and fully to society.\n\nConnecting an additional 20m women in Africa and Turkey to mobile by 2025\n\nThrough specially designed products and services, we will help to improve health and wellbeing, create financial inclusion and increase safety and security, so women can reach their full potential.\n\nSupporting 10m young people to access digital skills, learning and employment opportunities by 2022\n\nWe will help to upskill the next generation and support them to succeed in the digital economy.\n\nImproving the lives of 400m people through our Foundation programmes by 2025\n\nWe aim to support the more vulnerable people in society, enabling free access to healthcare and educational resources and creating opportunities for them to improve their lives and livelihoods.\n\nNote: 1 Excludes Egypt.\nWe believe that urgent and sustained action is required to address climate change and that business success should not come at a cost to the environment. Through our commitment to halve our environmental impact, we will help to ensure a sustainable future for all. Our focus on energy efficiency, renewable energy supply and network waste reduction will help us to mitigate the growth of our business and our customers\u2019 increasing demand for data.\n\nWe will significantly reduce our impact on the environment, while ensuring we can continue to grow profitably.\n\n**Reducing our greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2025**\n\n**Purchasing**\n\n100% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2025\n\nWe will reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, future-proof our energy supply and help to create a healthier planet for everyone.\n\n**Reusing, reselling or recycling**\n\n100% of our redundant network equipment\n\nWe will reduce the amount of electronic waste produced by our business and will support the move towards a more circular economy.\n\nNotes:\n1. Against a 2017 baseline.\n2. Excluding hazardous waste.\nOur strategy\n\nDeepening customer engagement\n\n| Our ambition | Consumer | Europe | Africa |\n|--------------|----------|--------|--------|\n\nWe aim to deepen the relationship we have with our customers by selling additional products and services, particularly fixed and converged products in Europe and mobile data and financial services in Africa. This will drive revenue growth and improve customer loyalty.\n\n| Business | Our strategy in the Business segment is to drive growth and deepen engagement with our existing mobile customers by cross-selling additional total communications products including next generation (NGN) fixed, IoT and Cloud services. |\nOur progress\n\nConsumer\n\nWe have made strong progress on our strategy and delivered a more consistent commercial performance across both Europe and Africa this year. This has driven six consecutive quarters of improved customer loyalty, with mobile contract churn in Europe down 1 percentage point year-on-year (see chart below). Based on Consumer net promoter scores, at the end of the period the Group was a leader or co-leader in 12 out of 18 markets. We also maintained our good momentum in mobile and NGN net additions.\n\nEurope\n\nWe are the largest mobile and fixed operator in Europe, supported by:\n\n- Our NGN fixed-line network which is the largest in Europe and covers 136 million households (see chart below). This provides us with a significant opportunity to capture market share gains and increase average revenue as customers move from legacy Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) to Gigabit capable technologies. By FY23, we will be able to deliver Gigabit speeds to approximately 50 million homes across Europe on our own network (see chart below).\n\n- Driving convergence across our customer base. We believe there is a strong opportunity to increase the number of customers who subscribe to converged or multi-product services. This also helps improve customer loyalty.\n\n- Our subscription-based television distribution business in Europe, which now has over 22 million active customer subscriptions. During the year we launched a number of specific commercial initiatives. These included:\n  - Launching new speed-tiered unlimited mobile data plans across six markets, meeting customers\u2019 demand for \u201cworry-free\u201d data usage and creating opportunities for revenue growth. Our unlimited data customer base totalled 4 million consumer SIMs by the end of FY20. We also launched 5G services in 97 cities across eight European markets.\n  - In Germany, following the acquisition of Unitymedia, we are the leading provider of Gigabit services with a significant speed advantage over the incumbent operator. The percentage of homes passed on our network that subscribe to our NGN broadband service was 33% in FY20, reflecting the significant opportunity we still have to increase our market share and upsell customers to higher speed packages. In Q4, we launched a new \u201cGigaCable Max\u201d campaign as part of the re-branding of Unitymedia to Vodafone which highlighted our network advantage. This campaign has been highly successful and helped drive record cable net additions of more than 250,000 in H2.\n\n- In the UK, we began a new campaign, the \u201cGreat British Broadband Switch\u201d, to coincide with new regulation relating to out-of-contract broadband customer notifications. This campaign contributed to a record number of new Consumer fixed customers added in the fourth quarter. Fixed-line broadband connections now total 751,000.\n\nAfrica\n\nIn Africa, demand for mobile data remains significant given the lack of fixed line infrastructure. There is also a substantial opportunity to grow M-Pesa (our mobile payments platform) and expand it into new financial and digital services.\n\nDuring the year, we saw continued growth in the demand for mobile data. Monthly average data usage increased to 2.0GB (FY19: 1.4GB) and the total number of data users grew by 70 million to 82.6 million.\nOur strategy (continued)\n\nDeepening customer engagement (continued)\n\nOur progress\n\nBusiness\n\nVodafone Business has increased its pace of strategic execution following the appointment, in September 2019, of Vinod Kumar to lead our cross-geography activities. Business customers, ranging from entrepreneurial sole traders through to large global organisations, contribute 28% to our total service revenue.\n\n- We continue to see a significant opportunity to win market share in the evolving wide area networking (\u2018WAN\u2019) market. With businesses more reliant on remote working and multi-site operations than ever before, we are seeing larger enterprise customers investing in more reliable software defined networking (\u2018SDN\u2019) and moving away from legacy solutions which are both less reliable and more expensive to maintain.\n\n- Our leading global Internet of Things (\u2018IoT\u2019) platform continues to resonate with Business customers and we added 19.5 million new SIM connections during the year. Our IoT connections support a range of industries including car manufacturers, logistics, energy and healthcare.\n\n- In December, we were the first telecommunications operator in Europe to announce an agreement with Amazon Web Services (\u2018AWS\u2019) to support ultra-low latency mobile edge computing services by deploying AWS Wavelength solutions at the edge of Vodafone\u2019s 5G networks, as part of our multi-cloud strategy. With low latency, the new services will help support artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, video analytics, autonomous vehicles, robotics and drone control, and will generate incremental revenues for the Group.\n\n- Our Business customer activities continue to gain traction in South Africa, with revenue from Business customers now contributing 20% of total service revenue.\n\nBusiness global footprint\n\nMarkets with SD-WAN coverage\n\nDelivering financial inclusion in Tanzania \u2013 M-Pesa\n\n6.7m\nM-Pesa customers (58% of mobile customers using M-Pesa)\n\n5.3m\nM-Pesa customers using \u201cSongesha\u201d\n\n35.0%\nM-Pesa revenue contribution to service revenue\n\n\u20ac1.6bn\nvalue of M-Pesa transactions processed monthly\n\nWe have a vision to take Tanzania into the digital age, where our mobile money service M-Pesa will allow the country to gradually reduce its reliance on cash transactions and pave the way for digital and mobile payments. Tanzania has a predominantly rural population, which makes access to traditional financial services challenging but creates an opportunity for digital solutions.\n\nMobile money agents have played a fundamental role in strengthening financial inclusion by helping to extend access to the unbanked population. Over the last decade, M-Pesa has been a remarkable success story, delivering significant social and financial value and deepen our relationship with customers.\n\nVodafone Tanzania is now moving away from the prevailing perception that M-Pesa is only a tool to send and receive money. It is evolving to become a platform for rolling out financial services that address the financial needs of Tanzanians. To date, our partnerships with commercial banks in Tanzania have delivered services that address key financial needs. Examples include overdraft services through \u201cSongesha\u201d, a partnership with TPB Bank; loans and saving services to small entrepreneurs with \u201cM-Pawa\u201d, a partnership with the Commercial Bank of Africa, and our Sharia-compliant \u201cHalal-Pesa\u201d in partnership with Amana Bank. In partnership with TPB Bank, we provided community-based digital financial solutions through \u201cM-Koba\u201d.\n\nMost small businesses in African markets like Tanzania are run by women, often before developing business knowledge including bookkeeping or accounting. By equipping women with mobile financial tools and enabling them to access information, we empower them to improve their financial literacy and help them learn new ways of doing business. In turn, this improves their overall wellbeing and the economic welfare of their families, with a significant effect on wider society, the economy and the country as a whole.\n\nRead more on how Vodafone is improving lives through M-Pesa on page 43\nAccelerating digital transformation\n\nOur ambition\nWe have a clear ambition to strengthen our differentiation and lead the industry in capturing the benefits of digital. As a result, we are systematically transforming our operating model by being Digital \u2018First\u2019 \u2013 delivering a fundamentally improved customer experience whilst also structurally lowering our cost base. We shared our ambitions at an investor event in September 2019, where we discussed three primary areas of focus: digital customer management, digital technology management and digital operations.\n\nOur progress\nIn FY19, we began our multi-year programme to generate at least \u20ac1.2 billion of net savings from operating expenses in Europe and Group common functions. At the end of the financial year we had successfully achieved \u20ac0.8 billion of our original target and we remain on track to achieve the remaining \u20ac0.4 billion in the financial year ahead. Highlights of activity in the financial year include the following:\n\n- We have increased the use of technology to communicate with existing customers. We are migrating from less efficient manual models and call centres, to \u201calways-on\u201d digital marketing. At the end of the financial year, 11 of our 13 European markets were using these new systems.\n\n- Assisting our customers with routine queries is a central part of our operations. In FY19, we conducted over 42 million assisted conversations through our contact centres every month.\n\nThis incurred an annual cost of over \u20ac1.2 billion. Through a targeted programme of technology deployment, including our Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistant \u201cTOBi\u201d, we reduced the number of customer calls by 20% over the last two years.\n\n- In FY19, we had almost 7,700 retail stores across the Group, which drove \u20ac800 million of annual operating expenses. We still see a central role for retail stores in our future channel mix, but we are evolving to a more integrated and holistic approach to channel management. By the end of the financial year we had reduced our store footprint by 7%.\n\n- Across the Group, we have over 20,000 team members within our shared services, under the banner \u201c_VOIS\u201d. This is a digital operations centre of excellence. Over the last two years, we have created 3,500 FTE role efficiencies through robotics, artificial intelligence and process optimisation.\n\nOur teams have continued to identify further cost saving and efficiency opportunities in addition to this initial target in a number of areas. As a result, we are extending our cost transformation programme. We are now targeting to deliver at least \u20ac1 billion of net operating expense savings during FY21-23, in addition to the \u20ac0.8 billion delivered in FY19-20.\n\nMoreover, we expect to deliver a net reduction in commissions paid to distribution channels. Every year, we spend approximately \u20ac2.5 billion in commissions to third parties. As we move our sales towards digital direct channels we expect these costs to reduce over time and contribute to our margin expansion.\n\nOur digital journey: towards a fully digital operating model\n\n| March 2017 | March 2020 | March 2021+ |\n|------------|------------|-------------|\n| \u2018Digital Vodafone\u2019 Building the foundations/ organisational design | Digital \u2018First\u2019 Systematic Group-wide execution to deliver a superior operating model | Digital becomes our primary channel |\n| CVM enabled by big data\u00b9 | 15% | 82% | 100% |\n| Digital channels share of sales mix\u00b2 | 9% | 21% | >40% |\n| MyVodafone app penetration\u00b9 | 55% | 65% | 95% |\n| Chatbots (% of contacts)\u00b3 | 0% | 29% | 60% |\n| Frequency of contacts\u00b9\u00b3 | 1.8 | 1.4 | 0.9 |\n\nNotes:\n1.

FOC requiring human intervention per year.\nOur strategy (continued)\n\nImproving asset utilisation\n\nOur ambition\nWe aim to improve the utilisation of all of the Group\u2019s assets as part of our focus on improving the Group\u2019s return on capital.\n\nOur progress\nWe employ significant capital resources across both our fixed line and mobile communications infrastructure. The quality of our network is of paramount importance in delivering an overall compelling experience for our customers. Over the past year we have explored a number of routes to improve both the capacity and coverage of our networks, whilst also improving the utilisation of these valuable assets. These initiatives include:\n\n- \u201cPassive\u201d sharing: reciprocal access with other communications providers to the physical mobile sites (i.e. towers and rooftops) to install radio equipment;\n- \u201cDeep passive\u201d infrastructure sharing: as above, but also including reciprocal access with other communications providers to the high-speed fixed infrastructure connecting mobile sites;\n- \u201cActive\u201d infrastructure sharing: reciprocal access with other communications providers to both the physical mobile sites and radio equipment, outside of major urban areas; and\n- Asset \u201cmonetisation\u201d: monetising our infrastructure assets, highlighting the valuation gaps between infrastructure assets and listed telecommunications providers.\n\nDuring the year, we made strong progress in each of these areas, with the following highlights:\n\n- We have now secured a range of network sharing partnerships across Europe including: Deutsche Telekom in Germany, Telecom Italia in Italy, Orange in Spain and Romania, Telefonica in the UK and Wind in Greece. These network sharing agreements support improved mobile coverage in rural areas, reduce our environmental impact, increase the pace of 5G network deployment and generate significant cost savings.\n- In March 2020, we completed the merger of our passive tower infrastructure in Italy with INWIT. This merger has created Italy\u2019s leading tower company with over 22,000 towers. Vodafone received \u20ac2.1 billion in cash and a 37.5% shareholding in the combined entity. In April 2020, we received special dividends of \u20ac0.2 billion following the INWIT recapitalisation and subsequently sold down 4.3% of our shareholding realising a further \u20ac0.4 billion of proceeds. Our current shareholding in INWIT is 33.2% and we intend to retain joint control alongside Telecom Italia.\n- In July 2019, we announced our intention to separate our European tower infrastructure and to explore a variety of monetisation alternatives. We have now completed the operational separation, with the full management team in place. We are preparing for a potential IPO in early calendar 2021, and we are targeting to provide financial information at our interim results in November 2020.\n- We have made a fast start on integrating the recently acquired Liberty Global assets in Germany and CEE and remain confident that we will deliver the \u20ac535 million of targeted annual cost and capex savings by the fifth full year post-completion. We have launched converged offers in all four markets, and are encouraged by the uptake.\n\nMobile network sharing and scaled fixed infrastructure\n\nMobile network sharing agreements in place in all major markets:\n\n5G in 97 cities across eight markets\n\n136 million marketable NGN homes:\n- 32 million on-net Gigabit capable\n- 23 million on-net NGN\n- 20 million strategic partnerships\n- 61 million wholesale access\n\nTargeting c.50 million on-net Gigabit homes by FY23\nOur progress\nOver the last two years, we have executed a significant amount of portfolio activity, in order to reposition the Group as a converged communications technology provider across our two scaled geographic platforms in Europe and Africa. The optimisation of our portfolio is now substantially complete.

As a result we achieved our financial targets for FY20.\n\nPaying for performance\nThe incentive plans used to reward the performance of our Directors and senior managers, with some local variances, include measures linked to our KPIs. This year performance under the financial metrics was broadly at or above the mid-point of the target range with performance under the customer appreciation KPIs metrics being below the mid-point of the range. Further details can be found in our Directors\u2019 Remuneration Report.\n\nOrganic service revenue growth\n\n| % | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Growth in revenue demonstrates our ability to grow our customer base and/or ARPU. This year we continued to grow revenue as commercial momentum improved across our markets. Overall, we delivered organic Group service revenue growth of 0.8%* in the year. | 2.0* | 0.3* | 0.8 |\n\nEurope net operating expense reduction\n\n| \u00a3bn | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Over the last two years we have generated over \u20ac0.8 billion of net opex savings against our FY21 >\u20ac1.2 billion opex plan. As we accelerate our digital transformation, we have enlarged and expanded our cost reduction target and now expect to deliver at least \u20ac1 billion of net opex savings during FY21\u201323 in addition to the \u20ac0.8 billion already delivered. | 0.3 | 0.4 | 0.4 |\n\nOrganic adjusted EBITDA growth\n\n| % | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Growth in adjusted EBITDA supports our free cash flow which helps fund investment and shareholder returns. Our adjusted EBITDA grew organically by 2.6%* this year and consequently the Group\u2019s adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 0.7 percentage points to 33.1%. | 6.5* | 3.1* | 2.6 |\n\nAdjusted earnings per share\neurocents\n\n| 2018 | 2019 | 2020 |\n|---|---|---|\n| Adjusted earnings per share declined by 10.7%, principally driven by increased financing costs and a higher average share count following the issuance of new Mandatory Convertible bonds in March 2019. | 11.59* | 6.27 | 5.60 |\n\nFree cash flow pre-spectrum\n\n| \u00a3bn | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Cash generation is a key driver of long-term shareholder returns.

These were to deliver a more consistent commercial performance in Europe, transform our cost base by leveraging new digital technologies, and to optimise our capital allocation to improve our return on capital and balance sheet strength.\n\nIn FY20 we performed well, growing organic EBITDA by 2.6%* to \u20ac14.9 billion and delivering free cash flow (pre-spectrum) of \u20ac5.7 billion, which was ahead of our \u201caround\u201d \u20ac5.4 billion guidance.\n\nCommercial performance: Accelerating momentum across Europe and Africa\n\nOur commercial momentum has been improving in all of our major European markets. Group organic service revenue increased by 0.8%* to \u20ac37.9 billion in FY20. We exited the year with service revenue growth of 1.6%* in Q4.\n\n- Our German business now represents a third of Group adjusted EBITDA and around 40% of free cash flow, following the acquisition and integration of Unitymedia\u2019s cable and TV assets. Service revenue was flat* at \u20ac10.7 billion as solid retail growth was offset by declining wholesale revenues and the impact of international call rate regulation. Excluding these impacts, retail revenue grew by 1.7%* (including Unitymedia), supported by our improved commercial momentum and record cable net customer additions in H2.\n\n- In Italy, service revenue declined by 3.9%* to \u20ac4.8 billion. Mobile customer trends improved throughout the year despite significant low-end price competition, and in the fixed business we continued to maintain good growth.\n\n- In the UK, we returned to service revenue growth reflecting our strong commercial momentum during the year. This was supported by our successful launch of speed-tiered unlimited data plans in mobile, our co-best network position, and record consumer fixed broadband additions in Q4. Service revenue grew by 0.5%* to \u20ac5.0 billion.\n\n- The market in Spain has been challenging for some time following the entrant of a new competitor. Our service revenue declined by 6.7%* to \u20ac3.9 billion. However, the commercial actions we have taken have stabilised our customer base and improved the rate of our service revenue decline to 2.7%* in Q4.\n\n- In our other Europe markets, we continued to perform well with service revenue growing by 3%* to \u20ac4.9 billion. Customer growth remained robust across both mobile and fixed line, and we exited the year with single digit mobile contract churn in four out of seven markets.\n\n- Our African business, Vodacom, performed well with service revenues growing 3.3%* to \u20ac4.5 billion. Trends in South Africa improved despite regulatory and macro pressures, and Vodacom\u2019s International operations continued to grow strongly.\nCost transformation: Delivering a best-in-class cost structure\n\nIn FY19, we began a multi-year programme of work to reduce our cost base and achieve industry leading levels of efficiency, alongside improving network quality and the overall experience for our customers. We set an ambitious target to reduce our net operating expenses in Europe and common functions by at least \u20ac1.2 billion over three years, by the end of FY21. During FY20, we delivered a further \u20ac0.4 billion of incremental net opex savings, meaning we are now two-thirds through our original target.\n\nThis strong execution of our cost transformation agenda, alongside improving commercial momentum, has enabled us to deliver a fifth consecutive year of EBITDA margin expansion. From FY15 to FY20, our EBITDA margin has increased from 28.3% to 33.1% in FY20. In Europe, we also returned to EBITDA growth of 3%* during the second half of the year.\n\nAs we enter into the last year of our original \u20ac1.2 billion plan, we are extending our ambition to deliver net opex savings of at least \u20ac1 billion during FY21-23. This is in addition to the \u20ac0.8 billion already delivered in FY19-20. We are therefore targeting a reduction in overall net operating costs in Europe by 20% over five years.\n\nOn top of structural operating expense savings, we believe that our distribution transformation, which is driving a rapid increase in sales through digital direct channels, will also allow us to generate significant commission costs efficiencies.\n\nCapital allocation: Decisive actions to improve returns\n\nOver the last two years, we have focused on the return on capital our business generates, alongside improving our EBITDA margin and sustaining cash flow generation. We have specifically focused on the following areas:\n\n- disciplined allocation of capital to network maintenance, capacity improvements and growth initiatives, maintaining total capital expenditure at around 17% of revenue;\n- completed network sharing agreements in all major European markets, which will enable us to improve both the coverage and capacity of our network, with greater capital efficiency; and\n- simplified our portfolio, which generated over \u20ac4 billion of cash during FY20.\n\nIn FY20, we increased our controlled pre-tax Group return on capital to 6.1%, from 5.3% in FY19, including the impact of the recently acquired Liberty Global assets. This is new external disclosure, but has been a significant factor in our internal planning and capital allocation process for many years, and we will now continue to report its progress in the future. Further information of this measure is included on page 39.\n\nFinancial position: Robust balance sheet\n\nOverall, our balance sheet is robust. We have doubled our average debt maturity to 12 years; growth initiatives, maintaining total capital expenditure at around 17% of revenue; and to reduce leverage towards the lower end of our target range of 2.5-3.0x net debt to EBITDA; and to maintain our returns to shareholders.\n\nDividend: Distribution in-line with our capital allocation priorities\n\nThe Group is in a robust financial position with good liquidity, no material short-term refinancing requirements and with resilient free cash flow generation. As a result, the Board is declaring a full year dividend of 900 eurocents per share.\n\nOur capital allocation priorities are to support investment in critical network infrastructure; to reduce leverage towards the lower end of our target range of 2.5-3.0x net debt to EBITDA; and to maintain our returns to shareholders.\n\nMargherita Della Valle\nChief Financial Officer\n\nOutlook: Relatively resilient operating model with underlying commercial momentum\n\nThe economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in our markets, whilst uncertain, is likely to be significant. Our business model is more resilient than many other sectors, but we are not immune to the challenges. We are experiencing a direct impact on our roaming revenues from lower international travel and we also expect economic pressures to impact our customer revenues over time. However, we are also seeing significant increases in data volumes and further improvements in loyalty, as our customers place greater value on the quality, speed and reliability of our networks. Based on the current prevailing assessments of the global macroeconomic outlook, we expect to generate free cash flow (pre-spectrum) of at least \u20ac5 billion in FY21.\n\nNote: 1 \u20ac13,284 million of cash and cash equivalents and \u20ac5,247 million of short term investments, excluding \u20ac6,407 million of gross cash collateral balances.\nOur financial performance\n\nGood results with improved commercial momentum\n\n\u2013 Group revenue grew by 3.0% to \u20ac45.0 billion, driven by improving commercial momentum in Europe\n\u2013 Total net operating cost savings of \u20ac0.4 billion in the year, facilitated by continued digital transformation\n\u2013 Adjusted EBITDA grew by 2.6%* to \u20ac14.9 billion, reflecting commercial momentum and cost savings progress\n\u2013 Free cash flow (pre-spectrum) grew by 4.7% to \u20ac5.7 billion, driven by revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth and capital discipline\n\u2013 Dividends per share of 9.00 eurocents\n\nAll amounts in this document marked with an \u201c*\u201d represent organic growth, which presents performance on a comparable basis, both in terms of merger and acquisition activity (notably by excluding the disposal of Vodafone New Zealand and the acquired Liberty Global assets), movements in foreign exchange rates and the impact from the implementation of IFRS 16 \u201cLeases\u201d.

As a result, the Group\u2019s statutory results for the year ended 31 March 2020 are on an IFRS 16 basis, whereas the comparative period for the year ended 31 March 2019 are on an IAS 17 basis. Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements explains the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 on the consolidated financial position at 1 April 2019.\n2 The 2020 results reflect average foreign exchange rates of \u20ac1:\u00a30.87, \u20ac1:INR 78.78, \u20ac1:ZAR 16.42, \u20ac1:TRY 6.52 and \u20ac1:EGP 18.18.\n3 Service revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBIT and adjusted operating profit are alternative performance measures which are non-GAAP measures that are presented to provide readers with additional financial information that is regularly reviewed by management and should not be viewed in isolation or as an alternative to the equivalent GAAP measure. For the year ended 31 March 2020, a revised definition of adjusted EBITDA has been applied. This restricts the period-on-period comparability of certain of the Group\u2019s alternative performance measures.

Europe adjusted EBITDA increased by 10.7%. On an organic basis adjusted EBITDA increased by 1.6%* as service revenue declines were offset by a \u20ac0.4 billion reduction in operating expenses. Europe adjusted EBIT grew by 26.3%, reflecting the contribution of the acquired Liberty Global assets.\n\nThe following table sets out the progression of organic service revenue growth during the year.\n\n### Total Europe: 77% of Group adjusted EBITDA\n\n| Year ended 31 March 2020 | FY20 | FY19 | Organic Change* |\n|--------------------------|------|------|-----------------|\n| Total revenue (\u20acm)       | 33,793 | 32,144 | 5.1%            |\n| Service revenue (\u20acm)     | 29,213 | 27,680 | (1.2)           |\n| Other revenue            | 4,580  | 4,464  | 2.5%            |\n| Adjusted EBITDA (\u20acm)     | 11,392 | 10,289 | 1.6%            |\n| Adjusted EBITDA margin (%) | 33.7% | 32.0%  | 1.7%            |\n| Depreciation and amortisation | (8,803) | (8,239) | 7.1%            |\n| Adjusted EBIT            | 2,589  | 2,050  | 26.3%           |\n| Share of adjusted results in associates and joint ventures | 118 | 150 | 26.3% |\n| Adjusted operating profit | 2,707  | 2,200  | 24.3%           |\n\nNote:\n1 For a full disaggregation of our financial results by geography, including intersegment eliminations, see pages 242 and 243.\n\n### Germany: 34% of Group adjusted EBITDA\n\n| Year ended 31 March 2020 | FY20 | FY19 | Organic Change* |\n|--------------------------|------|------|-----------------|\n| Total revenue (\u20acm)       | 12,076 | 10,390 | 16.2%           |\n| Service revenue (\u20acm)     | 10,696 | 9,145  | 16.0%           |\n| Other revenue            | 1,380  | 1,245  | 11.1%           |\n| Adjusted EBITDA (\u20acm)     | 5,077  | 4,079  | 25.0%           |\n| Adjusted EBITDA margin (%) | 42.0% | 39.3%  | 2.7%            |\n| Depreciation and amortisation | (3,376) | (3,009) | 12.2%           |\n| Adjusted EBIT            | 1,701  | 1,070  | 59.8%           |\n| Share of adjusted results in associates and joint ventures | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 |\n| Adjusted operating profit | 1,701  | 1,070  | 59.8%           |\n\nService revenue excluding Unitymedia was flat* (Q3: flat*, Q4: -0.1%*) as solid retail growth was offset by declining wholesale revenue and the impact of international call rate regulation. Retail revenue grew 1.1%* (Q3: 1.0%*, Q4: 0.9%*).\n\nFixed service revenue increased by 2.4%* (Q3: 2.8%*, Q4: 2.2%*) as good retail growth was partially offset by wholesale declines. DSL migrations to the Unitymedia footprint are excluded from our Q4 organic growth rate. Our commercial momentum accelerated with 381,000 net cable customer additions in the year (including Unitymedia from August 2019), supported by 110,000 migrations from DSL and the success of our \u201cGigaCable Max\u201d campaign following the rebranding of Unitymedia in February 2020; we added 216,000 broadband customers. We maintained our good momentum in convergence supported by our \u201cGigaKombi\u201d proposition, adding 259,000 Consumer converged customers in the year, which took our total Consumer converged customer base to 1.5 million. Our TV customer base declined by 245,000 (including Unitymedia from August 2019) reflecting the loss of primarily lower ARPU basic TV subscribers in the Kabel Deutschland AG (\u201cKDG\u201d) footprint and customer losses in the Unitymedia footprint.\n\nMobile service revenue declined by 1.8%* (Q3: -2.2%*, Q4: -1.9%*) driven by declines in wholesale and a drag from regulation. Retail revenue excluding regulatory impacts grew 0.7%* (Q3: 0.4%*, Q4: 0.4%*). We added 542,000 contract customers, supported in part by the success of our \u201cGigaCube\u201d proposition as well as by our continued good commercial momentum in branded channels. Contract churn improved by 0.8 percentage points year-on-year in Q4 to 12.3%, driven by improved loyalty in our branded consumer base and Business.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by 2.5%* and the organic adjusted EBITDA margin was 0.8%* percentage points higher, driven by our focus on more profitable direct channels and effective cost management. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 42%.\nOur financial performance (continued)\n\n### Italy: 14% of Group adjusted EBITDA\n\n|                      | FY20 \u20acm | FY19 \u20acm | Organic Change* % |\n|----------------------|---------|---------|-------------------|\n| Total revenue        | 5,529   | 5,857   |                   |\n| Service revenue      | 4,833   | 5,030   | (3.9)             |\n| Other revenue        | 696     | 827     |                   |\n| **Adjusted EBITDA**  | 2,068   | 2,202   | (6.6)             |\n| Adjusted EBITDA margin | 37.4%  | 37.6%   |                   |\n| Depreciation and amortisation | (1,255) | (1,268) |                   |\n| **Adjusted EBIT**    | 813     | 934     |                   |\n| Share of adjusted results in associates and joint ventures | \u2014 | \u2014 | |\n| **Adjusted operating profit** | 813 | 934 | |\n\nService revenue declined by 3.9%* (Q3: -5.0%, Q4: -3.7%) with good growth in fixed offset by declines in mobile. Mobile service revenue declined by 7.4%* (Q3: -7.7%, Q4: -8.0%).\n\nMarket mobile number portability (MNP) volumes were down 23% year-on-year in FY20 and were down 17% quarter-on-quarter in Q4. MNP further improved in March, reducing by 37% month-on-month, as COVID-19 impacted commercial activity market wide. Our customer outflows also moderated during the year. However, competition in the low-value segment of the pre-paid market remained intense, and our second brand \u201cho\u201d. continued to grow strongly, reaching 1.8 million active customers at the end of the year.\n\nFixed service revenue increased by 8.2%* (Q3: 4.2%, Q4: 10.4%) and we added 121,000 broadband customers in the year. Our total Consumer converged customer base is now 1.0 million (representing 36% of our broadband base), an increase of 92,000 in the year. Through our owned NGN footprint and strategic partnership with Open Fiber we now pass 7.5 million households. The sequential Q4 improvement in service revenue primarily reflected higher project revenues in Business.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA declined by 6.6%* including a 2.7 percentage point negative impact from a one-off regulatory provision, and the adjusted EBITDA margin declined by 0.4%* percentage points. Service revenue declines were partially offset by tight control of operating expenses, which fell by 7.6%* year-on-year, together with significantly lower commercial costs. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 37.4%.\n\n### UK: 10% of Group adjusted EBITDA\n\n|                      | FY20 \u20acm | FY19 \u20acm | Organic Change* % |\n|----------------------|---------|---------|-------------------|\n| Total revenue        | 6,484   | 6,272   |                   |\n| Service revenue      | 5,020   | 4,952   | 0.5               |\n| Other revenue        | 1,464   | 1,320   |                   |\n| **Adjusted EBITDA**  | 1,500   | 1,364   | 10.5              |\n| Adjusted EBITDA margin | 23.1%  | 21.7%   |                   |\n| Depreciation and amortisation | (1,632) | (1,638) |                   |\n| **Adjusted EBIT**    | (132)   | (274)   |                   |\n| Share of adjusted results in associates and joint ventures | \u2014 | \u2014 | |\n| **Adjusted operating profit** | (132) | (274) | |\n\nService revenue increased 0.5%* (Q3: 0.6%, Q4: 1.2%). Good fixed and mobile customer base growth was partially offset by lower wholesale revenue and a 0.4 percentage point drag from international call rate regulation.\n\nMobile service revenue was flat* (Q3: 0.6%, Q4: 0.3%), but grew when excluding the impact of international call rate regulation, with a higher customer base and RPI-linked price increases being offset by lower out-of-bundle revenue as a result of spend capping. We added 348,000 contract customers in the year, compared to 264,000 last year, supported by our new range of commercial plans, including speed-tiered \u201cVodafone Unlimited\u201d mobile data propositions and our 5G launch in July. Contract churn was stable year-on-year at 14.2% in Q4, despite the impact of text-to-switch regulation. We also added 475,000 prepaid customers, supported by our digital sub-brand \u201cVOXI\u201d.\n\nFixed service revenue increased by 1.7%* (Q3: 0.5%, Q4: 3.7%). Continued good customer growth in Consumer broadband, supported by the launch of our \u201cVodafone Together\u201d convergent plans, and growth in Business was partially offset by lower wholesale revenues. We added 176,000 broadband customers in the year including 64,000 in Q4. The sequential Q4 improvement primarily reflected a stabilisation in wholesale revenue.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by 10.5%* and the adjusted EBITDA margin was 1.6%* percentage points higher. This improvement was driven by service revenue growth, a 9.9% reduction in operating expenses and a 2.0 percentage point net benefit to growth from one-off license fee settlements and a reallocation of costs from capex to cost of sales following our new cloud partnership with IBM. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 23.1%.\nService revenue declined by 6.7%* (Q3: -6.5%*, Q4: -2.7%*), reflecting a shift in overall market demand towards the value segment and our decision not to renew unprofitable football distribution rights. The improvement in quarterly trends reflected the benefit of a December price increase for legacy customers, the stabilisation of our customer base in recent quarters and customer migrations to speed-tiered unlimited plans.\n\nOur commercial performance stabilised during the year, supported in part by the good performance of our \u201cLowi\u201d second brand. We returned to positive customer growth in mobile contract, broadband and TV in Q3 for the first time since Q3 FY18 and maintained our commercial momentum in Q4, adding 51,000 mobile contract customers and keeping our broadband customer base stable. We added 41,000 TV customers in Q4, supported by our new movies and series offers and despite our decision last year not to renew football content rights.\n\nThe overall pricing environment remains highly competitive, but we continue to see good uptake of our new speed-tiered unlimited plans with 2.4 million customers at the end of Q4. On average, the ARPU of unlimited customers is higher post migrating to the new plans.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA declined by 1.7%* and the organic adjusted EBITDA margin was 1.5%* percentage points higher. This was principally driven by the reduction in ARPU and a lower customer base, partially offset by lower football content costs and a 3.8%* reduction in operating expenses. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 23.5%. Adjusted EBITDA returned to growth in H2, up 8.2%* year-on-year, supported by lower content and commercial costs.\n\nGiven the challenging current trading and economic conditions, management has reassessed the expected future business performance in Spain. Following this reassessment, projected cash flows are lower and this has led to an impairment charge of \u20ac0.8 billion for the year ended 31 March 2020.\nOur financial performance (continued)\n\nVodacom: 14% of Group adjusted EBITDA\n\n| FY20 | FY19 | Organic Change* |\n|------|------|-----------------|\n| \u20acm   | \u20acm   | %               |\n| Total revenue | 5,531 | 5,443 | 3.3 |\n| Service revenue | 4,470 | 4,391 | 3.3 |\n| Other revenue | 1,061 | 1,052 | 0.9 |\n| Adjusted EBITDA | 2,088 | 2,157 | 1.1 |\n| Adjusted EBITDA margin | 37.8% | 39.6% | -1.8% |\n| Depreciation and amortisation | (767) | (735) | 4.3% |\n| Adjusted EBIT | 1,321 | 1,422 | -7.0% |\n\nVodacom Group service revenue grew 3.3%* (Q3: 5.2%*, Q4: 3.2%*) with trends in South Africa stabilising, despite regulatory and macro pressures, and continued strong growth in Vodacom\u2019s International operations.\n\nIn South Africa, service revenue increased 2.2%* (Q3: 4.6%*, Q4: 3.7%*) or 2.8%* excluding a one-off benefit in the prior year. This growth was achieved amid a weak macroeconomic environment, in which customers are optimising their spend, and despite new regulation introduced in March 2019 affecting out-of-bundle charges, rollover and the transfer of data. Despite these headwinds, data traffic grew 66% year-on-year as customers benefited from improved pricing, which, combined with the full transition of a new wholesale roaming agreement onto our network, supported an acceleration in service revenue growth during the year. We added 246,000 contract customers in the year, but lost 1.9 million prepaid customers as we focused on customer lifetime value, taking our total mobile customer base to 45.1 million.\n\nIn March 2020, we reached an agreement with the Competition Commission in relation to the Data Services Market Inquiry and on 1 April reduced monthly data bundle prices by up to 40%. This further accelerated our pro-active efforts to transform data pricing which already delivered a 50% reduction in out-of-bundle rates in March 2019 as well as reductions in a number of data bundle prices throughout the year.\n\nVodacom\u2019s international operations outside of South Africa grew by 7.5%* (Q3: 7.4%*, Q4: 4.4%*). Growth was strong across all of our markets, supported by the growing demand for mobile data and M-Pesa services. The sequential slowdown in Q4 primarily reflected new customer registration requirements in Tanzania. We have been required to bar services to 2.9 million customers since January 2020, out of a total customer base of 15.5 million, in line with a government biometric registration deadline. As of 31 March 2020, an additional 2.5 million customer SIMs remain unregistered as the Tanzanian authorities delayed any further service barring in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect to recover a substantial proportion of these customers over the coming quarters.\n\nVodacom\u2019s adjusted EBITDA increased by 1.1%* and the organic adjusted EBITDA margin was 0.8% percentage points lower reflecting subdued revenue growth in South Africa and the impact of higher roaming costs. Operating costs also increased, but grew more slowly than revenue.\n\nOther: 9% of Group adjusted EBITDA\n\nTurkey\n\nService revenues increased by 17.6%* (Q3: 17.3%*, Q4: 16.0%*) supported by strong customer contract ARPU growth, increased mobile data revenue, and fixed line customer base growth. Adjusted EBITDA grew 27%* and the organic adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 4.1%* percentage points driven by strong revenue growth ahead of inflation and lower commercial costs. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.5%.\n\nEgypt\n\nEgypt service revenue grew 14.5%* (Q3: 13.9%*, Q4: 14.8%*), supported by strong customer base growth and increased data usage. Adjusted EBITDA grew 14.2%* and the organic adjusted EBITDA margin decreased by 0.3%* percentage points driven by revenue growth ahead of inflation. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 45.9%.\n\nOn 29 January 2020, we announced a Memorandum of Understanding (\u2018MoU\u2019) with Saudi Telecom Company (\u2018stc\u2019) in relation to the sale of Vodafone\u2019s 55% shareholding in Vodafone Egypt to stc for a cash consideration of US$2.392 million (\u20ac2.180 million), implying a September FY20 LTM multiple of 70x Adjusted EBITDA and 11.2x Adjusted OpFCF. On 13 April 2020, the MoU with stc was extended by 90 days to allow additional time for the completion of due diligence on Vodafone Egypt by stc. We intend to enter into a definitive agreement following the completion of the due diligence process.\n\nOther associates and joint ventures\n\nVodafone Idea Limited (India)\n\nIn October 2019, the Indian Supreme Court gave its judgement in the \u201cUnion of India v Association of Unified Telecom Service Providers of India\u201d case regarding the interpretation of adjusted gross revenue (\u2018AGR\u2019), a concept used in the calculation of certain regulatory fees.\n\nAs the Group has no obligation to fund Vodafone Idea Limited (\u2018Vodafone Idea\u2019) losses, the Group has recognised its share of estimated Vodafone Idea losses arising from both its operating activities and those in relation to the AGR judgement to an amount that is limited to the remaining carrying value of Vodafone Idea, which is therefore reduced to nil. If the carrying value had been high enough not to restrict the Group\u2019s share of losses, then the recognised share of losses would have been substantially higher.\n\nThe Group has a potential exposure to certain contingent liabilities and potential refunds relating to Vodafone India and Idea Cellular at the time of the merger, including those relating to the AGR judgement, whereby Vodafone Group and Vodafone Idea would reimburse each other on set dates following any crystallisation of these pre-merger liabilities and assets. Under the terms of this arrangement, Vodafone Group is obliged to make payments to Vodafone Idea where amounts paid pursuant to the contingent liabilities of Vodafone India exceed those of Idea Cellular. The Group\u2019s potential exposure under this mechanism is capped at INR 84 billion (\u20ac1.0 billion) and any cash payments or cash receipts relating to these contingent liabilities and potential refunds must have been made or received by Vodafone Idea before any amount becomes due from or owed to the Group. Having considered the payments made and refunds received by Vodafone Idea in relation to these matters, including those relating to the AGR case, and the significant uncertainties in relation to VIL\u2019s ability to settle all liabilities relating to the AGR judgement, the Group has assessed a cash outflow of \u20ac235 million under the agreement to be probable at this time and provided for this amount at 31 March 2020. On 22 April 2020, the Group announced that it had made an advance payment of US$200 million to Vodafone Idea for amounts that are likely to be due in September 2020 under the terms of this mechanism.\n\nSee notes 12 and 29 in the consolidated financial statements for further details.\nIndus Towers (India)\nWe have extended the long stop date on our agreement to merge Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel to 24 June 2020, subject to an agreement on closing adjustments and other conditions precedent for closing, with each party retaining the right to terminate and withdraw the merger scheme on or prior to 24 June 2020.\n\nIndus Towers did not declare, or pay, a dividend during the FY20 financial year.\n\nVodafone Hutchison Australia\nIn February 2020, the Federal Court of Australia approved the proposed merger of Vodafone Hutchison Australia (VHA) and TPG Telecom Limited (TPG), ruling that it would not substantially lessen competition. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) subsequently announced it would not appeal the Court decision. The combination is subject to the approval of TPG shareholders, and completion is expected in the first half of FY21.\n\nSafaricom\nSafaricom service revenue grew by 4.8% (Q3: 5.3%, Q4: 3.2%) supported by growth in M-Pesa and in mobile and fixed data. Adjusted EBITDA grew 7.4% supported by strong revenue growth and cost discipline. During the financial year we received dividends of \u20ac269 million from Safaricom.\n\nNet financing costs\n\n| FY20 \u20acm | FY19 \u20acm | Change % |\n|---------|---------|----------|\n| Adjusted net financing costs1 | (1,638) | (1,042) | (57.2) |\n| Adjustments for: | | | |\n| Mark to market losses | (1,128) | (423) | |\n| Foreign exchange losses2 | (205) | (190) | |\n| Interest on lease liabilities | (330) | \u2013 | |\n| Net financing costs | (3,301) | (1,655) | (99.5) |\n\nNotes:\n1 Adjusted net financing costs is an alternative performance measure. Alternative performance measures are non-GAAP measures that are presented to provide readers with additional financial information that is regularly reviewed by management and should not be viewed in isolation or as an alternative to the equivalent GAAP measure. See \u201cAlternative performance measures\u201d on page 239 for further details.\n2 Primarily comprises foreign exchange differences reflected in the Income Statement in relation to sterling and US dollar balances.\n\nNet financing costs increased by \u20ac1.6 billion, primarily due to the recognition of mark to market losses. These were driven by the lower share price, causing a mark to market loss on the options relating to the mandatory convertible bonds and lower long-term yields, which led to mark to market losses on certain economic hedging instruments. Adjusted net financing costs include increased interest costs as part of the financing for the Liberty Global transaction as well as adverse interest rate movements on borrowings in foreign operations. Excluding these, underlying financing costs remained stable, reflecting consistent average net debt balances and weighted average borrowing costs for both periods.\n\nTaxation\n\n| FY20 \u20acm | FY19 \u20acm | Change % |\n|---------|---------|----------|\n| Income tax expense: | | |\n| Tax on adjustments to derive adjusted profit before tax | (1,250) | (1,496) | 16.4 |\n| Adjustments2: | | |\n| Deferred tax following revaluation of investments in Luxembourg | (346) | (488) | |\n| Reduction in deferred tax following rate change in Luxembourg | 881 | \u2013 | |\n| Deferred tax on use of Luxembourg losses in the year | 348 | 320 | |\n| Derecognition of a deferred tax asset in Spain | \u2013 | 1,166 | |\n| Adjusted income tax expense for calculating adjusted tax rate | (799) | (751) | (6.4) |\n| Profit/(loss) before tax | 795 | (2,613) | 130.4 |\n| Adjustments to derive adjusted profit before tax2 | 2,122 | 5,476 | |\n| Adjusted profit before tax3 | 2,917 | 2,863 | 1.9 |\n| Share of adjusted results in associates and joint ventures | 241 | 348 | |\n| Adjusted profit before tax for calculating adjusted effective tax rate | 3,158 | 3,211 | (1.7) |\n| Adjusted effective tax rate3 | 25.3% | 23.4% | (190.0)bps |\n\nNotes:\n1 The 2019 adjusted earnings per share has been aligned to the FY20 presentation which excludes mark to market and foreign exchange gains/losses. The net impact of this change reduces the effective tax rate by 1.0% to 23.4%.\n2 See \u201cEarnings per share\u201d.\n3 Adjusted profit before tax and adjusted effective tax are alternative performance measures. Alternative performance measures are non-GAAP measures that are presented to provide readers with additional financial information that is regularly reviewed by management and should not be viewed in isolation or as an alternative to the equivalent GAAP measure. See \u201cAlternative performance measures\u201d on page 239 for further details.\n\nThe Group\u2019s adjusted effective tax rate for the year ended 31 March 2020 was 25.3%. The rate increased as a result of the completion of the acquisition of Liberty Global assets, as well as the effects of writing off our deferred tax asset in Spain in the prior period. The Group\u2019s adjusted effective tax rate for both years does not include the following items: a reduction in our deferred tax assets in Luxembourg of \u20ac881 million following a reduction in the Luxembourg corporate tax rate, \u20ac348 million relating to Luxembourg losses (2019: \u20ac320 million) and \u20ac346 million (2019: \u20ac488 million) arising from a revaluation of investments based upon the local GAAP financial statements and tax returns. These items change the total losses we have available for future use against our profits in Luxembourg and neither item affects the amount of tax we pay in other countries. The Group\u2019s adjusted effective tax rate for the year ended 31 March 2019 does not include the derecognition of a deferred tax asset in Spain of \u20ac1,166 million.\n## Earnings per share\n\n|                        | FY20  | FY19  | Change |\n|------------------------|-------|-------|--------|\n| Adjusted operating profit | \u20ac4,555 | \u20ac3,905 | 16.6%  |\n| Adjusted net financing costs | (\u20ac1,638) | (\u20ac1,042) |        |\n| Adjusted income tax expense for calculating adjusted tax rate | (\u20ac799) | (\u20ac751) |        |\n| Adjusted non-controlling interests | (\u20ac471) | (\u20ac381) |        |\n| **Adjusted profit attributable to owners of the parent** | \u20ac1,647 | \u20ac1,731 | (4.9)% |\n\n**Adjustments:**\n\n- Impairment loss: (\u20ac1,685) (\u20ac3,525)\n- Amortisation of acquired customer base and brand intangible assets: (\u20ac638) (\u20ac583)\n- Restructuring costs: (\u20ac720) (\u20ac486)\n- Adjusted other income and expense: \u20ac2,257 (\u20ac262)\n- Non-operating income and expense: (\u20ac3) (\u20ac7)\n- Mark to market gains/(losses): (\u20ac1,128) (\u20ac423)\n- Foreign exchange losses: (\u20ac205) (\u20ac190)\n\n**Total Adjustments:** (\u20ac2,122) (\u20ac5,476) 61.2%\n\n**Taxation:**\n\n- India: (\u20ac451) (\u20ac745)\n- Non-controlling interests: 6 5\n\n**Loss attributable to owners of the parent:**\n\n|                        | Million | Million |\n|------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Weighted average number of shares outstanding \u2013 basic | 29,422 | 27,607 |\n\n**Basic loss per share:**\n\n|                        | eurocents | eurocents |\n|------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Basic loss per share   | (3.13)c   | (29.05)c  |\n| Adjusted earnings per share | 5.60c     | 6.27c     |\n\n**Notes:**\n\n1. Adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit attributable to owners of the parent and adjusted earnings per share are alternative performance measures. Alternative performance measures are non-GAAP measures that are presented to provide readers with additional financial information that is regularly reviewed by management and should not be viewed in isolation or as an alternative to the equivalent GAAP measures. See \u201cAlternative performance measures\u201d on page 239 for further details.\n\n2. The 2019 adjusted earnings per share has been aligned to the 2020 presentation which excludes mark to market and foreign exchange losses. The net impact of this decreased the adjusted loss attributable to the owners of the parent by \u20ac315 million and increased adjusted earnings per share by 1.01 eurocents.\n\n3. See \u201cTaxation\u201d, on page 35\n\n4. Primarily relates to the loss on disposal of Vodafone India and also includes the operating results, financing, tax and other gains and losses of Vodafone India, prior to becoming a joint venture, recognised in the prior year.\n\n5. Weighted average number of shares outstanding includes a weighted impact of 2,629 million shares (2019: 836 million shares) following the issue in March 2019 of \u20ac1.72 billion mandatory convertible bonds with a 2 year maturity date in 2021 and \u20ac1.72 billion with a 5 year maturity date in 2022 and \u20ac1.4 billion of mandatory convertible bonds issued in February 2016, which matured in February 2019.\n\nAdjusted earnings per share, which excludes impairment losses, was 5.60 eurocents compared to 6.27 eurocents for the year ended 31 March 2019, a decrease of 10.7%.\n\nBasic loss per share was 3.13 eurocents, compared to a loss per share of 29.05 eurocents for the year ended 31 March 2019. The decrease in the loss per share is primarily due to lower impairment charges in the year of \u20ac1.7 billion (2019: \u20ac3.5 billion), gains associated with the disposals of Vodafone New Zealand (\u20ac1.1 billion) and Italian tower assets (\u20ac3.4 billion), together with a \u20ac3.4 billion loss on the disposal of Vodafone India recognised in FY19.\nConsolidated statement of financial position\n\nThe consolidated statement of financial position is set out on page 135. Details on the major movements of both our assets and liabilities in the year are set out below.\n\nAssets\n\nGoodwill and other intangible assets\n\nGoodwill and other intangible assets increased by \u20ac12.5 billion to \u20ac53.5 billion. The increase primarily arose from \u20ac11.5 billion of goodwill arising on the acquisition of the European Liberty Global assets and \u20ac5.8 billion of identifiable intangible assets acquired. This was offset by \u20ac1.7 billion of impairment charges recorded in respect of the Group\u2019s investments in Spain, Ireland, Romania and Vodafone Automotive, \u20ac1.7 billion reduction following the disposal of subsidiaries and \u20ac4.5 billion of amortisation.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment increased by \u20ac11.8 billion to \u20ac39.2 billion, primarily due to the implementation of IFRS 16 \u201cLeases\u201d from 1 April 2019 whereby a \u201cright of use\u201d asset is recognised for the leased item and a lease liability is recognised for lease payments due. The impact of the adoption was to increase property, plant and equipment by \u20ac10.2 billion at 1 April 2019. An overview of the new accounting requirements and the impact on the Group is provided in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2020.\n\nOther non-current assets\n\nOther non-current assets increased by \u20ac6.4 billion to \u20ac41.2 billion, primarily due to a \u20ac5.0 billion increase in derivative financial instruments that are included within Trade and other receivables and a \u20ac1.9 billion increase in the investment in associates and joint ventures, primarily due to the formation of the Infrastructure Wireless Italiane S.p.A. (\u201cINWIT\u201d) joint venture (see note 27 to the consolidated financial statements). This was offset by a \u20ac1.1 billion reduction in deferred tax assets.\n\nCurrent assets\n\nCurrent assets decreased by \u20ac7.2 billion to \u20ac32.6 billion, primarily due to a \u20ac5.9 billion reduction in other investments. See note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2020.\n\nAssets and liabilities held for sale\n\nAssets and liabilities held for sale at 31 March 2020 of \u20ac0.6 billion relate to the Group\u2019s interests in Vodafone Hutchison Australia and Vodafone Egypt. Assets and liabilities held for sale at 31 March 2019 relate to the operations of Indus Towers and Vodafone Hutchison Australia.\n\nTotal equity and liabilities\n\nTotal equity\n\nTotal equity decreased by \u20ac0.8 billion to \u20ac62.6 billion, largely due to \u20ac2.7 billion of dividends paid to equity shareholders.\n\nNon-current liabilities\n\nNon-current liabilities increased by \u20ac18.1 billion to \u20ac72.0 billion, primarily due to a \u20ac14.2 billion increase in long-term borrowings (see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements), an increase of \u20ac2.3 billion in trade and other payables (see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements) and an increase of \u20ac1.6 billion in deferred tax liabilities (see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\nCurrent liabilities\n\nCurrent liabilities increased by \u20ac6.9 billion to \u20ac32.5 billion, primarily due to an increase of \u20ac7.6 billion in short-term borrowings (see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements), offset by a decrease of \u20ac0.6 billion in Trade and other payables.\n\nCash Flow, Funding & Capital Allocation\n\nCash flow\n\n| FY20 | FY19 | Change |\n|------|------|--------|\n| Adjusted EBITDA | 14,881 | 13,918 | 6.9 |\n| Capital additions | (7,411) | (7,227) | |\n| Working capital | (127) | 188 | |\n| Disposal of property, plant and equipment | 41 | 45 | |\n| Other | 337 | 147 | |\n| Operating free cash flow | 7,721 | 7,071 | 9.2 |\n| Taxation | (930) | (1,040) | |\n| Dividends received from associates and investments | 417 | 498 | |\n| Dividends paid to non-controlling shareholders in subsidiaries | (348) | (584) | |\n| Interest received and paid | (1,160) | (502) | |\n| Free cash flow (pre-spectrum) | 5,700 | 5,443 | 4.7 |\n| Licence and spectrum payments | (181) | (837) | |\n| Restructuring payments | (570) | (195) | |\n| Free cash flow | 4,949 | 4,411 | 12.2 |\n| Acquisitions and disposals | (14,454) | 182 | |\n| Equity dividends paid | (2,296) | (4,064) | |\n| Share buybacks | (1,094) | (606) | |\n| Convertible issue | \u2014 | 3,848 | |\n| Foreign exchange | 309 | 259 | |\n| Other | 1,250 | (1,432) | |\n| Net debt increase | (11,336) | 2,598 | (536.3) |\n| Opening net debt | (27,033) | (29,631) | |\n| Closing net debt | (38,369) | (27,033) | (41.9) |\n| Less mark to market gains in hedging reserves | (3,799) | |\n| Net debt adjusted for mark to market gains in hedging reserves | (42,168) | (27,033) | (56.0) |\n\nNotes:\n\n1. Adjusted EBITDA, operating free cash flow, free cash flow (pre-spectrum) and free cash flow are alternative performance measures which are non-GAAP measures that are presented to provide readers with additional financial information that is regularly reviewed by management and should not be viewed in isolation or as an alternative to the equivalent GAAP measures. See \u201cAlternative performance measures\u201d on page 239 for more information.\n\n2. Capital additions includes the purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, other than licence and spectrum.\n\n3. Interest paid and received excludes \u20ac305 million (31 March 2019: \u20acnil) of interest on lease liabilities, included within adjusted EBITDA, \u20ac175 million (31 March 2019: \u20ac41 million) of interest costs related to Liberty acquisition financing, included within Other, and \u20ac273 million (31 March 2019: \u20ac131 million) of cash outflow from the option structure relating to the issue of the mandatory convertible bond in February 2016, included within Share buybacks. The option structure was intended to ensure that the total cash outflow to execute the programme was broadly equivalent to the \u20ac1.44 billion raised on issuing the second tranche.\n\n4. Mandatory convertible bonds of \u20ac3.44 billion issued in March 2019.\n\n5. \u201cOther\u201d for the year ended 31 March 2020 primarily includes \u20ac3,799 million in relation to derivative gains in cash flow hedging reserves, offset by \u20ac1,510 million of debt in relation to licences and spectrum in Germany. \u201cOther\u201d for the year ended 31 March 2019 included \u20ac1,934 million of debt in relation to licences and spectrum in Italy and Spain and a \u20ac1,377 million capital injection into Vodafone Idea, offset by \u20ac2,335 million received from the repayment of US$2.5 billion of loan notes issued by Verizon Communications Inc.\n\n6. FY20 has been adjusted to exclude derivative gains in cash flow hedging reserves, the corresponding losses for which are not recognised on the bonds within net debt and which are significantly increased due to COVID-19 related market conditions.\n\nOperating free cash flow increased by \u20ac0.7 billion, primarily due to the contribution from the Liberty Global assets acquired during the year. Working capital movements include \u20ac0.3 billion in relation to handset purchases and the associated sale of customer receivables. Receivables are sold to mitigate the adverse working capital impact from handset sales to customers, where cash outflows are paid upfront to suppliers but inflows are received from customers over the length of the contract.\nFree cash flow (pre-spectrum) was \u20ac5.7 billion, an increase of \u20ac0.3 billion, as the increase in operating free cash flow and reduced dividend payments to minorities outweighed higher interest payments.\n\nAcquisitions and disposals include \u20ac2.0 billion received on completion of the sale of Vodafone New Zealand on 31 July 2019, together with \u20ac2.1 billion received on completion of the sale of Italian tower assets on 31 March. It also includes an amount of \u20ac10.3 billion paid on completion of the acquisition of the Liberty Global assets on 31 July 2019 and acquired net debt of \u20ac8.2 billion.\n\nClosing net debt adjusted for mark to market gains deferred in hedging reserves at 31 March 2020 was \u20ac42.2 billion (31 March 2019: \u20ac27.0 billion) and excludes the \u00a33.44 billion (31 March 2019: \u00a33.44 billion) mandatory convertible bond issued in February 2019, which will be settled in equity shares, \u20ac12.1 billion (31 March 2019: \u20acnil) of lease liabilities recognised under IFRS 16, a \u20ac1.3 billion (31 March 2019: \u20acnil) loan specifically secured against Indian assets and \u20ac0.7 billion (31 March 2019: \u20ac0.8 billion) of shareholder loans receivable from VodafoneZiggo.\n\nThe Group\u2019s gross and net debt includes certain bonds which have been designated in hedge relationships, which are carried at \u20ac1.5 billion higher (31 March 2019: \u20ac1.6 billion higher) than their euro equivalent redemption value. In addition, where bonds are issued in currencies other than euros, the Group has entered into foreign currency swaps to fix the euro cash outflows on redemption. The impact of these swaps are not reflected in gross debt and would decrease the euro equivalent redemption value of the bonds by \u20ac1.3 billion (31 March 2019: \u20ac1.0 billion).\n\n### Analysis of free cash flow\n\n| FY20 \u20acm | FY19 \u20acm | Change % |\n|---------|---------|----------|\n| Inflow from operating activities | 17,379 | 12,980 | 33.9 |\n| Net tax paid | 930 | 1,131 | |\n| Cash flow from discontinued operations | \u2013 | 71 | |\n| Cash generated by operations | 18,309 | 14,182 | 29.1 |\n| Capital additions | (7,411) | (7,227) | |\n| Working capital movement in respect of capital additions | (11) | (89) | |\n| Disposal of property, plant and equipment | 41 | 45 | |\n| Restructuring payments | 570 | 195 | |\n| Other1 | (3,777) | (35) | |\n| Operating free cash flow2 | 7,721 | 7,071 | 9.2 |\n| Taxation | (930) | (1,040) | |\n| Dividends received from associates and investments | 417 | 498 | |\n| Dividends paid to non-controlling shareholders in subsidiaries | (348) | (584) | |\n| Interest received and paid | (1,160) | (502) | |\n| Free cash flow (pre-spectrum)2 | 5,700 | 5,443 | 4.7 |\n| Licence and spectrum payments | (181) | (837) | |\n| Restructuring payments | (570) | (195) | |\n| Free cash flow2 | 4,949 | 4,411 | 12.2 |\n\nNotes:\n1.

The four pillars of our strategy are focused on ensuring that our ROCE meets or exceeds our weighted average cost of capital (WACC) over the long-term. In particular, we will meet this objective by efficiently allocating capital, improving asset utilisation and accelerating our digital transformation.\n\nWe calculate two ROCE measures: i) Pre-tax ROCE for controlled operations only and ii) Post-tax ROCE (including Associates & Joint Ventures). Both measures are based on Adjusted EBIT less amortisation of acquired customer-base and brand intangible assets. The post-tax measure also includes our share of adjusted results in equity accounted associates and joint ventures, and taxes the net operating profit by the adjusted effective tax rate to estimate an imputed tax expense.\n\nCapital employed includes all net operating assets and is calculated as the average of opening and closing balances of property, plant and equipment (including Right-of-Use assets and liabilities), intangible assets (including goodwill), operating working capital (including Held-for-Sale assets and excluding derivative balances), provisions, and under the post-tax measure, investments in associates and joint ventures. Other assets that do not directly contribute to returns are excluded: other investments, current and deferred tax balances and post-employment benefits.\n\nROCE grew 80 basis points to 6.1% on a pre-tax basis and 50 basis points to 4.0% on a post-tax basis. Our improvement in ROCE is primarily attributable to growth in adjusted EBITDA as a result of our improved service revenue performance, digital transformation and improving asset utilisation. The net improvement in ROCE is reduced because of higher depreciation and amortisation following capital investment, the recently acquired Liberty Global assets and in the post-tax measure, the higher adjusted effective tax rate in FY20.\n\nDividends\n\nThe Board is recommending total dividends per share of 9.0 eurocents for the year, the same as the prior year. This implies a final dividend of 4.5 eurocents compared to 4.16 eurocents in the prior year.\n\nThis year\u2019s report contains the Strategic Report on pages 6 to 71, which includes an analysis of our performance and position, a review of the business during the year, and outlines the principal risks and uncertainties we face. The Strategic Report was approved by the Board and signed on its behalf by the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer.\n\nNick Read\nChief Executive\n28 May 2020\n\nMargherita Della Valle\nChief Financial Officer\n28 May 2020\nSustainable business\n\nDelivering on our purpose\n\nOur sustainable business strategy helps us deliver on our purpose and ensure we act responsibly and with integrity wherever we operate.\n\nOur sustainable business strategy\n\nWe believe that Vodafone has a significant role to play in contributing to the societies in which we operate. Last year, we articulated our purpose \u2013 with the ambition to improve one billion lives and halve our environmental impact by 2025, building on a decade of initiatives, efforts and products from our business. Our sustainable business strategy helps the delivery of our 2025 targets across three pillars: Digital Society; Inclusion for All; and Planet. We aspire to enable an inclusive and sustainable digital society.\n\nIn parallel, we remain dedicated to ensuring that Vodafone operates responsibly and ethically, supported by our corporate disclosure programme. This is an area which we believe is more important than ever, given the ongoing COVID-19 crisis and the role business plays in supporting society during this period of uncertainty and change.\n\nOur purpose\n\nWe connect for a better future\n\nResponsible business practices\n\nHuman rights Responsible supply chain Anti-bribery and corruption Mobile, masts and health Tax and economic contribution\n\nOur contribution to the UN Sustainable Development Goals\n\nThis year marks the beginning of the \u201cdecade of delivery\u201d to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs provide a clear roadmap and call to action for business to contribute towards creating a better future. Vodafone is committed to playing our role through leveraging the power of our technology, networks and services to contribute.\n\nThrough the impact of our extensive global network, our wide range of products and services (such as our IoT and M-Pesa platforms) and the work of the Vodafone Foundations, we believe we can increase the speed and scale of delivery across a wide number of the SDGs.\nDigital Society\n\nWe believe in a connected digital society that helps improve people\u2019s lives, where data flows at speed, connecting people, communities and things to the internet like never before. With our next-generation networks, citizens will access an ever-growing range of services in real-time and businesses can develop new products and services to meet the needs of future generations.\n\nDigital services, like the ones we provide, are quickly becoming the new engines of growth in the global race for economic prosperity and sustainable development. For example in Africa, the UN Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development estimates that expanding broadband by 10% would yield a 2.5% increase in GDP per capita. Also, it has been estimated that 84% of all IoT applications support the UN SDGs.\n\nNotes:\n1 Defined as 4G/5G mobile networks and over 30Mbps fixed networks.\n2 UK Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), 2018.\n\nBuilding a Gigabit network\n\nGoal:\nTo connect over 250 million people to our next-generation networks by 2025\n\nWe are investing significantly in our modern network infrastructure and coverage to deliver a high-quality service that allows individuals and businesses to connect confidently anywhere and at any time.\n\nBenefits that high-speed internet (such as 5G) can have for the economy include productivity gains, such as faster download times and the ability to work in transit; increased consumer value by enabling innovative apps and services; and reduced carbon emissions, through supporting the large-scale deployment of IoT technologies across sectors.\n\nWe support our customers, both individuals and businesses, to realise these benefits.\n\nWe are future-proofing our fixed line infrastructure by upgrading our cable network to the latest DOCSIS 3.1 technology and deploying fibre deep into the network.\n\nOur fixed Gigabit networks will deliver a significant improvement in the maximum user speeds and network capacity: speeds of 30Mbps will directly improve the lives of millions of people. We are now Europe\u2019s largest fixed next-generation network provider by footprint, with 25 million broadband customers and 136 million marketable households in Europe.\n\nThis year, 144 million customers were connected to our next-generation networks.\n\nOur networks also support a wide variety of solutions to meet society\u2019s needs. We\u2019re working with businesses of all sizes to make the digital society a reality. From ensuring millions of employees across the world can work effectively from home during the COVID-19 crisis, to designing new IoT-connected products with and for our customers, we\u2019re committed to helping everyone get the best from technology.\n\nIn healthcare, for example, 5G will be a real driver of innovation, helping improve staff efficiency while also improving patient care. Through our connectivity, we can enable remote surgery, rehabilitation robotics and wearable sensors, to name just a few.\n\nGigabit Hubs generate economic growth in Ireland\n\nAccording to new data from research conducted this year, Vodafone has helped generate \u20ac27.4 million of local economic contribution in Ireland through the creation of six Gigabit Hubs in remote communities, which in turn have helped create hundreds of jobs and businesses.\n\nFifteen hubs are now benefiting from free 1 Gigabit broadband through Vodafone Ireland\u2019s Gigabit Hub initiative, transforming employment and business opportunities for residents. By applying an average of the findings to a scenario where one hub is located in each of the 26 counties in the Republic of Ireland, the study found the potential to generate \u20ac312 million of economic contribution at a national level, making a significant economic, social and financial impact across the country.\n\nNote:\n1 Vodafone\u2019s 2019 Gigabit Hub report analyses six hubs in Ireland located in Dundalk, Drogheda, Kilkenny, Carlow, Kerry and Cork.\n\nTackling loneliness with tech\n\nIn 2019, Vodafone UK launched a new report focused on how technology can be harnessed to tackle loneliness in people over 50 and also highlights that a significant number of older people are not confident using technology. At the same time, the financial implications of loneliness in the over 50s was revealed to come at a cost of \u00a31.8 billion per year to the UK economy.\n\nIn response, Vodafone UK launched a nationwide programme of tech masterclasses, helping participants set up their phones, use social media and learn more about wearable tech and connected home devices.\n\nRecommendations for both policy makers and businesses made in the report include introducing prescribing schemes so that GPs and health service practitioners are able to prescribe technology such as wearable devices and monitoring systems; developing tech toolkits to support independent living and offering financial support including funding the take-up of technology in the home.\nSupporting small businesses and entrepreneurs\n\nThrough Vodafone Business, we provide products and services which are specifically tailored for small and medium-sized (\u2018SME\u2019) and small-office home-office (\u2018SOHO\u2019) businesses, helping guide them through technology choices that are moving at an unprecedented pace and improve their digital readiness.\n\nThis support is more crucial than ever in the current climate (see case study below). Connectivity is vital for businesses around the world to thrive. For example, research commissioned by Vodafone found that 70% of micro-entrepreneurs in Ghana would face difficulties continuing their business without a smartphone. Constant connectivity allows entrepreneurs to connect with customers, search for new business ideas and adapt to changing market conditions.\n\nSmart transport solutions\n\nGoal: To connect over 150 million vehicles to the IoT by 2025\n\nOur electronics and telematics products create more efficient, safer and smarter transport for people, communities and businesses. Benefits include:\n\n- **Transport fleet and logistics** \u2013 improved vehicle management and monitoring for businesses including support and diagnostics, as well as driving style monitoring which improves efficiency and reduces carbon emissions.\n- **Automotive** \u2013 stolen vehicle recovery, crash alerts, automated breakdown calls and mobile apps for smarter transport.\n- **Insurance** \u2013 in-car telematics to monitor driver behaviour, usage-based insurance for more accurate insurance premiums, crash reconstruction/alerts and automated emergency calling.\n\nThis year we grew the number of connected vehicles we serve from 25 million to 31 million.\n\nCreating smarter cities\n\nOur IoT platform and technology are also supporting cities to become smarter to adapt to the demands of urban growth, as well as improve the lives of the citizens within them. With 55% of the world\u2019s population living in cities, digitisation can play a key role in tackling many of our cities\u2019 most pressing challenges, from air quality, public transport and energy efficiency, to waste management and improved building standards.\n\nThe IoT-enabled smart city can reroute traffic around congestion in real-time, automatically schedule repairs for failed infrastructure like street lighting or bridges, and intelligently manage energy use and pollution right across the built environment. It can protect citizens and businesses from crime more effectively, and safeguard vulnerable citizens in their homes.\n\nVodafone Spain will be the provider of the \u201cSevilla Smart City Platform\u201d, which will enable the municipality to more efficiently monitor and manage services and facilities such as waste management, street lighting and air quality.\n\nSupporting our business customers during the COVID-19 crisis\n\nWe are committed to helping our business and public sector customers mitigate the economic impacts of the health crisis. In many cases, this has involved helping customers to digitalise their own companies at a rapid pace. We estimate that we have enabled as many as 2.5 million people to work from home for the first time.\n\nIn the UK, to support homeworkers, we created a new flexible \u201cVodafone Emergency Homeworker\u201d plan for our existing mobile customers. This gives employees who may not have a company mobile access to unlimited voice, text and data for a reduced fixed amount for three months. We are also offering larger business customers additional mobile data packages to meet the needs of employees working from home.\n\nIn Africa, Vodacom has specifically focused on supporting SMEs during the pandemic. For example, in South Africa, Vodacom has extended loans to SMEs to assist them with cash flow challenges. A number of our markets in the region have also introduced additional data allocations and work-from-home packages for enterprise customers.\nImproving lives through M-Pesa\n\nWith M-Pesa, customers can take greater control over their own and their family\u2019s finances. This is particularly the case for women. For example, in Kenya, research estimated that with mobile money access through M-Pesa, 185,000 women have been able to switch from subsistence farming to business or sales as their primary occupation. In addition, the research also found that M-Pesa has helped lift 194,000 households, or 2% of Kenyan households, out of poverty. We estimate that 17 million women were actively using M-Pesa this year, accounting for 41% of our M-Pesa customer base.\n\nIn addition, M-Pesa is widely used to manage business transactions and to pay salaries, pensions, agricultural subsidies and government grants.\n\nIn Kenya, Safaricom\u2019s M-TIBA service allows anyone to send, save and spend funds specifically for medical treatment using their mobile phone. This is helping streamline the management of large-scale health financing schemes from insurers, the government and donors and is helping to make healthcare more accessible. There are now more than four million users of M-TIBA.\n\nNote:\n1 \u201cThe long-run poverty and gender impacts of mobile money\u201d, Suri and Jack, Science, 2016.\n3 World Bank, 2017.\nInclusion for All\n\nWe believe that the opportunities and promise of a better digital future should be accessible to all.\n\nAs digitisation dramatically increases the rate of change and pace of innovation, unless it is inclusive, it can widen existing divisions in our societies. Our goal therefore is also to democratise digitisation, making sure everyone can benefit from technology. Similarly, we need to focus on the human aspects of digital connectivity and content and how they impact our lives.\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis, especially its economic ramifications, may worsen the inequalities that exist in society. Women and young people are disproportionately affected, economically and socially. Low-wage workers, small enterprises, the informal sector and vulnerable groups, in part due to more limited access and ability to use digital solutions, are at greater risk of negative socio-economic impacts of the crisis, showing that digital inclusion and literacy are even more important.\n\nWe aim to contribute to building an inclusive digital society where no one is left behind, across all ages and socio-economic groups, from those in rural settings to our growing cities making technology relevant and accessible to everyone.\n\nGender equality and connecting women\n\nBy empowering women and promoting gender equality, we can enable communities, economies and businesses\u2014including our own\u2014to prosper.\n\nGoal:\nTo connect an additional 20 million women living in Africa and Turkey to mobile by 2025\n\nTo reflect recent changes in Vodafone\u2019s direct geographic footprint, this year we amended our previous goal to connect women in emerging markets, to be focused on Africa and Turkey.\n\nResearch from GSMA shows that Sub-Saharan Africa has one of the widest mobile gender gaps of any region, as women are 13% less likely to own a mobile phone than men. In addition, it is estimated that there is a 37% gender gap in mobile internet use.\n\nOwning even the most basic mobile enables a woman to communicate, access information, learn, manage her (family\u2019s) finances, set up and run a business and even get help if feeling threatened.\n\nNotes:\n4 Excluding Egypt.\n5 GSMA, 2020.\n\nProgress towards our 20 million women goal\n\n| Estimated number of female customers in Africa and Turkey (millions) |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| FY16            | FY17            | FY18            | FY19            | FY20            |\n| 36.8            | 40.0            | 41.6            | 46.3            | 46.2            |\n\nIncreasing access to health advice in South Africa\n\nIn South Africa, Vodacom\u2019s Mum & Baby service is a free-to-use (no data charges) mobile health service which gives customers maternal, neonatal and child health information. The information is shared through weekly stage-based SMS messages. Additional health-related content, such as articles, videos and tutorials, is available through a mobile-optimised website. The service has helped over 1.8 million parents and caregivers to take positive actions to improve their children\u2019s health since its launch in 2017.\n\nAn independent study to assess the socio-economic contribution of the service found that 95% of the mothers and pregnant women surveyed said that the information received influenced their decision to breastfeed. In addition, 96% agreed that the information received helped with their decision to vaccinate their child. If this were representative of all Mum & Baby subscribers, it would suggest that the service may have influenced the vaccination decisions for the children of approximately 650,000 individuals in South Africa.\n\nRead more at vodafone.com/mumandbaby\n\nTackling domestic violence and abuse\n\nSafety is one of the biggest social barriers to women fulfilling their potential. In March 2019 the Vodafone Foundation announced the international expansion of Bright Sky, a free app developed with Hestia, Aspirant, and Thames Valley Partnership that provides support and information to anyone who may be in an abusive relationship, or concerned about someone they know.\n\nSince Bright Sky was created, the app has been downloaded over 41,000 times in the UK. Working with Thames Valley Partnership, Vodafone Foundation has also launched the service in Ireland and the Czech Republic. By March 2021, our ambition is for Bright Sky to be live in 12 countries. In the wake of COVID-19, the app has seen a 75% increase in downloads, and has been credited by UN Women as a key tool in supporting survivors during this period of limited mobility.\n\nThe roll-out builds on over ten years of \u201cApps Against Abuse\u201d by Vodafone Foundation that connect over one million people affected by domestic abuse to help and advice.\n\nNote: 1 UN Women, COVID-19 and Ending Violence Against Women and Girls, 2020.\nMobile technology also enhances many public and commercial services, from accessing vaccinations and maternal healthcare, to mobile banking and online support for smallholder farmers.\n\nWe are using our mobile technologies to enhance the quality of women\u2019s lives through commercial programmes that:\n\n- Support education, skills and jobs;\n- Improve health, wellbeing and safety; and\n- Enable economic empowerment.\n\nWe also have specific initiatives to support female entrepreneurs, including Business Women Connect in Tanzania and Mozambique and Vodafone Turkey Foundation\u2019s Women First in Entrepreneurship programme.\n\nWe have made progress towards our goal and have an estimated 46.2 million active female entrepreneurs, including Business Women Connect in Tanzania and Mozambique and Vodafone Turkey Foundation\u2019s Women First in Entrepreneurship programme.\n\nWe have made progress towards our goal and have an estimated 46.2 million active female entrepreneurs, including Business Women Connect in Tanzania and Mozambique and Vodafone Turkey Foundation\u2019s Women First in Entrepreneurship programme.\n\nYouth skills and jobs\n\nGoals:\n\nSupport ten million young people to access digital skills, learning and employment opportunities by 2022\n\nProvide 100,000 opportunities for young people to receive a digital learning experience at Vodafone by 2022\n\nYouth unemployment remains high in many of our operating countries: 57% in South Africa, 35% in Greece, 33% in Spain and 29% in Italy. At the same time, demand for digital skills already outstrips the supply of available talent. As a global technology business, Vodafone wants to address this.\n\nIn 2018, we launched a free smartphone and web-based service called Future Jobs Finder designed to help young people find job opportunities in the digital economy and free digital skills training.\n\nThrough the tool, psychometric tests identify individuals\u2019 aptitudes and interests, mapping these to the most appropriate digital job category, as well as job opportunities in their chosen location or within Vodafone.\n\nSupporting digital skills through Vodafone Foundation\n\nThrough our local foundations, Vodafone has launched a number of programmes that help young adults develop their skills, including digital ones, and support the development of young entrepreneurs.\n\n\u201cCoding For Tomorrow\u201d in Germany, supported by Germany\u2019s State Minister for Digitisation, has helped over 85,000 children and young people since 2017 to learn coding, as well as build other skills such as creative problem solving. To support sustainable change, over 1,300 teachers from across 150 schools have received specific training to deliver the programme and content has also recently been created to be used by libraries and museums.\n\nIn South Africa, \u201c#codelikeagirl\u201d has now reached 700 girls across all nine provinces since launching in 2017, providing them with a week\u2019s course in coding, STEM and life skills training as well as information about cyberbullying, internet safety and entrepreneurship.\n\nIn Greece, the Foundation runs \u201cGeneration Next\u201d, helping students aged 12\u201318 to discover and learn more about STEM topics, while creating their own innovative projects that bring solutions to social problems. More than 78,500 students and teachers have benefited to date.\n\nBeyond digital training, the Vodafone Foundation designs and implements programmes around the world that combine Vodafone\u2019s charitable giving and technology to deliver public benefit and improve people\u2019s lives. This includes a focus on driving gender equality, and disaster response. The total amount donated to Vodafone Foundation in 2020 was over \u20ac46 million.\n\nOn completing the tests, users also receive a summary of their skills and interests that can be used on their CV or in a job application. As part of our #ChangeTheFace campaign (see below), version 2.0 of the service was launched this year and it has now helped over 539,000 people globally, matching users to the top five digital jobs that match their interests and their skills.\n\nSince April 2018, we have provided 168,899 digital learning experiences to young people at Vodafone, thereby exceeding our target. This has been through a range of initiatives including work experience, apprenticeships, intern and graduate schemes and coding programmes. Read more about our progress against our target on page 59.\n\nRecently, as part of Vodafone\u2019s commitment to support society during the COVID-19 crisis, we made a new range of online educational and training support available to customers and employees for free. This included online e-learning courses from Udemy and extended access to Perlego\u2019s online library of academic text books and publications.\n\nNote: 6 OECD, 2019.\nSustainable business (continued)\n\nPlanet\n\nWe believe that urgent and sustained action is required to address the climate emergency and that business success should not come at a cost to the environment.\n\nWe have committed to halving our environmental impact by 2025. Our focus on energy efficiency, renewable energy supply and eliminating network waste is helping us to mitigate the environmental impact of the growth of our business and our customers\u2019 increasing demand for data. In addition, one of our most important contributions is through using our technologies and services to provide our customers with the means to achieve a reduction in their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\n\nReducing carbon emissions\n\nGoals:\n\n- Reduce our GHG emissions by 50%7 by 2025\n- Purchase 100% of the electricity we use from renewable sources by 2025\n\nNotwithstanding ever-growing use of data and expansion of our networks, this year our total GHG emissions decreased by 9% to 1.84 million tonnes of CO\u2082e (carbon dioxide equivalent), predominantly due to an increase in the proportion of renewable electricity purchased. We continued to improve our overall energy efficiency during the year and achieved a 38.5% reduction in the amount of GHG emissions per petabyte (PB) of mobile data carried, to reach an average of 230 tonnes CO\u2082e per PB (2019: 374) (see charts below).\n\nDuring the year 25.9% of our electricity was from renewable sources (2019: 15.6%). This year we launched sourcing activities for Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) contracts, notably in the UK and Spain.\n\nIn addition, Germany, Romania, Greece and Hungary all sourced Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) or tariffs for the first time during the year.\n\nIn July 2019, Vodafone committed to setting a Science Based Target over the next year which is aligned to limiting global temperature rise to below 1.5\u00b0C and reaching net-zero emissions no later than 2050. This will require a significant reduction in our direct carbon emissions as well as setting targets for indirect emissions (including suppliers and joint ventures). We are also part of a GSMA taskforce that has defined the emission reduction pathway for the telecoms industry.\n\nIn recognition of our governance on GHG emissions, this year Vodafone moved to an A- from a B in the latest CDP rating.\n\nOur Planet programme, including our objective of halving our environmental impact, is also aligned to our risk mitigation process.\n\nWe have identified potential climate change risks through a Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) scenario-based risk and opportunity assessment. This has helped to specifically identify transition, physical, regulatory and reputational risks.\n\nIn 2018, we established a green bond framework, under which Vodafone issued its first \u20ac750 million green bond in May 2019 to finance or refinance projects to help us meet our environmental objectives. The framework and subsequent report define which projects are eligible under the use of proceeds and how they are selected.\n\nOptimising our energy consumption\n\nWe are committed to improving the energy efficiency of our base station sites and in our technology (data and switching) centres, which together account for 95% of our total global energy consumption. During 2020, we invested \u20ac77 million capital expenditure in energy efficiency and renewable projects across our business, which has led to annual energy savings of 1860Wh.\n\nOur energy efficiency initiatives are focused on three key areas:\n\n- sourcing and implementing more efficient network equipment;\n- reducing energy demand by installing lower-energy power and cooling technologies; and\n- cutting energy use by decommissioning and replacing legacy equipment.\n\nVodafone energy use (Gigawatt hours)\n\n|                      | FY18 | FY19 | FY20 |\n|----------------------|------|------|------|\n| Base station sites   | 3.627| 3.665| 3.810|\n| Offices              | 301  | 277  | 256  |\n| Technology centres   | 1.538| 1.540| 1.430|\n| Retail stores        | 55   | 46   | 45   |\n| Total                | 5,521| 5,528| 5,541|\n\nGHG emissions (million tonnes of CO\u2082e)\n\n|                      | FY18 | FY19 | FY20 |\n|----------------------|------|------|------|\n| Base station sites   | 1.78 | 2.01 | 1.84 |\n| Offices              | 0.52 | 0.52 | 0.52 |\n| Technology centres   | 0.29 | 0.29 | 0.29 |\n| Retail stores        | 0.29 | 0.29 | 0.29 |\n| Total                | 2.07 | 2.01 | 1.84 |\n\nGHG emissions per petabyte of mobile data carried by our networks (tonnes of CO\u2082e)\n\n|                      | FY18 | FY19 | FY20 |\n|----------------------|------|------|------|\n| Base station sites   | 591  | 374  | 230  |\n| Offices              | 15.4 | 15.6 | 25.9 |\n| Technology centres   | 15.4 | 15.6 | 25.9 |\n| Retail stores        | 15.4 | 15.6 | 25.9 |\n| Total                | 591  | 374  | 230  |\n\nPercentage of purchased electricity from renewable sources (%)\n\n|                      | FY18 | FY19 | FY20 |\n|----------------------|------|------|------|\n| Base station sites   | 15.4 | 15.6 | 25.9 |\n| Offices              | 15.4 | 15.6 | 25.9 |\n| Technology centres   | 15.4 | 15.6 | 25.9 |\n| Retail stores        | 15.4 | 15.6 | 25.9 |\n| Total                | 15.4 | 15.6 | 25.9 |\n\nNote: Calculated using local market actual or estimated data sources from invoices, purchasing requisitions, direct data measurement and estimations. Carbon emissions calculated in line with GHG Protocol standards. Scope 2 emissions are reported using the market-based methodology. For full methodology see our Sustainable Business Addendum 2020.\nWorking together with eSight Energy, Vodafone has implemented an energy data management system using data feeds from our electricity suppliers and from smart meters across 58,000 sites in Europe.\n\nTo support our energy reduction programme, we have established an employee engagement initiative, \u201c#RedLovesGreen\u201d. This aims to raise awareness of the individual actions that employees can take to reduce energy use and encourages changes in behaviour that collectively could have a significant impact. More than 16,000 colleagues are currently members of the RedLovesGreen community and over 3,000 have completed a dedicated energy awareness e-learning course.\n\n**Scope 3 emissions**\n\nScope 3 emissions are indirect GHG emissions over which we have no direct control but may be able to influence.\n\nThis year, our estimated Scope 3 emissions were 11.9 million tonnes of CO\u2082e (see chart below). We have worked with the Carbon Trust to analyse our Scope 3 emissions and prioritise where we have the greatest opportunity to influence reductions.\n\n**Enabling customers to reduce emissions**\n\nOur biggest contribution to mitigating climate change is the way our products and services are helping our customers to reduce the environmental impact. Through our IoT services, we are helping our customers to manage energy more efficiently and reduce their emissions.\n\nWe estimate that over 30% of the more than 103 million IoT connections we operate directly enable customers to reduce their emissions, and we expect these connections to increase over time.\n\nWe calculate that in 2020, the total GHG emissions avoided as a consequence of our IoT technologies and services were 6.9 million tonnes CO\u2082e, which is 3.8 times the emissions generated from our own operations. The greatest CO\u2082e savings enabled were predominantly in smart logistics and fleet management, followed by smart metering.\n\n**Building a circular economy**\n\n**Goal:**\n\n**To reuse, resell or recycle 100% of our network waste by 2025**\n\nWe believe society needs to move to a more efficient, circular economy focused on eliminating waste. Vodafone is committed to playing our part in this transition.\n\nOur Group policy on waste management prioritises the reuse or recycling of unwanted equipment, safely and responsibly. We also seek to help keep resources in use for as long as possible, extracting the maximum value from equipment while in use and then recovering and reusing materials before recycling them responsibly.\n\nThis year in our own operations, we generated an estimated 9.500 tonnes of waste and we recovered and recycled 84.9%. Globally, 99.9% of our network waste was sent for reuse and recycling.\n\nAs well as managing network waste, we are also working on ways to improve the reuse and repair of devices across our business. A number of our markets operate trade-in and device buyback schemes, such as drop-off boxes in retail stores, freepost return envelopes and repair services to encourage customers to repair or return their old devices and routers.\n\n**Reducing plastic waste**\n\nThis year, Vodafone made the commitment to eliminate all unnecessary plastics and other disposable single-use items where there are lower impact alternatives across all our retail stores and offices. This included no longer using disposable plastic bags in retail stores, as well as removing or restricting plastic marketing and promotional materials, replacing them with alternatives with a lower environmental impact.\n\nIn 2019, we replaced our standard credit-card sized SIM holder with a new half-size format, reducing the amount of plastic used to produce SIMs by 50%. These cards are available now in several European markets and will eventually replace full-sized cards across all markets.\n\n**Working towards our network waste target**\n\nThis year, we launched Asset Marketplace, a business-to-business solution within Vodafone that allows us to re-sell and repurpose large decommissioned electrical items like masts and antennae, helping us reduce carbon emissions by not needing to purchase new items. The solution also helps save an average of 63% of expenditure versus buying new equipment. Within two months of launching Asset Marketplace, shipments \u2013 including radio equipment \u2013 were sent from Germany to Portugal and from the UK and the Netherlands to several markets in Africa. Over the next year, we plan to expand the scope of Asset Marketplace to include IT and terminals, whilst also opening up the service to partner markets.\n\n**Partnering with Fairphone**\n\nThis year, we announced a strategic partnership with Fairphone to offer the more ethical, reliable and sustainable Fairphone 3 to Vodafone retail and corporate customers in European markets including the UK, Germany, Italy, Spain and Ireland. In some markets, we are now offering Fairphone 3 as an option for employees\u2019 work phones. Vodafone and Fairphone will also collaborate on best practice and share knowledge on key industry sustainability issues including the circular economy, electronic waste and responsible sourcing.\nOperating responsibly\n\nWe are committed to ensuring that our business operates ethically, lawfully and with integrity, as this is critical to our long-term success. This section addresses some of our key responsible business practices and details the activities we put in place to ensure our operating practices meet our own and our stakeholders\u2019 expectations.\n\nHuman rights\n\nAt Vodafone, we believe that wherever we operate, we contribute to the wealth and development of countries, regions and local communities in a way that advances the protection and promotion of a number of fundamental human rights and freedoms and supports the full realisation of socio-economic development.\n\nOur most salient human rights risks relate to the individual\u2019s right to privacy and freedom of expression. Our commitment to our customers\u2019 privacy goes beyond legal compliance. We are focused on building a culture that respects the right to privacy in order to justify the trust that people place in us, and always seek to respect and seek to protect our customers\u2019 lawful rights to hold and express opinions and share information and ideas without interference. At the same time, as a licensed national operator, we are obliged to comply with lawful orders from national authorities and the judiciary, including law enforcement.\n\nIn 2019, we launched our new Group human rights policy, setting out the minimum requirements that everyone working for and with Vodafone must comply with across all human rights topics. We manage human rights risks through our human rights due diligence approach, which is aligned with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n\nEnsuring human rights are upheld during the COVID-19 crisis\n\nOur focus on human rights is even more important during the COVID-19 crisis, which has a significant socio-economic impact, particularly across certain groups. We have a number of programmes to mitigate this impact, which stretch across our workforce, suppliers, customers and vulnerable groups. The crisis has also highlighted the tension between privacy and personal freedom, on the one hand, and public safety, on the other.\n\nAs part of our COVID-19 response, we have provided technical support to governments, for example through creating heat maps showing how containment measures affect population movements in aggregated and anonymised form, and giving advice on the development of privacy-preserving contact tracing apps.\n\nWhen doing so, we do not provide raw customer data to governments, and will never voluntarily offer our customer data for any initiatives that remove the requirement for consent.\n\nWe believe that any contact tracing apps should fulfil four conditions to adhere to human rights. These apps must be: a) independent of operators and other private companies; b) developed and controlled by national health authorities; c) still require consent; and d) it must be for the state institutions to justify why contact tracing is necessary and in line with existing laws and regulations.\n\nIt is especially in times of crisis that there is a critical need to stay true to our values and to ensure that the measures we take as a company, and as an industry, are based on ensuring the protection of human dignity and the adherence to fundamental rights. In this context, transparency has never been as important as it is now, and we will continue to share as much as we can.\n\nResponsible supply chain\n\nWe spend approximately \u20ac24 billion a year with around 11,000 direct suppliers around the world to meet our businesses\u2019 and customers\u2019 needs.\n\nEvery supplier that works for Vodafone is required to abide by our Code of Ethical Purchasing. These commitments extend down through the supply chain so that a supplier with which we have a direct contractual relationship (Tier 1 supplier) in turn is required to ensure compliance across its own direct supply chain (Tier 2 supplier from Vodafone\u2019s perspective) and beyond.\n\nThe Code of Ethical Purchasing is based on international standards including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization\u2019s Fundamental Conventions on Labour Standards.\n\nIt stipulates a range of ethical, labour and environmental standards that we expect to be followed across our supply chain, including areas such as child labour, health and safety, working hours, discrimination and disciplinary processes.\n\nUndergoing our first GNI assessment\n\nIn 2017, we joined the Global Network Initiative (\u2018GNI\u2019) as a Board member. The GNI is a multi-stakeholder forum focused on promoting and advancing freedom of expression and the right to privacy worldwide.\n\nAs part of our ongoing commitment as a member, we underwent our first independent GNI principles implementation assessment in 2019. The GNI Board concluded Vodafone is \u201cmaking best faith efforts to implement the GNI Principles with improvement over time\u201d \u2013 this is the formal wording adopted by the Board for companies\u2019 successful completion of the assessment.\n\nOur independent assessor noted, for example, that \u201cthe GNI principles are well understood and embraced by senior leaders in a number of key areas of the business and that the Company uses technology and existing compliance systems to embed human rights into everyday company procedures and processes.\u201d\n\nFor more information on the GNI company assessments visit: www.globalnetworkinitiative.org/company-assessments\n\nNumber of site assessments conducted (either by Vodafone or through JAC)\n\n| Year | FY18 | FY19 | FY20 |\n|------|------|------|------|\n|      | 98   | 85   | 74   |\nThose requirements are backed up by risk assessments, audits and operational improvement processes, which we summarise below and which are also underpinned by binding contractual commitments.\n\nWe evaluate our suppliers\u2019 compliance with our Code of Ethical Purchasing through a detailed assessment that may involve an on-site audit. Some site audits are conducted under the Joint Audit Cooperation (JAC) initiative, an association of telecommunications operators established to improve ethical, labour and environmental standards in the ICT supply chain, of which Vodafone is a participating member (see chart on page 48).\n\nThe top three areas of non-compliance were:\n\n- Health & safety matters related to non-compliant building safety;\n- Environmental matters related to non-compliant chemical storage and lack of carbon reduction programmes; and\n- Excessive working hours due to needing better demand management.\n\nSuppliers that do not meet our standards are provided with a corrective action plan to address any areas for improvement and are required to submit evidence that this has been completed.\n\nOur supplier performance management programme covers environmental factors, and suppliers\u2019 GHG performance is one of the factors evaluated in our annual assessment process. We also ask selected suppliers to provide details of their GHG emissions and management programmes through CDP. We have also changed the weighting in our procurement, giving more emphasis to purpose in our selection of suppliers.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 crisis, to assist businesses most at risk within our supply chain, Vodafone is ensuring that all new orders issued to our micro and small suppliers providing goods and services to Vodafone\u2019s European operations are paid in 15 days, instead of the customary 30 to 60 days.\n\n**Anti-bribery and corruption**\n\nAt Vodafone, we support and foster a culture of zero tolerance towards bribery or corruption in all our activities.\n\n**Our anti-bribery policy**\n\nOur policy on this issue is summarised in our Code of Conduct and states that employees or others working on our behalf must never offer or accept any kind of bribe.\n\nOur anti-bribery policy is consistent with the UK Bribery Act and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and provides guidance about what constitutes a bribe and prohibits giving or receiving any excessive or improper gifts and hospitality. Any policy breaches can lead to dismissal or termination of contract.\n\nFacilitation payments are strictly prohibited by our policy and our employees are provided with practical guidance on how to respond to demands for facilitation payments. The only exception is when an employee\u2019s personal safety is at risk. In such circumstances, when a payment under duress is made, the incident must be reported to the compliance team as soon as possible afterwards.\n\nOne of the ways to help the fight against COVID-19 is through charitable donations and contributions, either monetary or in kind. We are proud to have been able to provide donations for those in need. We have issued guidance to all markets and Foundations to assist them in their assessment of different initiatives, to ensure donations are given in line with our policies, and to stipulate clear steps for seeking exceptions to the policies where these are deemed necessary.\n\n**Governance and risk assessment**\n\nOur Chief Executive and Group Executive Committee (ExCo) oversee our efforts to prevent bribery. They are supported by local market Chief Executives, who are responsible for ensuring that our anti-bribery programme is implemented effectively in their local market.\n\nThey in turn are supported by local specialists and by a dedicated Group team that is solely focused on anti-bribery policy and compliance.\n\nVodafone\u2019s Risk and Compliance Committee assists the ExCo to fulfil its accountabilities with regards to risk management and policy compliance.\n\nThe key actions for the programme for the coming year are documented in the bribery risk line of sight report, which is regularly updated by our General Counsel.\n\nAs part of our anti-bribery programme, every Vodafone business must adhere to minimum global standards, which include:\n\n- ensuring there is a due diligence process for suppliers and business partners at the start of the business relationship;\n- completion of the global e-learning training for all employees, as well as tailored training for higher risk teams; and\n- using Vodafone\u2019s global online gift and hospitality registration platform, as well as ensuring there is a process for approving local sponsorships and charitable contributions.\n\nThe bribery risks we face are constantly evolving. The table below summarises the principal risk categories and the measures we take in mitigation.\n\n| Risk | Response |\n|------|----------|\n| Operating in high-risk markets | We undertake biennial risk assessments in each of our local operating companies and at Group level, so we can understand and limit our exposure to risk. |\n| Business acquisition and integration | Anti-bribery considerations are taken into account when carrying out due diligence on a target company. Red flags identified during the due diligence are reviewed and assessed. Following acquisition, we implement our anti-bribery programme. |\n| Spectrum licensing | To reduce the risk of attempted bribery, a specialist spectrum policy team oversees our participation in all negotiations and auctions. We provide appropriate training and guidance for employees who interact with government officials on spectrum matters. |\n| Building and upgrading networks | Our anti-bribery policy makes it clear that we never offer any form of inducement to secure a permit, lease or access to a site. We regularly remind all employees and contractors in network roles of this prohibition, through tailored training sessions and communications. |\n| Working with third parties | Suppliers and other relevant third parties working for or on behalf of Vodafone, must comply with the principles set out in our Code of Conduct and Code of Ethical Purchasing. Third party due diligence is completed at the start of our business relationship with suppliers; other third parties and partners. Through their contracts with us, our suppliers, partners and other third parties make a commitment to implement and maintain proportionate and effective anti-bribery compliance measures. We regularly remind current suppliers of our policy requirements and complete detailed compliance assessments across a sample of higher-risk and higher-value suppliers. Select high-risk third parties are trained to ensure awareness of our zero-tolerance policy. |\n| Winning and retaining business | We provide targeted training for our Vodafone Business and Partner Markets sales teams. In addition, we also maintain and monitor a global register of gifts and hospitality to ensure that inappropriate offers are not accepted or extended by our employees. |\nImplementation of the anti-bribery policy is monitored regularly in all local markets as part of the annual Group Policy Compliance Review assurance process, which reviews key anti-bribery controls. Visits to local markets, on a rotating basis, enable us to assess the implementation of the anti-bribery programme in more detail, through on-the-ground reviews. This year, reviews were completed in Vodafone Egypt and Vodafone Business. The reviews demonstrated good implementation of the anti-bribery programme. Some areas for improvement relating to third party risk management were identified and are being addressed.\n\nEngaging employees to raise awareness of bribery risk\nWe run a multi-channel high profile global communications programme, Doing What\u2019s Right, to engage with employees and raise awareness and understanding of the policy. The \u201cDoing What\u2019s Right\u201d programme also features e-learning training, which includes a specific anti-bribery module. To date, over 90% of active employees around the world have completed the e-learning training.\n\n\u2018Speak Up\u2019\nAll Vodafone employees are encouraged to report any suspected breaches of our Code of Conduct as soon as possible, using our \u2018Speak Up\u2019 process.\n\nSenior executives review every Speak Up report and the programme is reviewed by the Group Risk and Compliance Committee. Speak Up operates under a non-retaliatory policy: everyone who raises a concern in good faith is treated fairly with no negative consequences for their employment with Vodafone, regardless of the outcome of any subsequent investigation.\n\nThis year, 602 separate concerns were reported using Speak Up on a wide range of issues (though only a very small fraction were related to bribery and corruption).\n\nMobiles, masts and health\nThe health and safety of our people, customers and the wider public is a priority for Vodafone. We always operate our mobile networks strictly within national regulations, which are typically based on, or go beyond, international guidelines set by the independent scientific body the International Commission for Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). There has been scientific research on mobile frequencies (including those used by 5G) for decades, and 5G is covered by international and national exposure guidelines and regulations. Following an extensive review of scientific studies published during the last 20 years, in March 2020 ICNIRP confirmed that there are no adverse effects on human health from 5G frequencies if exposure is within their guidelines.\n\nIn addition, the majority of Vodafone\u2019s markets that have rolled out 5G have implemented a \u201cSmart PowerLock\u201d feature which guarantees compliance with electromagnetic field (EMF) regulations under all possible operating conditions for all 5G sites by reducing the energy radiated when certain network conditions are met.\n\nThere is no credible scientific evidence linking the spread of COVID-19 to 5G or to mobile technologies. It is regrettable that unproven, unsubstantiated theories circulating primarily on social media have incited individuals to damage masts and base stations in a number of countries, thereby jeopardising people\u2019s connectivity, including digital access to health services. We have been encouraged by the response from the scientific and technical community in rejecting these claims, and we appreciate the work carried out by fact-checking organisations, governments and health agencies in ensuring that the established scientific position is communicated to the public.\n\nWe have robust governance mechanisms in place and conduct regular compliance assessments to ensure that our masts and devices meet all regulations. We review all published scientific research. We also perform network measurements and carry out calculations and assessments of exposure from the network masts, and review the test reports we receive on EMF testing on devices.\n\nTax and economic contribution\nAs a major investor, taxpayer and employer, we make a significant contribution to the economies of all the countries in which we operate. In addition to direct and indirect taxation, our financial contributions to governments also include other areas such as radio spectrum fees and auction proceeds.\n\nOur tax report sets out our total contribution to public finances on a cash-paid basis. The information we share aims to help our stakeholders understand our approach, policies and principles. We disclose our financial contributions to governments at a country level, as we believe this is an important way to demonstrate that it is possible to achieve an effective balance between a company\u2019s responsibilities to society as a whole, through the payment of taxes (and other government revenue-raising mechanisms), and its obligations to its shareholders.\n\nWe also share our views on key topics of relevance, including the latest on the taxation of the digital economy. We continue to include our OECD BEPS country-by-country disclosure, as submitted to HMRC.\n\nFind out more\nOur ESG Addendum 2020 provides more detailed information, including on our Sustainable Business governance processes, the scope and methodology of our reporting and alignment to GRI Standards.\n\nOur latest reports can be found online, including our Modern Slavery Statement and our Gender Pay Gap Report:\n\nRead more at vodafone.com/ESG2020\nRead our latest reports at vodafone.com/sbreporting\nThe table below outlines where the key contents requirements of the Non-Financial Statement can be found within this document (as required by sections 414CA and 414CB of the Companies Act 2006).\n\nVodafone\u2019s sustainable business reporting also follows other international reporting frameworks, including the Global Reporting Initiative, CDP and GHG Reporting Protocol.\n\n| Reporting requirement                  | Vodafone policies and approach | Section within Annual Report |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Environmental matters**              |                               |                             |\n| Planet performance                     | Planet                        | 46                          |\n| Climate change risk                    | Risk management               | 62                          |\n| **Employees**                          |                               |                             |\n| Code of Conduct                        | Anti-bribery and corruption   | 49                          |\n| Occupational health and safety         | Employee experience           | 60                          |\n| Diversity and inclusion                | Diverse talent and skills     | 58                          |\n| **Social and community matters**       |                               |                             |\n| Driving positive societal transformation performance | Digital Society | 41 |\n| Stakeholder engagement                 | Stakeholder engagement        | 12                          |\n| Mobiles, masts and health              | Mobiles, masts and health     | 50                          |\n| **Human rights**                       |                               |                             |\n| Human rights approach                  | Human rights                  | 48                          |\n| Code of Ethical Purchasing             | Responsible supply chain      | 48                          |\n| Modern Slavery Statement               | Find out more                 | 50                          |\n| **Anti-bribery and corruption**        |                               |                             |\n| Code of Conduct                        | Anti-bribery and corruption   | 49                          |\n| Anti-bribery policy                    | Anti-bribery and corruption   | 49                          |\n| Speak Up process                       | Anti-bribery and corruption   | 50                          |\n| **Policy embedding, due diligence and outcomes** | Sustainable business | 40 |\n| Risk management                        | Risk management               | 62                          |\n| **Description of principal risks and impact of business activity** | Risk management | 62 |\n| **Description of business model**      | Our strategy                  | 20                          |\n| **Non-financial key performance indicators** | Sustainable business | 40 |\n\n**UK Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (\u2018SECR\u2019)**\n\nIn accordance with SECR requirements, this provides a summary of GHG emissions and energy data for Vodafone UK, in comparison with global performance.\n\n|                        | Global (excluding Vodafone UK) | Vodafone UK |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------|\n| GHG emissions (Scope 1 and 2) (m tonnes CO\u2082e) | 1.75 | 0.09 |\n| GHG emissions per petabyte (\u2018PB\u2019) of mobile data carried (tonnes of CO\u2082e) | 242 | 120 |\n| Total energy consumption (GWh) | 4,832 | 709 |\n\nRead more on Vodafone\u2019s approach to reducing carbon emissions on page 46\nDeveloping a new \u2018social\u2019 contract\n\nAt Vodafone we connect for a better future. We know that connectivity is transforming how we live and work and we are working to build a digital future that works for everyone. Keeping with Vodafone\u2019s commitment to play a critical role in a resilient digital society, we introduced our \u2018social\u2019 contract which represents the partnership we want to develop.\n\nWe have formulated a \u2018social\u2019 contract to represent the partnership that we want to develop with governments, policy makers and civil society. It is based on three pillars; Trust, Fairness and Leadership. These pillars represent our offer to society and the conditions that need to be in place for the connectivity sector to thrive. We believe the formulation of this contract is an important step in creating a digital society that works for citizens and businesses alike.\n\nThe pillars:\n\n| Trust | Fairness | Leadership |\n|-------|----------|------------|\n| Simplified and transparent pricing | Closing the rural divide | Leader in convergence, IoT and mobile financial services |\n| Security of our networks and customer data | Investment in network quality and resilience | Industry leader on network sharing |\n| Customer-orientated approach to new technologies | Fair competition across entire ecosystem | Digitisation of other industries |\n| Digital inclusion \u2013 especially youth and women | Sustainable market structure | Partnerships with tech companies to enhance service delivery |\n| Reducing planetary impact | Network sharing enabled | Transitioning to vendor diversity through OpenRAN |\n| | Deployment costs lowered | Vodafone Foundation pushing tech innovation for societal benefit |\n| | Non-discriminatory spectrum auctions | |\nExamples of \u2018social\u2019 contract in action\n\n**OpenRAN**\nVodafone has been advocating for more diversity in the supply chain for network equipment. Part of the solution is OpenRAN which standardises the design and functionality of the hardware and software in the Radio Access Network (RAN) \u2013 the infrastructure, masts and antennae that operators use to carry mobile traffic.\n\nIn a complex technical process, the RAN gets deconstructed and reassembled into a set of fully open and interoperable sub systems that improves supplier diversity and healthy competition in the supply chain. Vodafone has opened its EU footprint for RAN tenders (>100k sites across 14 countries) and embarked on pilots in seven markets, aiming to bring strategic scale to OpenRAN.\n\nAs chair the Telecom Infrastructure Project (TIP) and member of the O-RAN Alliance, Vodafone is leading on technical and policy work to agree common global standards, encourage global scale and help ensure the benefits of OpenRAN are realised.\n\n**Network sharing/rural coverage**\nNetwork sharing agreements have been finalised in a number of countries in order to make rural network coverage more cost efficient. In some cases such as Italy and Spain this has been done on a bilateral basis.\n\nIn the UK, Vodafone has entered into a unique partnership with government and other mobile operators to provide a Shared Rural Network solution to deliver connectivity to deep rural locations that were previously uneconomic to serve.\n\nThis large scale initiative will provide a connectivity boost for some of the most remote communities of the UK, bringing connectivity benefits where they live, work and travel.\n\nThe Shared Rural Network sees Vodafone and its partners investing in a network of new and existing phone masts (overseen by a jointly owned company) to guarantee coverage to 280,000 premises and 16,000km of roads. This ground-breaking initiative is set to transform rural connectivity in the UK over the next few years.\n\n**Data democratisation \u2013 South African agreement with Competition Authority**\nFollowing the Competition Commission\u2019s Data Market Inquiry Report in December 2019, Vodacom engaged constructively and reached an agreement with the Commission. This was done on the understanding that action will be taken by the Communications Regulator and Government to auction high demand spectrum.\n\nThe delays in assigning spectrum and completing the digital migration has curbed the pace at which data prices could fall. From 1 April 2020, continuing Vodacom\u2019s price transformation which had seen 50% reduction in effective price for data in the last two years, Vodacom introduced further price reductions (up to 40%) across all its monthly bundles, and through its ConnectU platform provides free access to basic internet, essential services, and cheaper pricing to the poorest communities.\n\nThis range of initiatives will reduce the cost to communicate with R2.7 billion (~\u20ac144 million) in additional savings to customers this year; promote digital inclusion; and assist societal problems in education, healthcare, and unemployment.\nDeveloping a new \u2018social\u2019 contract (continued)\n\nCOVID-19: Our rapid, comprehensive and coordinated response to support society...\n\nVodafone is committed to doing its utmost to support society during this period of uncertainty and change. As a provider of critical connectivity and communications services enabling our digital society, we announced a five-point plan to help the communities in which we operate.\n\n1 Maintain network service quality\n\nIn assisting governments and citizens, it is essential that we are able to maintain a minimum level of resilience and quality of service on our networks. This ensures essential connectivity and communications services, enabling citizens who are staying at home to continue to work, learn, socialise and be entertained. This was our first priority.\n\n- As customers work from home to an unprecedented degree using video conferencing over fixed broadband, uplink data (from the customer to our network) increased by as much as 100% in some markets. Download traffic has increased by 44% in aggregate.\n\n- Overall, mobile data usage increased by around 15% across Europe, peaking at 30% in Spain and Italy. In Africa, where there is limited fixed broadband, mobile data usage increased by around 20%, reaching 40% at its peak in South Africa.\n\n- In response, we brought forward planned network upgrades, adding four Terabits per second of additional capacity to our networks during March and April. In our cable and fibre networks, we upgraded the number and size of interconnection points with other operators and by the end of April had increased our capacity by 60%.\n\n- Our engineers continue to play an essential role when equipment at premises needs attention. In Germany, our 5,000 customer engineers managed to decrease repair times by around 40%, aided by the ability of customers to make immediate appointments and reduced travel times.\n\n2 Provide network capacity and services for critical government functions\n\nWe are offering hospitals additional network capacity and services such as video conferencing and unlimited, fast connectivity for healthcare workers. This allows remote consultations, removing the need for non-essential travel to hospitals and has allowed updates and best practices to be shared between hospitals and clinical staff.\n\n- In Italy, Vodafone has provisioned vital connectivity for new hospitals in Cuasso, Varese and the new Fiera Milano hospital in Milan.\n\n- Vodafone UK has provided emergency coverage for temporary new hospitals including the 4,000 bed Nightingale Hospital at London\u2019s Excel Centre and similar facilities in Manchester, Cardiff and Glasgow.\n\n- Vodafone Romania has installed new mobile sites for temporary military hospitals in Bucharest and Constanta.\n\n- In South Africa and Lesotho, Vodacom has provided 20,000 and 1,000 devices respectively to Ministries of Health departments for field workers engaged in testing and related data collection.\n\n- To guarantee connectivity for patients, Vodafone Spain has provided 30,000 SIMs with 60GB of data to hospitals and care centres for the elderly\u2014ensuring that people who are affected by COVID-19 in nursing homes, residences or small hospitals can stay connected to their families.\n\n- In Italy, Vodafone has donated more than 1,200 smartphones and tablets to hospitals, foundations and non-profit organisations to enable patients to remain in touch with relatives.\n\n- In the UK, Vodafone has announced that 125,000 NHS workers who are existing customers will benefit from 30 day\u2019s free unlimited mobile data.\n\n- Vodafone Germany and Corevas have repurposed and offered for free their EmergencyEye technology which was previously used to provide detailed virtual health assessments via smartphone\u2014removing the need for patients to leave the house and lowering the risk of infections as a result.\nFacilitating E-learning for students\nWith schools also now being shut, we are offering free access to government educational resources, and any other educational resources that are recommended by the national educational authorities and academic institutions.\n\n3 Improve dissemination of information to the public\nRecognising the importance of timely and accurate information to the public, we are offering all governments the ability to disseminate critical information via text alerts and providing free access to health and education sites.\n\n\u2013 In the UK, we have zero-rated the cost for mobile users to visit the nhs.uk domain and equivalent pages in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for the duration of the crisis.\n\n\u2013 In South Africa, our ConnectU Platform provides free services on health, jobs, education, safety and security, and Government services to the public.\n\n\u2013 In Germany, we have zero-rated digital education web pages and the official COVID-19 virus website of Robert Koch Institute and hospitals.\n\n4 Facilitate working from home and help small and micro businesses within our supply chain\nThe economic repercussions of this pandemic could be significant and long lasting. To mitigate these effects, we need to help those that can to work from home. For businesses of all sizes, but particularly SMEs, we are providing remote working solutions, advice and best practice information on how to use those services in the most effective way.\n\n\u2013 Vodafone employees alone, for example, are hosting 40,000 virtual video meetings and generating over six million call minutes every single day thanks to a rapid expansion of capacity to all of the digital tools we use.\n\n\u2013 We are supporting Vodafone Business customers to digitalise their own companies rapidly. We have enabled as many as 2.5 million employees to work from home, many for the first time.\n\n\u2013 We have announced faster supplier payment terms to micro and small enterprises who may have liquidity problems.\n\n\u2013 We have provided special remote working solutions for businesses and SMEs, in particular.\n\n\u2013 Vodafone Hungary are offering business packages to micro and SME business customers without any loyalty contract.\n\n\u2013 Vodafone markets including Spain, Italy, South Africa and Kenya are offering unlimited data and special offers to SMEs for a limited period.\n\n5 Improve governments\u2019 insights in affected areas\nData insights are essential to understand the effectiveness of lockdowns and the spread of the virus. Wherever technically and lawfully possible, we are assisting governments in developing insights based on large anonymised data sets.\n\nThis work falls into three broad categories: mobility \u2018insights\u2019, data and AI-driven modelling and contact tracing apps:\n\n\u2013 Mobility \u2018insights\u2019: we are providing governments and public administrations with access to the mobility dashboards (live in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal). This mobility data is particularly useful to see if quarantine and lockdown measures have been effective and are being observed. In Italy, we used our Vodafone Analytics platform to provide Lombardy\u2019s regional government with heat maps showing how population movements changed before and after containment.\n\n\u2013 Data & AI-driven modelling: We have leveraged our experience of tracking the spread of infectious diseases, like malaria in Africa, using big data and artificial intelligence techniques. We developed an epidemiologist model, in collaboration with academics from the University of Southampton and Imperial College.\n\n\u2013 Contact tracing apps: We are assisting governments as they look to exit quarantine/lockdown measures, through the development of contact tracing smartphone apps. We are a member of the pan-European research consortia the Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT) that has created an open-source technology standard and Software Developer Kit to develop a contact-tracing app that works in a privacy-protected manner.\n\nAdditional actions\n\u2013 In response to COVID-19 Vodafone has given direct contributions and services in-kind totalling approximately \u20ac100 million, reaching 78 million customers.\n\n\u2013 The Vodafone Foundation has also donated \u20ac9 million in cash grants, gifts in-kind and from employee donations via the community fund.\n\n\u2013 During the COVID-19 crisis, M-Pesa is a strong alternative to cash, offering a no-contact payment solution. Working with regulators, M-Pesa has implemented a number of measures across our African markets including enabling free person to person transactions, increasing transaction and balance limits, and flexible customer registration and on-boarding.\n\n...ensuring vital connectivity to keep families connected, to enable businesses to operate, students to learn, healthcare to be delivered and Governments to provide critical services.\nEngaging and inspiring our employees with \u2018The Spirit of Vodafone\u2019\n\nPeople and culture are central to our purpose to connect for a better future and to our commitment to improve one billion lives and halve Vodafone\u2019s environmental impact by 2025.\n\nPurpose and Spirit\n\nTo fulfil our purpose and deliver our strategy, we have identified the need for a shift in our culture, defined as the \u2018The Spirit of Vodafone\u2019. The Spirit engages and inspires employees to drive behavioural change at all levels in the organisation and is underpinned by the ambition to establish ourselves as a trusted partner to connect for a better future. To get there we must be restless and passionate about improving the lives of our customers, colleagues and communities. We are always open to new things and curious to create solutions that our customers will love. It starts with us. No matter where we work in Vodafone, we act as one. Together, we create a place where everyone can truly be themselves and belong.\n\nWe have identified the four Spirit behaviours which will help us to do this:\n\n- Earn customer loyalty\n- Create the future\n- Experiment, learn fast\n- Get it done, together\n\nIn December 2019 we launched the Spirit of Vodafone through a global broadcast and articulated the connection between our purpose, strategy and Spirit. Globally 37,850 people joined the event either virtually or in person. This launch, known as the Big Conversation, was followed by local market sessions on Spirit and team conversations on beliefs and behaviours. The aim was to deepen understanding and encourage individuals to commit to action. We then carried out an impact analysis, which showed how instrumental the Big Conversation has been in igniting this behavioural change.\n\nSince then, active steps have been taken to embed our Spirit across our core business and people processes, concerning our organisation, talent and skills, recruitment processes and reward and recognition.\nOur people: key information\n\n| By contract | By gender | By location |\n|-------------|-----------|-------------|\n| 92,866 Employees | 53,711 Male (61%) | 14% Germany |\n| 11,269 Contractors | 34,941 Female (39%) | 5% Italy |\n\n| | | |\n|---|---|---|\n| | 14% Other Europe | 5% Vodacom South Africa |\n| | 12% Other Markets | 6% Vodacom Group (others) |\n| | 22% Shared services | 8% Others |\n\nAverage number of employees: 92,866\nEmployee turnover rate: 19%\nWomen on the Board: 42%\nWomen in senior leadership positions: 29%\nWomen in management and leadership roles: 31%\n\nNotes:\n1. Due to the recent integration, Liberty data is excluded from the gender split due to the lack of data availability.\n2. Percentage of senior women in our top 173 leadership positions.\n3. Percentage of women in our 6,372 management and leadership roles.\n\nOrganisation\n\nThe execution of our strategy requires an effective operating model and in the last year we have made substantive progress in reshaping our organisation.\n\nOne important strategic change was the decision to focus on two differentiated geographical regions (Europe and Africa), dissolving the Africa, Middle East and Asia Pacific (AMAP) region. As of 1 April 2020 Vodacom Group now reports directly to the Vodafone Group Chief Executive, whilst Vodafone Ghana moves under the Vodafone CEO.\n\nWe also completed the acquisition and organisational integration of Liberty Global\u2019s cable assets in Germany and our Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) markets, enabling us to earn customer loyalty by becoming Europe\u2019s leading converged operator and further strengthening our capabilities in these markets.\n\nWe have also continued our plans for implementing our \u201cTech 2025\u201d vision, which outlines our five-year strategy for our Technology function, in which we have driven key changes such as implementing both IT and network platforms.\n\nFinally we set up our European tower business \u201cTowerCo\u201d to centrally manage our tower assets, in order to generate operational efficiencies and increase tenancy ratios across our portfolio. We are also considering potential options to monetise these towers while preserving network differentiation and long-term strategic flexibility.\n\nAny organisational change we conduct is in compliance with local legislation and in consultation with employee representatives, works councils and local unions. We continue to invest in strengthening our operating model to deliver our strategy, and to create an open, diverse and inclusive environment for our people.\n\nWelcoming our new colleagues with the Spirit of Vodafone\n\nCultural integration to bring together employees from both Vodafone and the acquired entities has been an ongoing and consistent area of focus and effort.\n\nIn Germany, prior to the completion of the acquisition, a cultural diagnostics was conducted by a third party provider and a comprehensive \u201cDay 1 Welcome Experience\u201d for our new colleagues was created based on the insights. This included town halls, all-hands meetings, and a personalised message from our Germany CEO to every new colleague.\n\nIn our CEE markets, the key theme for cultural integration has been \u201cBetter together\u201d; the involvement of employees at all levels of the acquired entities in integration activities has been key to embedding this concept. Employees of UPC entities have been a core part of team events from leadership off-sites, company all-hands and functional team effectiveness activities. Integrated senior leadership has played a visible role and there has been an emphasis on making employees from UPC entities feel \u201cat home\u201d in the Vodafone environment, with a specific focus on accelerated co-location of teams from both entities, office tours of the premises, CEO tours, bi-weekly \u201copen\u201d hour with Directors, etc.\n\nEmployee sentiment in both organisations has been measured through regular Pulse Surveys, and appropriate actions have been taken in response. The subsequent results have demonstrated that these measures were well received by employees.\n\nThe launch of \u2018The Spirit of Vodafone\u2019 in December 2019 has provided further support to the cultural integration both in Germany and CEE markets. Employees from Liberty and UPC entities play key roles in embedding the Spirit of Vodafone in the combined organisation and continue to provide visible and engaged leadership.\n\nNote:\n4. An organization-wide business meeting that gives an opportunity for employees to ask questions to senior leaders.\nDiverse talent and skills\n\nInclusion is a key pillar of our purpose and creating a place where everyone feels they belong is core to our Spirit. At Vodafone we are proud of our commitment and we continue to focus on creating a place where people can be themselves.\n\nIn light of this commitment, in the period covered by this report, we employed 92,866 full-time equivalent colleagues and 11,269 contractors, across 21 markets. Within this we had employees from 126 different nationalities.\n\nOur commitment is embraced at every level, from senior leadership in the Vodafone Group Plc Board, to each employee and embedded in the \u201cSpirit of Vodafone\u201d, the \u201cCode of Conduct\u201d and our \u201cBusiness Principles\u201d.\n\nDiversity & Inclusion\n\nOur Diversity & Inclusion agenda continues to be one of our key priorities focusing mainly on gender balance, LGBT+, disability and ethnicity.\n\nOur ambition is for Vodafone to become the world\u2019s best employer for women by 2025. As part of this ambition, last year we set our target of 30% of our management and leadership roles held by women across our local markets and 11,269 contractors, across 21 markets.\n\nAs part of this ambition, last year we set our target of 30% of our management and leadership roles held by women across our local markets and 11,269 contractors, across 21 markets.\n\nOur commitment was recognised by the Stonewall Top Global Employer and the Global Ally Programme Award. We have also supported allies through our global Ally training programmes and introduced Friends of LGBT+ training webinars to help create a culture where employees can be open about their sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nTo support colleagues with a disability, we have expanded support for recruiters and line managers through webinars to increase understanding of the needs of neurodiverse colleagues and candidates.\n\nDigital \u2018First\u2019\n\nTo support the digital transformation of our business we realise the need for adopting new ways of working and developing digital talent and skills, which we refer to as Digital \u2018First\u2019.\n\nTo deliver at scale and pace, we set up a new agile operating model focused on digital marketing and sales, modern technology architecture in markets, and automation and artificial intelligence (AI) in customer operations and shared services. As of March 2020, we have 60 tribes, 393 squads and more than 3,700 people working in an agile way across 11 markets, and we see good momentum in implementing agile ways of working across all markets.\n\nWe have also introduced a new talent management approach for these digital teams to help enable a successful shift into agile ways of working. This approach focuses on the level of skills that employees demonstrate, encouraging them to continue to build expertise through reward, recognition and individual development. It also gives an organisation-wide view of the skills that are available internally and informs the design of strategies to build, develop or source that are not currently available in teams.\n\nThis approach was tested in three markets: Turkey, South Africa and Egypt. The next markets going ahead with skills assessment are Italy in March 2020, followed by Spain, Portugal and Greece in September 2020; we had 470 in phase 1 and 947 in phase 2.\n\nOur people response to the COVID-19 crisis\n\nOur response to the COVID-19 pandemic has prioritised the safety and wellbeing of our people first from the outset, through a variety of initiatives deployed across markets and tightly coordinated by the Business Continuity Plan programme management. The move to working from home for almost 100,000 of our people across all markets (approximately 95%) has been a tremendous organisational effort, enabled by our technology and network infrastructure, collaboration tools deployed at scale, HR policies and digital training.\n\nWe have not made any organisation change or redundancies relating to the COVID-19 crisis, during the medical emergency. In the early stages of the crisis, we reskilled retail staff to enable them to operate as call centre agents from their homes in selected markets. At the same time we were able to maintain full operational continuity in the customer care centres by enabling our agents to work from home. Medical and wellbeing support has been made available online and through video to our employees globally.\n\nWe have introduced a rich variety of digital learning content to help employees and their families in developing resilience and learning new skills, and to support line managers in managing their teams effectively in remote working conditions.\n\nGlobal and local webinars have provided regular guidance around health, safety and wellbeing, leadership support and technical advice. In parallel, to create capacity for the teams to focus on the crisis, we have reprioritised and simplified our people processes, including a prioritisation of recruiting efforts, the streamlining of the end of year performance cycle and a simpler process for 2020/21 goal setting.\n\nBased on requests from employees to do more to support people most affected by the pandemic we have also introduced a Global Giving Scheme, a new employee fundraising initiative that will directly support local charities in our communities during this crisis. All members of the Group Executive Committee have contributed, with the Group Chief Executive Officer and Group Chief Financial Officer leading the way by donating 25% of their salaries for April, May and June. Vodafone and the Vodafone Foundation will match all contribution on a 1:1 basis, doubling employees\u2019 contributions.\n\nIn April 2020, we launched a global survey to understand how employees are adapting to the new environment, to assess how they are feeling and to prioritise any additional support needed.\n\nThe survey ran every two weeks in April and May. In the last round on 29 April, approximately 56,000 employees participated (62% response rate) and results showed that our people feel supported to do their jobs (49% of respondents indicated they had all the support they need at this time), are adapting to the new environment and feel a sense of pride, engagement and connection to Vodafone. Linked to Vodafone\u2019s response to the crisis and our focus on employees, customers and society. We have consistently received positive feedback from our employees on our internal communications and the visibility of our leadership team during this time.\n\nAs we start looking at the post-crisis scenarios, we have defined a framework to support our markets as they plan for return from lockdown. We are focused on defining our \u201cnew normal\u201d and we will be looking to retain some of the learnings and practices we have developed and implemented during the crisis, as they can help us to accelerate the delivery of our purpose commitments and strategic goals.\nSkills and talent\nOur transformation to a technology communications company requires us to ensure we have the critical skills we need in our organisation now and for the future. Today\u2019s platforms and technologies are driving demand in AI, automation, Cloud, coding and analytics. The rapid development of these technologies requires a focus on continuous learning for employees through high-quality and curated learning journeys.\n\nOur skills-led academies provide targeted learning for employees with access to expert content which can lead to externally benchmarked \u201cnanodegrees\u201d in specific topics. Our people have completed 15,000 courses that are available. Approximately 30% of those 15,000 courses had a rating, which averaged at 4.5 out of 5. 87,000 users completed approximately 600,000 courses. We continually review the skills required in the organisation to ensure relevant learning is available both through the targeted learning journeys and for employees to undertake self-led learning.\n\nWe also continue to invest in our leaders as they are at the forefront of our digital transformation.\n\nLast year, we strengthened our leadership capabilities through the creation of three core programmes targeted at different leadership segments (405 \u2013 Leadership Essentials, 98 \u2013 Connected Leadership for E-Bands). The Leadership Essentials programme supports new line managers, whilst the Connected Leadership programme further develops their skills and further explores the Growth mind-set. Finally, the Global Agile learning path has been recently cascaded to markets to enable them to localise the content in order to ensure high impact, thereby supporting leaders in key agile roles.\n\nIn addition to our efforts to develop digital talent and skills internally, we are also actively acquiring key digital skills from the market, providing digital work opportunities at scale. In 2019, we hired 676 external digital talents in Germany, UK, Italy, Spain, Turkey and South Africa on critical roles such as digital marketing specialists, user experience/interface designers, data scientists/analysts and software developers.\n\nOur commitment to provide 100,000 digital work experience opportunities to young people aged 26 and under by 2022 has already been achieved through our digital work experience programmes, apprenticeships, intern and graduate schemes.\n\nWe have provided a total of 168,999 digital learning experiences since April 2018, with over 113,322 in the period covered by this report (see chart below).\n\nWe have also continued to expand our vocational training and apprenticeships across our business. These grant people permanent roles at Vodafone while offering support through continuous learning in order to gain a formal qualification in their chosen fields. In addition, since its launch in 2017, Vodafone\u2019s #codelikeagirl programme has continued to grow and this year has reached over 2,554 girls across 17 markets.\n\nLaunched in partnership with Code First Girls, the programme aims to tackle low female engagement in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education. Girls aged 14-18 receive an immersive one-week digital experience where they learn to code and receive basic training on computer languages and development programmes.\n\nOur Discover graduate programme, which has been running for over ten years, offers young people with a bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s degree a series of assignments across our business areas and local markets. Since its launch ten years ago, over 6,100 graduates have joined the programme, with 805 recruited this year. Our Discover programme is highly diverse; this year new entrants were recruited from 22 different countries, of which 50% were female.\n\nOur Reconnect5 Hire as of 31 March 2020 \u2013 we have hired 525 Reconnects and 433 of them are women.\n\nNote:\n5. Our Reconnect programme is designed to help people get back to work after a career break.\n\nOpportunities for young people to receive a digital learning experience at Vodafone during FY20\n\n| Opportunity                  | Number |\n|------------------------------|--------|\n| Direct hires                 | 5,950  |\n| Digital work experience      | 104,420|\n| Internships                  | 1,747  |\n| Apprenticeships              | 400    |\n| Graduates                    | 805    |\nRecognising performance\nWe strive to ensure our performance management and reward processes are aligned with our strategy and culture. We continually review these processes in the context of our Digital \u2018First\u2019 focus and constantly look for opportunities to radically simplify wherever possible.\n\nA key part of embedding our new culture is ensuring we reward our people based on their performance, potential and contribution to our values and success. During this year we reviewed the pay arrangements throughout our business to ensure they align more fully with our purpose, strategy, and Spirit. To maintain compliance with our fair pay principles and to highlight the importance of this across our business, we also benchmarked and monitored our pay practices in all of our markets and took action where necessary.\n\nOur pay practices, including retirement and other benefit provisions, are compliant with all local legislation, free from discrimination, market competitive and easily understood. We also offer competitive retirement and other benefit provisions. Global short-term incentive plans are offered to a large percentage of colleagues, and global long-term incentive plans are offered to our senior managers. Our arrangements are subject to Company and individual performance measures, looking at both \u201cwhat\u201d we do, and \u201chow\u201d we do it.\n\nEmployee experience\nWe believe that our employees\u2019 experience, their working environment, health, safety and wellbeing, is a key enabler of personal growth and business performance. This year we have continued the journey of digitalisation and simplification of the core Human Resources processes, enabled by the deployment of a global cloud-based system, SAP Success Factors.\n\nAs an employer, keeping our people safe is one of our most fundamental responsibilities. We take safety extremely seriously in our operations and aim to promote our approach across the industry by leading on safety standards, insisting on high safety practices from our employees and suppliers, and engaging with customers and peers.\n\nOur commitment to safety does not differentiate between employees, contractors and suppliers, all of whom benefit from the same focus on preventing harm, both on worksites and when working or moving between sites.\n\nAny injury is one too many, and any loss of life related to our operations is unacceptable. It is therefore with great regret that we report three recordable fatalities this year. One in Ghana, one in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and one in Lesotho (see chart below). We have undertaken thorough investigations into the causes of each fatal incident and defined actions to help prevent a recurrence of a similar incident. These investigations were overseen by the respective local market Chief Executive, who is responsible for ensuring that the causes of the incident are understood and that any corrective actions are implemented. We also share the lessons learned from each fatality across the relevant Group functions.\n\nWe track and investigate high-potential incidents (HPIs) \u2013 incidents that do not necessarily result in injury but have the potential to do significant harm. During the year, 826 HPIs were recorded, of which 752 involved employees and 74 involved suppliers\u2019 employees or contractors. Each HPI is investigated as an indicator of the potential for a more serious accident. We seek to identify the root cause and ensure suitable corrective action is taken where necessary. An investigation into an HPI is conducted at a scale proportionate to the indicative level of risk.\n\nLost-time Incidents (LTI) is the term we use when an employee is injured while carrying out a work-related task and is consequently unable to perform his or her regular duties for a complete shift or period of time after the incident. In addition, for our suppliers and contractors, we separately track performance measures.\n\nIn recent years, we have stepped up our efforts to capture and analyse all incidents of potential or actual harm to our employees. Greater compliance with mandatory rules on reporting incidents enables us to identify emerging trends in operating risks, increasing our scope to intervene and put the necessary controls in place. The total number of reported LTI incidents for 2018/19 was 64. In 2019/20, the total is at 33 for the year to date. Of the 33 incidents, 21 were attributed to slips, trips or falls in and around the workplace; four were vehicle-related; while the remaining six incidents comprised assault and manual handling injuries (see chart below).\n\n| Total recordable fatalities | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 |\n|----------------------------|------|------|------|------|\n| Suppliers\u2019 employees/contractors | 10   | 6    | 2    | 1    |\n| Members of the public      | 1    | 1    | 1    | 1    |\n\nNote: In addition there is one other road traffic fatality reported in Ghana in May 19 which is still under investigation and cannot be included in our figures until the local legal proceedings have been completed.\n\n| Lost-time incidents (employees only) | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 |\n|-------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|\n| Number of lost-time incidents       | 86   | 64   | 64   | 33   |\n| Lost-time incident rate per 1,000 employees | 0.81 | 0.62 | 0.62 | 0.37 |\n\nNote: 1 Data includes LTIs from India up until 1 September 2018.\nOur safety strategy focuses on the most significant risks for people working in operational roles:\n\n- road risk when driving for work;\n- working with electricity;\n- working at height;\n- fibre operations; and\n- the management and control of suppliers.\n\nRoad traffic incidents continue to be the primary cause of serious injuries and fatalities (73%) within Vodafone and our supply chain. Sadly these incidents have involved members of the public, which impacts the communities in which we operate. With this in mind, many of our markets conduct focused road safety initiatives and awareness campaigns to help improve the lives of our employees, customers and the communities that we operate in by partnering with local governments and road safety authorities.\n\nWe have continued to witness growing engagement in employee wellbeing, particularly around the subjects of physical, emotional and mental health.\n\nWe held our first global webinar in support of World Mental Health Day, where employees were encouraged to share their personal mental health experiences, identify cultural differences and learn from others. The event was viewed live by over 1,300 employees online and a further 300+ attending from meeting rooms in London and across the local markets. In light of the success of the event, this will become a regular feature of Vodafone\u2019s wellbeing calendar.\n\nIn addition, we designed and launched two mental health videos, one aimed at all employees while the other is specifically designed to give advice to line managers to promote the importance of raising awareness, supporting colleagues and normalising mental wellbeing. Both videos are available globally on Vodafone University.\n\nVodacom South Africa became the first local market to develop its own Mental Health at Work Policy that includes clear direction and guidance on arrangements to help prevent, intervene and support employees. They have also introduced a programme of training for employees to become Mental Health First Aiders.\n\nIn the UK, 531 employees have participated in local market mental health programmes, with 240 trained Mental Health First Aiders and 120 line managers completing a half-day awareness course, and a further 171 completing an online module through Vodafone University.\n\nFinally, we continue to run the Vodafone Global Wellbeing Challenge where we encourage all of our colleagues to get active. This year we had over 4,000 participants walking a combined 480,280,447 steps together.\n\nThroughout the year we have delivered a wide variety of new and expanded initiatives to transform our organisation, bringing the Spirit of Vodafone to life in everything we do. We are committed to continuing to fulfil our purpose and deliver our strategy in the coming year with our people firmly at the core of our business.\n\nThe use of digital technology to improve road safety\n\nTurkey has introduced artificial intelligence to analyse and consolidate 20 different telematics systems from suppliers (1,137 vehicles, which are registered to third party suppliers) into one portal, which can provide daily automated notifications which previously took four days to analyse. Initial statistics indicated a 50% decrease in the number of speeding violations in this population.\n\nOur Drive Safe App will be launched shortly, which will deliver tailored safety learning and training content for users that is easily accessible on mobile devices. The content focuses on increasing driver anticipation and reaction to road hazards, encouraging adoption of safe driving behaviours and reinforcing our Absolute Rules. Drive Safe will be freely available for all employees and suppliers globally.\nRisk management\n\nManaging uncertainty in our business\n\nOur risk management framework enables a consistent approach to the identification, management and oversight of risks. This consistency is valuable as it allows us to take a holistic approach to risk management and to make meaningful comparisons of the risks we face and how we manage them across our footprint, which is essential to achieve our strategic objectives.\n\nIdentifying our risks\n\nUsing our global risk management framework, all local markets and Group entities identify the risks that could affect their strategy and operations in order to implement risk mitigation plans. These risks are then consolidated into a Group-wide view and presented to a representative selection of our senior leaders and executives, who add their own input on strategic, functional and emerging risks. We then define which emerging risks warrant being added to our risk watchlist and monitored for their impact on the organisation.\n\nFurthermore, we evaluate the completeness of our risk landscape by benchmarking against comparable companies in our peer group. After final consolidation, the proposed principal risks and risk watchlist are reviewed and approved by our Executive Committee (ExCo) before being submitted to the Audit and Risk Committee and the Board.\n\nManaging our risks\n\nEach principal risk is assigned an executive owner who is accountable for setting the target tolerance level. The executive owner is responsible for confirming adequate controls are in place and that the necessary action plans are implemented to bring the risk profile within an acceptable tolerance. To provide adequate oversight, we report throughout the year on principal and emerging risks, and hold in-depth reviews of all principal risks at different oversight committees. Figure 1 presents an overview of our process and governance structures, including the Audit and Risk Committee and Board.\n\nWe develop severe but plausible scenarios for all risks. These scenarios not only provide insights into possible threats and points of failure, allowing us to react and adjust our strategy accordingly, but are also used for the purpose of assessing our viability (page 71).\n\nFigure 1: Overview of governance structure\n\n| Board/Audit and Risk Committee | Provides oversight for the Vodafone Group |\n|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Risk and Compliance Committee (sub-committee of ExCo) | Reviews principal and emerging risks |\n| | Reviews effectiveness of risk management across the Group |\n| Group Risk Team | Responsible for the application and maintenance of the Group risk management framework |\n| | Supports the Board/ExCo by creating programmes to strengthen our risk culture |\n| Group Risk Owners | ExCo risk owners have responsibility for management of the risk assigned to them |\n| | Senior executive risk champions identify and implement mitigating action |\n\nLocal Oversight Committees\n\nProvide oversight for the local risk management programme\n\nLocal market CEOs\n\nSet local objectives, identify priority risks and ensure tolerance alignment with the Vodafone Group guidance\n\nLocal Risk Owners\n\nSenior managers in local management teams responsible for local risks and the local risk programme to manage, measure, monitor and report on the risks\n\nLocal Risk Managers\n\nContact point for each market/entity on risk, facilitate all activities as defined by the Group risk management framework\n\nInternal Audit\n\nProvide assurance on the effectiveness of the risk management framework and mitigating risk controls\nStrengthening our framework\n\nOver the course of the year, we have:\n\n- Further enhanced and driven adoption of our global risk tool, allowing us to have a single source of risk and assurance data;\n- Continued to develop the link between risk and budgeting to inform the capital allocation reviews in a timely manner;\n- Implemented a process for tracking action plans to manage our principal risks; and\n- Continued with our engagement programme to develop our global risk community.\n\nKey improvement projects underway consist of:\n\n- Enhancing our approach to assessing the impact of emerging risks by evaluating long-term scenarios;\n- Improving the way we collect and treat early signals in the internal and external environment by embedding the use of risk indicators;\n- Continuing to align with TCFD by assessing the impact of the climate-related risks and opportunities to meet future requirements; and\n- Further enhancing our risk processes reflecting lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic to be better prepared in the future.\n\nOur principal risks\n\nWe categorised our risks into four different areas to provide the appropriate level of governance and oversight to effectively manage these risks.\n\n| Strategic | Financial | Technological | Operational |\n|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------------|\n| The influence of stakeholders and industry players on our business and our response to them: | Our financial status, standing and continued growth: | The network and IT systems that support our business and the data they hold: | The ability to achieve our optimal business model: |\n| A Adverse political and regulatory measures | E Global economic disruption | F Cyber threat and information security | H Digital transformation |\n| Political pressures and new regulatory measures impact our strategy or profitability | Disruption caused by global external events, such as pandemics, that impacts our financial performance | External or internal attack resulting in service unavailability or data breach | Failure to deliver business and IT transformation targets in a timely and efficient manner |\n| B Geo-political risk in the supply chain | | G Technology failure | I Strategic transformation |\n| Global trade wars and security concerns impact our supply chain | Failure of critical services and applications causing service disruption | | Failure to deliver expected business value from our existing portfolio, and new acquired assets, or joint ventures |\n| C Market disruption | | | J Legal and regulatory compliance |\n| New telecom operators entering the market/price wars reduce margins | | | Non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations |\n| D Disintermediation | | | |\n| Loss of customer relevance to the big technology players through emerging technology | | | |\n\nFigure 2: Our principal risks and interdependencies\n\nWe continue to consider risks both individually and collectively in order to fully understand our risk landscape. By analysing the correlation between risks, we can identify those that have the potential to cause, impact, or increase another risk and that these are weighted appropriately. This exercise informs our scenario analysis, particularly the combined scenario used in the Long-Term Viability Statement (page 71).\n\nWe have considered COVID-19 (a key element of risk E \u2013 global economic disruption) which could lead to a long-term global recession and other operating constraints that may have a knock-on effect on several of our principal risks.\n\nAdditionally, we added health pandemic to our watchlist risks, as we seek to learn from the current crisis so that we are better prepared in the future.\n## Global economic disruption\n\n**What is the risk:**\nAny major economic disruption could result in reduced demand for our services and lower spending power for our consumers, affecting our profitability and cash flow generation. Economic disruption can also impact financial markets, including currencies, interest rates, borrowing costs and the availability of debt financing.\n\n**How we manage it:**\nWe have a long average life of debt which minimises re-financing requirements, and the vast majority of our interests costs are fixed. We maintain sufficient liquidity resources so that we can cope for a prolonged period of time without accessing the capital markets.\n\n**Risk owner:**\nMargherita Della Valle\n\n## Cyber threat and information security\n\n**What is the risk:**\nAn external cyber-attack, insider threat or supplier breach could cause service interruption or the loss of confidential data. Cyber threats could lead to major customer, financial, reputational and regulatory impacts across all of our local markets.\n\n**How we manage it:**\nWe protect Vodafone and our customers from cyber threats by continuing to strengthen global and local security controls.\n\n**Risk owner:**\nJohan Wibergh\n\n## Geo-political risk in supply chain\n\n**What is the risk:**\nWe operate and develop sophisticated infrastructure in the countries in which we are present. Our network and systems are dependent on a wide range of suppliers internationally. If there was a disruption to the supply chain, we might be unable to execute our plans and we, the industry, would face potential delays to network improvements and increased costs.\n\n**How we manage it:**\nWe are closely monitoring the political situation around our key suppliers. We are also engaging with governments, experts and suppliers to remain fully informed so that we can respond accordingly and comply with the latest regulations, economic sanctions and trade rulings.\n\n**Risk owner:**\nJoakim Reiter\n\n## Adverse political and regulatory measures\n\n**What is the risk:**\nOperating across many markets and jurisdictions means we deal with a variety of complex political and regulatory landscapes. In all of these environments, we can face changes in taxation, political intervention and potential competitive disadvantage. This also includes our participation in spectrum auctions.\n\n**How we manage it:**\nWe address issues openly with policy makers and regulatory authorities to find mutually acceptable ways forward.\n\n**Risk owners:**\nJoakim Reiter and Margherita Della Valle\n\n## Technology failure\n\n**What is the risk:**\nMajor incidents caused by natural disasters, deliberate attacks or an extreme technology failure, although rare, could result in the complete loss of key sites in either our data centres or our mobile/fixed networks causing a major disruption to our service.\n\n**How we manage it:**\nUnique recovery targets are set for essential assets to limit the impact of service outages. A global policy supports these targets with requisite controls to provide effective resilience.\n\n**Risk owner:**\nJohan Wibergh\n| Year-on-year risk movement: | Risk category: |\n|---------------------------|---------------|\n| Increased                 | Financial     |\n\n**Our target tolerance:**\nWe need to take a conservative approach to managing financial risks.\n\n**Scenario:**\nA severe contraction in economic activity leads to lower cash flow generation for the Group and disruption in global financial markets impacts our ability to refinance debt obligations as they fall due.\n\n**Emerging threats:**\nBecause this is an externally driven risk, the threat environment is continually changing. External factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic are currently creating a severe contraction in economic activity across all our markets. The financial markets are currently experiencing high levels of volatility and the availability and cost of financing may change significantly.\n\n| Year-on-year risk movement: | Risk category: |\n|---------------------------|---------------|\n| Stable                    | Technological |\n\n**Our target tolerance:**\nOur risk tolerance is to avoid a material cyber breach, loss of data or reputational impact. Security underpins our commitment to protecting our customers with reliable connections and keeping their data safe.\n\n**Scenario:**\nScenarios could include attacks on individual markets, parts of our network or large-scale intrusions spanning multiple markets. Each year we model a different severe but plausible scenario.\n\n**Emerging threats:**\nCyber risk is constantly evolving in line with technological advances and geo-political developments. We anticipate threats will continue from existing sources, but also evolve in areas such as IoT, supply chain, quantum computing and the use of AI and machine learning.\n\n| Year-on-year risk movement: | Risk category: |\n|---------------------------|---------------|\n| Stable                    | Strategic     |\n\n**Our target tolerance:**\nWe have a diverse range of supplier relationships and we manage these closely with our procurement specialists. We have a multi-vendor strategy in place across our markets to mitigate against supply chain disruption.\n\n**Scenario:**\nThere is disruption to our supply chain due to unilateral decisions affecting vendor-choices or decisions that affect trade and supply chains.\n\n**Emerging threats:**\nWe operate in a global environment where political landscape changes could have an effect on our operations.\n\n| Year-on-year risk movement: | Risk category: |\n|---------------------------|---------------|\n| Stable                    | Strategic     |\n\n**Our target tolerance:**\nWe aim to have strategies that are based on common objectives with political, policy and regulatory stakeholders so as to reduce the risk that our business will be undermined by unpredictable and disproportionate political and regulatory environments and interventions.\n\n**Scenario:**\nExposure to additional liabilities by regulatory authorities or if tax laws were to adversely change in the markets in which we operate.\n\n**Emerging threats:**\nThere is a risk that regulation will become more diverse (and therefore more difficult to manage) as different countries, and a variety of regulators within countries, introduce new regulations for emerging technology such as AI, IoT and net neutrality.\n\n| Year-on-year risk movement: | Risk category: |\n|---------------------------|---------------|\n| Stable                    | Technological |\n\n**Our target tolerance:**\nOur customer promise is based on reliable availability of our network, therefore the recovery of key mobile, fixed and IT services must be fast and robust.\n\n**Scenario:**\nThe loss of critical assets in our networks or IT infrastructure causing a service disruptions impacting our ability to provide service to our customers.\n\n**Emerging threats:**\nWe could be impacted by an increase in extreme weather events caused by climate change which may increase the likelihood of a technology failure. New assets inherited from acquired businesses may not be aligned to our target resilience level which may increase the likelihood of a technology failure.\n## Strategic transformation\n\n**What is the risk:**\nWe are undertaking a large-scale integration of new assets across multiple markets. If we do not complete this in a timely and efficient manner, we would not see the full benefit of planned synergies and could face additional costs or delays to completion. The successful integration also requires that an important number of technology platforms/services are migrated on time before the termination of the transitional services agreements.\n\nWe also have a number of joint ventures in operation and must ensure that these operate effectively.\n\n**How we manage it:**\nIntegration specialists and local teams are implementing the many projects and activities that constitute the integration plan.\n\nWe have robust governance in place to manage our joint ventures effectively.\n\n---\n\n## Market disruption\n\n**What is the risk:**\nNew entrants with lean models could create pricing pressure. As more competitors launch unlimited bundles there could be price erosion. Our market position and revenues could be damaged by failing to provide the services that our customers want.\n\n**How we manage it:**\nWe closely monitor the competitive environment in all markets, and react appropriately.\n\n---\n\n## Digital transformation\n\n**What is the risk:**\nFailure in digital or IT transformation projects could result in loss business, a poorer customer experience and reputational damage.\n\n**How we manage it:**\nWe track individual programmes against our clearly defined objectives and target KPIs throughout the lifecycle of our projects. The aim is to identify new threats then manage and mitigate them.\n\n---\n\n## Disintermediation\n\n**What is the risk:**\nWe face increased competition from a variety of new technology platforms which aim to build alternative communication services or different touch points, which could potentially affect our customer relationships. We must be able to keep pace with these new developments and competitors while maintaining high levels of customer engagement and an excellent customer experience.\n\n**How we manage it:**\nWe continually strive to introduce innovative propositions and services while evolving our customer experience to deepen the relationship with our customers. Our strategy focuses on simplifying our offer portfolios and accelerating our digital transformation, for a better customer experience.\n\n---\n\n## Legal and regulatory compliance\n\n**What is the risk:**\nVodafone must comply with a multitude of local and international laws and applicable industry regulations. These include privacy, anti-money laundering, competition, anti-bribery and economic sanctions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to reputational damage, financial penalties and/or suspension of our licence to operate.\n\n**How we manage it:**\nWe have subject matter experts in legal teams and a robust policy compliance framework. We train our employees in \u201cDoing what\u2019s right\u201d. These training and awareness programmes set out our ethical culture across the organisation and assist employees to understand their role in ensuring compliance.\n| Year-on-year risk movement: | Risk category: |\n|---------------------------|---------------|\n| Increase                  | Operational   |\n| **Our target tolerance:** |               |\n| Since strategic transformation is critical to our future, our tolerance for this risk is low. |               |\n| **Scenario:**             |               |\n| Delay in the integration of a major acquisition means we cannot realise the benefits as quickly as planned. |               |\n| **Emerging threats:**     |               |\n| As we increase the pace at which we transform our business there is an emerging risk that unless managed carefully different transformation initiatives could negatively impact each other. |               |\n\n| Year-on-year risk movement: | Risk category: |\n|---------------------------|---------------|\n| Decreased                 | Strategic     |\n| **Our target tolerance:** |               |\n| We aim to continue to be competitive in our markets. We are evolving our offers and adopting agile commercial models to mitigate competitive risks using simple, targeted offers, smart pricing models and differentiated customer experience. |               |\n| **Scenario:**             |               |\n| Aggressive pricing, accelerated MVNO losses and disruptive new market entrants in key European markets result in greater customer churn and pricing pressures impacting our financial position. |               |\n| **Emerging threats:**     |               |\n| Because this is an externally driven risk, the threat environment is continually changing. |               |\n\n| Year-on-year risk movement: | Risk category: |\n|---------------------------|---------------|\n| Decrease                  | Operational   |\n| **Our target tolerance:** |               |\n| We need to deliver these transformations programmes with the correct mix of efficient systems, relevant skills and digital expertise in alignment with the original planned spend and business benefits. |               |\n| **Scenario:**             |               |\n| Failure to deliver business benefits causes cost escalation, budget overruns and increased customer churn which could negatively impact our financial performance. |               |\n| **Emerging threats:**     |               |\n| The digital transformation strategy considers emerging threats and factors. |               |\n\n| Year-on-year risk movement: | Risk category: |\n|---------------------------|---------------|\n| Stable                    | Strategic     |\n| **Our target tolerance:** |               |\n| We offer a superior customer experience and continually improve our offering through a wide set of innovative products and services. We also develop innovative new products and explore new growth areas such as 5G, IoT, convergence, digital services and security so that we continue to meet our customers\u2019 needs. |               |\n| **Scenario:**             |               |\n| Emerging technology impacts our market share. |               |\n| **Emerging threats:**     |               |\n| Emerging risks include the development of new connectivity systems that compete with our networks. |               |\n\n| Year-on-year risk movement: | Risk category: |\n|---------------------------|---------------|\n| Stable                    | Operational   |\n| **Our target tolerance:** |               |\n| We seek to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in all of our markets. |               |\n| **Scenario:**             |               |\n| Breaches of legal compliance could lead to reputational damage, investigation costs and fines. |               |\n| **Emerging threats:**     |               |\n| Changing workplace dynamics, digital transformation, asset integrations and a change in our employee demographics might degrade our control environment so we are updating our Code of Conduct and various policies to mitigate this. |               |\nRisk management (continued)\n\nKey changes to our principal risks\n\nThe global economic disruption risk increased as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nWe have renamed the successful integration of new assets and management of joint ventures risk to strategic transformation, which now addresses not only the integration of acquisitions but also changes occurring from the separation of our tower portfolio and other types of strategic transformation initiatives.\n\nMarket disruption risk has decreased when compared to our other principal risks as some of our key markets have adapted and responded positively to competitor activities.\n\nThe digital transformation risk has decreased as a result of the progress we made on our digital journey and the IT transformation programme.\n\nRisk watchlist\n\nWe face a number of uncertainties where an emerging risk may potentially impact us in the longer term. In some cases, there may be insufficient information to understand the likely scale, impact or velocity of the risk. We also might not be able to fully define a mitigation plan until we have a better understanding of the threat. We have created a watchlist of these emerging risks which we review on a regular basis.\n\nWe regularly provide our Audit and Risk Committee with a list of risks on our watchlist such that future strategies take into account future technological, environmental, regulatory or political changes.\n\nSome examples of these risks are:\n\nEMF\n\nThe risk can be broken down into three areas:\n\n- failure to comply with national legislation or international guidelines (set by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (\u2018ICNIRP\u2019)) as it applies to EMF, or failure to meet policy requirements;\n- the risk arising from concerted campaigns or negative community sentiment towards location or installation of radio base stations, resulting in planning delays; and\n- changes in the radio technology we use or the body of credible scientific evidence which may impact either of the two risks above.\n\nWe have an established governance for EMF risk management (a Group leadership team that reports to the Board, and a network of EMF leaders across all markets), as well as an EMF taskgroup which was set up in FY20, that focus on assessing and reporting on the impact of 5G on EMF. The taskgroup scope included quantifying the impact of EMF restrictions in those markets with limits that do not align with international, science-based guidelines; coordinate engagement with policy makers relating to 5G and EMF; and assess the impact of social media campaigns on public concern.\n\nVodafone continues to advocate for national EMF regulations to be harmonised with international guidelines. In March 2020, the ICNIRP updated their guidelines (first published 1998) following a review of published science.\n\nICNIRP confirmed that there are no adverse effects on human health from 5G frequencies if exposure is within their guidelines. We have worked in partnership with the GSMA and national trade associations to provide information on these new guidelines to regulators, health agencies and Government ministries. Additionally, we have updated national regulators about how our advanced technologies for 5G services are compliant with regulations. Vodafone always operates its mobile networks strictly within national regulations, which are typically based on, or go beyond, ICNIRP\u2019s guidelines, and we regularly monitor our operations in each country to ensure we meet those regulations.\n\nWe have established a European tower company that is required to comply with the Group\u2019s Radio Frequency Safety Policy (which meets international standards) and local regulations.\n\nBrexit\n\nThe Board continues to monitor the implications for Vodafone\u2019s operations in light of the new trading relationship between the UK and the EU, which has yet to be negotiated.\n\nA cross-functional steering committee has identified the impact of the UK and EU failing to reach a free trade agreement on the Group\u2019s operations and has produced a comprehensive mitigation plan.\n\nAlthough our headquarters are in the UK, a large majority of our customers are in other countries, accounting for most of our revenue and cash flow. Each of our operating companies operates as a stand-alone business, incorporated and licensed in the jurisdiction in which it operates, and able to adapt to a wide range of local developments. As such, our ability to provide services to our customers in the countries in which we operate, inside or outside the EU, is unlikely to be affected by the lack of a free trade deal. We are not a major international trading company, and do not use passporting for any of our major services or processes.\n\nThe lack of an agreed free trade deal between the UK and EU could lead to a fall in consumer and business confidence. Such a fall in confidence could, in turn, reduce consumer and business spend on our products and services.\nClimate-related disclosures\n\nWe recognise that climate change poses a number of physical risks (i.e. caused by the increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events) and transition-related risks (i.e. economic, technology or regulatory challenges related to moving to a greener economy) for our business. We are currently aligning internal processes with the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) after the initial independent gap analysis we reported in 2019. We have summarised our progress to date in this section and aim to be fully aligned by 2022.\n\nManaging climate risk\n\nAs a result of the growing understanding of the impacts of climate change on our business, this was added as a risk to our watchlist in 2019, recognising its evolving nature. The Group External Affairs Director, a member of the Group Executive Committee, heads the Planet agenda as part of our purpose-led strategy (pages 16 to 19) and has overall accountability for climate change, which includes providing updates to the Board on our progress towards our climate-related goals. Furthermore, as part of our sustainable business strategy (page 40), we monitor climate-related metrics and develop plans to address specific risks and opportunities. An example of this is our ambition to halve our environmental impact by 2025 which includes a commitment to set science-based carbon targets aligned to the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to keep global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees (page 46).\n\nSubject to shareholder approval of our Remuneration Policy at the 2020 AGM, our ESG priorities will be embedded in our executive remuneration arrangements via a specific measure under our long-term incentive plan. For the 2021 financial year\u2019s award, this measure will include a specific GHG reduction ambition \u2013 more details of which can be found in our Directors\u2019 Remuneration Report on pages 96 to 120.\n\nMaterial risks and opportunities\n\nThe process to assess the materiality of climate-related risks and opportunities follows industry and sectoral relevant benchmark data and takes into consideration our principal risks (page 63). Based on our initial assessment, the principal risks most influenced by climate change are \u201cadverse political and regulatory measures\u201d and \u201ctechnology failures\u201d.\n\nKey risk and opportunity areas arising from the assessment are:\n\n- Growing external pressures and demands for action negatively impact revenues from those companies late to react and trigger an increase in taxation and energy prices.\n- Global focus on energy efficiency increases the likelihood of new regulation impacting energy intensive assets, however it carries an opportunity with the application of new technologies.\n- Increase in temperature and frequency of extreme weather events (e.g. heat waves, storms) leads to higher energy consumption for cooling and affects the quality of radio frequency and wireless transmission, in addition to damaging equipment and harming people\u2019s wellbeing.\n\nAt Vodafone, we believe our approach to business resilience will mitigate the short to medium-term physical impacts of climate change, and we will continue to monitor longer-term trends. Our priority, however, is to prepare ourselves to face the challenges and seize the opportunities posed by the move to a lower carbon economy and the policy changes required to achieve it, for instance, by growing our IoT connectivity platform and products to enable our customers to reduce their carbon footprint.\n\nClimate scenario analysis\n\nWe adopted three scenarios in line with the Bank of England\u2019s reference climate scenarios \u2013 see figure below \u2013 as outlined in their consultation document released in December 2019. We will conduct the required assessments to quantify the business impacts of all material climate-related risks under each scenario and over different time horizons to better understand the financial value at risk.\n\nThe outputs of the scenario analysis will assist us in either adjusting existing policies or developing new ones, especially looking at opportunities to improve our business resilience and continuity. It will also inform the assessment of our long-term viability and allow us to validate the priority areas of focus set in our Planet pillar. The overall aim is to provide the Board with reasonable assurance of the sustainability of our business in meeting the challenges of an ever-changing global economy.\n\nMetrics and targets\n\nWe have been measuring and reporting on energy and carbon emissions since 2001. Our latest emissions footprint can be found on page 2. In addition, we have set a number of 2025 targets to manage climate-related risks and reduce our impact on the environment, such as to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 50% and to purchase 100% renewable electricity. Related data can be found in the sustainable business section pages 40 to 51.\nCOVID-19\nSince January 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought significant disruption to our staff, suppliers and customers. It is likely to change the global economic, social, political and business landscape for the foreseeable future.\n\nIn order to adapt to a new external context, we undertook a review of the impacts of the pandemic on our principal risks to identify new opportunities that may arise or risks which may change materially.\n\nWe are taking a three phase approach to help us to adapt to the changing environment. We have a good foundation with our five-point plan (see pages 54 and 55) and strong delivery against this across our markets.\n\nPhase 1: Immediate crisis management\nWe initiated our response to this crisis drawing on existing pandemic response plans. The objective at this stage was to prioritise the health, safety and wellbeing our workforce and the immediate needs of our customers and governments.\n\nDuring the early stages of the crisis we ensured our critical infrastructure, resources and activities were organised so as to provide continuity of our operations and to enable us to implement our five-point plan.\n\nPhase 2: Recovery\nWe expected to play an instrumental role in the speed of recovery.\n\nOur focus will be on the acceleration of digitisation that we have already seen in the first phase, to help all businesses, but especially SMEs, recover quickly and to enable government sectors to become more resilient. Investment in 5G and continued improvement of networks will create jobs and provide a launchpad for other sectors to recover more quickly during the economic crisis. We will also continue to protect the vulnerable through measures to improve digital skills and drive digital inclusion.\n\nPhase 3: The new normal\nOur hope is that phase two supports a more positive trajectory for the industry as a whole as we transition towards a \u201cnew normal\u201d.\n\nIn this phase, if the first two phases are successful and subject to the unknown changes that COVID-19 may have brought to societies more generally, we will aim to emerge as trusted partners of our customers and governments. Strong and resilient communications infrastructure is clearly essential for a resilient society. This is dependent on a sustainable market structure and fair regulatory framework.\n\nScenario analysis and impact assessment\nWe evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across all our principal risks to support sustainability of our operations. Information was collected through interviews with risk owners and champions and subject matter experts and input from our local market colleagues.\n\nWe adopted two scenarios for our assessment: a short to medium-term impact leading to an economic slowdown and, a longer-term global recession with impacts likely beyond 2020. We focused on the latter, more extreme case, as the basis for our stress testing.\n\nThe review concluded that a significant number of our principal risks would be adversely affected if this pandemic was reoccurring and resulted in continued lockdown measures with a subsequent deep global recession. For these affected risks we have developed short-term responses and long-term strategic actions to minimise the impact on our business.\n\nWe identified the following areas as the ones with the most impact on our principal risks:\n\n- The health, safety and wellbeing of our employees is vital for us, therefore we reacted quickly to take relevant actions such as implementing a global restriction for travel, restricting attendance/organisation of large events, and increasing smart-working at scale.\n- To support our employees better in these unprecedented times and to enable remote working, we also introduced various digital content and online learning materials to support our line managers and employees, initiated a pulse survey to monitor closely employee wellbeing and engagement, and virtualised most of our recruitment and onboarding processes (see page 58).\n- Delays across the supply chain are caused by the disruptions in availability of people, goods, services and equipment. This is expected to persist and be further compounded by the global economic disruption which may negatively affect the financial stability of critical suppliers. We reviewed the risks associated with our critical suppliers and service providers and identified if we have sufficient stock levels in our warehouses to address scheduled replacement and maintenance of our equipment.\n- We anticipate a continued increase in volume and scale of financially motivated cyber attacks using phishing, malware and denial of service. Criminals and other sophisticated threat actors are using the crisis as cover to expand or continue their actions against all sectors, include Vodafone and our customers. We have heightened our security monitoring and response. We track external threats working with governments, law enforcement and industry specialists.\n\nFinally, we have performed additional financial stress testing and liquidity impact analysis in order to reflect the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic in the assessment of the Group\u2019s long-term viability, as set out on page 71.\n\nNext steps\nWith the COVID-19 crisis evolving, we remain in close contact with our local health authorities, governmental agencies and other key stakeholders in all our geographies, so that we can react and adapt to any changes in circumstances and minimise the risk to Vodafone and our customers, employees and other stakeholders.\n\nThere are a number of ongoing business reviews at both Group and local market level to evaluate different courses of action in response to the crisis.\n\nLooking ahead, we will review the lessons learned during this crisis as part of future updates to our risk management framework, specifically when it comes to our approach to prepare for similar types of events.\nLong-Term Viability Statement (\u2018LTVS\u2019)\n\nThe preparation of the LTVS includes an assessment of the Group\u2019s long-term prospects in addition to an assessment of the ability to meet future commitments and liabilities as they fall due over the three year review period.\n\nAssessment of viability\n\nVodafone continues to adopt a three year period to assess the Group\u2019s viability, a period in which we believe our principal risks tend to develop, in what is a dynamic industry sector. This time horizon is also in line with the structure of long-term management incentives and the outputs from the long range business planning cycle.\n\nFor 2020, as a result of the increased pressures on the global financial markets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted additional financial stress testing and sensitivity analysis, considering revenues at risk as well as the impact of our response plan to the crisis.\n\nThe assessment of viability started with the available headroom as of 31 March 2020 and considered the plans and projections prepared as part of the forecasting cycle, which include the Group\u2019s cash flows, planned commitments, required funding and other key financial ratios. We also assumed that debt refinancing will remain available in all plausible market conditions.\n\nFinally, we estimated the impact of severe but plausible scenarios for all our principal risks on the three year plan and, in addition, stress tested a combined scenario taking into account the risk interdependencies as defined on the diagram on page 63, where the following risks were modelled as materialising in parallel over the three year period:\n\n- **Global economic disruption**: Global events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, put pressure on our financial performance and liquidity.\n- **Cyber threat and information security**: An external cyber-attack exploits vulnerabilities and leads to a GDPR fine.\n- **Geo-political risk in supply chain**: Increase in trade wars leads to decisions that may affect our supply chain and restricts our ability to use critical suppliers.\n\nAdverse political and regulatory measures: Governments in financial struggle look to other sources to raise revenues, such as spectrum auctions.\n\nAssessment of long-term prospects\n\nEach year the Board conducts a strategy session, reviewing the internal and external environment as well as significant threats and opportunities to the sustainable creation of long-term shareholder value (note that known emerging threats related to each principal risk are described in pages 8 and 9).\n\nAs an input to the strategy discussion, the Board considers the principal risks that are longer term in nature (including adverse political and regulatory measures, market disruption and disintermediation), with the focus on identifying underlying opportunities and setting the Group\u2019s future strategy. The output from this session is reflected in the strategic section of the Annual Report (pages 20 to 25), which provides a view of the Group\u2019s long-term prospects.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe Board assessed the prospects and viability of the Group in accordance with provision 31 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, considering the Group\u2019s strategy and business model, and the principal risks to the Group\u2019s future performance, solvency, liquidity and reputation. The assessment takes into account possible mitigating actions available to management where any risk or combination of risks materialise.\n\nTotal cash and cash equivalents available of \u00a313.3 billion (page 188) as of 31 March 2020, along with options available to reduce cash outgoings over the period considered, provide the Group with sufficient positive headroom in all scenarios tested. Reverse stress testing on revenue and EBITDA over the review period confirmed that the Group has sufficient headroom available to face uncertainty. The Board deemed the stress test conducted to be adequate and therefore confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will remain in operation and be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due up to 31 March 2023.\nChairman\u2019s governance statement\n\nWe are committed to creating value for our stakeholders and contributing to wider society through corporate governance excellence\n\nI am pleased to present, on behalf of the Board, the Corporate Governance Report for the year ended 31 March 2020.\n\nThe Board is committed to delivering strong corporate governance for our shareholders, employees, suppliers, partners and customers, especially during these times of uncertainty and instability presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. For this reason, we take seriously our commitment to maintaining the highest levels of corporate governance to support the creation of long-term sustainable value for the benefit of all our stakeholders. This report illustrates how we have achieved this over the past year and sets out our plans for the coming year.\n\nHighlights of the year\n\nWe\u2019ve not stood still for a moment this past year. Having strengthened with recent appointments our telecoms industry expertise, we are confident that around the Board table we have all the skills, experience and diversity that the Company needs. We have welcomed a new Non-Executive Director, David Thodey, while undertaking a robust and successful process to find my successor. Board representatives have engaged with our principal investors to understand their views on, amongst other areas, Board composition and executive remuneration. As a result, we believe a balanced, long-term incentive-based Remuneration Policy is being recommended to shareholders. Details of David\u2019s induction, the process undertaken to identify my successor and my successor\u2019s biography can be found on pages 77 and 88 and the revised Remuneration Policy on pages 102 to 107.\n\nWe have also enjoyed a year of constructive engagement with our new auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, and you can read more on how we have reviewed and tested our internal control framework on pages 94 and 95 and challenged our understanding of our principal risks on pages 63 to 68.\n\nExecuting our strategy at pace\n\nThis year has been a key period in the transformation of Vodafone as we deliver on our strategy at pace. We\u2019ve made great headway in driving cost and capital efficiencies and continue to implement our plans to enhance our performance and support future cash flows. A strong Board is needed to navigate this fast-changing environment and maintain resilience, receiving tailored training and timely information, as well as taking time to consider stakeholder interests and relevant risk factors. This has been especially important given the economic uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, and your Board has worked closely with the Executive Committee to ensure that we continue to make good progress on our strategic priorities whilst we respond to the changing needs of our stakeholders, delivering value to our customers and protecting the health, safety and wellbeing of our people.\n\nCulture\n\nThe Spirit of Vodafone was launched on 10 December, to transform how we work and what we achieve together as we move forward to becoming a leading technology communications company. Our Spirit pillars are explored in full on page 56, and a summary of the Board\u2019s input into the design and launch of the Spirit is provided on page 81.\n\nNick Read, Leanne Wood and the rest of the Executive Committee have injected huge energy into this launch, engaging with our employees in face-to-face meetings and global digital forums to have honest discussions about what the Spirit really means to us all. The Board receives detailed updates on the Spirit from Nick and has the opportunity to discuss progress and highlight areas of strength and development.\n\nSustainable growth\n\nWe have worked hard for a number of years to support a robust dividend policy and the Board and I were disappointed that we needed to make the tough decision, in the face of external challenges, to cut the 2019 final dividend to our valued shareholders by 40%. It was not a choice taken lightly by the Board, however it was the right decision to ensure we maintain sufficient financial headroom to support the sustainable growth of our business for the long-term benefit of all our stakeholders. I would like to take this opportunity to express the Board\u2019s collective desire to maintain a progressive dividend policy going forward, which we started with the declaration of a 4.50 eurocents per share interim dividend and the recommendation of a 4.50 eurocents per share final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2020, providing a total dividend for the year of 9.00 eurocents per share.\n\nCorporate governance\n\nI am pleased to announce that we are able to confirm compliance in full with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (\u2018the Code\u2019) throughout the year. Your Board has been taking time to understand the views of our most valued stakeholder groups and is confident in presenting a statement on how various stakeholder interests have been taken into account in decision-making at the Board, which can be found on pages 82 and 83. A summary of how we have complied with the Code during the year is presented on page 73 and details can be found in this Governance Report and the Strategic Report.\n\nDemonstrating the strength of our commitment to our purpose pillars, long-term value creation and the sustainability priorities of our stakeholders, in November we held a Meet the Board day. At this event, members of the Board and senior management met with investors to discuss key topics. Further details can be found on page 82.\nDiversity is an important consideration for the Board and its Nominations and Governance Committee when assessing the composition and effective functioning of the Board. The Board also takes responsibility for the oversight and monitoring of diversity within the senior management team and wider workforce.\n\nAn internal Board evaluation was undertaken this year with the assistance of Lintstock. Excellent progress has been made against the actions set for 2020 consequent to the 2019 external evaluation. It is very encouraging for me to personally observe and hear reported that the Directors consider the Board to be operating effectively, with improved engagement in Board meetings with senior managers on specialist topics.\n\nSuccession planning\nAt the date of publication, I have served as Chairman for nine years. At the request of the Board, I will continue to serve as Chairman for a limited period of time to provide a period of handover to my successor, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois van Boxmeer. This will be important to maintain stability and continuity as we execute our strategy during the current period of global economic uncertainty.\n\nMy fellow Director, Renee James, has served more than nine years as a Director. In order to have a more gradual refreshment of the Board and maintain a good level of average annual tenure we propose to extend Renee\u2019s tenure by one more year. Following evaluation, she is still considered independent.\n\nEmployee engagement\nThese events afforded an opportunity for the Directors to meet with the workforce and receive their views on our new policy for workforce engagement, how our strategy is being executed, emerging commercial opportunities and the risks encountered by our businesses.\n\nDuring the year, 18 senior managers were invited to present to the Board on various subjects, including digital, culture, business development, risk, Vodafone Foundation, internal controls and viability. Valerie Gooding has been leading on employee engagement and attended forums in Europe and South Africa to capture the views of our workforce and report them to the Board. Furthermore, David Nish attended our Global Risk and Compliance Forum where he met colleagues from a variety of our local markets who are responsible for managing the internal controls and monitoring systems across Vodafone. The Board also had the pleasure of meeting employees at Vodafone UK and Vodafone Spain during Board visits to those markets.\n\nUnderstanding and managing our emerging risks\nThere have been a number of developments in the year which have introduced new items to the Board\u2019s agenda. Examples include the export restrictions imposed by the US and the COVID-19 pandemic. As these developments have an impact on our business and stakeholders, it has been crucial for the Board to maintain oversight, receive regular updates and dedicate time to understanding and discussing these risks as they evolve, so we can plan ahead and take appropriate action.\n\nWith all this in mind, I invite you to explore in more detail how the Board is understanding its capability and effectiveness, engaging in understanding the business and our stakeholders, and dedicating time to reflection and development.\n\nGerard Kleisterlee\nChairman\n28 May 2020\n\nCompliance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (the \u2018Code\u2019)\nIn respect of the year ended 31 March 2020 Vodafone Group Plc was subject to the Code (available from www.frc.org.uk).

The Board also oversees the implementation of appropriate risk assessment systems and processes to identify, manage and mitigate Vodafone\u2019s principal risks.

Together, these set out what we do and how we do it. The Spirit is explained further on page 56 and our Code of Conduct can be found on our website vodafone.com.\n\nThe Board has a critical role in setting the tone of our organisation and championing the behaviours we expect to see. The Spirit launched in December and regular discussions within and across Vodafone have been encouraged to galvanise our culture with our purpose and Strategy. The cultural climate in Vodafone is measured through a number of mechanisms including policy and compliance processes, internal audit, and formal and informal channels for employees to raise concerns including our annual people survey and Speak Up, our whistleblowing programme. Speak Up is also available to the contractors and suppliers working with us. The Board is appraised of any material whistleblowing incidents.

It carefully considered the approval of the interim dividend and its recommendation for the final dividend, taking into account our capital allocation priorities to support investment in critical infrastructure, reduce leverage towards the lower end of our target range, and maintain returns to shareholders.\n\nUS bonds\nAs part of its oversight of our business\u2019 long-term funding requirements, the Board receives annual updates on activity related to our two bond programmes; the US shelf programme listed on NASDAQ and the EMTN programme listed in both London and Dublin, to ensure cost efficient and dependable financial resources are available to the business.\n\nRisk and controls\nTo ensure a framework of prudent and effective controls is in place\n\nSystem of internal control\nDetails of the operation of our internal risk and compliance processes informed the Board\u2019s discussions on culture and operational matters.\n\nRisk tolerance and risk management\nThe Board reviewed management\u2019s identification and assessment of the top ten principal risks and their impact on strategy and commercial initiatives.\n\nCOVID-19\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has created an unprecedented challenge for the global economy, and the Board was appraised of the considerations and actions taken by management to protect the health and safety of our people whilst we continue to provide critical services to our customers and emergency services.\n\nStakeholders\nEngagement and participation with stakeholders\n\nPrincipal suppliers\nNick Read held a meeting with our key suppliers in California to discuss matters of mutual interest regarding the industry environment and geopolitical developments.\n\nOther\nBrexit\nThe Board considered the likelihood and potential impact of a no-deal Brexit on the Company and its stakeholders, with particular focus on Vodafone UK and Business.\n\nVodafone Foundation\nThe charitable work of the Vodafone Foundation undertaken in 2019, and proposals for 2020, were reported to the Board to inform decisions on funding and the strategic direction of the Foundation\u2019s work.\n\nHealth and safety\nThe Board received reports on health and safety initiatives, considering the wellbeing of the people working for and with us throughout the Group. The Board noted with regret the deaths of three employees within Vodafone Business during the year and requested detailed reports on the ongoing work being undertaken to eliminate the risk of fatalities and work-related safety incidents.\n\nEnsuring our culture is aligned with purpose and strategy\nThe Board played a key role in the launch of the Spirit of Vodafone, which captures the beliefs and behaviours of our people, being mindful of the considerations noted below.\n\n\u2013 Whether a new cultural programme was important for our people to support them in executing our strategy\n\u2013 What lessons could be learnt from our past experiences and the experiences of other companies\n\u2013 The role of culture as a differentiator\n\u2013 The opinions of employees\n\u2013 Plans for employee engagement and roll-out\n\u2013 The role of reward\n\u2013 Culture as an enabler of our purpose and strategy\n\nThe Board looks forward to monitoring the success of its launch, and its contribution towards driving our strategy, using a variety of metrics including the results of periodic all-employee surveys.\nEngaging with our stakeholders\n\nPromoting the success of Vodafone\n\nPursuant to the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, Vodafone is required to provide information on how the Directors have performed their duty under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 to promote the success of Vodafone, including how these matters and the interests of Vodafone\u2019s stakeholders have been taken into account in Board discussions and decision-making.\n\nDecisions are made by the Board which can impact one or more of our key stakeholder groups in quite different ways. This requires a considered and balanced approach to decision-making, ensuring high-quality information is provided to the Board in a timely manner, and diversity of thought and open discussion amongst Directors is encouraged by the Chairman during meetings. Our 2020 internal effectiveness review concluded that high-quality information was received by the Board and appropriate time was allowed for Board discussion.\n\nOur key stakeholder groups are identified as most likely to be affected by the principal decisions of the Board and include our customers, our people, our suppliers, our local communities and non-governmental organisations, regulators and governments and our investors. Further details of the Company\u2019s interaction with stakeholders is provided on pages 12 and 13.\n\nStakeholder engagement\n\nThe Board takes stakeholder engagement seriously because we appreciate the fundamental need to build a holistic view of our business to promote a strategy which takes account of the broader operating environment. Directors benefit from improved insight into the needs of our stakeholders, provoking discussion of the potential risks and opportunities for our business in satisfying those needs, and understanding the potential impact of decisions on affected stakeholders. Better insight and diversity of perspectives leads to more productive and balanced Board discussions on complex issues and, as a result, decisions are well-considered.\n\nOur Board is committed to engaging with stakeholders directly wherever possible. Provided below is an overview of the Board\u2019s engagement with our key stakeholder groups during the year.\n\nOur People\n\nA number of engagement and feedback mechanisms for our employees are well established at Vodafone, including Speak Up, business leader Q&A sessions, the Vodafone News app and Workplace, our internal digital communications platform. These enable timely and tailored communications to employees on topics most relevant to their role and which they are most interested in, in recognition of the geographical and operational diversity of our workforce. We are aware that our global workforce also includes contractors and others, so we also assess appropriate mechanisms for engaging with those groups.\n\nIn response to COVID-19 changing the way we work, we quickly introduced a global pulse survey which regularly seeks the views of our employees. It was encouraging to see strong levels of engagement and positive themes highlighted. These themes were communicated back to employees and fed into Board updates on our COVID-19 response.\n\nDuring the year, high potential individuals were invited to Board dinners to give them an opportunity to interact directly with the Directors and discuss industry developments and key challenges and opportunities in the technology and telecommunications sectors.\n\nValerie Gooding attended meetings of the European Employee Consultative Committee in July 2019, and the South Africa National Consultative Committee in January 2020. At these events, Valerie gave an overview of engagement initiatives and global policies and practices impacting those colleagues, following which employees were able to communicate their views on the most pressing issues and concerns for their local market. Key topics raised included Brexit, age considerations in the context of Vodafone\u2019s push for digitalisation, and fair pay between functions and trust in management. The tone of these meetings was positive and feedback received showed that the engagement was effective. Output from these events was reported back to the Board and it was agreed to continue with this mechanism of engagement, for Valerie to feed back to the employee committees, and for external development trends to be monitored so that future employee engagement can address those issues.\n\nDavid Nish attended our 2019 Global Risk and Compliance Forum where he met colleagues from a variety of our local markets who are responsible for managing internal controls and monitoring systems. The engagement offered David an opportunity to directly gather the views of senior managers on important questions around the successes and challenges posed by the Company\u2019s operations and risk landscape.\n\nOur Investors\n\nThroughout the year, the Board regularly engaged with investors. At our annual general meeting, shareholders have the opportunity to ask questions to the Board and, following each release of our quarterly financial results, we deliver a presentation and hold a question and answer session with analysts and investors. In addition, following the release of our results, Nick and Margherita embark on roadshows with the senior management team to visit institutional investors, to hold detailed discussions about our performance and strategy execution.\n\nIn 2019, we held our first Meet the Board Day. Our purpose pillars (as discussed in detail on pages 16 to 19) are Digital Society, Inclusion for all and Planet. We recognise all our stakeholders have an interest in our commitments, but in particular our institutional investment community who are increasingly engaging with issuers on sustainability matters. With this in mind, we wanted to present our purpose, explain how it interplays with our strategy and culture, and demonstrate the benefits that our purpose brings to our wider stakeholder groups, including our customers, employees and communities. As well as receiving presentations from Gerard, Valerie, David Nish and Nick, investors had the opportunity to attend breakout sessions to discuss these matters face-to-face with members of the Executive Committee and senior managers responsible in these areas, to ask questions and receive feedback, hearing from and engaging with members of the Board.\n\nFurther information and materials from the Meet the Board Day can be viewed at investors.vodafone.com/esg.\nOur Local Communities and Non-Government Organisations\nThe Board continues to be fully supportive of the Vodafone Foundation\u2019s important work improving the lives of the people living in our local communities and supporting the valuable work of Non-Government Organisations. During the year, Nick visited local markets in Africa to experience the tremendous positive impact the Vodafone Foundation is having in our local communities, and to understand the ways Vodafone can help to support the social and economic prosperity of those communities.\n\nThe Board played a key role in the development of our new \u2018social\u2019 contract, which sets out our vision of the closer relationships we want to foster with governments, policy makers and civil society. It will also continue to monitor the ways in which the \u2018social\u2019 contract is demonstrated in practice. This is explored in detail on pages 52 and 55.\n\nOur Suppliers\nNick held a meeting with key suppliers in California to talk about challenges to the industry, to develop an improved understanding of their views and to identify future commercial opportunities. He reported his findings to the Board, highlighting that our suppliers are aligned with us on their future aspirations to invest in robust 5G technology and to develop enterprise and mobile edge computing.\n\nGovernments and Regulators\nThe roll-out of 5G infrastructure and related security considerations, industry competition and the future of IoT are important issues for governments and regulators as well as Vodafone. Throughout the year, members of the Senior Leadership Team are invited to discuss these issues with governments and regulators, either as part of long-term planning initiatives or in reaction to specific events.\n\nDecision-making\nFaced with the sudden and unprecedented short- and long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, both social and economic, it is important for the Board to demonstrate the strength of its leadership through fair and balanced decision-making. As the interests of key stakeholder groups continue to evolve, the Board will maintain its engagement to ensure their interests continue to be well understood in order to be appropriately considered and balanced in Board decision-making.\n\nPrincipal decisions are assessed as material to the Group\u2019s strategy. The two case studies below demonstrate how the interests of key stakeholders have been factored into decision-making by identifying the relevant impacted stakeholder groups, the likely impact of a particular decision on each group, and any mitigating steps the Board required to manage the impact on affected groups.\n\nIntegration of acquired Liberty Global assets\nWhat happened:\nIn August 2019, we announced the completion of the purchase of Liberty Global\u2019s assets in Germany, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania. A significant amount of planning was done between announcement of the acquisition and completion which enabled a fast start to integration activities and synergies delivery, whilst continuing day-to-day operations to meet the stand-alone business plans.\n\nInterests of stakeholders:\nThe acquisition was a significant milestone to ensure we strengthen our convergence capabilities across our European operations, in line with our Group-wide strategy. Vodafone became the owner of the largest Gigabit-capable next-generation network infrastructure in the region. Positive results are expected for both Vodafone and its customers in those territories as operating efficiencies allow us to realise significant cost synergies as well as to provide higher quality of service, to launch convergent product offerings across fixed, mobile and TV, and to keep innovating and improving our customer experience throughout.\n\nDuring the integration, concerted effort from employees across Vodafone and acquired operations was needed to ensure that assets were effectively incorporated into our networks and convergent products and propositions could be deployed for the benefit of our customers. The Board understood that affected employees would be concerned about business disruption and potential job losses as a result of integration, and were satisfied that management had considered mitigating steps. These included a fair selection process through a third party for the management positions across both operations in each country, an integrated senior management team from day one, a clear and open communication from the management to all employees, and a phased plan to ensure business as usual activities were not compromised by integration projects.\n\nFor our shareholders, the Board considered the acquisition another example of executing on our promised strategy to become a fully convergent player in Europe. Utilising our capital in this way demonstrates the Board\u2019s focus on continuing to drive revenue growth and operating margins in our core markets. This should ultimately deliver improved value to our shareholders.\n\nEuropean TowerCo\nWhat happened:\nIn July 2019, we announced the creation of Europe\u2019s largest tower business, placing all our towers assets across Europe into a European tower company (\u2018European TowerCo\u2019).\n\nInterests of stakeholders:\nThe Board recognised that Vodafone had an opportunity to improve asset utilisation, highlight the value of its tower assets, and explore monetisation opportunities. For our valued colleagues working with our tower assets, this presented both a daunting change and a huge opportunity. The pan-European nature of the new European TowerCo afforded an opportunity to improve working relationships across Europe by sharing best practice and working closely together. The dedicated time and resource of a central management team would allow greater focus on strategic development of the towers assets, and management teams in our local markets would be able to focus on other strategic initiatives.\n\nIn respect of our suppliers, there was also an opportunity to strengthen relationships by dealing with the new European TowerCo for all service and hardware support for our tower infrastructure across Europe.\n\nThe Board considered the overall impact of organisational change and believed that an accelerated process of demerging assets and operations would reduce disruption and generate benefits faster.\nInduction, development and evaluation\n\nEffective use of our skills and experience and improving our performance\n\nThe Board recognises that it needs to continually monitor and improve its performance. This is achieved through the annual performance evaluation, full induction of new Board members and ongoing Board development. The conclusions of this year\u2019s review have been positive and confirmed that the Board remains effective.\n\nProcess undertaken for our internal evaluation\n\nIn accordance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code and our three year cycle, the 2020 Board evaluation was conducted internally with the assistance of Lintstock. Lintstock is considered fully independent as it does not have a relationship with the Board or any Director. Below is an overview of how the evaluation was conducted.\n\nStructure\n\nThe Chairman and Company Secretary worked together with Lintstock to devise a structure for the internal evaluation process to enable a rigorous review of the Board as a whole, its Committees and individual Directors\u2019 contributions to Board discussions and decision-making. In particular, the review was designed to see if the following two actions identified from the 2019 external evaluation had been taken:\n\n- More opportunities for Non-Executive Directors to visit more of our local markets.\n- More senior managers to be present at Board meetings to engage directly with the Board.\n\nEvaluation process\n\nA tailored Board questionnaire was compiled to gather and distil feedback. The objectives of the review were to provide an assessment of Vodafone Group\u2019s Board effectiveness and governance, including the effectiveness of its Committees.\n\nLintstock collated the responses from Directors and presented reports to the Board and its Committees on the input received in the evaluation.\n\nEvaluation findings\n\nThe Board\u2019s and individual Directors\u2019 engagement with the Executive Committee, senior managers, high potential employees had improved, with more opportunities for discussion with external business leaders.\n\nMore time devoted to discussion around strategic matters and succession planning was positively received.\n\nOur three year Board evaluation cycle\n\n| Year | External evaluation | Internal evaluation |\n|------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| 2019 | facilitated by Raymond Dinkin of Consilium, which has no other connection with Vodafone. | further details will be provided in next year\u2019s report. |\n| 2020 | facilitated by Lintstock, which has no other connection with Vodafone. Further information can be found below. | |\n| 2021 | | |\n\nBoard insights\n\nProgress against 2019 actions\n\nIn the 2019 Board effectiveness review, it was agreed that more opportunities for Non-Executive Directors to visit local market would be developed. After each visit Directors would provide feedback to the Chief Executive and, as appropriate, the Board. Going forward, it was agreed that more senior managers would present at Board meetings to enable direct engagement with the Board.\n\nThis year\u2019s finding\n\nIn total the Directors visited five local markets in FY20:\n\n- Valerie Gooding joined Nick Read on his visit to Vodafone Spain.\n- Sanjiv Ahuja, Michel Demar\u00e9 and Amparo Moraleda together visited Vodafone Italy.\n- The Board visited Vodafone Spain and Vodafone\u2019s UK Digital Centre.\n\nTwelve executives and 18 senior managers presented to the Board during the year on a diverse range of topics.\n\nAction for 2021\n\nDeveloping the Board\u2019s understanding of the Company\u2019s regulators and further attention on customers will be in focus for FY21.\nBoard composition\n\nProgress against 2019 actions\nIn the 2019 Board effectiveness review, it was agreed that the Board would continue to use opportunities in its natural lifecycle to address identified skills gaps to ensure that the Board\u2019s composition is aligned with the Company\u2019s strategic goals, including to further strengthen the telecommunications experience on the Board.\n\nThis year\u2019s finding\nThe appointment of David Thodey as a Director in FY20 brought further telecommunications skills and experience to the boardroom.\n\nFurther details of David\u2019s appointment and induction is presented on page 88.\n\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois van Boxmeer met the criteria set for the Chairman role which included: a former CEO of a large multinational business; an affinity for technology; broad international experience; a proven leader driving top and bottom-line growth; a strong reputation with the investment community; the stature to represent Vodafone well at senior political, regulatory and business levels; with the intellect, judgement and insight to bring strategic challenge; and the temperament to be an effective Chairman able to create and leverage a collegial and high-performing Board.\n\nAction for 2021\nThe focus for FY21 will be Jean-Fran\u00e7ois van Boxmeer\u2019s induction and the transfer to him of the Chairman role.\n\nSee page 88 for details of David Thodey\u2019s appointment process.\n\nBoard training and development\n\nProgress against 2019 actions\nIn the 2019 Board effectiveness review, it was agreed to invite speakers from other technology companies to meet with the Board, and for improved efforts to be made to ensure Directors are provided with timely and informative material on developments impacting Vodafone\u2019s operating environment during the year.\n\nThis year\u2019s finding\nMichael Wade, Cisco Chair in Digital Business Transformation and Professor of Innovation and Strategy at IMD, presented to the Board and colleagues from Vodafone UK during the Board\u2019s visit to Vodafone UK\u2019s Digital Centre.\n\nAction for 2021\nThe Board wants to better understand customer insights and to develop its understanding and oversight of Vodafone Business.\n\nSee page 86 for details of the Board\u2019s training and development during the year.\n\nStrategy\n\nProgress against 2019 actions\nIn the 2019 Board effectiveness review, it was agreed that, when deciding the agenda for Board meetings during the year, the Chairman and Chief Executive together with the Company Secretary would ensure that sufficient time is allocated to items relating to the execution of the strategy to allow time for deeper discussion.\n\nThis year\u2019s finding\nThe 2020 Board review was positive about the increase in time devoted to strategy matters in Board meetings.\n\nThe key strategic items presented to the Board in the year are shown on page 80.\n\nAction for 2021\nThe strategy process has been reviewed to enhance the preparations for, and conversation in, the Board\u2019s Strategy meeting.\n\nSee pages 80 and 81 for details of the Board\u2019s activities during the year.\nBoard induction and development\n\nWe believe good decision-making is enabled by a deep understanding of our operations and people. All our Directors commit their time to complete an induction and ongoing training programme.\n\nBoard induction\n\nWe have a comprehensive induction programme in place for our newly appointed Directors and each new Director is provided with a tailored induction programme to suit their individual needs. This involves meetings with other members of the Board, Executive Committee members and senior management, it also covers technical briefings and site visits. During the induction, each Director is encouraged to identify areas which they would like additional information on, or further meetings, which are then arranged by the Company Secretary. On completion of the induction programme, all new Directors have sufficient knowledge and understanding of the business to enable them to effectively contribute to strategic discussions and oversight of the Group.\n\nOn joining the Board, David Thodey was provided with an induction programme which has been designed to ensure he gains a full understanding of the Group, including discussions with senior managers on strategy, brand and innovation, operations, our people, remuneration, external affairs, finance, legal and governance matters. Further activities and visits to local markets are planned for the coming year. Further details of David\u2019s appointment and induction are provided on page 88.\n\nA comprehensive, tailored induction programme for Jean-Fran\u00e7ois van Boxmeer is being planned and further details of this will be provided in the 2021 Annual Report.\n\nBoard training and development\n\nTo assist the Board in undertaking its responsibilities, ongoing training is provided for all Directors and training needs are assessed as part of the Board evaluation procedure. The Board programme includes regular presentations from management, site visits and informal meetings, to build their understanding of the business and sector. During the past year, Directors received regular training on our local markets, our operating environment and recent legal and governance developments impacting Vodafone.\n\nLocal markets\n\nThe annual strategy day is a significant event within the annual calendar. This year the Board held its strategy day in Madrid, where members of the senior management team and high potential employees met with the Board to discuss the Spanish economy and political scene, Vodafone Spain\u2019s business and our Spanish colleagues\u2019 views on the Group\u2019s strategy and how it is being implemented by Vodafone Spain.\n\nDirectors are also given the opportunity to visit other local markets individually. During the year, site visits were made by Board members to the following local markets: Italy, Spain and the UK. These visits help to improve the breadth and depth of their knowledge of Vodafone and engagement on an individual level with senior management and employees in the respective markets.\n\nLocal market focus sessions were also held during Board meetings covering the German, South African, Spanish, Turkish, and Europe Cluster markets.\n\nOperating environment\n\nBoard meetings included sessions on Vodafone\u2019s competitive landscape and political and regulatory trends and developments and their implications for Vodafone in addition to the regular updates provided on business development.\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our operations globally, the Board has received, and will continue to receive, detailed reports on action being taken by the Company to respond to changing and new opportunities and risks. The Board will continue to receive regular deep dives into key local markets and updates on our global enterprise business.\n\nLegal and governance updates\n\nThe Group General Counsel and Company Secretary provided updates on current legal and governance issues. These included updates on the Group\u2019s compliance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code and The Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018 (the \u2018Regulation\u2019).\n\nAll Directors have access to the advice and services of the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary. Directors may take independent legal and/or financial advice at the Company\u2019s expense when it is judged necessary in order to discharge their responsibilities effectively. No such independent advice was sought in FY20.\nThe Nominations and Governance Committee (\u2018the Committee\u2019) continues its work of evaluating the composition of the Board and ensuring that our governance is effective.\n\n**Key objective:**\nTo evaluate the composition of the Board and ensure that it comprises individuals with the necessary diversity, skills, knowledge and experience to ensure that it is effective in discharging its responsibilities and to have oversight of all matters relating to corporate governance.\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n- Assessing the composition, structure and size of the Board and its Committees and leading the process for appointments to the Board;\n- Succession planning for the Board and Executive Committee, taking into account diversity and the need for an orderly succession;\n- Overseeing the performance evaluation of the Board, its Committees and individual Directors; and\n- Monitoring developments in all matters relating to corporate governance, bringing any issues to the attention of the Board.\n\nThe Committee is comprised solely of independent Non-Executive Directors. The Committee had four scheduled meetings during the year, and attendance by members at Committee meetings can be seen on page 77. Committee meetings were attended by Committee members with other individuals and external advisers invited to attend all or part of the meetings as appropriate.\n\nA summary of highlights of the Committee\u2019s work during the year and key areas for its focus in the coming year are set out below.\n\n**Highlights from the year:**\n- Dedicated Chair succession planning by a sub-committee led by Valerie Gooding which resulted in the appointment of Jean-Fran\u00e7ois van Boxmeer with effect from 28 July 2020, subject to shareholder approval.\n- Appointment of David Thodey to the Board with induction programme currently underway.\n- Overseeing the changes to the Executive Committee.\n\n**Key areas of focus for the next year:**\n- Jean-Fran\u00e7ois van Boxmeer\u2019s induction and the handover of the Chairman role.\n- Board and Executive Committee succession planning in order to maintain their necessary balance of skills, knowledge and experience to remain effective.\n- Continuing to monitor compliance with the Code and future regulatory updates.\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Nominations and Governance Committee Report for the year ended 31 March 2020. This past year, the main focus of the Committee has been Board and Executive Committee composition, succession planning and corporate governance matters. In particular, time and attention has been duly dedicated to my and Renee\u2019s succession.\n\nThe Committee was delighted to welcome David Thodey to the Board as a new Non-Executive Director in September 2019. An insight into the Committee\u2019s appointment process for David can be found on page 88.\n\nThe Committee promotes a diverse Board and Executive Committee. To select the most suitable candidates, the Committee considers the skills, experience and attributes required to drive Vodafone forward successfully in fulfilment of its purpose and strategic goals. As Chairman of the Committee, I take an active role in overseeing the progress made towards improving diversity in appointments in a way that is consistent with the long-term strategy of the Group. The Committee will continue to monitor balance on the Board to ensure we have sufficiently deep and broad expertise, and will recommend further appointments as appropriate.\n\nOur Executive Committee has experienced several changes designed to support our strategic focus on markets in Europe and Africa, driving radical simplification, utilising our assets and becoming the partner of choice. Details of these changes can be found on page 88.\n\nOur commitment to diversity and technology skills extends beyond the Board and Executive Committee. The Committee reviews initiatives which aim to develop the talent pipeline. Further details of our programmes to manage talent can be found on page 58.\n\nAs always, the Committee has reviewed action taken to comply with the Code and other legal and regulatory obligations during the year.\n\n**Changes to the Board and Committees**\nFollowing the 2019 AGM, Samuel Jonah stepped down from the Board after ten years of service and David Thodey was appointed with effect from 1 September 2019. As announced at our 2019 AGM, Dame Clara Furse became a member of the Remuneration Committee and stepped down from the Audit and Risk Committee, whilst Sanjiv Ahuja and Michel Demar\u00e9 were appointed as members of the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\nOn 22 May 2020 it was announced that subject to shareholder approval at the 2020 AGM, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois van Boxmeer would be appointed as a Non-Executive Director with effect from 29 July 2020 and will become Chairman on 3 November 2020. It was also announced that on 28 July 2020 Sir Crispin Davis will stand down as a member of the Audit and Risk Committee and David Thodey will become a member of it.\n\n**Assessment of the independence of the Non-Executive Directors**\nAll Non-Executive Directors have submitted themselves for re-election at the 2020 AGM.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the independence of all the Non-Executive Directors pursuant to the Code. All are considered independent and they continue to make independent contributions and effectively challenge management.\n\nAt the time of the 2020 AGM, Renee James\u2019 and my tenure will exceed nine years, the limit under the Code. At the Board\u2019s request I will stand for re-election as a Director at the 2020 AGM for a limited period of time to facilitate a smooth transition of the Chair role and to provide continuity in the current circumstances. The Board has also asked Renee James to stand for re-election at the 2020 AGM as she continues to demonstrate independent judgement in Board and Committee discussions and her re-election would support succession planning and ensure the Board remains diverse. Renee continues to provide challenge, diversity of thought and objectivity, and her considerable external experience provides invaluable technology expertise and insight to the Board.\nNominations and Governance Committee (continued)\n\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois van Boxmeer will be considered independent upon appointment on 28 July 2020, in accordance with the requirements of the Code.\n\nThe Executive Directors\u2019 service contracts and Non-Executive Directors\u2019 appointment letters are available for inspection at our registered office and will be available on display at the 2020 AGM.\n\nManagement of conflicts of interest\nThe Committee and the Board are satisfied that the external commitments of the Non-Executive Directors and of me, your Chairman, do not conflict with our duties and commitments as Directors of the Company, and that each Non-Executive Director is able to dedicate sufficient time to the Company\u2019s affairs.\n\nDirectors have a duty under the Companies Act 2006 to avoid a situation in which they have or may have a direct or indirect interest that conflicts or might conflict with the interests of the Company. This duty is in addition to the existing duty owed to the Company to disclose to the Board any interest in a transaction or arrangement under consideration by the Company.\n\nOur Directors must report any changes to their commitments to the Board; immediately notify the Company of actual or potential conflicts or a change in circumstances relating to an existing authorisation and complete an annual conflicts questionnaire. Any conflicts or potential conflicts identified are considered and, as appropriate, authorised by the Board in accordance with the Company\u2019s Articles of Association. A register of authorised conflicts is also reviewed periodically.\n\nDuring the financial year, no actual or potential conflicts were identified. The Committee is comfortable that it has adequate measures in place to manage and mitigate any actual or potential conflicts of interests that may arise in the future.\n\nBoard evaluation\nIn accordance with the Code, Vodafone conducts an annual evaluation of Board and Board Committee performance, which every Director engages in. This year, an internal evaluation of the performance of the Board and Committees was facilitated by Lintstock which has no other connection with Vodafone. The details of the outcome of this review and the actions to be addressed during the financial year ending 31 March 2021 can be found on pages 84 and 85.\n\nSuccession planning\nThe Committee monitors the length of tenure and the skills and experience of the Non-Executive Directors to assist in succession planning. Details of the length of tenure of each of the Directors can be found on pages 76 and 77 and a summary of the skills and experience of the Non-Executive Directors is presented in the top right hand side. The Committee is confident that the Board has the necessary mix of skills and experience to contribute to the Company\u2019s strategic objectives.\n\nA sub-committee led by our Senior Independent Director, Valerie Gooding, and excluding me, instructed MWM Consulting, to assist in the search for a new Chair. Spencer Stuart, another executive consultancy, assisted in the process. Spencer Stuart conducts other assessment and search assignments for the Company. MWM Consulting has no other connection with Vodafone. Both firms are accredited firms under the Enhanced Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms. A role profile was prepared (see page 85 for a summary of the criteria for the role) and a longlist of potential candidates was considered by the sub-committee. A shortlist was prepared and interviews conducted. The search culminated in the Board recommending to shareholders that Jean-Fran\u00e7ois van Boxmeer be appointed as a new Non-Executive Director at the AGM on 28 July 2020 and that he succeed me as Chairman of the Board with effect from the close of business on 3 November 2020.\n\nExperience and skills\n\n| Experience and skills | Non-Executive Directors |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------|\n| Consumer goods and services/Marketing | |\n| Finance | |\n| Emerging markets | |\n| Media | |\n| Technology/Telecoms | |\n| Political/Regulatory | |\n\nAppointment process\nWhen recruiting new members of the Board, the Committee adopts a formal and transparent procedure with due regard to the diversity, skills, knowledge and level of experience.\n\nDavid Thodey, Non-Executive Director\nThe Committee identified the need for a Non-Executive Director with extensive telecoms and technology experience. David, having been the CEO of a leading telecoms and information services company in Australia and having held senior executive positions in a leading software company, was appointed following a rigorous interview process.\n\nExternal search consultancy, Russell Reynolds Associates, was engaged to support the recruitment process. It has no other connection with the Company other than providing recruitment services and is an accredited firm under the Enhanced Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms. Following his appointment, David is undertaking a thorough induction which we expect to complete within the first year of his appointment.\n\nAn overview of the steps leading to David\u2019s election as a Director and induction process can be found below:\n\n1. Engage with search consultancy and provide them with a search specification.\n2. Shortlisting of candidates by Committee.\n3. Interview process with Committee members and Chief Executive.\n4. Recommendation to the Board on the chosen candidate.\n5. Appointment terms drafted and agreed with the selected candidate.\n\nDavid Thodey\nAppointed as a Non-Executive Director on 1 September 2019\n\nThe Committee has also been regularly informed on succession planning for the Executive Committee. During the year the following changes were made to the Executive Committee:\n\n- On 1 September 2019 Vinod Kumar was appointed as CEO Vodafone Business and a member of the Executive Committee.\n- With effect from 1 April 2020 Vivek Badrinath was appointed as CEO European Towers and stepped down from the Executive Committee.\n- With effect from 1 April 2020 Shameel Joosub, CEO Vodacom, was appointed as a member of the Executive Committee.\nDiversity\n\nIn line with Vodafone\u2019s Board Diversity Policy, the Committee is firmly committed to supporting diversity and inclusion in the boardroom in compliance with the Code and acknowledges the importance of diversity and inclusion to the effective functioning of the Board. As set out in our Board Diversity Policy, Vodafone\u2019s long-term ambition is to increase diversity on our Board in all forms. This includes diversity of skills and experience, age, gender, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, cultural background or belief and in cognitive thinking.\n\nThe Committee annually reviews and agrees the Board Diversity Policy and monitors the progress made at Board and senior management levels during the financial year.\n\nFor the technology sector to reach its full social and economic potential, it needs to more fairly reflect the world in which we operate. Diversity at Vodafone extends beyond the Board to the global workforce. The Committee has been and continues to monitor Vodafone\u2019s compliance with targets and best practice recommendations set for gender diversity by the Davies Report and Hampton-Alexander Review and for ethnic diversity by the Parker Review.\n\nHaving met the Davies Report\u2019s recommendation for 25% female Directors on the Board, we continue to work to meet the target in the Hampton-Alexander Review that by 2020 at least 33% female Board and Executive Committee positions and direct reports of the Executive Committee (the \u2018Senior Leadership Team\u2019). We are pleased to report that as at 31 March 2020 five women and seven men served on the Board, meaning 41.7% of our Board roles are currently held by women and the Board composition exceeds both targets. Over and above this, Vodafone has been recognised in the Female FTSE Board Report 2019 by Cranfield University for having women occupying our Senior Independent Director and Executive Director roles.\n\nFollowing the most recent Executive Committee change, four positions are currently held by women (28.6%). This is a slight decline compared to 2019 (30.8%), however the Committee continues to make a serious commitment to increase female representation at this level. In the Senior Leadership Team 46 (28.9%) positions are currently held by women (2019: 27.9%). The Committee is aware neither the Executive Directors nor the Senior Leadership Team will meet the 33% representation target set by the Hampton-Alexander Review by the end of 2020. The below chart illustrates the current gender diversity of our Board, Executive Committee and Senior Leadership Team against the current targets of the Hampton-Alexander Review and Davies Report.\n\nHowever we are confident that the initiatives detailed on page 58, including our ambition to become the world\u2019s best employer for women by 2025 will encourage gender diversity within Vodafone\u2019s Executive Committee and Senior Leadership Team.\n\nThe Committee is mindful of the recommendation of the Parker Review Report to have at least one Director from a non-white ethnic minority by 2021 and is satisfied that our Board currently meets this recommendation. Whilst our immediate focus has been on gender and nationality, following the recommendations from the McGregor-Smith Review, Vodafone has now implemented voluntary self-disclosure on Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (\u2018BAME\u2019) information on our people system in the UK and Group to improve visibility in this area and inform decisions on actions required to support ethnic diversity within the organisation.\n\nAdditionally, we are committed to leading the way by developing the pipeline of BAME candidates through talent programmes and our BAME network. Further details on Vodafone\u2019s diversity initiatives to build a diverse organisation can be found in the \u201cOur people and culture\u201d section on pages 58 and 59.\n\nWe are proud to have been recognised in the 2019 Bloomberg Gender Equality Index as being a top company globally and a Top 20 Employer in the UK by Stonewall.\n\nGovernance\n\nThis is the first year that Vodafone will report against the Code and following a review the Committee is satisfied that Vodafone complied with the Code in full during the year. The Committee also received regular updates on corporate governance developments and has considered the impact of those developments on Vodafone. The Board was and will continue to be provided with updates on the ways in which Vodafone\u2019s culture is embedded throughout the organisation, the recognised cultural challenges and the corrective action being taken to address any material whistleblowing incidents identified through Vodafone\u2019s Speak Up programme.\n\nIn her role as Senior Independent Director, Valerie Gooding has attended the European Employees Consultative Committee and South African National Consultative Committee. In addition to this, the Board received updates on the actions being taken to ensure there is sufficient engagement with employees, including the results of the annual employee opinion survey. As mentioned above, the Board is committed to promoting diversity in all forms and the Committee will continue to oversee the development of a diverse pipeline at Board and Executive Committee level.\n\nThe Matters Reserved for the Board and the Terms of Reference of the Nominations and Governance Committee, the Audit and Risk Committee and the Remuneration Committee were reviewed in March 2020 but no changes were required since they had been updated in 2019 to take into account the new provisions of the Code.\n\nDuring the course of the next financial year, the Committee will continue to monitor its compliance with the Regulations and the Code, review succession plans for Non-Executive Director roles. The Committee will continue to ensure that adequate succession planning is in place for the Executive Directors and senior management.\n\nGerard Kleisterlee\nOn behalf of the Nominations and Governance Committee\n28 May 2020\nThe Committee plays a key role in the governance of the Group\u2019s financial reporting, risk management, control and assurance processes and the external audit. In recent months, the Committee has focused on the risk assessment, cash flow and funding, accounting, controls and disclosure impacts of COVID-19 alongside ongoing work on how we manage cyber security threats, the continued evolution of our financial control environment and the transition to a new external auditor.\n\nKey objectives\nProvision of effective governance over the appropriateness of financial reporting of the Group, including the adequacy of related disclosures, the performance of both the internal audit function and the external auditor and oversight over the Group\u2019s systems of internal control, business risks and related compliance activities.\n\nResponsibilities\nThe Committee\u2019s terms of reference are available on vodafone.com/governance. Responsibilities of the Committee are to:\n\n- Review the integrity of the financial and narrative statements, including the review of significant financial reporting judgements;\n- Review and monitor the external auditor\u2019s independence and objectivity and the effectiveness of the external audit;\n- Review the system of internal financial control and compliance with section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n- Monitor the activities and review the effectiveness of the Internal Audit function;\n- Monitor the Group\u2019s risk management system, review of the principal and emerging risks and the management of those risks; and\n- Provide advice to the Board on whether the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and on the appropriateness of the long-term viability statement.\n\nChairman and financial expert:\nDavid Nish\n\nMembers:\nSir Crispin Davis\nAmparo Moraleda\nSanjiv Ahuja\nMichel Demar\u00e9\n\nThis report provides an overview of how the Committee operated, an insight into the Committee\u2019s activities and its role in ensuring the integrity of the Group\u2019s published financial information and ensuring the effectiveness of its risk management, controls and related processes.\n\nCommittee structure\nThe membership of the Committee changed in the year with the appointment of Sanjiv Ahuja and Michel Demar\u00e9, taking over from Dame Clara Furse who became a member of the Remuneration Committee. The new members were appointed after a rigorous process to ensure the Committee has the necessary range of expertise required to meet its responsibilities. Given my experience, I continue to be designated as the financial expert on the Committee for the purposes of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the UK Corporate Governance Code. We believe that the Committee continues to have competence relevant to the sector in which the Group operates.\n\nLooking ahead, on 28 July 2020 Sir Crispin Davis will cease to be a member of the Committee and on that date David Thodey will become a member of the Committee. I would like to thank Sir Crispin for his insightful contributions to the Committee and I look forward to welcoming David.\n\nMeetings\nThe Committee met five times during the financial year as part of its standard schedule of meetings, with further meetings on 4 May and 28 May, the latter to approve the Annual Report. The attendance by members at Committee meetings can be seen on page 77. The external auditor is invited to each meeting.\n\nMeetings of the Committee normally take place the day before Board meetings. I report to the Board, as a separate agenda item, on the activity of the Committee and matters of particular relevance and the Board receives copies of the Committee minutes. The Committee also regularly meets separately with the external auditor, the Chief Financial Officer and the Group Audit Director without others being present. Furthermore, I regularly meet with the external lead audit partner throughout the year outside the formal Committee process.\n\nWe routinely conduct deep dive reviews, together with specific risk management activities, as set out below:\n\n- While each meeting has reviews of risk and compliance related matters, the January meeting particularly focuses on these;\n- In September and March, we assess issues affecting the Group\u2019s half-year and year end reporting and approve the principal and emerging risks;\n- In November and May, we conclude this work and advise the Board on the Group\u2019s external financial reporting;\n- In early May, the meeting agenda was revised to ensure appropriate time was allotted to consider the impacts of COVID-19 and related business and financial risk assessments.\n\nExternal audit\nFollowing the tender process in the 2019 financial year, shareholders approved the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP (EY) as the Group\u2019s external auditor on 23 July 2019. Throughout the year, the Committee has overseen and facilitated a smooth transition from the former auditor to EY.\n\nAreas of focus\nThis year, the Committee has focused on the following areas:\n\n- The impact of COVID-19 on Group risk management, cash flow and funding, accounting, disclosure and financial controls;\n- Cyber security \u2013 given the need to ensure the Group is well placed to meet the risks and external threats in this area;\n- The Group\u2019s regulatory compliance activities;\n- The ongoing development of the financial control environment;\n- The adoption of IFRS 16 \u201cLeases\u201d in the year; and\n- The accounting, reporting and disclosure implications of (i) the acquisition of Liberty Global\u2019s assets in Germany and in Central and Eastern Europe, (ii) the combination of Vodafone Italy\u2019s towers with INWIT\u2019s passive network infrastructure and (iii) a range of matters in relation to the Group\u2019s investment in Vodafone Idea.\n\nCommittee effectiveness\nIn order to ensure that the Committee remains effective, every three years the Board appoints an external organisation to perform an independent review of the Committee to evaluate its performance. The last independent review was performed in March 2019 and concluded that the Board members considered the Committee to be thorough and fully effective in meeting its objectives. In 2020 an internal review of the Board and Committee effectiveness was undertaken with support by Linstock. Feedback on the Committee\u2019s performance was positive.\n\nOn behalf of the Audit and Risk Committee\n\nDavid Nish\nCOVID-19\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis has had a range of implications on risk management and corporate reporting in the period. The key considerations are summarised below.\n\nPrincipal and emerging risks\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 on the Group\u2019s principal and emerging risks and uncertainties has been reviewed in depth together with related mitigations. This work is summarised on page 70.\n\nCorporate governance\n\nThe financial close process and external audit\n\nIn response to governmental advice and restrictions regarding social distancing and travel, essentially all of the Group\u2019s employees involved in the preparation of ongoing management information, financial reporting and supporting the external audit have been working from home, as are EY\u2019s audit teams. This has required a different way of working during the year-end financial close process. Remote user access to our financial systems for these employees, software collaboration tools for the collation of audit evidence and regular status meetings have proved invaluable during the preparation of the financial results and execution of the external audit. We extended our reporting timetable by two weeks, resulting in the Annual Report being approved on 28 May 2020.\n\nInternal controls systems\n\nWe have reviewed our financial controls and have concluded that except for a limited number of changes required as a result of remote working, primarily in relation to the form of physical evidencing of approval, the ongoing operation of our financial controls is substantially unaffected by COVID-19 restrictions. This is in part a function of the tools and processes that have allowed remote access working for finance teams. We also performed a re-assessment of the Internal Audit plan for FY21 to ensure priorities were re-aligned with areas of higher risk in the current COVID-19 impacted operating environment.\n\nFinancial reporting\n\nSignificant financial reporting judgements\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 has been factored into certain of our significant financial reporting judgements, notably impairment testing. See significant financial reporting judgements on page 92.\n\nIn addition, all of our markets have reviewed the amounts provided against receivables and contract assets for expected credit losses, taking into account the potential for increased losses due to the economic impact of COVID-19.\n\nLong-term viability statement\n\nThe Committee provides advice to the Board on the form and basis of conclusions underlying the long-term viability statement as set out on page 71 and the going concern assessment.\n\nIn response to COVID-19, the Committee challenged management on its financial risk assessment as part of its consideration of the long-term viability statement. This included scrutiny of forecast liquidity, balance sheet stress tests, the availability of cash and cash equivalents through new or existing financing facilities and a review of counterparty risk to assess the likelihood of third parties not being able to meet contractual obligations. Certain elements of this exercise supplemented the normal annual process and assessment of the Group\u2019s prospects made by management, and included:\n\n- The assessment of the review period and alignment with the Group\u2019s internal long-term forecasts;\n- The assessment of the capacity of the Group to remain viable after consideration of future cash flows, expected debt service requirements, undrawn facilities and access to capital markets;\n- The modelling of the financial impact of certain of the Group\u2019s principal risks materialising using severe but plausible scenarios; and\n- Ensuring clear disclosures in the Annual Report as to why the assessment period selected was appropriate to the Group, what qualifications and assumptions were made and how the underlying analysis was performed, consistent with FRC pronouncements.\n\nExpanded disclosure in relation to the Group\u2019s liquidity has been provided in the financial statements. See note 22 \u201cCapital and financial risk management\u201d.\n\nExternal audit\n\nThe Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing the relationship with the external auditor. This includes making the recommendation on the appointment, reappointment and removal of the external auditor, assessing its independence on an ongoing basis and approving the statutory audit fee, the scope of the statutory audit and the appointment of the lead audit engagement partner.\n\nAppointment of EY\n\nFollowing a formal tender process in the previous financial year and the Committee\u2019s recommendation to the Board, shareholders appointed Ernst & Young LLP (\u201cEY\u201d) as the Group\u2019s external auditor in July 2019. EY replaced PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (\u201cPwC\u201d).\n\nThe lead audit partner is Alison Duncan who has held the role since the appointment of EY.\n\nIt was a key objective of the Committee to ensure that EY became fully familiar with all aspects of the Group that were relevant to the external audit process as part of its audit planning. This was partly achieved through EY \u201cshadowing\u201d PwC during the 31 March 2019 year-end audit process at the major markets and at Group. This included attendance to observe at Group Audit and Risk Committee meetings before formal appointment. Subsequently, EY performed detailed planning activities and reviewed PwC audit files.\n\nFollowing this work, EY presented to the Committee its detailed audit plan for the 2020 financial year, which outlined its audit scope, planning materiality and its assessment of key audit risks. The audit plan was a key output from the transition process and was reviewed in detail by the Committee.\n\nThe identification of key audit risks is critical in the overall effectiveness of the external audit process and are outlined in the Audit Report on pages 127 to 140.\n\nThe Committee also receives reporting from EY on its assessment of the accounting and disclosures in the financial statements and financial controls.\n\nThe Committee will continue to review the auditor appointment and anticipates that the audit will be put out to tender at least every ten years. The Company has complied with the Statutory Audit Services Order 2014 for the financial year under review.\n\nIndependence and objectivity\n\nIn its assessment of the independence of the auditor, and in accordance with the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\u2019s (PCAOB) standard on independence, the Committee receives details of all relationships between the Company and EY that may have a bearing on its independence and receives confirmation from EY that it is independent of the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities law and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the PCAOB.\n\nThe Committee and EY agreed a number of steps to ensure EY was independent for the purpose of conducting the audit of the 2020 financial\n## Significant financial reporting matters and judgements\n\nThe areas considered and actions taken by the Committee in relation to the 2020 Annual Report are outlined below. For each area, the Committee was satisfied with the accounting and disclosures in the financial statements.\n\n| Area of focus | Actions taken/conclusion |\n|---------------|--------------------------|\n| **Revenue recognition** | The Committee received an update in September 2019, in relation to the IFRS 15 revenue reporting and accounting processes. Key areas of focus and challenge from the Committee were in relation to the period end closing process, data management, management information and financial controls. The accounting policy for, and related disclosure requirements of IFRS 15 that have been presented in the Annual report were reviewed in March and May 2020. |\n| **Lease liabilities** | The Committee has received ongoing updates on the implementation of IFRS 16. This includes the new accounting policy for, and related disclosure requirements of, IFRS 16 that have been presented in the Annual Report. The Committee challenged management on the systems and processes implemented for reporting. |\n| **Taxation** | The Group Tax Director presented on both the provisioning and disclosure of tax contingencies and deferred tax asset recognition at the November 2019 and May 2020 Committee meetings. The Committee challenged the judgements underpinning both the provisioning and disclosures adopted for the most significant components of contingent taxation liabilities and the underlying assumptions for the recognition of deferred tax assets, principally the availability of future taxable profits and utilisation period. |\n| **Liability provisioning** | The Committee met with the Group\u2019s General Counsel and Company Secretary and the Director of Litigation in both November 2019 and May 2020. The Committee reviewed and challenged management\u2019s assessment of the current status of the most significant claims, together with relevant legal advice received by the Group, to form a view on the appropriate level of provisioning and extent of related disclosures. |\n| **Vodafone Idea** | The Committee challenged management over the disclosure and reporting implications of the adverse judgement in the AGR case in India at the November 2019, January 2020 and May 2020 Committee meetings. This supplemented a range of Board deliberations on this topic in the period. |\n| **Impairments** | The Committee reviewed and discussed detailed reporting with management and challenged the appropriateness of the assumptions made, the consistent application of management\u2019s methodology and the achievability of the business plans. The Committee focused its attention on the updates made to assumptions as a result of managements\u2019 assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on the forecast cash flows, the cash generating units most impacted and the extent of sensitivity disclosures to be provided. The impairment assumptions were reviewed and updated where required for the potential impact of the current COVID-19 crisis. The Group Head of Planning presented the output of the impairment exercise at the early-May 2020 meeting. During the year, the Group has recorded impairments in respect of its investments in Vodafone Ireland, Vodafone Spain, Vodafone Romania and Vodafone Automotive. |\n| **Acquisitions and disposals** | Management outlined the key accounting and disclosure impacts in relation to these transactions. The Committee received detailed reporting from EY on its assessment on the accounting judgements and disclosures made by management in both the half-year and annual financial statements. |\n\n### Area of focus\n\n**Revenue recognition**\n\nRevenue is a risk area given the inherent complexity of IFRS 15 accounting requirements and the underlying billing and related IT systems. See note 1 \u201cBasis of preparation\u201d.\n\n**Lease liabilities**\n\nThe implementation of IFRS 16 represents a significant change in financial reporting, in particular the recognition of significantly more lease liabilities. See note 1 \u201cBasis of preparation\u201d and note 20 \u201cLeases\u201d.\n\n**Taxation**\n\nThe Group is subject to a range of tax claims and related legal actions across a number of jurisdictions where it operates. Further, the Group has extensive accumulated tax losses and a key management judgement is whether a deferred tax asset should be recognised in respect of those losses. See note 6 \u201cTaxation\u201d and note 29 \u201cContingent liabilities and legal proceedings\u201d.\n\n**Liability provisioning**\n\nThe Group is subject to a range of claims and legal actions from a number of sources, including competitors, regulators, customers, suppliers and, on occasion, fellow shareholders in Group subsidiaries. See note 16 \u201cProvisions\u201d and note 29 \u201cContingent liabilities and legal proceedings\u201d.\n\n**Vodafone Idea**\n\nDisclosure and accounting judgements primarily in relation to the impacts on the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) ruling in India. This included the identification of the amounts of losses to be recognised, asset impairment and the appropriate level of provisioning required in relation to the contingent liability adjustment mechanism. See note 29 \u201cContingent liabilities and legal proceedings\u201d.\n\n**Impairments**\n\nJudgements in relation to impairment testing relate primarily to the assumptions underlying the calculation of the value in use of the Group\u2019s businesses, being the achievability of the long-term business plans and the macroeconomic and related modelling assumptions underlying the valuation process. See note 4 \u201cImpairment losses\u201d.\n\n**Acquisitions and disposals**\n\nIn July 2019, the Group completed the acquisition of Liberty Global\u2019s operations in Germany and the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania. This gave rise to complex accounting and disclosure requirements, particularly in relation to the valuation of acquired tangible and intangible assets. In March 2020, the Group completed the combination of Vodafone Italy\u2019s tower assets with INWIT\u2019s passive network infrastructure. This resulted in a gain on the disposal of Italy\u2019s towers which was restricted due to the lease back of these towers. This also resulted in an equity accounted investment in INWIT which was part of the consideration received. See note 27 \u201cAcquisitions and disposals\u201d.\n\n---\n\n**Note:**\n\nSee note 1 \u201cBasis of preparation\u201d. See note 6 \u201cTaxation\u201d and note 29 \u201cContingent liabilities and legal proceedings\u201d. See note 27 \u201cAcquisitions and disposals\u201d. See note 20 \u201cLeases\u201d. See note 16 \u201cProvisions\u201d and note 29 \u201cContingent liabilities and legal proceedings\u201d. See note 29 \u201cContingent liabilities and legal proceedings\u201d.\nyear. The primary elements of this were that all existing EY services ceased by 31 March 2019 with the exception of a small number of permissible non-audit services that were subject to a specific exemption from this requirement and all proposed EY services from 1 April 2019 were immediately subject to the Group\u2019s non-audit services policy.\n\nFor the 2021 financial year, the Group\u2019s non-audit services policy has been updated and approved by the Committee. The updated policy incorporates the requirements of the FRC\u2019s revised Ethical Standard that was published in December 2019. The previous policy contained a list of prohibited non-audit services. This is replaced by a \u201cwhitelist\u201d of permitted non-audit services, which mirrors the revised Ethical Standard.\n\n**Effectiveness of the external audit process**\n\nThe Committee reviewed the quality of the external audit throughout the year and considered the performance of EY, taking into account the Committee\u2019s own assessment, feedback, and the results of a detailed survey of senior finance personnel across the Group. Based on these reviews, the Committee concluded that there had been appropriate focus and challenge by EY on the primary areas of the audit and that EY had applied robust challenge and scepticism throughout the audit.\n\n**EY audit and non-audit fees**\n\nTotal fees payable to EY for audit and non-audit services in the year ended 31 March 2020 amounted to \u20ac27 million.\n\nComparative figures presented below are in respect of amounts paid to the previous external auditor, PwC, in those years.\n\n**Audit fees**\n\nThe Committee reviewed and discussed the fee proposal during the tender process and received assurance that the proposed fees were appropriate for the scope of work required. Subsequent to the audit tender process, a limited number of recurring and non-recurring scope changes were agreed. The Committee agreed an audit fee of \u20ac20 million (2019: \u20ac17 million) for statutory audit services in the year.\n\n**Non-audit fees**\n\nTo protect the independence and objectivity of the external auditor, the Committee has a policy for the engagement of the external auditor to provide non-audit services. This policy prohibits EY from playing any part in management or decision-making, providing certain services such as valuation work and the provision of accounting services. This policy also sets a presumption that EY should only be engaged for permissible non-audit services where there is no legal or practical alternative supplier and includes a cap on the level of non-audit fees.\n\nThe Committee has pre-approved that EY can be engaged by management, subject to the policies set out above, and subject to:\n\n- A \u20ac60,000 fee limit for individual engagements;\n- A \u20ac500,000 total fee limit for services where there is no legal alternative; and\n- A \u20ac500,000 total fee limit for services where there is no practical alternative supplier.\n\nFor those permitted services that exceed these specified fee limits, the Chairman pre-approves the service. In mid-March 2020, this policy was updated to align with the new FRC requirements such that only certain expressly permitted non-audit services would be permissible.\n\nNon-audit fees were \u20ac7 million (2019: \u20ac2 million) and represented 35% of audit fees for the 2020 financial year (2019: 12%; 2018: 24%). See note 3 \u201cOperating profit/(loss)\u201d for further details.\n\nThe level of fees in the current year is higher than in previous years. This is because EY historically provided the Group with a range of services prior to their appointment as external auditor. Three pre-existing EY service arrangements, which would not ordinarily have been approved under the Group\u2019s non-audit services policy, but where it was deemed significantly advantageous for the service to be completed, were allowed to continue into the 2020 financial year. Fees for these three services were \u20ac5 million. Each was a permitted service under audit regulations and each service was complete early in the financial year.\n\n**Financial reporting**\n\nThe Committee\u2019s primary responsibility in relation to the Group\u2019s financial reporting is to review, with management and the external auditor, the appropriateness of the half-year and annual financial statements. The Committee focuses on:\n\n- The quality and acceptability of accounting policies and practices;\n- Material areas in which significant judgements have been applied or where significant issues have been discussed with the external auditor;\n- An assessment of whether the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable;\n- The clarity of the disclosures and compliance with financial reporting standards and relevant financial and governance reporting requirements;\n- Providing advice to the Board on the form and basis underlying the long-term viability statement; and\n- Any correspondence from regulators in relation to our financial reporting.\n\n**Accounting policies and practices**\n\nThe Committee received reports from management in relation to:\n\n- The identification of critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty;\n- Significant accounting policies;\n- The implementation of IFRS 16 in the year; and\n- Proposed disclosures of these in the 2020 Annual Report.\n\nFollowing discussions with management and the external auditor, the Committee approved the disclosures of the accounting policies and practices set out in note 1 \u201cBasis of preparation\u201d to the consolidated financial statements, which include details of the impacts of adopting IFRS 16.\n\n**Fair, balanced and understandable**\n\nThe Committee assessed whether the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company\u2019s position and performance, business model and strategy. The Committee reviewed the processes and controls that underpin its preparation, ensuring that all contributors, the core reporting team and senior management are fully aware of the requirements and their responsibilities. This included the use and disclosure of alternative performance measures (or \u201cnon-GAAP\u201d measures) and the financial reporting responsibilities of the Directors under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its members as well as considering the interests of other stakeholders which will have an impact on the Company\u2019s long-term success of the entity.\n\nThe Committee reviewed an early draft of the Annual Report to enable early input and comment. The Committee also reviewed the financial results announcements, supported by the work of the Group\u2019s Disclosure Committee, which reviews and assesses the Annual Report and investor communications.\nAudit and Risk Committee (continued)\n\nThis work enabled the Committee to provide positive assurance to the Board to assist them in making the statement required by the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code.\n\nRegulators and our financial reporting\nThe FRC publishes thematic reviews to help companies improve the quality of corporate reporting around new accounting standards. The FRC also issued a range of guidance and performed a number of detailed reviews related to the year-end reporting process across public companies. The Group has reviewed the output of these reviews and their impacts on the Group\u2019s reporting with the most relevant being:\n\n- Year-end advice to Audit Committee Chairs and CFOs;\n- Thematic review on existing disclosure requirements for IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and the impairment of non-financial assets; and\n- Thematic review on disclosures relating to the adoption of IFRS 16.\n\nWhilst the Group already complied with the majority of the recommendations, the 2020 Annual Report has been updated to seek to adopt best practice where applicable.\n\nIn March 2020, the FRC and the SEC issued guidance for companies during the COVID-19 crisis. The Group has reviewed this guidance and updated disclosures accordingly.\n\nThe Group also follows the FRC\u2019s Lab projects, notably preparations for the European Single Electronic Format (\u2018ESEF\u2019) regulations that come into effect for the 2021 financial year.\n\nThere has been no correspondence from regulators, including the FRC\u2019s Corporate Reporting Review Team (\u2018CRRT\u2019), commenting on our financial reporting in respect of the Group\u2019s FY19 or FY20 reporting.\n\nInternal control and risk management\nThe Committee has the primary responsibility for the oversight of the Group\u2019s system of internal control, including the risk management framework, the compliance framework and the work of the Internal Audit function.\n\nInternal audit\nThe Internal Audit function provides independent and objective assurance over the design and operating effectiveness of the system of internal control, through a risk based approach. The function reports into the Committee and, administratively, to the Group Chief Financial Officer. The function is composed of teams across Group functions and local markets. This enables access to specialist skills through centres of excellence and ensures local knowledge and experience. The function has a high level of qualified personnel with a wide range of different professional qualifications and experience. A co-sourcing agreement with a professional firm has ensured access to additional specialist skills and an advanced knowledge base.\n\nInternal Audit activities are based on a robust methodology and subject to ongoing internal quality assurance reviews to ensure compliance with the standards of the Institute of Internal Auditors. The function has invested in several initiatives to improve continuously its effectiveness, particularly in the adoption of new technologies. The increased use of data analytics has provided deeper audit testing and driven increased insights.\n\nThe Committee has a permanent agenda item to cover Internal Audit related topics. Prior to the start of each financial year, the Committee reviews and approves the annual audit plan, assesses the adequacy of the budget and resources and reviews the operational initiatives for the continuous improvement of the function\u2019s effectiveness.\n\nThe Committee reviews the progress against the approved audit plan and the results of audit activities, with a focus on unsatisfactory audit results and \u201ccross-entity audits\u201d, being audits performed across multiple markets with the same scope. Audit results are analysed by risk, process and geography to highlight movements in the control environment and areas that require attention.\n\nDuring the year, Internal Audit coverage focused on principal risks, which include \u201ccyber threat and information security\u201d, \u201cdigital transformation and simplification\u201d, and \u201cmarket disruption\u201d. Relevant audit results are reported at the same time as the Committee\u2019s in-depth review with the risk owner, which allows the Committee to have an integrated view on the way the risk is managed. Assurance was also provided across a range of areas, including cyber security, hygiene & essentials, suppliers & third parties and off footprint security; IT resilience; operating expense management; non-current assets accounting; churn management; contract management and the Vodafone Foundation. The activities performed by the shared service organisation also received attention due to their significant bearing on the effectiveness of global processes. Management is responsible for ensuring that issues raised by Internal Audit are addressed within an agreed timetable, and the Committee reviews their timely completion.\n\nCompliance with section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act\nOversight of the Group\u2019s compliance activities in relation to section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act and policy compliance reviews also fall within the Committee\u2019s remit.\n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting and we have responsibility for ensuring the effectiveness of these controls. The Committee received updates on the Group\u2019s work in relation to section 404 compliance and the Group\u2019s broader financial control environment at each meeting during the year. This included monitoring the progress and outcome of work particularly focused on testing and then evidencing the completeness and accuracy of reporting from systems used in the operation of certain controls. This is often referred to as \u201cIPE\u201d: or \u201cInformation Produced by the Entity\u201d. As the Group evolves, including both from the ongoing centralisation of processes and controls into its shared service centres and from broader changes in the composition of the Group, we continue to challenge management on ensuring the nature and scope of control activities changes to ensure key risks continue to be adequately mitigated. The deeper utilisation of automated controls embedded within our systems is part of this ongoing evolution in the control environment.\n\nThe Committee also took an active role in monitoring the Group\u2019s compliance activities including receiving reports from management in the year covering programme-level changes, the scope of compliance work performed and the results of controls testing. A significant area of focus was on the assessment of the controls over the Group\u2019s work in performing a significant upgrade to its Group wide financial ERP system in the year. The Committee also received regular updates on a programme to deliver greater consistency of compliance related activities in relation to risks outside Finance and IT. The external auditor also reports the status of its work in relation to controls in its reports to the Committee.\n\nAssessment of Group\u2019s system of internal control, including the risk management framework\nThe Group\u2019s risk assessment process and the way in which significant business risks are managed is an area of focus for the Committee. The Committee\u2019s activity here was led primarily, but not solely, by the Group\u2019s assessment of its principal and emerging risks and uncertainties, as set out on pages 62 to 71. Cyber security remains, and will continue to be, a major area of focus for the Committee given the ongoing risks in this area.\nThe Group has an internal control environment designed to protect the business from the material risks which have been identified. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls and the Committee has responsibility for ensuring the effectiveness of these controls. The Committee reviewed the process by which Group management assessed the control environment, in accordance with the requirements of the Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and related Financial and Business Reporting published by the FRC. Activity here was driven primarily by reports from the Group Audit Director on the effectiveness of internal controls. Although not relevant in the financial period, this would include any identified incident and fraud, including those involving management or employees with a significant role in internal controls.\n\n**In-depth reviews**\n\nThe Committee requested management to provide in-depth reviews as part of the meeting agenda.

It has been heartening to see our people work together during recent weeks and months to ensure this priority is met.\n\nIt is in times of volatility that embracing our purpose and values is most important, and the Board has seen colleagues from across the business live the Vodafone Spirit during these testing times.\n\nAs a provider of critical connectivity and communications services which enable our digital society, we have announced a five-point plan to help the communities in which we operate. More details of this can be found within our \u2018social\u2019 contract report on pages 54 and 55.\n\nExecutive pay and our commitments to our colleagues\n\nThere is an economic impact from COVID-19, and both the Committee and the wider Board are acutely aware of the impact this unforeseen event has had on our share price, as it has on those of all listed businesses around the world.\n\nUnlike many businesses, the Technology Communications industry has remained relatively resilient during this period. At the time of writing, we have not had to furlough any employees and our operations are continuing without the need for state aid. As set out in this Annual Report, we are also in a position to pay a year end dividend.\n\nIn terms of commitments to our colleagues, we have enabled home working for the vast majority of our people, been flexible with our leave and working hours policies, provided health and wellbeing support across our markets, and enabled digital learning for our colleagues and their families. As part of a wider employee charity giving initiative, Executive Committee members have also been making personal donations to COVID-19 related charities, with both Executive Directors donating 25% of their salary over a three month period, which will be matched by the business in conjunction with the Vodafone Foundation.\n\nWith regards to this year\u2019s salary review, whilst our wider all-employee pay review has also continued as normal, with performance-related remuneration scheduled to be delivered as planned, no salary increases for either the Executive Directors or senior management teams will be awarded this year.\n\nBoth Executive Directors will also be taking 100% of their 2020 net bonus, which will be paid in June 2020, in the form of shares and have agreed to hold 100% of their net shares from the upcoming August 2020 vest (i.e. 2018 GLTI award, granted in August 2017) for a full two years post-vest. This latter decision represents a voluntary early adoption of our new structure whereby long-term incentive awards will be subject to a three year performance period and an additional two year holding period (i.e. the \u201c3+2\u201d model). Subject to shareholder approval of our Remuneration Policy at the 2020 AGM, this structure will apply to awards granted from this year onwards.\nNext steps\nThe Committee is aware that the COVID-19 situation is constantly evolving and we will continue to keep executive remuneration arrangements and decisions under review between the publication of this report and our AGM, and beyond.\n\nIn particular, the Committee is conscious of the potential impact the current market uncertainty could have on the size, in terms of the number of shares granted, of the planned awards later this year. The Committee has reviewed its processes in light of the June 2019 grant (i.e. 2020 GLTI award) where an unexpected share price drop led to the actual number of shares granted being higher than what was originally expected when the Committee had approved the awards. As disclosed to the market last year and set out on page 112 of this report, the Executive Directors voluntarily forfeited 20% of the shares awarded in this case to reflect the unexpected share price movement.\n\nThis year the Committee has agreed to delay the date of the 2021 award grant to November 2020. This will provide a longer period for the market to potentially settle and also assists with the difficulty in setting a three year free cash flow target range in the current uncertain conditions. The Committee will meet shortly before the grant to review all relevant information and agree the FCF target. This opportunity will also be used to consider other matters in relation to the grant including, but not limited to, the weightings of the performance measures and whether the number of shares granted should be determined by an average share price or the normal spot price approach.\n\nFull details of decisions made in respect of the November 2020 grant, including the FCF target range, performance measure weightings, and the grant price used for award calculation purposes, will be disclosed in the relevant stock exchange announcement, and published in next year\u2019s report. The Committee believes this approach is necessary to ensure the 2021 award, and the associated FCF target range, is appropriate and not unduly influenced by the immediate and unprecedented external market conditions.\n\nNotwithstanding this delay to the grant date, the performance period for the 2021 award will continue to run on a financial year to financial year basis as normal \u2013 in this case from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2023. As such the Committee has agreed that it is already in a position to determine appropriate Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) targets for this award, and these are set out on pages 119 and 120. The Committee believes disclosing such information is important in providing transparency on our targets as early as possible \u2013 particularly in respect of the new ESG measure.\n\nWere it not for the uncertainty caused by COVID-19, then the FCF target would have also been disclosed in this report ahead of the grant, as has been our practice in prior years.\n\nThe Committee is aware that the current landscape is characterised by uncertainty and will continue to work in a responsible manner to ensure the most appropriate decisions are made in light of all the latest information and that executive pay does not benefit from the current market volatility.\n\nOur principles\nIn both designing the revised policy, and implementing the current policy during the year, the Committee was guided by its principles of:\n\nSupport our strategy, purpose and spirit\nEnsuring our Remuneration Policy, and the manner in which it is implemented, drives the behaviours that support our strategy and business objectives.\n\nPay for performance\nMaintaining a \u201cpay for performance\u201d approach to remuneration which ensures our incentive plans only deliver significant rewards if and when they are justified by business performance.\n\nShareholder alignment\nAligning the interests of our senior management team with those of shareholders by developing an approach to share ownership that helps to maintain commitment over the long term.\n\nFair pay\nOffering competitive and fair rates of pay and benefits to all of our people, in line with our Fair Pay principles (further details of which can be found on pages 114 and 115).\n\nRemuneration Policy review\nRemuneration structures\nOver the last year the Committee has been reviewing our current remuneration structures in the context of our refreshed strategy and purpose. During this period the Committee had regular updates and discussions on external emerging trends in respect of both corporate governance developments and the increased discussion on \u201calternative LTI arrangements\u201d.\n\nOverall the Committee concluded that our current remuneration structures (including the use of performance shares) are aligned with our principles and remain best positioned to support our strategy, meet the critical need of attracting and retaining key talent in a competitive global marketplace, and deliver value for our shareholders.\n\nDelivering on these points is particularly important as we make the transition to a converged technology communications leader, and the Committee is confident the structures set out in our revised Remuneration Policy are the right arrangements at this time. The Committee will continue to review developing external trends and will remain open-minded about the nature of any future changes.\n\nWhilst the Committee was satisfied with the current core structures in place under our current policy, it was recognised there was scope to implement a number of best practice features which have emerged since the Remuneration Policy was last approved, and to incorporate shareholder feedback which has been received during this period.\nRemuneration Committee (continued)\n\nShareholder consultation\nIt was from this starting position that the Committee developed its original proposals and initiated an external consultation on these with our shareholders. During the year the Committee worked to facilitate genuine two-way dialogue when consulting on the proposed revisions to our current Remuneration Policy.\n\nThis spirit is illustrated through how we launched our initial conversation with our largest shareholders in November 2019. As a March year end company, this ensured that the Committee was able to fully discuss all of the feedback received, and ensure inputs were properly considered prior to a final Remuneration Policy needing to be submitted in this year\u2019s Annual Report and Accounts.\n\nThe level of engagement from shareholders during the consultation was high, and the Committee would like to thank everyone who took the time to provide feedback throughout the consultation period. As I have stated in these pages in previous years, the Committee is committed to maintaining a transparent and strong relationship with its shareholders, and this year\u2019s consultation exemplified the mutual benefits of such an approach.\n\nAt the time of writing the final key proposed changes to our Remuneration Policy have been met with widespread support from those investors and stakeholders that engaged in the consultation, and are summarised as follows:\n\n- Formalisation of pension alignment with the wider UK workforce.\n- Introduction of annual bonus deferral.\n- Reduction in GLTI opportunity.\n- Inclusion of an ESG measure under our GLTI.\n- Introduction of a full \u201c3+2\u201d vesting/holding period under our GLTI.\n- Strengthening of post employment shareholding requirements.\n- Expansion of current clawback arrangements.\n\nFull details of the final proposed changes to our Remuneration Policy are provided on page 100, with these changes then embedded in our revised Remuneration Policy which can be found on pages 102 to 107.\n\nThe Committee takes shareholder consultations seriously, and in the spirit of transparency has briefly set out the two key changes which were made to the original proposals following shareholder feedback:\n\nProposal Change 1: Post employment share ownership requirement\nUnder the original proposals, the current post employment share ownership requirements would have been strengthened so that all leavers would have had to continue to hold 100% of their goal for one year post employment, and 50% for a further second year.\n\nWhilst a majority of shareholders were supportive of this evolution from our current tranche structure, and appreciated the high level of holdings required from our executives, the Committee recognised there was a preference for this proposal to be extended to 100% of the requirement for both years.\n\nThe Committee discussed the feedback on this topic and decided that, given our track record of aiming to be a market leader in the area of executive shareholding requirements and the developing view of the importance of post employment shareholdings, it was appropriate to amend the final proposal to 100% of the requirement for two years post employment.\n\nProposal Change 2: GLTI performance condition weightings\nIn light of the proposed introduction of an ESG measure under our GLTI, a re-weighting of the performance conditions was required.\n\nBased on feedback from shareholders in previous years regarding the importance of free cash flow under our incentive arrangements, the Committee decided that the original proposal would include a normal weighting of 70% on free cash flow, 20% on TSR, and 10% on ESG.\n\nDuring the consultation it became clear that shareholder preference was for the TSR and free cash flow weightings to be re-balanced. The Committee discussed this feedback and subsequently agreed that it was appropriate to revise the proposed normal weightings across the aforementioned performance measures to 60%, 30% and 10% respectively.\n\nNext steps\nAs illustrated above, this revised Remuneration Policy is the product of comprehensive engagement between shareholders and the Committee and will be submitted for shareholder approval at our 2020 AGM.\n\nEmployee engagement\nAs set out in last year\u2019s report, during the year I had the opportunity to attend both our European and South African employee forums in my capacity as Senior Independent Director. This formed part of our wider initiatives on engaging the employee voice, further details of which can be found on page 115. These meetings were highly productive and allowed employee representatives to discuss a variety of topics with me which included the impact of Brexit on our business, the link between Group and local markets, and Fair Pay.\n\nThis latter topic is particularly important to me as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and it was encouraging to have such a positive and lively discussion on the work we are doing in this area. The Committee is committed to making decisions on executive pay in the context of pay arrangements in the business, and further details of how this was undertaken during the year can be found on page 114 onwards.\n\nArrangements for 2021\nSalary freezes for our executives\nFollowing a March review of the executive remuneration arrangements, the Committee agreed that there would be no increase to base salary for either the Chief Executive or the Chief Financial Officer and as such their salaries will remain unchanged for the year ahead.\n\nThis is the second consecutive year that the Committee has decided not to award a salary increase to either of the executives, and illustrates the Committee\u2019s commitment to only award increases where appropriate in light of both internal and external conditions.\n\nAnnual bonus (GSTIP)\nFollowing the conclusion of our policy consultation, the Committee determined that both the opportunity and structure of performance conditions under the annual bonus should remain unchanged.\n\nAt the March 2020 meeting, the Committee agreed that the performance conditions and their respective weightings for 2021 should remain unchanged from 2020.\n\nHowever, in light of the uncertainty caused by COVID-19 and the subsequent difficulty in setting an appropriate service revenue target, it was agreed at the May 2020 meeting for this condition to be removed from the 2021 short-term incentive. The three remaining conditions of free cash flow, EBIT, and Customer Appreciation KPIs will subsequently be equally weighted at 1/3 each.\nAs set out in the revised Remuneration Policy, from 2021 25% of any net bonus will also be deferred into shares for two years unless the executive has already met their share ownership requirement.\n\nGlobal long-term incentive (GLTI)\nSome of the most significant proposed changes to our Remuneration Policy are in respect of the structure of our GLTI. These changes are set out on page 100 and include a reduction in award sizes, an increase in holding period, and the introduction of an ESG measure.\n\nThe latter of these changes is particularly important to the Committee, illustrating as it does our desire to ensure that our executive pay arrangements embrace the three pillars of our purpose. The metrics used under this ESG measure are quantitative, linked to our externally disclosed ambitions in this area, and are detailed further on page 120.\n\nLinking pay and performance\nThe Committee has always been committed to robust target setting processes which ensure pay and performance are linked. This continues to be shown through our historic incentive payouts, the levels of which illustrate how our variable pay truly is variable, with its realisation subject to genuinely stretching targets. A full breakdown of our ten year history can be found on page 117.\n\nFurther information on the forward-looking arrangements for our Board can be found on pages 118 and 119 of the Annual Report on Remuneration.\n\nPerformance outcomes during 2020\n\nGSTIP performance\nAnnual bonus performance during the year was assessed against both financial and strategic measures. The four measures were equally weighted at 25% each, with financial metrics constituting service revenue, adjusted EBIT and adjusted free cash flow whilst the strategic measure was linked to customer appreciation KPIs. The KPIs themselves covered metrics including churn, revenue market share, and net promoter score (further details of which can be found on page 110).\n\nFor the year under review, performance under the financial metrics was broadly at or above the mid-point of the target range with performance under the customer appreciation KPIs metrics being below the mid-point of the range.\n\nThe combined performance under all of these measures during the year resulted in an overall payout of 51.9% of maximum. As set out above, both Executive Directors will voluntarily be using their full net bonus to purchase shares in our business. Further details on our performance under each measure can be found on pages 109 and 110 of the Annual Report on Remuneration.\n\nGLTI performance\nThe 2018 GLTI award (granted August 2017) was subject to free cash flow (2/3 of total award) and TSR (1/3 of total award) performance, both of which were measured over the three year period ending 31 March 2020.\n\nFinal FCF performance finished above the midpoint of the target range, resulting in 58.6% of the FCF element vesting.\n\nIn respect of TSR, our relative performance over the period was 3.6% p.a. above the peer group median. This resulted in 33.9% of the TSR element vesting.\n\nOverall, the calculated payout for the award was 50.4% of maximum \u2013 further details of this calculation can be found on page 111. Both Executive Directors have voluntarily agreed to hold all of their net shares from this vest for a full two year period post-vest (i.e. an early adoption of our new \u201c3+2\u201d model which is set out in further detail on the following pages).\n\nConsideration of discretion\nThe Committee reviewed incentive outcomes at the May 2020 meeting and determined them to be appropriate in light of business performance across the relevant performance periods.\n\nThe Committee further acknowledged that the business has continued to perform well even against an uncertain external backdrop, and it was subsequently agreed that no adjustments were required to either incentive outcome this year. Further details of the matters considered when coming to this decision can be found in our Annual Report on Remuneration on page 109.\n\nLooking ahead\nAs this letter suggests, this year has been one characterised by continuous engagement, comprehensive discussions and, towards the end, an unprecedented global situation. The dedication and quality of our colleagues and customers has remained consistently high throughout this period and, despite the uncertain external backdrop, we remain in a strong position to continue delivering on our purpose, strategy and spirit.\n\nThe Committee believes that the revised policy, as set out in the following pages, will help drive this progress and I would once again like to thank you, our shareholders, for the level and quality of your engagement over this last year.\n\nValerie Gooding\nChairman of the Remuneration Committee\n28 May 2020\n## Executive pay at a glance\n\n### The components of remuneration\n\n| Fixed pay (comprising Base salary, Benefits and Pension) |  |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|---|\n| **Feature** | **Current policy** | **Proposed policy** | **Rationale** |\n| **Pension** | Current practice is 10% of salary for executives, although the legacy policy allows up to 24%. | The Policy will be updated to formally reflect the latest executive pension arrangements which took effect in July 2018 (10% of salary). | Both Executive Directors are based in the UK and these arrangements are aligned with the employer contributions available to our UK workforce. |\n\n### Remuneration Policy \u2013 summary of changes\n\n| **Fixed pay** | **Annual bonus** Global Short-Term Incentive Plan \u2013 \u201cGSTIP\u201d | **Long-term incentive** Global Long-Term Incentive Plan \u2013 \u201cGLTI\u201d | **Other** |\n|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| **Feature** | **Current policy** | **Proposed policy** | **Rationale** |\n| **Pension** | Current practice is 10% of salary for executives, although the legacy policy allows up to 24%. | The Policy will be updated to formally reflect the latest executive pension arrangements which took effect in July 2018 (10% of salary). | Both Executive Directors are based in the UK and these arrangements are aligned with the employer contributions available to our UK workforce. |\n| **Annual bonus deferral** | No annual bonus deferral. | Mandatory annual bonus deferral (25% into shares for two years) will be applied to all executives who have not met their share ownership requirement. | Bonus deferral will act as an additional measure to ensure shareholder alignment in situations where an executive is working towards their share ownership requirement. |\n| **Maximum opportunity (% of salary)** | Chief Executive: 575% (Threshold: 103.5%). Other EDs: 525% (Threshold: 94.5%). | Chief Executive: 500% (Threshold: 100%). Other EDs: 450% (Threshold 90%). | These proposed changes aim to balance the need, as one the UK\u2019s largest listed companies, to attract the talent required to drive our strategic agenda, with the need to account for the views of our stakeholders on the matter of long-term incentives. |\n| **Vesting/holding periods** | Three year vest period, with shares delivered 50% at vest, 25% on the first anniversary of vesting, and 25% on the second anniversary. | Three year vesting period with all shares subject to an additional two year holding period (i.e. \u201c3+2\u201d model). | The Committee recognises that matters of quantum, simplicity, and shareholder alignment are of high importance to our stakeholders and these proposed changes aim to further reinforce our commitment in this area. |\n| **Performance conditions** | Adjusted FCF (2/3) and Relative TSR (1/3). | Adjusted FCF (60%), Relative TSR (30%), and ESG (10%). | Introducing an ESG element under the GLTI also underlines management\u2019s commitment to our purpose, and the importance of our impact on the societies we operate in to our investors. |\n| **Share ownership requirements** | Chief Executive (500%), Other EDs (400%). Requirements apply post-employment until all GLTI awards have vested. | Requirement levels remain unchanged whilst post-employment conditions will now apply to all leavers for a period of two years. | Recognises the growing shareholder consensus on this matter whilst further strengthening alignment between executive pay and the shareholder experience. |\n| **Malus and clawback** | Trigger events include material misstatement, material miscalculation, and gross misconduct. | Incorporate a reputational damage trigger event. Include discretion to extend clawback exercise period if an investigation is ongoing. | Expands the protection offered by clawback further than just the \u201ctraditional three\u201d trigger events and ensures the timescales for applying such powers are sufficient. |\n## Total remuneration at a glance \u2013 2020 compared to 2021\n\nThe below table illustrates the arrangements in place during the year under review (2020) compared to those which will be in place for 2021 (subject to shareholder approval of the Remuneration Policy at the 2020 AGM).\n\n| Component          | 2020 (year ending 31 March 2020) | 2021 (year ending 31 March 2021) |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| **Fixed pay**      |                                  |                                  |\n| **Base salary**    | **Effective 1 July 2019:**       | **Effective 1 July 2020:**       |\n|                    | Chief Executive: \u00a31,050,000 (no increase). | Chief Executive: \u00a31,050,000 (no increase). |\n|                    | Chief Financial Officer: \u00a3700,000 (no increase). | Chief Financial Officer: \u00a3700,000 (no increase). |\n| **Benefits**       | Travel related benefits and private medical cover. | Travel related benefits and private medical cover. |\n| **Pension**        | Pension contribution of 10% of salary for all Executive Directors. | Pension contribution of 10% of salary for all Executive Directors. |\n| **Annual bonus**   |                                  |                                  |\n| **GSTIP**          | **Opportunity (% of salary):**   | **Opportunity (% of salary):**   |\n|                    | Target: 100%                     | Target: 100%                     |\n|                    | Maximum: 200%                    | Maximum: 200%                    |\n|                    | **Measures:**                    | **Measures:**                    |\n|                    | Service revenue (25%), adjusted EBIT (25%), adjusted FCF (25%), and customer appreciation KPIs (25%). | Adjusted EBIT (1/3), adjusted FCF (1/3), and customer appreciation KPIs (1/3). |\n| **Long-term incentive** | **Opportunity (% of salary):** | **Opportunity (% of salary):** |\n| **GLTI**           | Maximum:                         | Maximum:                         |\n|                    | Chief Executive: 575%            | Chief Executive: 500%            |\n|                    | Other Executive Directors: 525% | Other Executive Directors: 450% |\n|                    | **Measures:**                    | **Measures:**                    |\n|                    | Adjusted free cash flow (2/3 of total award) and TSR (1/3 of total award). | Adjusted free cash flow, TSR, and ESG.

This includes our considerations when determining policy, a description of the elements of the reward package, including an indication of the potential future value of this package for each of the Executive Directors, and the policy applied to the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors.\n\nWe will be seeking shareholder approval for our Remuneration Policy at the 2020 AGM and we intend to implement it at that point. A summary and explanation of the proposed changes to the current Remuneration Policy is provided on page 100. Subject to approval, we will review our policy each year to ensure that it continues to support our company strategy and if it is necessary to make a change to our policy within the next three years, we will seek shareholder approval.\n\nConsiderations when determining our Remuneration Policy\n\nOur remuneration principles which are outlined on page 97 guide the Remuneration Committee when making decisions on our policy and its implementation. A critical consideration for the Remuneration Committee when determining our Remuneration Policy is to ensure that it supports our company purpose, strategy, and business objectives.\n\nA variety of stakeholder views are taken into account when determining executive pay, including those of our shareholders, colleagues, and external bodies. Further details on how we engage with, and consider the views of, each of these stakeholders are set out on page 115.\n\nIn advance of submitting our policy for shareholder approval we ran a thorough consultation exercise with our major shareholders. We invited our top 20 shareholders and a number of key governance stakeholders to comment on remuneration at Vodafone and to provide feedback on the proposed changes to the current policy which was approved at the 2017 AGM. A number of meetings between shareholders and the Remuneration Committee Chairman took place during this consultation period. Further details of this consultation are provided on pages 97 and 98 whilst a summary of the proposed changes to our current policy, which are incorporated in this revised Remuneration Policy report, is provided on page 100.\n\nListening to and consulting with our employees is very important and the Committee is supportive of the growing focus on engaging the employee voice, which has accompanied recent changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code. Our engagement with colleagues can take different forms in different markets but includes a variety of channels and approaches including our annual people survey which attracts very high levels of participation and engagement, regular business leader Q&A sessions, and a number of internal digital communication platforms.\n\nOur Senior Independent Director also undertakes an annual attendance at our European employee forum, and a similar body in South Africa, with any questions or concerns raised by the employee representatives fed back directly to the Board for consideration and discussion.\n\nWe do not formally consult directly with employees on the executive Remuneration Policy nor is any fixed remuneration comparison measurement used. However, when determining the policy for Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee is briefed on pay and employment conditions of employees in Vodafone Group as a whole, with particular reference to the market in which the executive is based. Further information on our approach to remuneration for other employees is given on page 105.\n\nPerformance measures and targets\n\nOur Company strategy and business objectives are the primary consideration when we are selecting performance measures for our incentive plans. The targets within our incentive plans that are related to internal financial measures (such as revenue, profit and cash flow) are typically determined based on our budgets. Targets for strategic and external measures (such as customer appreciation KPIs, ESG measures, and total shareholder return (\u2018TSR\u2019)) are set based on company objectives and in light of the competitive marketplace. The threshold and maximum levels of performance are set to reflect minimum acceptable levels at threshold and very stretching levels at maximum.\n\nAs in previous Remuneration Reports we will disclose the details of our performance targets for our short and long-term incentive plans. However, our annual bonus targets are commercially sensitive and therefore we will only disclose our targets in the Remuneration Report following the completion of the financial year. We will normally disclose the targets for each long-term award in the Remuneration Report for the financial year preceding the start of the performance period \u2013 where this is not possible, such targets will be disclosed at the time of grant and published in the next Remuneration Report.\n\nAt the end of each performance period we review performance against the targets, using judgement to account for items such as (but not limited to) mergers, acquisitions, disposals, foreign exchange rate movements, changes in accounting treatment, material one-off tax settlements etc. The application of judgement is important to ensure that the final assessments of performance are fair and appropriate.\n\nMalus and clawback\n\nIn addition, the Remuneration Committee reviews the incentive plan results before any payments are made to executives or any shares vest and has full discretion to adjust the final payment or vesting downwards if they believe circumstances warrant it. In particular, the Committee has the discretion to use either malus or clawback as it sees appropriate. In the case of malus, the award may lapse wholly or in part, may vest to a lesser extent than it would otherwise have vested or vesting may be delayed.\n\nIn the case of clawback, the Committee may recover bonus amounts that have been paid up to three years after the relevant payment date, or recover share awards that have vested up to five years after the relevant grant date. The key trigger events for the use of the clawback arrangements include material misstatement of performance, material miscalculation of performance condition outcomes, gross misconduct, and reputational damage.\n\nSubject to approval of this Remuneration Policy, these arrangements will be applicable to all bonus amounts paid, or share awards granted, following the 2020 AGM. The current clawback arrangements, which are set out in the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM, have been applicable to all bonus amounts paid, or share awards granted, since the 2017 AGM.\nThe Remuneration Policy table\nThe table below summarises the main components of the reward package for Executive Directors.\n\n| Fixed pay | Base salary |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| Purpose and link to strategy | To attract and retain the best talent |\n| Operation | Salaries are usually reviewed annually and fixed for 12 months commencing 1 July. Decision is influenced by: |\n| | \u2013 level of skill, experience and scope of responsibilities of individual; |\n| | \u2013 business performance, scarcity of talent, economic climate and market conditions; |\n| | \u2013 increases elsewhere within the Group; and |\n| | \u2013 external comparator groups (which are used for reference purposes only) made up of companies of similar size and complexity to Vodafone. |\n| Opportunity | Average salary increases for existing Executive Committee members (including Executive Directors) will not normally exceed average increases for employees in other appropriate parts of the Group. Increases above this level may be made in specific situations. These situations could include (but are not limited to) internal promotions, changes to role, material changes to the business and exceptional company performance. |\n| Performance metrics | None. |\n\n| Fixed pay | Pension |\n|-----------|---------|\n| Purpose and link to strategy | To remain competitive within the marketplace |\n| Operation | Executive Directors may choose to participate in the defined contribution pension scheme or to receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension. |\n| Opportunity | The pension contribution or cash payment is equal to the maximum employer contribution available to our UK employees under our Defined Contribution scheme (currently 10% of annual gross salary). |\n| Performance metrics | None. |\n\n| Fixed pay | Benefits |\n|-----------|----------|\n| Purpose and link to strategy | To aid retention and remain competitive within the marketplace |\n| Operation | Travel related benefits. This may include (but is not limited to) company car or cash allowance, fuel and access to a driver where appropriate. |\n| | Private medical, death and disability insurance and annual health checks. |\n| | In the event that we ask an individual to relocate we would offer them support in line with Vodafone\u2019s relocation or international assignment policies. This may cover (but is not limited to) relocation, cost of living allowance, housing, home leave, education support, tax equalisation and advice. |\n| | Legal fees if appropriate. |\n| | Other benefits are also offered in line with the benefits offered to other employees, for example, our all-employee share plan, mobile phone discounts, maternity/paternity benefits, sick leave, paid holiday, etc. |\n| Opportunity | Benefits will be provided in line with appropriate levels indicated by local market practice in the country of employment. |\n| | We expect to maintain benefits at the current level but the value of benefit may fluctuate depending on, amongst other things, personal situation, insurance premiums and other external factors. |\n| Performance metrics | None. |\n### Remuneration Policy (continued)\n\n#### Annual bonus \u2013 Global Short-Term Incentive Plan (\u2018GSTIP\u2019)\n\n**Purpose and link to strategy**\n\n- To drive behaviour and communicate the key priorities for the year.\n- To motivate employees and incentivise delivery of performance over the one year operating cycle.\n- The financial metrics drive our growth strategies whilst also focusing on improving operating efficiencies. The strategic measures aim to ensure a great customer experience remains at the heart of what we do.\n\n**Operation**\n\n- Bonus levels and the appropriateness of measures and weightings are reviewed annually to ensure they continue to support our strategy.\n- Performance over the financial year is measured against stretching financial and non-financial performance targets set at the start of the financial year.\n- The annual bonus is usually paid in cash in June each year for performance over the previous year. A mandatory deferral of 25% of post-tax bonus earned into shares for two years will normally apply except where an executive has met or exceeded their share ownership requirement.\n\n**Opportunity**\n\n- Bonuses can range from 0\u2013200% of base salary, with 100% paid for on-target performance. Maximum is only paid out for exceptional performance.\n\n**Performance metrics**\n\n- Performance over each financial year is measured against stretching targets set at the beginning of the year.\n- The performance measures normally comprise a mix of financial and strategic measures. Financial measures may include (but are not limited to) profit, revenue and cash flow with a weighting of no less than 50%. Strategic measures may include (but are not limited to) customer appreciation KPIs such as churn, revenue market share, and NPS.\n\n#### Long-term incentive \u2013 Global Long-Term Incentive Plan (\u2018GLTI\u2019)\n\n**Purpose and link to strategy**\n\n- To motivate and incentivise delivery of sustained performance over the long term.\n- To support and encourage greater shareholder alignment through a high level of personal share ownership.\n- The use of free cash flow as the principal performance measure ensures we apply prudent cash management and rigorous capital discipline to our investment decisions.\n- The use of TSR along with a performance period of not less than three years means that we are focused on the long-term interests of our shareholders.\n\n**Operation**\n\n- Award levels and the framework for determining vesting are reviewed annually.\n- Long-term incentive awards consist of shares subject to performance conditions which are granted each year.\n- Awards will normally vest not less than three years after the respective award grant date based on Group performance against the performance metrics set out below. In exceptional circumstances, such as but not limited to where a delay to the grant date is required, the Committee may set a vesting period of less than three years, although awards will continue to be subject to a performance period of at least three years.\n- All post-tax shares are subject to a mandatory two year holding from the date of vest prior to release.\n- Dividend equivalents are paid in cash after the vesting date.\n\n**Opportunity**\n\n- Maximum long-term incentive face value at award of 500% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 450% for other Executive Directors.\n- Threshold long-term incentive face value at award is 20% of maximum opportunity. Minimum vesting is 0% of maximum opportunity. Awards vest on a straight-line basis between threshold and maximum.\n- The Committee has the discretion to reduce long-term incentive grant levels for Directors who have neither met their shareholding guideline nor increased their shareholding by 100% of salary during the year.\n- The awards that vest accrue cash dividend equivalents over the three year vesting period.\n- Awards vest to the extent performance conditions are satisfied.\n\n**Performance metrics**\n\n- Performance is measured against stretching targets set at the time of grant.\n- Vesting is determined based on the following measures: adjusted free cash flow as our operational performance measure, relative TSR against a peer group of companies as our external performance measure, ESG as a measure of our external impact and commitment to our purpose.\n- Weightings will be determined each year and will normally constitute 60% on adjusted free cash flow, 30% on relative total shareholder return, and 10% on ESG. The Committee will determine the actual weighting of an award prior to grant, taking into account all relevant information.\nNotes to the Remuneration Policy table\n\nExisting arrangements\nWe will honour existing awards, incentives, benefits and contractual arrangements made to individuals prior to their promotion to the Board and/or prior to the approval and implementation of this policy. For the avoidance of doubt this includes payments in respect of any award granted under any previous Remuneration Policy. This will last until the existing incentives vest (or lapse) or the benefits or contractual arrangements no longer apply.\n\nLong-term incentive (\u2018GLTI\u2019)\nWhen referring to our long-term incentive awards we use the financial year end in which the award was made. For example, the \u201c2020 award\u201d was made in the financial year ending 31 March 2020. The awards are usually made in the first half of the financial year.\n\nThe extent to which awards vest depends on three performance conditions:\n\n\u2013 underlying operational performance as measured by adjusted free cash flow;\n\u2013 relative Total Shareholder Return (\u2018TSR\u2019) against a peer group median; and\n\u2013 performance against our Environmental, Social, and Governance (\u2018ESG\u2019) targets.\n\nAdjusted free cash flow\nThe free cash flow performance is based on the cumulative adjusted free cash flow figure over the performance period. The detailed targets and the definition of adjusted free cash flow are determined each year as appropriate. The target adjusted free cash flow level is set by reference to our long-range plan and market expectations. We consider the targets to be critical to the Company\u2019s long-term success and its ability to maximise shareholder value, and to be in line with the strategic goals of the Company. The Remuneration Committee sets these targets to be sufficiently demanding with significant stretch where only outstanding performance will be rewarded with a maximum payout.\n\nThe cumulative adjusted free cash flow vesting levels as a percentage of the award subject to this performance element are shown in the table below (with linear interpolation between points):\n\n| Performance          | Vesting percentage (% of FCF element) |\n|----------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Below threshold      | 0%                                    |\n| Threshold            | 20%                                   |\n| Maximum              | 100%                                  |\n\nTSR outperformance of a peer group median\nWe have a limited number of appropriate peers and this makes the measurement of a relative ranking system volatile. As such, the outperformance of the median of a peer group is felt to be the most appropriate TSR measure. The peer group for the performance condition is reviewed each year and amended as appropriate.\n\nThe TSR vesting levels as a percentage of the award subject to this performance element are shown in the table below (with linear interpolation between points):\n\n| Performance                                      | Vesting percentage (% of TSR element) |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Below median                                     | 0%                                    |\n| Median                                           | 20%                                   |\n| Percentage outperformance of the peer group median equivalent to 80th percentile | 100%                                  |\n\nIn order to determine the percentages for the equivalent outperformance levels above median, the Remuneration Committee seeks independent external advice.\n\nESG performance\nOur ESG targets will be set on an annual basis (as per the approach for our other performance measures), and will be aligned to our externally communicated ambitions in this area. Where performance is below the agreed ambition, the Committee will use its discretion to assess vesting based on performance against the stated ambition and any other relevant information.\n\nRemuneration policy for other employees\nWhile our remuneration policy follows the same fundamental principles across the Group, packages offered to employees reflect differences in market practice in the different countries, role and seniority.\n\nFor example, the remuneration package elements for our Executive Committee are essentially the same as for the Executive Directors with some minor differences, for example smaller levels of share awards and local variances where appropriate. The remuneration for the next level of management, our senior leadership team, again follows the same principles with local and individual performance aspects in the annual bonus targets and performance share awards. They also receive lower levels of share awards which are partly delivered in conditional share awards without performance conditions.\nRemuneration Policy (continued)\n\nEstimates of total future potential remuneration from 2021 pay packages\n\nThe tables below provide estimates of the potential future remuneration for each of the Executive Directors based on the remuneration opportunity to be granted in the 2021 financial year. Potential outcomes based on different performance scenarios are provided for each Executive Director.\n\nThe assumptions underlying each scenario are described below.\n\nFixed\nConsists of base salary, benefits and pension.\nBase salary is at 1 July 2020.\nBenefits are valued using the figures in the total remuneration for the 2020 financial year table on page 109 (of the 2020 report).\nPensions are valued by applying cash allowance rate of 10% of base salary at 1 July 2020.\n\n| Role                  | Base (\u00a3'000) | Benefits (\u00a3'000) | Pension (\u00a3'000) | Total fixed (\u00a3'000) |\n|-----------------------|--------------|------------------|-----------------|--------------------|\n| Chief Executive       | 1,050        | 42               | 105             | 1,197              |\n| Chief Financial Officer | 700         | 22               | 70              | 792                |\n\nMid-point\nBased on what a Director would receive if performance was in line with plan.\nThe opportunity for the annual bonus (\"GSTIP\") is 100% of base salary under this scenario.\nThe opportunity for the long-term incentive (\"GLTI\") reflects assumed achievement mid-way between threshold and maximum performance.\n\nMaximum\nThe maximum award opportunity for the GSTIP is 200% of base salary.\nThe maximum GLTI opportunity reflects full vesting based on the maximum award levels set out in this Remuneration Policy (i.e. 500% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 450% of base salary for the Chief Financial Officer).\n\nAll scenarios\nLong-term incentives consist of share awards only which are measured at face value i.e. no assumption for cash dividend equivalents payable.\n\nRecruitment remuneration\n\nOur approach to recruitment remuneration is to pay no more than is necessary and appropriate to attract the right talent to the role.\n\nThe Remuneration Policy table (pages 103 and 104) sets out the various components which would be considered for inclusion in the remuneration package for the appointment of an Executive Director. Any new Director\u2019s remuneration package would include the same elements, and be subject to the same constraints, as those of the existing Directors performing similar roles. This means a potential maximum bonus opportunity of 200% of base salary and long-term incentive maximum face value of opportunity at award of 500% of base salary.\n\nWhen considering the remuneration arrangements of individuals recruited from external roles to the Board, we will take into account the remuneration package of that individual in their prior role. We only provide additional compensation to individuals for awards foregone. If necessary we will seek to replicate, as far as practicable, the level and timing of such remuneration, taking into account also any remaining performance requirements applying to it. This will be achieved by granting awards of cash or shares that vest over a timeframe similar to those forfeited and if appropriate based on performance conditions. A commensurate reduction in quantum will be applied where it is determined that the new awards are either not subject to performance conditions or subject to performance conditions that are not as stretching as those of the awards forfeited.\n\nService contracts of Executive Directors\n\nExecutive Directors\u2019 contracts have rolling terms and are terminable on no more than 12 months\u2019 notice.\n\nThe key elements of the service contract for executives relate to remuneration, payments on loss of office (see below), and restrictions during active employment (and for 12 months thereafter). These restrictions include non-competition, non-solicitation of customers and employees etc.\n\nTreatment of corporate events\n\nAll of the Company\u2019s share plans contain provisions relating to a change of control. Outstanding awards and options would normally vest and become exercisable on a change of control to the extent that any performance condition has been satisfied and pro-rated to reflect the acceleration of vesting, unless the Committee determines otherwise.\n\nIn the event of a demerger, distribution (other than an ordinary dividend) or other transaction which would affect the current or future value of any award, the Committee may allow awards to vest on the same basis as for a change of control described above. Alternatively, an adjustment may be made to the number of shares if considered appropriate.\nPayments for departing Executive Directors\n\nIn the table below we summarise the key elements of our policy on payment for loss of office. We will of course, always comply both with the relevant plan rules and local employment legislation.\n\n| Provision | Policy |\n|-----------|--------|\n| Notice period and compensation for loss of office in service contracts | \u2013 12 months\u2019 notice from the Company to the Executive Director.  \n\u2013 Up to 12 months\u2019 base salary (in line with the notice period). Notice period payments will either be made as normal (if the executive continues to work during the notice period or is on gardening leave) or they will be made as monthly payments in lieu of notice (subject to mitigation if alternative employment is obtained). |\n| Treatment of annual bonus (\u2018GSTIP\u2019) on termination under plan rules | \u2013 The annual bonus will be pro-rated for the period of service during the financial year and will reflect the extent to which Company performance has been achieved.  \n\u2013 The Remuneration Committee has discretion to reduce the entitlement to an annual bonus to reflect the individual\u2019s performance and the circumstances of the termination. |\n| Treatment of unvested long-term incentive awards (\u2018GLTI\u2019) on termination under plan rules | \u2013 An Executive Director\u2019s award will vest in accordance with the terms of the plan and satisfaction of performance conditions measured at the normal completion of the performance period, with the award pro-rated for the proportion of the vesting period that had elapsed at the date of cessation of employment.  \n\u2013 The Remuneration Committee has discretion to vary the level of vesting as deemed appropriate, and in particular to determine that awards should not vest for reasons which may include, at their absolute discretion, departure in case of poor performance, departure without the agreement of the Board, or detrimental competitive activity. |\n| Pension and benefits | \u2013 Generally pension and benefit provisions will continue to apply until the termination date.  \n\u2013 Where appropriate other benefits may be receivable, such as (but not limited to) payments in lieu of accrued holiday and legal fees or tax advice costs in relation to the termination.  \n\u2013 Benefits of relative small value may continue after termination where appropriate, such as (but not limited to) mobile phone provision. |\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, an arrangement may be established specifically to facilitate the exit of a particular individual albeit that any such arrangement would be made within the context of minimising the cost to the Group. We will only take such a course of action in exceptional circumstances and where it is considered to be in the best interests of shareholders.\n\nChairman and Non-Executive Directors\u2019 remuneration\n\nOur policy is for the Chairman to review the remuneration of Non-Executive Directors annually following consultation with the Remuneration Committee Chairman. Fees for the Chairman are set by the Remuneration Committee.\n\n| Element | Policy |\n|---------|--------|\n| Fees | \u2013 We aim to pay competitively for the role including consideration of the time commitment required. We benchmark the fees against an appropriate external comparator group. We pay a fee to our Chairman which includes fees for chairmanship of any committees. We pay a fee to each of our other Non-Executive Directors and they receive an additional fee if they chair a committee and/or hold the position of Senior Independent Director. Non-executive fee levels are set within the maximum level as approved by shareholders as part of our Articles of Association. We review the structure of fees from time to time and may, as appropriate, make changes to the manner in which total fees are structured, including but not limited to any additional chair or membership fees. |\n| Allowances | \u2013 Under a legacy arrangement, an allowance is payable each time certain non-Europe-based Non-Executive Directors are required to travel to attend Board and committee meetings to reflect the additional time commitment involved. |\n| Incentives | \u2013 Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any incentive plans. |\n| Benefits | \u2013 Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any benefit plans. The Company does not provide any contribution to their pension arrangements. The Chairman is entitled to the use of a car and a driver whenever and wherever he is providing his services to or representing the Company. We have been advised that for Non-Executive Directors, certain travel and accommodation expenses in relation to attending Board meetings should be treated as a taxable benefit therefore we also cover the tax liability for these expenses. |\n\nNon-Executive Director letters of appointment\n\nNon-Executive Directors are engaged on letters of appointment that set out their duties and responsibilities. The appointment of Non-Executive Directors may be terminated without compensation. Non-Executive Directors are generally not expected to serve for a period exceeding nine years. For further information refer to the Nominations and Governance Committee section of the Annual Report.\nRemuneration Committee\n\nIn this section we give details of the composition of the Remuneration Committee and activities undertaken during the 2019 financial year. The Committee is comprised to exercise independent judgement and consists only of the following independent Non-Executive Directors:\n\nChairman: Valerie Gooding\nCommittee members: Michel Demar\u00e9, Dame Clara Furse, Renee James and Samuel Jonah (until 23 July 2019)\n\nThe Committee regularly consults with Nick Read, the Chief Executive, and Leanne Wood, the Chief Human Resources Officer, on various matters relating to the appropriateness of awards for Executive Directors and senior executives, though they are not present when their own compensation is discussed. In addition, Adrian Jackson, the Group Reward and Policy Director, provides a perspective on information provided to the Committee, and requests information and analysis from external advisers as required. Rosemary Martin, the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, advises the Committee on corporate governance guidelines and acts as secretary to the Committee.\n\nExternal advisers\n\nThe Remuneration Committee seeks and considers advice from independent remuneration advisers where appropriate. The appointed advisers, Willis Towers Watson, were selected through a thorough process led by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee at the time and were appointed by the Committee in 2007. The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee has direct access to the advisers as and when required, and the Committee determines the protocols by which the advisers interact with management in support of the Committee. The advice and recommendations of the external advisers are used as a guide, but do not serve as a substitute for thorough consideration of the issues by each Committee member. Advisers attend Committee meetings occasionally, as and when required by the Committee.\n\nWillis Towers Watson is a member of the Remuneration Consultants\u2019 Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the Remuneration Consultants\u2019 Group Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. This is based upon principles of transparency, integrity, objectivity, competence, due care and confidentiality by executive remuneration consultants. Willis Towers Watson has confirmed that it adheres to that Code of Conduct throughout the year for all remuneration services provided to Vodafone and therefore the Committee is satisfied that it is independent and objective. The Remuneration Consultants\u2019 Group Code of Conduct is available at remunerationconsultantsgroup.com.\n\nAdviser Appointed by Services provided to the Committee Fees for services provided to the Committee \u00a3\u2019000 Other services provided to the Company\n\n| Adviser | Appointed by | Services provided to the Committee | Fees for services provided to the Committee \u00a3\u2019000 | Other services provided to the Company |\n|---------|--------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Willis Towers Watson Remuneration Committee in 2007 | Advice on market practice; governance; provision of market data on executive reward; reward consultancy; and performance analysis. | 88 | Reward and benefits consultancy; provision of benchmark data; outsourced pension administration; and insurance consultancy services. |\n\nNote:\n1 Fees are determined on a time spent basis.\n\n2017 annual general meeting \u2013 Remuneration Policy voting results\n\nAt the 2017 annual general meeting there was a binding vote on our Remuneration Policy.

In addition, informal conference calls can also take place. The principal agenda items at the formal meetings were as follows:\n\n| Meeting | Agenda Items |\n|---------|--------------|\n| May 2019 | \u2013 2019 annual bonus achievement and 2020 targets/ranges \u2013 2017 long-term incentive award vesting and 2020 targets/ranges \u2013 Shareholder update \u2013 2019 Directors\u2019 Remuneration Report |\n| July 2019 | \u2013 Shareholder & media communications update \u2013 Review of Remuneration Policy \u2013 Corporate governance matters |\n| October 2019 | \u2013 Corporate governance matters \u2013 Review of Remuneration Policy \u2013 2019/20 shareholder consultation |\n| November 2019 | \u2013 Shareholder consultation update \u2013 Gender Pay Gap Reporting |\n| January 2020 | \u2013 Shareholder consultation update \u2013 Remuneration arrangements across Vodafone \u2013 Committee\u2019s terms of reference \u2013 Chairman and Non-Executive Director fee levels \u2013 2021 reward packages for the Executive Committee \u2013 Remuneration Committee performance review |\n| March 2020 | \u2013 Shareholder consultation update \u2013 Remuneration arrangements across Vodafone \u2013 Committee\u2019s terms of reference \u2013 Chairman and Non-Executive Director fee levels \u2013 2021 reward packages for the Executive Committee \u2013 Remuneration Committee performance review |\n2020 remuneration\n\nIn this section we summarise the pay packages awarded to our Executive Directors for performance in the 2020 financial year versus 2019. Specifically we have provided a table that shows all remuneration that was earned by each individual during the year and computed a single total remuneration figure for the year. The value of the annual bonus (GSTIP) reflects what was earned in respect of the year but will be paid out in cash in the following year. Similarly the value of the long-term incentive (GLTI) reflects the share awards which will vest in June/August 2020 as a result of the performance through the three year period ended at the completion of our financial year on 31 March 2020.\n\nConsideration of the use of discretion\n\nThe Remuneration Committee reviews all incentive awards prior to payment and uses judgement to ensure that the final assessments of performance are fair and appropriate. If circumstances warrant it, the Committee may adjust the final payment or vesting downwards.\n\nThe Committee reviewed incentive outcomes at the May 2020 meeting and determined them to be appropriate in light of business performance across the relevant performance periods. The Committee agreed that due to the timing of the COVID-19 outbreak there was relatively limited impact on performance results across either incentive performance period.\n\nThe Committee further acknowledged that the business has continued to respond effectively to developing events even after the performance periods ended. As set out in the Letter from the Remuneration Committee Chairman, none of our employees have been furloughed, we are continuing to pay a dividend and we will be delivering performance-related pay and running a global salary review for our wider employee population as normal. It was subsequently agreed that no adjustments were required to either incentive outcome this year.\n\nTotal remuneration for the 2020 financial year (audited)\\(^1\\)\n\n|                      | Nick Read | Margherita Della Valle |\n|----------------------|-----------|------------------------|\n| Salary/fees          | \u00a31,050    | \u00a3947                   |\n| Taxable benefits\\(^2\\) | 42        | 29                     |\n| Annual bonus: GSTIP (see below for further detail) | \u00a31,090 | \u00a3922 |\n| Total long-term incentive\\(^3\\) | \u00a31,426 | \u00a3935 |\n| GLTI awards\\(^4\\) | \u00a31,181    | \u00a3738                   |\n| GLTI dividends\\(^5\\) | 245       | 197                    |\n| Pension/cash in lieu of pension | 105 | 129 |\n| Other\\(^6\\)          | 1         | 1                      |\n| **Total**            | **3,714** | **2,963**              |\n| **Total Fixed Remuneration** | **1,198** | **1,106** |\n| **Total Variable Remuneration** | **2,516** | **1,857** |\n\nNotes:\n\n1. Nick Read was appointed Chief Executive-Designate on 27 July 2018, and became Chief Executive on 1 October 2018. Nick\u2019s 2019 single figure therefore reflects remuneration received both in respect of his current role, as well as in respect of his previous role as Chief Financial Officer. Margherita Della Valle joined the Board as Chief Financial Officer on 27 July 2018. In line with the reporting regulations, the single figure for Margherita reflects remuneration received in respect of services rendered as a Board Director (i.e. 2019 single figure reflects the period 27 July 2018 to 31 March 2019). This includes the value of performance share awards granted to her prior to her appointment to the Board which vest based on adjusted free cash flow performance over the three year period to 31 March 2020 (2020 single figure) and 31 March 2019 (2019 single figure).\n\n2. Taxable benefits include amounts in respect of: -- Private healthcare (2020: Nick Read \u00a32,583, Margherita Della Valle \u00a32,583; 2019: Nick Read \u00a32,612; Margherita Della Valle \u00a31,760); -- Cash car allowance \u00a319,200 p.a.; and -- Travel (2020: Nick Read \u00a319,759; Margherita Della Valle \u00a3325; 2019: Nick Read \u00a36,797; Margherita Della Valle \u00a3194).\n\n3. The share prices used for both the 2020 and 2019 values, as set out in note 4 below, are lower than the grant prices for both respective awards. As such, no amount of the values shown in either column are attributable to share price appreciation during the performance or vesting periods.\n\n4. The value shown in the 2019 column is the award which vested on 30 June 2019 and is valued using the execution share price on 30 June 2019 of 128.70 pence. The value shown in the 2020 column is the award which vests on 4 August 2020 in respect of Nick Read and 26 June 2020 in respect of Margherita Della Valle, and is valued using an average closing share price over the last quarter of the 2020 financial year of 139.95 pence.\n\n5. Nick Read receives a cash award equivalent in value to the dividends that would have been paid during the vesting period on any shares that vest. The dividend value shown in 2020 relates to awards vesting on 4 August 2020. Margherita Della Valle\u2019s figure reflects the value of dividend equivalent awards accrued during the performance period in respect of the award vesting on 30 June 2020.\n\n6. Reflects the value of the SAYE benefit which is calculated as \u00a3375 x 12 months x 20% to reflect the discount applied based on savings made during the year.\n\n7. In line with our SEC reporting requirements, total remuneration received by Margherita Della Valle in respect of the period 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019, inclusive of payments received whilst Deputy Chief Financial Officer, was \u00a31,467k.\n\n2020 annual bonus (\u2018GSTIP\u2019) payout (audited)\n\nIn the table below we disclose our achievement against each of the performance measures and targets in our annual bonus (GSTIP) and the resulting total annual bonus payout level for the year ended 31 March 2020 of 51.9% of maximum. This is applied to the maximum bonus level of 200% of base salary for each executive. Commentary on our performance against each measure is provided below the table.\n\n| Performance measure | Payout at maximum performance (% of salary) | Actual payout (% of salary) | Actual payout (% of overall bonus maximum) | Threshold performance level \u00a3bn | Target performance level \u00a3bn | Maximum performance level \u00a3bn | Actual performance level \u00a3bn |\n|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Service revenue     | 50%                                        | 24.2%                       | 12.1%                                      | 32.8                           | 34.5                       | 36.3                          | 34.5                        |\n| Adjusted EBIT       | 50%                                        | 27.1%                       | 13.5%                                      | 2.8                            | 3.7                        | 4.6                           | 3.8                         |\n| Adjusted free cash flow | 50%                                      | 30.5%                       | 15.3%                                      | 4.2                            | 5.0                        | 5.9                           | 5.2                         |\n| Customer appreciation KPIs | 50%                                      | 22.0%                       | 11.0%                                      | See below for further details |\n\nTotal annual bonus payout level 200% 103.8% 51.9%\n\nNote:\n\n1. These figures are adjusted for the impact of M&A, foreign exchange movements and any changes in accounting treatment.\nFinancial metrics\nAs set out in the table above, free cash flow and EBIT finished above the midpoints of the respective target ranges reflecting strong performance in markets including Germany, the UK, Egypt and Turkey. Service revenue finished slightly below the mid-point of our target range, mainly driven by performance in our largest European markets.\n\nCustomer appreciation KPIs\nAn assessment of performance under the customer appreciation KPIs measure was conducted on a market by market basis. Each market was assessed against a number of different metrics which included:\n\n- Churn is defined as total gross customer disconnections in the period divided by the average total customers in the period.\n- Revenue market share is based on our total service revenue and that of our competitors in the markets we operate in.\n- Net Promoter Score (NPS) for both Consumer and Vodafone Business \u2014 defined as the extent to which our customers would recommend us.\n\nAll measures utilise data from our local markets which is collected and validated for quality and consistency by independent third party agencies where possible.\n\nOur overall Customer Appreciation KPI outcome reflects a competitive environment in a number of our markets. Whilst performance remained stable or improved against a number of metrics in certain markets, the Committee agreed that a final payout below the mid-point of the target range was appropriate.\n\nGroup churn performance ended the year slightly down, although underlying performance was more favourable. In Europe we saw relatively stable performance in our main European markets of Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK, with both Italy and Spain improving their relative positioning compared to our peers. Overall this performance was offset by unfavourable performance in Turkey, where price competition negatively impacted churn rates in this market.\n\nOur revenue market share remained relatively stable during the year, with slight increases recorded in Germany, Italy, and the UK accompanied by an improvement in the gap to the market leader, and an improvement in position in Italy and the UK. Less favourable performance was recorded in Spain, where our market position also fell and the gap to the market leader increased. Elsewhere in Europe our operations faced competitive pressure in Romania, Czech Republic and Turkey, all of which recorded a fall in market position, although this was accompanied by positive performance in the form of narrowing the gap to the market leader in the cases of Romania and Czech Republic.\n\nNPS performance during the year saw a number of markets slightly fall in their Consumer NPS market position, including in Italy, the UK and Turkey. Notwithstanding this, we recorded positive performance in our European markets of Portugal and Albania, and African markets of Egypt and Ghana, where our position as market leader was extended. Market position movement was less prevalent in respect of Business NPS where we maintained our market position in the vast majority of markets where this measure is monitored. Notable movements included an extension in our leadership position in Italy and an unfavourable movement in our gap to the market leader in the UK and South Africa.\n\nIt is within this context that overall performance against our Customer Appreciation KPIs metrics during the year was judged to be below target. The aggregated performance for the regions and the Group is calculated on a revenue-weighted average to give an overall achievement:\n\n| Customer appreciation KPIs Achievement (% of maximum) |\n|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Europe                                               |\n| Africa                                               |\n| Group                                                |\n\n| 2020 annual bonus (GSTIP) amounts | Base salary \u00a3\u2019000 | Maximum bonus % of base salary | 2020 payout % of maximum | Actual payment \u00a3\u2019000 |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|\n| Nick Read                         | 1,050             | 200%                          | 51.9%                    | 1,090                |\n| Margherita Della Valle            | 700               | 200%                          | 51.9%                    | 727                  |\n\nVoluntary decision to receive short-term incentive in shares\nAs set out in the Letter from the Remuneration Committee Chairman, both Executive Directors have voluntarily agreed to receive their full 2020 short-term incentive in Vodafone shares as a sign of confidence in our business.\nLong-term incentive (\u2018GLTI\u2019) award vesting in August 2020 (audited)\n\nVesting outcome\n\nThe 2018 long-term incentive (\u2018GLTI\u2019) awards which were made to executives in August 2017 will vest at 50.4% of maximum in August 2020. The performance conditions for the three year period ending in the 2020 financial year are as follows:\n\n| Adjusted FCF performance \u2013 2/3 of total award (\u20acbn) | TSR outperformance \u2013 1/3 of total award | TSR peer group |\n|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Below threshold <14.75                             | Below threshold Below median           | Bharti         |\n| Threshold 14.75                                    | Threshold Median                       | BT Group       |\n| Maximum 18.45                                      | Maximum 10.0% p.a.                     | Liberty Global |\n|                                                   |                                        | Deutsche Telekom |\n|                                                   |                                        | MTN            |\n\nThe adjusted free cash flow for the three year period ended on 31 March 2020 was \u20ac17.2 billion and equates to vesting under the FCF element of 58.6% of maximum.\n\nThe chart to the right shows that our TSR performance over the three year period ended on 31 March 2020 was above that of the median of our comparator group and equates to vesting under the TSR element of 33.9% of maximum.\n\nWhen the weighting of each condition is applied to the respective performance outcomes, this results in a calculated payout of 50.4% of overall maximum.\n\nThe vesting impact of this outcome when applied to the number of shares granted is set out in the table below.\n\n| 2018 GLTI share awards subject to performance conditions vesting in June/August 2020 | Maximum number of shares | Adjusted free cash flow performance payout % of maximum | Relative TSR performance payout % of maximum | Weighted performance payout % of maximum | Number of shares vesting | Value of shares vesting ('000) |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Nick Read                                                                           | 1,673,437                | 58.6%                                                  | 33.9%                                       | 50.4%                                  | 843,412                  | \u00a31,181                      |\n| Margherita Della Valle1                                                              | 308,050                  | 65.5%                                                  | N/A                                         | 65.5%                                  | 201,895                  | \u00a3282                       |\n\nNote:\n1 These share awards subject to performance conditions reflect an award granted to Margherita Della Valle in June 2017 prior to her appointment to the Board (including dividend equivalent shares). The award was subject to adjusted free cash flow performance in line with the ranges outlined above and will vest in June 2020.\n\nSpecified procedures are performed by our internal audit team over the adjusted free cash flow to assist with the Committee\u2019s assessment of performance. The performance assessment in respect of the TSR measure is undertaken by Willis Towers Watson. Details of how the plan works can be found in the Remuneration Policy that was approved at the 2017 AGM.\n\nVoluntary extension of holding period\n\nThese share awards will vest on 4 August 2020 (26 June 2020 in respect of the award made to Margherita Della Valle) and both Executive Directors have committed to voluntarily hold all net vested shares for a full two year period post the vest date.\n\nLong-term incentive (\u2018GLTI\u2019) awarded during the year (audited)\n\nThe independent performance conditions for the 2020 long-term incentive awards made in June 2019, and subject to a three year performance period ending 31 March 2022, are adjusted free cash flow and TSR performance as follows:\n\n| Adjusted FCF performance (2/3 of total award) | Adjusted FCF performance (\u20acbn) | Vesting percentage (% of FCF element) |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Below threshold                               | <15.85                         | 0%                                    |\n| Threshold                                     | 15.85                          | 18%                                   |\n| Maximum                                       | 19.55                          | 100%                                  |\n\n| TSR performance (1/3 of total award) | TSR outperformance | Vesting percentage (% of TSR element) |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Below threshold                     | Below median       | 0%                                    |\n| Threshold                           | Median             | 18%                                   |\n| Maximum                             | 8.50% p.a.

The impact of this decision is reflected in the table below.\n\nAs set out in the Letter from the Remuneration Committee Chairman on page 97, in light of this experience and the current market volatility, the Committee is delaying the grant of the 2021 award until November 2020. This will allow the Committee to set an appropriate FCF target range and ensure the current exceptional market conditions do not inappropriately impact the grant conditions. Prior to the grant the Committee will consider a range of matters including, but not limited to, whether it is appropriate to use an average share price for the purpose of determining the number of shares subject to award granted. Further information will be provided in the market announcement following grant and disclosed in the 2021 Directors\u2019 Remuneration Report.\n\n### Outstanding awards\n\nThe structure for awards made in August 2018 (vesting August 2021) and June 2019 (vesting June 2022) is set out on the previous page. Further details on the structure of these awards, and relevant targets, can be found in the Annual Report on Remuneration of the relevant year.\n\n### All-employee share plans\n\nDuring the year the Executive Directors were eligible to participate in the Vodafone Group Sharesave Plan which is open to all UK employees.\n\nThe Vodafone Sharesave Plan is an HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) approved scheme open to all staff permanently employed by a Vodafone company in the UK as of the eligibility date. Options under the plan are granted at up to a 20% discount to market value. Executive Directors\u2019 participation is included in the option table on page 114.\n\n### Pensions (audited)\n\nDuring the 2020 financial year the Executive Directors received a cash allowance of 10% of base salary.\n\nMargherita Della Valle accrued benefits of \u00a39,999,996 under the defined contribution pension plan in respect of the period she served on the Board during the year. Neither Nick Read or Margherita Della Valle participated in a defined benefit scheme whilst an Executive Director.\n\nThe Executive Directors are provided benefits in the event of death in service. They also have an entitlement under a long-term disability plan from which 2/3 of base salary, up to a maximum benefit determined by the insurer, would be provided until the state pension age. In respect of the Executive Committee members, the Group has made aggregate contributions of \u00a3273,771 (2019: \u00a3264,818) into defined contribution pension schemes.\n\n### Alignment to shareholder interests (audited)\n\nCurrent levels of ownership by the Executive Directors, and the date by which the goal should be or should have been achieved, are shown below. The values are calculated using an average share price over the six months to 31 March 2020 of 147.73 pence.\n\nBased on this valuation price, both Executive Directors are currently below their shareholding requirements. In respect of Nick Read, this reflects an increase in the valuation of his holding from 402% of salary, as stated in the 2019 report, to 495% as stated in the table below. The number of shares Nick has beneficial ownership of has also increased from 2,825,550 to 3,516,841 over the same period. Margherita Della Valle joined the Board on 27 July 2018 and will continue to work towards achieving her goal prior to July 2023.\n\n### Dividend equivalents on the shares that vest are paid in cash after the vesting date.\n\n### Notes:\n\n1. Face value calculated based on the closing share price on 25 June 2019 (day immediately preceding the date of grant) of 124.2 pence.\n\nThe shareholding requirements include a post employment condition whereby the Executive Directors will need to continue to hold shares equivalent to the value of their requirement at the date of departure (or actual holding on departure if the requirement has not been reached during\nemployment) for a further two years post employment. The Committee has a number of processes in place to ensure this condition is met, including executives agreeing to these terms prior to receiving an award, executives holding the majority of their shares (and at least up to the value of their requirement) in a nominee rather than a personal account, and the Committee having the ability to lapse any unvested GLTI awards if the condition is not met.\n\nCollectively the Executive Committee including the Executive Directors owned 20,595,294 Vodafone shares at 31 March 2020, with a value of over \u00a330.4 million. None of the Executive Committee members\u2019 shareholdings amounts to more than 1% of the issued shares in that class of share, excluding treasury shares.\n\n**Directors\u2019 interests in the shares of the Company (audited)**\n\nA summary of interests in shares and scheme interests of the Directors who served during the year is given below. Margherita Della Valle\u2019s outstanding GLTR share award was granted prior to her appointment to the Board.

One ADR is equivalent to ten ordinary shares.\n\nAt 28 May 2020, and during the period from 1 April 2020 to 28 May 2020, no Director had any interest in the shares of any subsidiary company. Other than those individuals included in the tables above who were Board members at 31 March 2020, members of the Group\u2019s Executive Committee at 31 March 2020 had an aggregate beneficial interest in 16,038,933 ordinary shares of the Company. At 28 May 2020, the Directors had an aggregate beneficial interest in 5,622,774 ordinary shares of the Company and the Executive Committee members had an aggregate beneficial interest in 16,024,156 ordinary shares of the Company. The change in the number of shares held by the Executive Committee reflects a change in membership during this period. None of the Directors or the Executive Committee members had an individual beneficial interest amounting to greater than 1% of the Company\u2019s ordinary shares.\n\nThe Directors\u2019 total number of interests in shares did not change during the period from 1 April 2020 to 28 May 2020.\n\n**Performance share awards**\n\nThe maximum number of shares subject to outstanding awards that have been granted to Directors under the long-term incentive (GLTI) plan are currently as follows:\n\n| GLTI performance share awards | 2018 award | 2019 award | 2020 award |\n|------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Performance period ending: March 2020 | Performance period ending: March 2021 | Performance period ending: March 2022 |\n| Share price at grant: 224.0 pence | Share price at grant: 184.2 pence | Share price at grant: 124.2 pence |\n| Nick Read | 1,673,437 | 3,278,043 | 3,887,636 |\n| Margherita Della Valle | 260,764 | 1,995,330 | 2,366,387 |\n\n**Notes:**\n1.

Other than those individuals included in the table above, at 28 May 2020 members of the Group\u2019s Executive Committee held options for 52,242 ordinary shares at prices ranging from 102.6 pence to 189.2 pence per ordinary share, with a weighted average exercise price of 140.7 pence per ordinary share exercisable at dates ranging from 1 September 2020 to 1 March 2025.\n\nMargherita Della Valle, Hannes Ametsreiter, Aldo Bisio, Ant\u00f3nio Coimbra, Ahmed Essam, Shameel Joosub, Vinod Kumar, Rosemary Martin, Joakim Reiter, and Serpil Timuray held no options at 28 May 2020.\n\nLoss of office payments (audited)\nOther than amounts already disclosed in prior year reports, no loss of office payments were made during the year.\n\nPayments to past Directors (audited)\nDuring the 2020 financial year Lord MacLaurin received benefit payments in respect of security costs as per his contractual arrangements. These costs exceeded our de minimis threshold of \u00a35,000 p.a. and, including the tax paid, were \u00a323,513 (2019: \u00a323,186).\n\nFees retained for external non-executive directorships\nExecutive Directors may hold positions in other companies as non-executive directors and retain the fees.\n\nDuring the year ended 31 March 2020 Nick Read served as a non-executive director on the board of Booking Holdings Inc. where he retained fees of US$294,424 (2019: US$335,000). Margherita Della Valle served as a non-executive director on the board of Centrica plc until 12 May 2019 where she retained fees of \u00a311,270 (2019: \u00a366,651).\n\nPay in the wider context\nFair pay at Vodafone\nAs part of its review of executive remuneration arrangements, the Committee takes account of the pay policies in place across the wider business. This includes considering the structure of remuneration offerings at each level of the business to ensure there is a strong rationale for how packages evolve across the different levels of the organisation.\n\nDuring the year the Committee was updated on how remuneration arrangements were being reviewed across the business to ensure they fully aligned with our strategy, supported our purpose, and celebrated our spirit. The Committee was also informed of recent steps taken to enhance our global annual fair pay review, including how conditions and pay positions across our operations had been reviewed. The Committee was informed where the key focus areas were and what actions had been agreed locally to implement any required adjustments. In addition to being a core principle of the Committee, there is a clear culture in our business of ensuring we offer competitive and fair pay to all employees. Our approach, across our business, is guided by our six principles which are set out overleaf.\n1 Market competitive\nThe pay of our people is reflective of their skills, role and function and also the market data.\nWe annually review the pay of each person and actively manage any who fall below the market competitive range.\n\n2 Free from discrimination\nOur pay should not be affected by gender, age, disability, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, cultural background or belief.\nWe annually compare the average position of our males and females against their market benchmark, grade and function to identify and understand the differences.\n\n3 Ensure a good standard of living\nWe work with the independent organisation, Fair Wage Network, to assess how our pay compares to the \u201cliving wage\u201d in each of our markets as we are committed to providing a good standard of living for our people and their family.\n\n4 Share in our successes\nAll our people should have the opportunity to share in our success by being eligible to receive some form of performance related pay, e.g. a bonus, shares or sales incentive.\n\n5 Provide benefits for all\nOur global standard is to offer all our people life insurance and access to either Company or State provided healthcare and pension provision.\nGlobally, at Vodafone, all new mothers are offered at least 16 weeks fully paid maternity leave and can return to work for four days a week, paid five days for the first six months. All non-birthing partners are offered at least two weeks fully paid parental leave.\n\n6 Open and transparent\nWith a series of user friendly guides and an annual Reward Statement, which help explain our people\u2019s pay packages and outline the value of their core pay package, we ensure that our people understand their pay.\nIn addition they also receive monthly or weekly payslips and a payment schedule.\n\nStakeholder engagement\nThe Committee considers all stakeholder groups when setting executive pay including:\n\nColleagues\nThe Committee is fully briefed on pay arrangements across the business to ensure any decisions on executive pay are made within our wider business context. We engage with our employees through a variety of means including Employee Forums, Town Hall meetings (including with our executives), global annual people survey and digital platforms \u2013 all of which give our people the chance to voice their opinion on any area of interest \u2013 including executive pay.\n\nShareholders\nThe Committee values the active participation of our shareholders during our consultations and fully considers all feedback as part of the review process. This year we started our consultation in November 2019 (for the July 2020 AGM) to ensure all parties had adequate time for engagement.\n\nGovernment\nThe Committee actively engages with external professional bodies/government departments when they issue consultations on proposed changes to legislation/reporting guidelines.\n\nWider society\nThe Committee is fully aware that society has grown increasingly concerned about executive pay in the wider market. The Committee believes that through transparent reporting and active engagement in explaining both the operation of, and rationale for, executive pay decisions, trust in this area can be rebuilt.\n\nUK Gender Pay Gap reporting\nFor the last three years, we have published our UK Gender Pay Gap in line with the statutory UK methodology. We are aware that the nature of the statutory calculation means our UK Gender Pay Gap will fluctuate year-on-year, influenced by changes in our business structure and the percentage of men and women at all levels and positions.\n\nNotwithstanding this, through our commitment to embed diversity into our culture, with Inclusion for All being a key pillar of our purpose, we aim to reduce the gap over time. Our initiatives aim to support all women across different roles, areas, and geographies of our business and will, over time, reduce our specific UK Gender Pay Gap (which this year was calculated as 10.9% \u2014 a decrease from our prior year figure of 16.1%).\n\nThe existence of a UK gender pay gap in our business is primarily a consequence of more men than women holding senior or specialist, and therefore higher-paid, roles. We recognise the progress we are making but appreciate there is more to be done. Further details of our initiatives in this area, case studies from our colleagues, and key statistics can be found on our dedicated UK Gender Pay Gap webpage on www.vodafone.com/uk-gender-pay-gap.\nRelative spend on pay\nThe chart below shows both the dividends distributed in the year and the total cost of remuneration in the Group.\n\nFor more details on dividends and expenditure on remuneration for all employees, please see pages 174 and 204 respectively.\n\nRelative importance of spend on pay\n\n| Year | Distributed by way of dividends | Overall expenditure on remuneration for all employees |\n|------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2019 | 4,022                           | 5,267                                                |\n| 2020 | 2,317                           | 5,462                                                |\n\nCEO pay ratio\nThe following table sets out our CEO pay ratio figures in respect of 2020 and 2019:\n\n| Year | CEO Single Figure | Method | 25th percentile pay ratio | Median pay ratio | 75th percentile pay ratio |\n|------|-------------------|--------|---------------------------|------------------|---------------------------|\n| 2020 | \u00a33,714k           | Option B | 118:1                     | 73:1             | 47:1                      |\n| 2019 | \u00a34,359k           | Option B | 154:1                     | 107:1            | 56:1                      |\n\nNote:\n1 The CEO single figure used in the calculation of the 2019 ratios reflects a blended figure for Vittorio Colao and Nick Read, recognising the change in incumbency for the role during this year.\n\nYear Supporting Information | 25th percentile pay ratio | Median pay ratio | 75th percentile pay ratio |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|---------------------------|\n| 2020 Salary                 | \u00a328.0k                    | \u00a342.8k           | \u00a365.0k                    |\n| Total pay and benefits      | \u00a331.3k                    | \u00a351.1k           | \u00a378.6k                    |\n| 2019 Salary                 | \u00a323.1k                    | \u00a336.4k           | \u00a365.0k                    |\n| Total pay and benefits      | \u00a328.3k                    | \u00a340.8k           | \u00a378.2k                    |\n\nThe calculation methodology used reflects Option B as defined under the relevant regulations. In line with the relevant regulations this utilises the most recently collected and disclosed data analysed within our Gender Pay Gap report, with employees at the three quartiles identified from this analysis and their respective single figure values calculated.\n\nTo ensure this data accurately reflects individuals at such quartiles, the single figure values for individuals immediately above and below the identified employee at each quartile within the Gender Pay Gap analysis were also reviewed.\n\nThis year our ratios decreased when viewed on a year-on-year basis. This was partly driven by the methodology required for our 2019 ratio, which was a blended figure of our current Chief Executive and his predecessor. In normal years we expect the ratios to be primarily driven by the valuation of the long-term incentive that is included in the Chief Executive\u2019s single figure for the year.\n\nChange in the Chief Executive\u2019s remuneration between 2019 and 2020\nIn the table below we show the percentage change in the Chief Executive\u2019s remuneration (salary, taxable benefits and annual bonus payment) between the 2019 and 2020 financial years compared to the average for other Vodafone Group employees who are measured on comparable business objectives and who have been employed in the UK since 2019 (per capita). Vodafone has employees based all around the world and some of these individuals work in countries with very high inflation; therefore a comparison to Vodafone\u2019s UK-based Group employees is more appropriate than to all employees.\n\nIn line with the regulations, the table below calculates the percentage change in the Chief Executive\u2019s remuneration by comparing Nick Read\u2019s 2020 remuneration with his 2019 remuneration \u2013 the latter of which partly reflects his arrangement as Chief Financial Officer prior to his appointment as Chief Executive on 1 October 2018.\n\nDue to the timing of this change in role, this year\u2019s figures show higher changes than normal in respect of the role of Chief Executive (as it is not a like-for-like comparison). This is similar to how the 2019 figures showed a significant decrease, due to how Nick\u2019s 2019 figure (which as stated above includes an element of pay in respect of his previous role) was being compared to a 2018 figure which reflected a full-year Chief Executive figure in respect of his predecessor. Nick\u2019s salary has not changed since his appointment to the role of Chief Executive.\n\n| Item                  | Percentage change from 2019 to 2020 |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Base salary           | 10.9%                               |\n| Taxable benefits      | 44.8%                               |\n| Annual bonus          | 18.2%                               |\n| Other Vodafone Group employees employed in the UK | 5.1% | 0.1% | 30.8% |\nAssessing pay and performance\n\nIn the table below we summarise the Chief Executive\u2019s single figure remuneration over the past ten years, as well as how our variable pay plans have paid out in relation to the maximum opportunity. This can be compared with the historic TSR performance over the same period. The chart below shows the performance of the Company relative to the STOXX Europe 600 Index over a ten year period. The STOXX Europe 600 Index was selected as this is a broad-based index that includes many of our closest competitors. It should be noted that the payout from the long-term incentive plan is based on the TSR performance shown in the chart on page 111 and not this chart.\n\n### Ten year historical TSR performance\n\nGrowth in the value of a hypothetical \u20ac100 holding over ten years\n\n| Year | 2010 | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Value | 100  | 108  | 107  | 124  | 139  | 157  | 147  | 180  | 158  | 185  | 196  |\n\n### Financial year remuneration for Chief Executive\n\n| Year | Single figure of total remuneration \u00a3\u2019000 | Annual Bonus (actual award versus max opportunity) | Long-Term Incentive (vesting versus max opportunity) |\n|------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| 2010 | 7,022                                    | 62%                                              | 31%                                              |\n| 2011 | 15,767                                   | 47%                                              | 100%                                             |\n| 2012 | 11,099                                   | 33%                                              | 57%                                              |\n| 2013 | 8,014                                    | 44%                                              | 37%                                              |\n| 2014 | 2,810                                    | 56%                                              | 0%                                               |\n| 2015 | 5,224                                    | 58%                                              | 23%                                              |\n| 2016 | 6,332                                    | 47%                                              | 44%                                              |\n| 2017 | 7,389                                    | 64%                                              | 67%                                              |\n| 2018 | 2,740\u00b9                                   | 52%                                              | 40%                                              |\n| 2019 | 1,619\u00b2                                   |                                                  |                                                  |\n| 2020 | 3,714                                    |                                                  |                                                  |\n\nNotes:\n1.

This included a detailed discussion on the structure of remuneration offerings at each level of the business and how pay at these levels is determined. The Committee also considered the wider external context in light of the developing COVID-19 situation, and the commitments made to our wider employee population.\n\nThe cumulative effect of these discussions was that the Committee was able to make decisions in respect of executive remuneration within the context of how, and appreciating the rationale for why, remuneration arrangements evolve across the different levels within the organisation.\n\n2021 base salaries\n\nIn March 2020 the Committee reviewed executive remuneration arrangements against the following comparator groups:\n\n1) A EuroTop peer group constituting the top 50 European companies (excluding financial services companies) and a few other select companies relevant to the telco sector; and\n2) The FTSE 30 (excluding financial services companies).\n\nFollowing this review, the Committee agreed that the salaries for both the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer would remain unchanged at:\n\n- Chief Executive: Nick Read \u00a31,050,000; and\n- Chief Financial Officer: Margherita Della Valle \u00a3700,000.\n\nThe Committee further determined that salaries for Executive Committee members will also remain unchanged.\n\nPension\n\nPension arrangements for both the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer will remain unchanged at 10% of salary, in line with the maximum employer contribution level for the wider UK population.\n2021 Annual Bonus (\u2018GSTIP\u2019)\n\nAs set out on page 98 of the Letter from the Remuneration Committee Chairman, the Committee originally agreed at the March 2020 meeting that the annual bonus performance conditions and their respective weightings for 2021 should remain unchanged from 2020.\n\nHowever, in light of the uncertainty caused by COVID-19 and the subsequent difficulty in setting an appropriate service revenue target, it was agreed at the May 2020 meeting for this condition to be removed from the 2021 plan. The Committee believes this is important in maintaining the integrity of the targets set under the plan. The remaining measures will be retained and weighted as set out below:\n\n- adjusted EBIT (1/3);\n- adjusted free cash flow (1/3); and\n- customer appreciation KPIs (1/3). This includes an assessment of churn, revenue market share, and Net Promoter Score\\(^1\\) (\u2018NPS\u2019).\n\nNote:\n\\(^1\\) The assessment of NPS utilises data collected in our local markets which is validated for quality and consistency by independent third party agencies.\n\nDue to the potential impact on our commercial interests, annual bonus targets are considered commercially sensitive and therefore will be disclosed in the 2021 Remuneration Report following the completion of the financial year.\n\nLong-term incentive (\u2018GLTI\u2019) awards for 2021\n\nAwards for 2021 will be made in line with the arrangements described in our policy on pages 104 and 105. Vesting of the 2021 award will be subject to the performance of adjusted free cash flow, relative TSR, and ESG performance.\n\nAs set out in the Letter from the Remuneration Committee Chairman, the Committee will approve the 2021 awards prior to the planned November grant taking account of all information at the time. Whilst the normal weightings of our measures will be 60% on FCF, 30% on relative TSR, and 10% on ESG, the Committee will review these prior to the November 2020 grant and assess whether they remain appropriate for this grant in the context of the situation at the time. Notwithstanding this, in-line with feedback received during this year\u2019s shareholder consultation, the ESG measure will constitute 10% of the total award, and TSR will have a minimum weighting of 30%.\n\nFurther details for the 2021 award targets are provided below.\n\nAdjusted free cash flow\n\nAs set out in the Letter from the Remuneration Committee Chairman, due to the difficulty in setting an accurate and appropriate three year adjusted free cash flow target in the current environment prior to the date of this report\u2019s publication, the decision on the target range for this measure will be made closer to the time of the November 2020 grant. Details of the final range will be disclosed in the relevant market announcement at the time of grant, and published in the 2021 Directors\u2019 Remuneration Report.\n\nRelative TSR\n\nFollowing the annual review of the performance measures which included a review of analysis provided by the Committee\u2019s external advisers, the Committee determined that the TSR outperformance range for the 2021 award should continue to be set at the 80th percentile equivalent for maximum performance. For the 2021 award, this equates to outperformance of 8.50% p.a. at maximum. This is the same outperformance range as used under the 2020 award and remains at the top end of market practice in this area.\n\nThe Committee further determined that given the strategic importance of Germany as market to the wider business, the TSR peer group should be expanded to include Telef\u00f3nica Deutschland.\n\n| TSR peer group | BT Group | Deutsche Telekom | Liberty Global | MTN | Orange | Royal KPN | Telecom Italia | Telef\u00f3nica | Telef\u00f3nica Deutschland |\n|----------------|----------|------------------|----------------|-----|--------|-----------|---------------|-------------|-----------------------|\n| TSR outperformance | Below threshold | Below median | 0.0% | Threshold | Median | 20.0% | Maximum | 8.50% p.a. (80th percentile equivalent) | 100.0% |\n\nLinear interpolation (i.e. straight-line vesting) occurs for performance between threshold and maximum.\nESG\n\nThe Committee is aware of the importance of linking any non-financial measures to quantifiable and robust targets. When consulting with our shareholders, the Committee\u2019s proposal to link the new ESG element of the GLTI award directly to our purpose and the associated externally communicated ambitions and targets, received strong support.\n\nThe table below sets out how performance under the ESG measure will be assessed against three quantitative ambitions:\n\n| Purpose pillar | Metric for 2021 GLTI | Overall ambition | Baseline position for 2021 GLTI | Ambition for 2021 GLTI |\n|---------------|----------------------|------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Planet        | Greenhouse gas reduction | 50% reduction from FY17 baseline by 2025 | 11% reduction from FY17 baseline at 31 March 2020 | 40% reduction from FY17 baseline by 31 March 2023 |\n| Inclusion for All | Women in management | 40% of women in management by 2030 | 31% of women in management at 31 March 2020 | 34% of women in management by 31 March 2023 |\n| Digital Society | M-Pesa connections | Connect >50m people and their families to mobile money by 2025 | 40.5m connections at 31 March 2020 | 56m connections by 31 March 2023 |\n\nEach ambition for the 2021 award has been set by considering both our externally communicated target, and our internal progress as at 31 March 2020. Where we are ahead of our originally communicated external ambition, for example in M-Pesa connections, we have set our target recognising this so as to ensure all ambitions remain stretching against actual current performance.\n\nAt the end of the performance period the Committee will assess achievement across the three metrics against the stated ambitions and determine vesting under this element. Full disclosure of the rationale for the final vesting decision will be provided in the relevant Directors\u2019 Remuneration Report.\n\nFurther details on our initiatives and progress during the year in respect of the three pillars of our purpose can be found on pages 40 to 47.\n\n2021 remuneration for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors\n\nFor the 2020 review the fees for our Chairman and Non-Executive Directors have been benchmarked against the FTSE 30 (excluding financial services companies). Following the review it was agreed that no changes will be made to the current fee levels which are set out in the table below.\n\n| Position/role | Fee payable \u00a3\u2019000 |\n|---------------|-------------------|\n| Chairman1     | 650               |\n| Non-Executive Director | 115             |\n| Additional combined fee for Senior Independent Director and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee | 50 |\n| Additional fee for Chairmanship of Audit and Risk Committee | 25 |\n\nNote:\n1 The Chairman\u2019s fee also includes the fee for the Chairmanship of the Nominations and Governance Committee.\n\nSubject to shareholder approval, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois van Boxmeer will join the Board as a Non-Executive Director following the AGM on 28 July 2020. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois will receive a fee in respect of this role in line with our approach set out above. Upon his appointment as Chairman, the fee paid to Jean-Fran\u00e7ois will change to reflect the fee paid for the role of Chairman (as also set out in the table above). Both fees will be pro-rated to reflect time served in each position during the year.\n\nFor 2021 the allowance payable each time a non-Europe-based Non-Executive Director eligible for this legacy arrangement is required to travel to attend Board and Committee meetings to reflect the additional time commitment involved is \u00a36,000.\n\nFurther remuneration information\n\nDilution\n\nAll awards are made under plans that incorporate dilution limits as set out in the guidelines for share incentive schemes published by the Investment Association. The current estimated dilution from subsisting executive awards is approximately 2.6% of the Company\u2019s share capital at 31 March 2020 (2.7% at 31 March 2019), whilst from all-employee share awards it is approximately 0.3% (0.3% at 31 March 2019). This gives a total dilution of 2.9% (3.0% at 31 March 2019).\n\nService contracts\n\nThe terms and conditions of appointment of our Directors are available for inspection at the Company\u2019s registered office during normal business hours and at the annual general meeting (for 15 minutes prior to the meeting and during the meeting). The Executive Directors have notice periods in their service contracts of 12 months. The Non-Executive Directors\u2019 letters of appointment do not contain provision for notice periods or for compensation if their appointments are terminated.\n\nThis report on remuneration has been approved by the Board of Directors and signed on its behalf by:\n\nValerie Gooding\nChairman of the Remuneration Committee\n26 May 2020\nOur US listing requirements\n\nAs Vodafone\u2019s American depositary shares are listed on NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (\u2018NASDAQ\u2019), we are required to disclose a summary of any material differences between the corporate governance practices we follow and those of US companies listed on NASDAQ. Vodafone\u2019s corporate governance practices are primarily based on UK requirements but substantially conform to those required of US companies listed on NASDAQ. The material differences are set out in the following table:\n\n| Board member independence | Different tests of independence for Board members are applied under the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code and the NASDAQ listing rules. The Board is not required to take into consideration NASDAQ\u2019s detailed definitions of independence as set out in the NASDAQ listing rules. The Board has carried out an assessment based on the independence requirements of the Code and has determined that, in its judgement, each of Vodafone\u2019s Non-Executive Directors is independent within the meaning of those requirements. |\n| Committees | The NASDAQ listing rules require US companies to have a nominations committee, an audit committee and a compensation committee, each composed entirely of independent directors, with the nominations committee and the audit committee each required to have a written charter which addresses the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities, and the compensation committee having sole authority and adequate funding to engage compensation consultants, independent legal counsel and other compensation advisers. |\n| | \u2013 Our Nominations and Governance Committee is chaired by the Chairman of the Board and its other members are independent Non-Executive Directors. |\n| | \u2013 Our Remuneration Committee is composed entirely of independent Non-Executive Directors. |\n| | \u2013 Our Audit and Risk Committee is composed entirely of Non-Executive Directors, each of whom (i) the Board has determined to be independent based on the independence requirements of the Code and (ii) meets the independence requirements of the Securities Exchange Act 1934. |\n| | \u2013 We have terms of reference for our Nominations and Governance Committee, Audit and Risk Committee and Remuneration Committee, each of which complies with the requirements of the Code and is available for inspection on our website at vodafone.com/governance. |\n| | \u2013 These terms of reference are generally responsive to the relevant NASDAQ listing rules, but may not address all aspects of these rules. |\n| Code of Ethics and Code of Conduct | Under the NASDAQ listing rules, US companies must adopt a Code of Conduct applicable to all directors, officers and employees that complies with the definition of a \u201ccode of ethics\u201d set out in section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. |\n| | \u2013 We have adopted a Code of Ethics that complies with section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which is applicable only to the senior financial and principal executive officers, and which is available on our website at vodafone.com/governance. |\n| | \u2013 We have also adopted a separate Code of Conduct which applies to all employees. |\n| Quorum | The quorum required for shareholder meetings, in accordance with our Articles of Association, is two shareholders, regardless of the level of their aggregate share ownership, while US companies listed on NASDAQ are required by the NASDAQ listing rules to have a minimum quorum of 33.33% of the shareholders of ordinary shares for shareholder meetings. |\n| Related party transactions | In lieu of obtaining an independent review of related party transactions for conflicts of interests in accordance with the NASDAQ listing rules, we seek shareholder approval for related party transactions that (i) meet certain financial thresholds or (ii) have unusual features in accordance with the Listing Rules issued by the FCA in the UK (the \u2018Listing Rules\u2019), the Companies Act 2006 and our Articles of Association. |\n| | Further, we use the definition of a transaction with a related party as set out in the Listing Rules, which differs in certain respects from the definition of related party transaction in the NASDAQ listing rules. |\n| Shareholder approval | When determining whether shareholder approval is required for a proposed transaction, we comply with both the NASDAQ listing rules and the Listing Rules. Under the NASDAQ listing rules, whether shareholder approval is required for a transaction depends on, among other things, the percentage of shares to be issued or sold in connection with the transaction. Under the Listing Rules, whether shareholder approval is required for a transaction depends on, among other things, whether the size of a transaction exceeds a certain percentage of the size of the listed company undertaking the transaction. |\nDirectors\u2019 report\n\nThe Directors of the Company present their report together with the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2020.\n\nThis report has been prepared in accordance with requirements outlined within The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and forms part of the management report as required under Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule (DTR) 4.

Subsidiaries exempt from audit\n\nFor more information\nDirectors\u2019 statement of responsibility\n\nThe Directors are responsible for preparing the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations and keeping proper accounting records. Detailed below are statements made by the Directors in relation to their responsibilities, disclosure of information to the Company\u2019s auditor, going concern and management\u2019s report on internal control over financial reporting.\n\nFinancial statements and accounting records\n\nCompany law of England and Wales requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the Group at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those financial statements the Directors are required to:\n\n- select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;\n- make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;\n- present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;\n- state whether the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted for use in the EU and Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulations. The Directors also ensure that the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB);\n- state for the Company\u2019s financial statements whether applicable UK accounting standards have been followed; and\n- prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and the Group will continue in business.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and of the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and for the consolidated financial statements, Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for the system of internal control, for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and, hence, for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company\u2019s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\nDirectors\u2019 responsibility statement\n\nEach of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on pages 76 and 77 confirms that, to the best of his or her knowledge:\n\n- the consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB and IFRS as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group;\n- the parent company financial statements, prepared in accordance with United Kingdom generally accepted accounting practice, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Company; and\n- the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group, together with a description and robust assessment of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.\n\nThe Directors are also responsible under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its members as a whole and in doing so have regard for the needs of wider society and stakeholders, including customers, consistent with the Group\u2019s core and sustainable business objectives.\n\nHaving taken advice from the Audit and Risk Committee, the Board considers the report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and that it provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company\u2019s position and performance, business model and strategy.\n\nNeither the Company nor the Directors accept any liability to any person in relation to the Annual Report except to the extent that such liability could arise under English law. Accordingly, any liability to a person who has demonstrated reliance on any untrue or misleading statement or omission shall be determined in accordance with section 90A and schedule 10A of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.\n\nDisclosure of information to the auditors\n\nHaving made the requisite enquiries, so far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined by section 418(3) of the Companies Act 2000) of which the Company\u2019s auditor is unaware and the Directors have taken all the steps they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company\u2019s auditor is aware of that information.\nDirectors\u2019 statement of responsibility (continued)\n\nGoing concern\nThe Group\u2019s business activities, performance, position, principal risks and uncertainties and the Directors\u2019 assessment of its long-term viability are set out in the Strategic Report on page 71.\n\nIn addition, the funding position of the Group included in \u201cBorrowings\u201d and \u201cCapital and financial risk management\u201d in notes 21 and 22, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements. Notes 21 and 22 include disclosure in relation to the Group\u2019s objectives, policies and processes for managing as well as details regarding its capital, its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk. As noted on page 193, the Group has access to substantial cash and financing facilities.\n\nThe Group also believes it adequately manages or mitigates its solvency and liquidity risks through two primary processes, described below.\n\nBusiness planning process and performance management\nThe Group\u2019s forecasting and planning cycle consists of three in-year forecasts, a budget and a long-range plan. These generate income statement, cash flow and net debt projections for assessment by Group management and the Board. Each forecast is compared with prior forecasts and actual results so as to identify variances and understand the drivers of the changes and their future impact so as to allow management to take action where appropriate. Additional analysis is undertaken to review and sense check the key assumptions underpinning the forecasts.\n\nCash flow and liquidity reviews\nThe business planning process provides outputs for detailed cash flow and liquidity reviews, to ensure that the Group maintains adequate liquidity throughout the forecast periods. The prime output is a one year liquidity forecast which is prepared and updated on a daily basis which highlights the extent of the Group\u2019s liquidity based on controlled cash flows and the headroom under the Group\u2019s undrawn revolving credit facility (\u2018RCF\u2019). The key inputs into this forecast are:\n\n- free cash flow forecasts, with the first three months\u2019 inputs being sourced directly from the operating companies (analysed on a daily basis), with information beyond this taken from the latest forecast/budget cycle;\n- bond and other debt maturities; and\n- expectations for shareholder returns, spectrum auctions and M&A activity.\n\nThe liquidity forecast shows two scenarios assuming either maturing commercial paper is refinanced or no new commercial paper issuance. The liquidity forecast is reviewed by the Group Chief Financial Officer and included in each of her reports to the Board. In addition, the Group continues to manage its foreign exchange and interest rate risks within the framework of policies and guidelines authorised and reviewed by the Board, with oversight provided by the Treasury Risk Committee.\n\nCOVID-19\nThe potential impact of COVID-19 on the Group has been considered as part of the going concern assessment. The Directors have reviewed the liquidity forecasts for the Group, which have been updated for the expected impact of COVID-19 on trading. The Directors have also considered sensitivities in respect of potential downside scenarios in concluding that the Group is able to continue in operation for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approving the consolidated financial statements. Those sensitivities include a downside scenario for COVID-19 on trading performance, exclusion of cash collateral received under the Group\u2019s collateral support agreements, and non-refinancing of debt maturities in the assessment period. In addition to the liquidity forecasts prepared, the Director\u2019s considered the availability of both the Group\u2019s \u20ac7.7 billion revolving credit facilities, undrawn as at 31 March 2020, and mitigating actions should they be required.\n\nIn reaching its conclusion on the going concern assessment, the Directors also considered the findings of the work performed to support the statement on the long-term viability of the Group. As noted on pages 70 and 71, this included key changes to the principal risks relevant to the sustainability of our operations in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, sensitivity analysis, scenario assessments, and combinations thereof, including that of a longer-term global recession with likely impacts beyond 2020.\n\nConclusion\nBased on the review the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and accounts.\n\nControls over financial reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Group.\n\nThe Group\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that:\n\n- pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets;\n- are designed to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the EU and IFRS as issued by the IASB, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorisation of management and the Directors of the Company; and\n- provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition of the Group\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nAny internal control framework, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures, and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or because the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nBy Order of the Board\n\nRosemary Martin\nGroup General Counsel and Company Secretary\n28 May 2020\nAudit report on the consolidated and Company financial statements\n\nIndependent auditor\u2019s report to the members of Vodafone Group Plc\n\nOpinion\n\nIn our opinion:\n\n\u2013 Vodafone Group Plc\u2019s Consolidated financial statements and Company financial statements (the \u201cfinancial statements\u201d) give a true and fair view of the state of the Group\u2019s and of the Company\u2019s affairs as at 31 March 2020 and of the Group\u2019s loss for the year then ended;\n\n\u2013 the Consolidated financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;\n\n\u2013 the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and\n\n\u2013 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, and, as regards the Consolidated financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.\n\nWe have audited the financial statements of Vodafone Group Plc which comprise:\n\n| Group                                      | Company                                      |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 March 2020 | Company statement of financial position as at 31 March 2020 |\n| Consolidated income statement for the year then ended | Company statement of changes in equity for the year then ended |\n| Consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended | Related notes 1 to 11 to the financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies |\n| Consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended | Consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended |\n| Consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended | Related notes 1 to 34 to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies |\n\nThe financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 \u201cReduced Disclosure Framework\u201d (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).\n\nBasis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor\u2019s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report below. We are independent of the Group and Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC\u2019s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nConclusions relating to principal risks, going concern and viability statement\n\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following information in the Annual Report, in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to:\n\n\u2013 the disclosures in the annual report set out on pages 62 to 70 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;\n\n\u2013 the directors\u2019 confirmation set out on page 71 in the annual report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the entity, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;\n\n\u2013 the directors\u2019 statement set out on page 126 in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the entity\u2019s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;\n\n\u2013 whether the directors\u2019 statement in relation to going concern required under the Listing Rules in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or\n\n\u2013 the directors\u2019 explanation set out on page 71 in the annual report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the entity, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the entity will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.\nOverview of our audit approach\n\nKey audit matters\n\n- Revenue recognition\n- Carrying value of goodwill\n- Recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets on tax losses \u2013 Luxembourg\n- Assessment of contingent liabilities\n- Valuation of identifiable intangible assets for the acquisition of European Liberty Global assets (new in FY20)\n\nAudit scope\n\n- We performed an audit of the complete financial information of 10 components, specified audit procedures on specific balances for a further 9 components and other procedures on the remaining 243 components.\n- The components where we performed full audit procedures accounted for 80% of Adjusted EBITDA and 76% of Revenue. The components where we performed specified procedures accounted for 5% of Revenue.\n\nMateriality\n\n- Overall Group materiality of \u20ac282m has been calculated based on adjusted EBITDA calculations as defined in the \u2018Our application of materiality\u2019 section of this report. This materiality amount represents approximately 2% of the Group\u2019s adjusted EBITDA as reported in Note 2 in the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nFirst year audit transition\n\nThe year ended 31 March 2020 is our first as auditor of the Group. We commenced transition at the start of the audit professional engagement period on 1 April 2019 including shadowing the previous auditor through the 31 March 2019 audit, such as attendance at certain close meetings and the Audit and Risk Committee meeting. Subsequently, audit transition activities focussed on the following areas:\n\nMobilisation of the global audit team:\n\n- We held an onboarding and transition programme in London, attended by the Group audit team, Finance Shared Service Centre audit team, all full scope and specified procedures scope audit teams and the most significant statutory audit teams. Over three days approximately 70 colleagues attended sessions on group audit strategy, key audit risks, deployment of technologies, approach to controls testing, division of responsibilities between teams for centralised audit procedures and our approach to ensuring a consistent high audit quality.\n- An equivalent Vodacom Group onboarding and transition programme was led by our South Africa audit team. This event repeated the key sessions from the onboarding and transition programme in London described above, with the Group audit team partners and IT specialist attending and delivering sessions throughout the event.\n- Prior to the half year interim review, the Group audit team made site visits to the key audit locations. This provided us with the opportunity to develop our understanding of the business, meet with local management, evaluate the audit transition progress of component audit teams and provide early direction of the audit strategy at key locations.\n\nEstablishing our audit base prior to reaching our interim review conclusion for the six months ended 30 September 2019:\n\n- We evaluated all key accounting judgement papers and the Group\u2019s accounting policies.\n- We undertook reviews of the predecessor auditor files to consider working papers in relation to significant audit risk matters, to identify and assess the judgements exercised over these risks and to assess the nature, timing and extent of audit procedures performed in forming the prior year auditor opinion.\n- Prior to signing the interim review opinion, we had understood and walked through the key processes at Group and in the full scope audit locations.\nKey audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nRevenue recognition\n\nRisk\n\nAs more fully described in Note 2, Note 14 and Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group reported revenue of \u20ac44,974 million (FY19: \u20ac43,666 million), contract assets of \u20ac3,563 million (FY19: \u20ac4,202 million) and contract liabilities of \u20ac2,603 million (FY19: \u20ac2,392 million) at 31 March 2020. Management records revenue according to the principles of IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, including following the 5-step model therein. Under IFRS 15, management must determine if there are separate performance obligations for the services and goods it provides to customers and assign values thereto, based on the selling prices of goods or services in separate transactions under similar conditions to similar customers (the \u201cstand-alone selling price\u201d).\n\nDetermining the stand-alone selling price and therefore the allocation of revenue to the different performance obligations, which impacts timing of the related revenue recognition, is complex and judgemental. In addition, auditing the revenue recorded by the Group is complex due to the multiple IT systems and tools utilised in the initiation, processing and recording of transactions, which includes a high volume of individually low monetary value transactions. Complex auditor judgement was involved, and IT professionals were utilised, in the design of the audit approach and testing of IT systems and automated processes, as well as manual adjustments made to the underlying data recorded by the IT systems, to recognise revenue in accordance with IFRS 15.\n\nWe have also identified a risk of management override through inappropriate manual topside revenue journal entries as revenue is a key performance indicator, both in external communication and for management incentives.\n\nOur response to the risk\n\nWe performed full or specified audit procedures over this risk area in 8 full scope and 2 specified procedure components with significant revenue streams, which covered 81% of the Group\u2019s revenue.\n\nOur audit procedures included, among others, obtaining an understanding of, evaluating the design and testing the operating effectiveness of controls over the Group\u2019s revenue recognition process, which includes management\u2019s review of contracts, their identification of performance obligations, the estimation of the relative standalone selling price for each performance obligation, and the determination of the timing of revenue recorded. We also evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the processing of billing data, assisted by our IT professionals.\n\nWe evaluated management\u2019s accounting policies and the methodology used by management to determine the standalone selling price, where relevant.\n\nIn addition, our audit procedures included, testing of reconciliations between the data records from the billing systems to the general ledger. Also, on a sample of basis:\n\n\u2013 we tested the accuracy of the billing data used in the IFRS 15 accounting process;\n\u2013 assessed the determination of performance obligations;\n\u2013 compared the standalone selling price to observable pricing;\n\u2013 recalculated the allocation of revenue between performance obligations and the revenue recognised during the period; and\n\u2013 tested the associated manual and automated adjustments posted in the general ledger to record revenue.\n\nWe also assessed the adequacy of the Group\u2019s disclosures in respect to the accounting policies on revenue recognition.\n\nKey observations communicated to the Audit and Risk Committee\n\nBased on the procedures performed, we consider the recognition of revenue to be appropriate for the year ended 31 March 2020. Furthermore, we consider the disclosures appropriate.\nCarrying value of goodwill\n\nRisk\n\nAs more fully described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group calculates the value in use (\u2018VIU\u2019) for cash generating units (\u2018CGU\u2019) to determine whether an adjustment to the carrying value of the CGU, and therefore, goodwill, is required. As of 31 March 2020, the Group has recorded \u20ac31,271 million of goodwill and recognised impairment losses in the year of \u20ac1,685 million, primarily in respect of its Spain and Ireland CGUs.\n\nThe Group\u2019s assessment of the VIU of its CGUs involves estimation about the future performance of the local market businesses. In particular, the determination of the VIUs was sensitive to the significant assumptions of projected adjusted EBITDA growth, long-term growth rates, and discount rates. The estimation uncertainty increased at the end of the year as a result of the effects of COVID-19 on the macroeconomic factors used in developing the assumptions.\n\nAuditing the Group\u2019s annual impairment test was complex, given the significant judgement related to assumptions described above and data used in the VIU models and the sensitivity of the VIU models to fluctuations in assumptions, particularly as it relates to the Spain and Ireland CGUs.\n\nOur response to the risk\n\nThe recoverability of the Group\u2019s goodwill balances was subject to full scope audit procedures performed by the Primary audit team with support from relevant component audit teams on certain procedures.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Group\u2019s goodwill impairment review process. This included testing management\u2019s controls over their review of the significant assumptions used in determining the VIU of the CGUs, including projected adjusted EBITDA growth, long-term growth rates, and discount rates.\n\nTo test the determination of the VIU of the Group\u2019s goodwill, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the CGUs identified and testing the allocation of assets and liabilities to the carrying value of each CGU.\n\nWe also tested the methodology applied in the VIU models, as compared to the requirements of IAS 36, Impairment of Assets, including the mathematical accuracy of management\u2019s model. We performed audit procedures to test and assess the significant assumptions used in the VIU models, including projected adjusted EBITDA growth, long-term growth rates, and discount rates, for example by comparing them to external data such as economic and industry forecasts for the relevant markets. For management\u2019s assessment of implied recoverable value, we compared CGU EBITDA multiples to market listed peers. We performed an analysis of the significant assumptions to evaluate the sensitivity of the VIU models to fluctuations in the assumptions.\n\nFor each CGU, we compared the cash flow projections used in the VIU models to the information approved by the Group\u2019s Board of Directors and evaluated the historical accuracy of management\u2019s business plans, which underpin the VIU models.\n\nWe also assessed the adjustments applied by management to reflect the estimated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, by reference to the nature of the revenue streams in each market and the COVID-19 related restrictions in place to the economic forecasts for each market and other external data as at 31 March 2020. In addition, we performed downside sensitivity analyses on management\u2019s COVID-19 adjustments.\n\nWe involved a valuation specialist in our team to assist us with certain of these audit activities.\n\nWe also assessed the adequacy of the related disclosures provided in Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements, in particular the sensitivity disclosures and the estimated impact of COVID-19 on the Group\u2019s forecast cash flows.\n\nKey observations communicated to the Audit and Risk Committee\n\nWe considered the approach adopted for modelling the impact of COVID-19 for each market relative to the sectors they serve, and the duration thereof, to be reasonable based on facts and circumstances known at 31 March 2020. We concur with management\u2019s conclusion to recognise impairment charges totalling \u20ac1,685 million in respect of Spain, Ireland, Romania and Vodafone Automotive. For all the other CGUs, we concur with the conclusions reached in respect of the carrying value of goodwill.\nRecognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets on tax losses \u2013 Luxembourg\n\nRisk\n\nAs more fully described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group recognises deferred tax assets based on their estimated recoverability and whether management judge that it is probable that there will be sufficient and suitable taxable profits in the relevant legal entity or tax group against which to utilise the assets in the future.\n\nA deferred tax asset in Luxembourg of \u20ac20,544 million (FY19: \u20ac21,425 million) has been recognised in respect of losses, as management concluded it is probable that the Luxembourg entities will continue to generate taxable profits in the future against which they can utilise these assets. The Luxembourg companies\u2019 income is derived from the Group\u2019s internal financing and procurement and roaming activities.\n\nAuditing the Group\u2019s recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets in Luxembourg is significant to the audit because it involves material amounts, and the judgements and estimates in relation to future taxable profits and the period of time over which it is expected to utilise these assets results in increased estimation uncertainty.\n\nOur response to the risk\n\nAudit procedures on the recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets on tax losses in Luxembourg were performed by the Primary audit team and its tax specialists with support from Luxembourg tax and transfer pricing specialists on certain procedures.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of management\u2019s controls around the recognition of deferred tax assets in Luxembourg, including the calculation of the gross amount of deferred tax assets recorded, the preparation of the prospective financial information used to determine the Group\u2019s future taxable income, the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, and management\u2019s identification and use of available commercial strategies.\n\nTo test the realisability of the deferred tax assets in Luxembourg, with the support of tax specialists, our audit procedures included, among others:\n\n\u2013 evaluating management\u2019s position on the availability of the losses and with respect to local tax law and tax planning strategies adopted;\n\u2013 corroborated the developments in the forecast taxable income since the prior year to supporting evidence and other areas of our audit;\n\u2013 evaluated the consistency of future interest rates utilised in the forecasts with market expectations and considered the potential impact of COVID-19 on forecast interest rates as at the balance sheet date; and\n\u2013 assessed whether contrary evidence exists that was not consistent with either management\u2019s stated intention that the financing structures will remain in place or that it was probable that future taxable profits will exist.\n\nWe also considered the adequacy of the Group\u2019s disclosures in Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements as to the basis for recognition of the asset and the longevity of the utilisation period.\n\nKey observations communicated to the Audit and Risk Committee\n\nWe concur with the recognition of the deferred tax assets on the basis of forecast cashflows and that the long recoverability period was supported by management\u2019s intention to maintain the level of financing income in Luxembourg.\nAssessment of contingent liabilities\n\nRisk\n\nAs more fully described in Note 29 to the consolidated financial statements, there are a number of ongoing threatened and actual legal, regulatory and taxation claims and disputes across the Group. Provisions are recorded if it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be estimated reliably.\n\nAuditing the Group\u2019s recorded provisions and disclosed contingent liabilities at 31 March 2020 required significant auditor judgement in assessing management\u2019s expectations of the outcome of matters as it pertains to (i) Indian withholding taxes on the acquisition of Hutchison Essar Limited; and (ii) the Group\u2019s exposure under a contingent liability mechanism agreed on the formation of Vodafone Idea Limited (\u2018VIL\u2019), both of which constitute a material exposure to the Group.\n\nOur response to the risk\n\nAudit procedures on these legal proceedings and assessment of contractual obligations were performed by the Primary audit team.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of management\u2019s controls over the identification, estimation, monitoring and disclosure of contingent liabilities and provisions related to claims and disputes.\n\nOur audit procedures included, among others, discussing these matters with the Group litigation team and Group general counsel to understand and assess management\u2019s basis for determining the accounting and disclosures made for significant disputes or claims. With respect to the Indian withholding tax and VIL matters:\n\nIndian withholding tax:\nWe inspected underlying source documentation, including the court judgement, arbitration related submissions and third-party analyses of the case to understand and assess the facts of the various claims, counter claims and status of ongoing proceedings. In addition to the discussions with Group personnel, as described above, we held direct discussions with external legal counsel engaged by management to support the Group in defending the Indian withholding tax claim, to assist us in evaluating management\u2019s assessment of the claim and obtained and evaluated audit inquiry letters received from them.\n\nVIL \u2013 Contingent Liability Mechanism (\u2018VIL CLM\u2019):\nWe inspected written legal advice obtained by management from external legal counsel and held direct discussions with such counsel to understand the contractual terms and operation of the VIL CLM and to assist us in evaluating management\u2019s assessment of the likelihood and expected outcome of various scenarios that could impact the accounting for the Group\u2019s obligation under the VIL CLM. An EY legal professional assisted us in assessing certain aspects of the VIL CLM.\n\nIn addition, we assessed the significant uncertainties in relation to VIL\u2019s ability to further settle liabilities in relation to the Adjusted Gross Revenue judgement described in Note 29 of the consolidated financial statements, based on available information and consequently management\u2019s assessment if it was probable, at the balance sheet date, that the Group would be required to settle liabilities under the VIL CLM.\n\nWe assessed the adequacy of the disclosures included in Note 12 and Note 29 of the consolidated financial statements for these matters.\n\nKey observations communicated to the Audit and Risk Committee\n\nIndian withholding tax:\nBased on the current status of proceedings and the opinion of the Group\u2019s external legal counsel, we concur with management\u2019s conclusion that it is not probable that a present obligation exists at the balance sheet date, and accordingly no provision is required as at 31 March 2020. We agree that disclosure as a contingent liability set out in Note 29 of the consolidated financial statements remains appropriate.\n\nVIL \u2013 Contingent Liability Mechanism:\nBased on the facts and circumstances as at 31 March 2020, including the contractual terms of the mechanism, we concur with management\u2019s conclusion that it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle any further obligation to VIL under the agreement beyond the \u20ac235 million provision recognised at the balance sheet date. We agree the disclosure of any further potential exposure as a contingent liability set out in Note 29 of the consolidated financial statements is appropriate.\nValuation of identifiable intangible assets for the acquisition of European Liberty Global assets (new in FY20)\n\nRisk\n\nAs more fully described in Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements, on 31 July 2019, the Group completed the acquisition of a 100% interest in Unitymedia GmbH (\u2018Unitymedia\u2019) and Liberty Global\u2019s operations (excluding its \u201cDirect Home\u201d business) in the Czech Republic (\u2018UPC Czech\u2019), Hungary (\u2018UPC Hungary\u2019) and Romania (\u2018UPC Romania\u2019) (collectively, \u201cthe Liberty Business\u201d) for an aggregate net cash consideration of \u20ac10,313 million. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting whereby the total purchase price which resulted in the recognition of identifiable intangible assets of \u20ac5,818 million and goodwill of \u20ac11,504 million.\n\nAuditing the valuation of identifiable intangible assets involved complex auditor judgement, due to the estimation uncertainty and the application of valuation techniques built, in part, on assumptions around the future performance of the Liberty Business, including assumptions impacted by future events, such as revenue growth rates, customer churn rates, EBITDA growth rates (primarily synergies) and capital expenditures. Changes in these assumptions can have a material effect on the valuation of identifiable intangible assets.\n\nGiven the significance of Unitymedia Germany to the overall Liberty Business, our procedures primarily focussed on the valuation of the acquired identifiable intangible assets for Unitymedia.\n\nOur response to the risk\n\nAudit procedures on the purchase price allocation were performed by the Primary audit team with support from the Germany component audit team on certain procedures.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of management\u2019s controls over its accounting for the acquisition. For example, we tested controls over management\u2019s review of the valuation of identifiable intangible assets, including the review of the valuation models and significant assumptions, as described above, used in the valuation.\n\nTo test the fair value of these acquired identifiable intangible assets, with the assistance of our valuation specialists, our audit procedures included, amongst others, assessing the competence, capabilities and objectivity of management\u2019s specialists, evaluating the prospective financial information used in the valuation models, testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data and evaluating the Group\u2019s use of valuation methodologies.\n\nOur procedures to assess the prospective financial information used in the valuation models, included evaluating the key assumptions discussed above, by comparison to current industry, market and economic trends and historical results of Unitymedia. We performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact of changes in key assumptions to the valuation of the acquired identifiable intangible assets.\n\nWe assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in Note 27 in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nKey observations communicated to the Audit and Risk Committee\n\nBased on the procedures performed, we agree that the assumptions, methodologies and judgements applied as part of the purchase price allocation (\u2018PPA\u2019) are reasonable.\n\nFinal disclosures in Note 27 of the consolidated financial statements are appropriate.\n\nThe key audit matters set out above are consistent with those reported by Vodafone Group Plc\u2019s previous external auditor with the exception of:\n\n\u2013 Addition of the key audit matter in relation to purchase price allocation for acquired Liberty Global assets following the acquisition in the current financial year; and\n\n\u2013 Removal of the key audit matters in relation to significant one-off transactions in the prior year and, with the exception of the accounting for the Contingent Liability Mechanism with VIL, matters in respect of joint venture accounting that did not have a significant effect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team in the current year (for developments in the current financial year in respect of VIL \u2013 refer to Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements).\nAudit report on the consolidated and Company financial statements (continued)\n\nAn overview of the scope of our audit\n\nTailoring the scope\n\nOur assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of Group-wide controls, changes in the business environment and other factors such as recent internal audit reports when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.\n\nIn assessing the risk of material misstatement to the consolidated financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, of the 262 reporting components of the Group, we identified 19 components covering entities within Germany, South Africa, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, Turkey, Ireland, Portugal, Luxembourg and corporate entities, which represent the principal business units within the Group.\n\nFull scope components \u2013 Of the 19 components selected, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of 10 components (\u201cfull scope components\u201d) which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics.\n\nSpecified procedures components \u2013 For the remaining 9 components (\u201cspecified procedures components\u201d), we performed audit procedures that were specified by the Primary audit team in response to specific risk factors and in order to ensure that, at the overall group level, we reduced and appropriately covered the residual risk of error. Depending on the component or type of procedure these procedures were undertaken by the Primary audit team or separate component team.\n\nOf the remaining 243 components that together represent 20% of the Group\u2019s Adjusted EBITDA, none are individually greater than 5% of the Group\u2019s Adjusted EBITDA. The Primary audit team performed other procedures, including overall analytical review procedures, intercompany eliminations and foreign currency translation recalculations. The Primary audit team also considered the centralised audit procedures, data analytics and group wide IT systems testing performed to respond to any potential risks of material misstatements to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe table below illustrates the coverage obtained from the work performed by our audit teams.\n\n| Reporting components | Number | % of Group Adjusted EBITDA | % of Group Revenue | 2020 | Note |\n|----------------------|--------|---------------------------|-------------------|------|------|\n| Full scope           | 10     | 80                        | 75                | 1, 2, 4 |\n| Specified procedures | 9      | \u2013                         | 5                 | 2, 3, 4 |\n| Full and specified procedures coverage | 19 | 80 | 81 | |\n| Remaining components | 243    | 20                        | 19                | 5, 6 |\n| Total reporting components | 262 | 100 | 100 | |\n\nNotes\n1. 2 of the 10 full scope components relate to the Parent Company and another corporate entity whose activities include consolidation adjustments which are audited by the Primary audit team. Procedures on 3 of the other full scope locations are undertaken by component teams based in Germany and the remaining 5 full scope components are Italy, South Africa, Spain, Turkey and the UK.\n2. The Group audit risks in relation to revenue recognition were subject to audit procedures at each of the full and specified procedures scope locations with significant revenue streams (being 8 full scope components and 2 specific scope components).\n3. For the Ireland and Portugal components, specified procedures were defined by the Group team in respect of Revenue, Cost of sales and PPE accounts and as such the audit procedures will not have included testing of all significant accounts of the component but will have contributed to the coverage of significant accounts selected for testing by the Primary audit team, including those within Group Adjusted EBITDA. Specified procedures were performed for 7 other Finance and corporate entities across a range of significant accounts directly by the Primary audit team.\n4. The Group audit risks in relation to Carrying value of goodwill, Recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets on tax losses \u2013 Luxembourg, Assessment of contingent liabilities, Valuation of identifiable intangible assets for the acquisition of European Liberty Global assets were subject to audit procedures by the Primary audit team on the entire balance, with support from component audit teams on certain procedures.\n5. The contribution of specified procedure components to Group Adjusted EBITDA is included within \u2018remaining components\u2019 as audit procedures were performed on certain, but not all, significant accounts of the specified procedures component contributing to Group Adjusted EBITDA.\n6. Included within the 243 reporting components are the components for the Group\u2019s joint venture investments in Vodafone Idea Limited and Vodafone Ziggo for which specified and review procedures were performed respectively.\n7. Adjusted EBITDA as defined in \u2018Our application of materiality\u2019 section of this report.\n\nChanges from the prior year\n\nThe approach to audit scope is similar to the prior year external audit with the addition of a number of markets as specified procedures scope for selected significant accounts to extend the group audit procedures beyond the Group\u2019s main markets and to introduce a level of unpredictability through rotational testing.\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have revisited our procedures in respect of the Directors\u2019 going concern assessment, taking into account the nature of the Group, its business model and related risks. We evaluated the Directors\u2019 assessment of the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern, including the consistency of the cash flow forecasts, the key assumptions within the scenarios modelled and the available sources of liquidity with the findings from other areas of the audit. We assessed both the impact of additional sensitivities and the availability of mitigating future actions on the going concern assessment. We have also reviewed the disclosures contained within the Annual Report and consolidated financial statements in relation to this issue and consider them to describe adequately the impact of COVID-19 on the Group as at 31 March 2020.\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown restrictions occurred late in the Group\u2019s financial year and as such any audit procedures dependent on physical verification had either been completed and were subject to roll forward procedures or alternative procedures were performed. In response to the potential for risks to arise due to remote work arrangements, we instructed component audit teams to extend the level of roll-forward testing of controls performed as at 31 March 2020.\n\nThe performance of the year end audit remotely at both component and Group locations was supported through remote user access to the Group\u2019s financial systems and the use of EY software collaboration platforms for the secure and timely delivery of requested audit evidence.\n\nThe original audit plan included the performance of certain specified procedures in Egypt (3% of Group revenue). Following the introduction of lockdown restrictions in March 2020, and the strict local data privacy rules impacting the extent and speed of remote working, planned procedures could not be completed in full by the date of this auditor opinion and as such this component is not included within the coverage statistics set out in this auditor\u2019s report. The work performed by the component team was utilised by the Primary audit team as part of the other procedures performed to respond to any potential risks of material misstatement to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Primary audit team is satisfied that the final scope of audit procedures performed for the group audit is appropriate.\n\nInvolvement with component teams\n\nIn establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the components by us, as the Primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global network firms operating under our instruction. Of the 10 full scope components, audit procedures were performed on 2 of these directly by the Primary audit team, with the remaining 8 being performed by component audit teams. For the 7 specified procedures scope components work was performed directly by the Primary audit team with the remaining 2 being performed by component teams. Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole.\n\nVodafone has centralised processes and controls over key areas within its Vodafone Intelligent Solutions (VOIS) finance shared service centre locations. The Primary audit team provide direct oversight, review, and coordination of the audit teams at VOIS locations whose work includes centralised testing for certain accounts, including certain procedures on revenue, leases, cash and centralised purchase to pay processes.\n\nThe Group audit team established a programme of planned visits that has been designed to ensure that the Senior Statutory Auditor, or another Group audit partner, would visit the full scope components. During the current year\u2019s audit cycle, visits were undertaken, at least once, by the Primary audit team to the component teams in Germany, Italy, Spain, Turkey, South Africa, UK, India and Hungary as set out below.\n\nComponents visited:\n\n| Germany (A) (B) | Spain (A) (B) |\n|----------------|--------------|\n| UK (A) (B)     | Italy (B)    |\n| South Africa (A) (B) | Turkey (B) |\n\nVOIS locations visited:\n\n| Pune, India (A) (B) | Budapest, Hungary (B) |\n|---------------------|------------------------|\n| Ahmedabad, India    |                        |\n\nNotes:\n\n(A) These locations were visited by the Senior Statutory Auditor.\n(B) These locations were visited multiple times.\n\nThese visits involved discussing with the component teams their audit approach and any issues arising from their work, reviewing key audit working papers on the Group\u2019s audit risk areas, and meeting with local management to discuss the component\u2019s business performance and matters relating to the local finance organisation including the internal financial control environment. The Primary audit team interacted regularly with the local EY component audit teams during each stage of the audit and were responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process. We maintained continuous and open dialogue with the component audit teams in addition to holding formal meetings to ensure that we were fully aware of their progress and results of their procedures. This, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements.\nCOVID-19 impact\nAs the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown restrictions occurred late in the Group\u2019s financial year, many site visits to component locations had already taken place. A number of additional site visits were scheduled to full and specified procedures locations from early March 2020, however restrictions issued by the UK and other Governments meant that certain of these visits were not possible. For those components impacted by these measures, the site visits were held virtually through the use of video or teleconferencing facilities, including meetings with local Vodafone management. Weekly video conference calls were held with each component team from mid-March through to the full year results announcement in May 2020. Close meetings for all components and group audit risk areas were held via tele and video conference in April 2020.\n\nFor all components, the year-end review of relevant audit work papers was facilitated by the EY electronic audit file platform, screen sharing or the provision of copies of work papers direct to the Group audit team.\n\nBased upon the above approach we are satisfied that we have been able to perform sufficient and appropriate oversight of our component teams.\n\nOur application of materiality\nWe apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion.\n\nMateriality\nMateriality is defined as the magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.\n\nWe determined materiality for the Group to be \u20ac282 million, which is 2% of Adjusted EBITDA modified to include the impact of certain restructuring costs and certain elements of \u2018Other income and expenses\u2019 which we have assessed as recurring in nature. We consider that Adjusted EBITDA is the most relevant performance measure on which to determine materiality given the prominence of this metric throughout the Annual Report and consolidated financial statements, analyst presentations, and profit metrics focussed on by analysts.\n\n| Starting basis | Adjusted EBITDA of \u20ac14,881 million\u2020 |\n|----------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Adjustments    | Add back adjustments assessed by the audit team to be recurring in nature: |\n|                | \u2013 Group restructuring costs (\u20ac695 million) |\n|                | \u2013 Other income and expenses (\u20ac88 million, debit) |\n| Materiality     | Adjusted EBITDA for materiality basis; \u20ac14,098 million |\n|                | Materiality of \u20ac282 million (2% of materiality basis) |\n\n\u2020 See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and definition of this Alternative Performance Measure at page 239.\n\nWe determined materiality for the Parent Company to be \u20ac471 million based on 1% of the Company\u2019s equity. However, since the Parent Company was a full scope component, for accounts that were relevant for the Group financial statements, a performance materiality of \u20ac25 million was applied.\n\nDuring the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality with the only change in the final materiality from our original assessment at planning being to reflect the actual reported performance during the year.\n\nThe previous auditor determined materiality for the Group to be \u20ac250m for the external audit for the year ended 31 March 2019.\nPerformance materiality\nThe application of materiality at the individual account or balance level is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.\n\nWe set our performance materiality at 50% of planning materiality calculated as \u20ac138 million (\u20ac141 million based on year end materiality). This was based upon a combination of risk factors including this being a first year audit for EY, significant corporate transactions, integration of the acquired Liberty Global businesses, a number of IT system changes and the ongoing restructuring in certain key markets.\n\nAudit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component. In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was \u20ac15 million to \u20ac138 million.\n\nReporting threshold\nAn amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of \u20ac14m, which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\nWe evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.\n\nOther information\nThe other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report set out on pages 1 to 126, other than the financial statements and our auditor\u2019s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\n\nIn this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our responsibility to specifically address the following items in the other information and to report as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information where we conclude that those items meet the following conditions:\n\n- **Fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 125** \u2013 the statement given by the directors that they consider the Annual Report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group\u2019s performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or\n\n- **Audit and Risk Committee reporting set out on pages 90 to 95** \u2013 the section describing the work of the Audit and Risk Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit and Risk Committee; or\n\n- **Directors\u2019 statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code set out on page 122** \u2013 the parts of the directors\u2019 statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the company\u2019s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.\nAudit report on the consolidated and Company financial statements (continued)\n\nOpinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\nIn our opinion, the part of the Directors\u2019 Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\n\u2013 the information given in the strategic report and the directors\u2019 report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and\n\n\u2013 the strategic report and the directors\u2019 report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\n\nMatters on which we are required to report by exception\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Parent Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors\u2019 report.\n\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\n\u2013 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n\n\u2013 the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors\u2019 Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n\n\u2013 certain disclosures of directors\u2019 remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n\n\u2013 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\n\nResponsibilities of directors\nAs explained more fully in the directors\u2019 responsibilities statement set out on page 125, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group and Parent Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nAuditor\u2019s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor\u2019s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\nExplanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nThe objectives of our audit, in respect to fraud, are: to identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements due to fraud; to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks of material misstatement due to fraud, through designing and implementing appropriate responses; and to respond appropriately to fraud or suspected fraud identified during the audit. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the entity and management.\n\nOur approach was as follows:\n\n\u2013 The Primary audit team obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the most significant are those that relate to the reporting framework (IFRS, FRS 101, the Companies Act 2006 and UK Corporate Governance Code), the relevant tax compliance regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n\n\u2013 We understood how the Group is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of management, internal audit, those responsible for legal and compliance procedures and the company secretary. We corroborated our enquiries through our review of board minutes and papers provided to the Audit and Risk Committee and attendance at all meetings of the Audit and Risk Committee, as well as consideration of the results of our audit procedures across the Group.\n\n\u2013 We assessed the susceptibility of the Group\u2019s consolidated financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by meeting with management from various parts of the business to understand where it considered there was susceptibility to fraud; and assessing whistleblowing incidences for those with a potential financial reporting impact. We also considered performance targets and their propensity to influence on efforts made by management to manage revenue and earnings. We considered the programmes and controls that the Group has established to address risks identified, or that otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud, and how senior management monitors those programmes and controls.\n\n\u2013 Based on our understanding, at a Group level our procedures involved: enquiries of Group management and those charged with governance, legal counsel, the corporate security team, the fraud investigation team and the whistleblowing and investigation team; journal entry testing, with a focus on manual consolidation journals and journals indicating large or unusual transactions based on our understanding of the business; and challenging the assumptions and judgements made by management in respect of significant one-off transactions in the financial year and significant accounting estimates as referred to in the key audit matters section above. At a component level, our full and specified procedure scope component audit team\u2019s procedures included enquiries of component management; journal entry testing; and focused testing, including in respect of the key audit matter of revenue recognition. We also leveraged our data analytics platform in performing our work on the purchase to pay process to assist in identifying higher risk transactions for testing.\n\n\u2013 Where the risk was considered to be higher, including areas impacting Group key performance indicators or management remuneration, we performed audit procedures to address each identified fraud risk or other risk of material misstatement. These procedures included those on revenue recognition referred to in the key audit matter section above and testing manual journals and were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free from fraud or error.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council\u2019s website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor\u2019s report.\nAudit report on the consolidated and Company financial statements (continued)\n\nOther matters we are required to address\n\n\u2013 We were appointed by the company on 23 July 2019 to audit the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2020 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments is one year as this is the first audit year.\n\n\u2013 The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC\u2019s Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the Parent Company and we remain independent of the Group and the Parent Company in conducting the audit.\n\n\u2013 The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\nUse of our report\n\nThis report is made solely to the company\u2019s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company\u2019s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor\u2019s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company\u2019s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n\nAlison Duncan (Senior statutory auditor)\nfor and on behalf of Ernst & Young LLP,\nStatutory Auditor\nLondon\n28 May 2020\n\nNotes:\n1.

See note 17 \u201cCalled up share capital\u201d.\n2. Includes share premium, capital reserve, capital redemption reserve, merger reserve and share-based payment reserve. The merger reserve was derived from acquisitions made prior to 31 March 2004 and subsequently allocated to additional paid in capital on adoption of IFRS.\n3. The currency reserve is used to record cumulative translation differences on the assets and liabilities of foreign operations. The cumulative translation differences are recycled to the income statement on disposal of the foreign operation.\n4. The revaluation surplus derives from acquisitions of subsidiaries made before the Group\u2019s adoption of IFRS 3 (revised) on 1 April 2010 and comprises the amounts arising from recognising the Group\u2019s pre-existing equity interest in the acquired subsidiary at fair value.\n5. Principally includes the impact of the Group\u2019s cash flow hedges with \u20ac4,113 million net gain deferred to other comprehensive income during the year (2019: \u20ac1,555 million net gain; 2018: \u20ac1,811 million net loss and \u20ac488 million net gain (2019: \u20ac1,279 million net gain; 2018: \u20ac1,460 million net loss) recycled to the income statement. These hedges primarily relate to foreign exchange exposure on fixed borrowings with interest cash flows, unwind to the income statement over the life of the hedges and any foreign exchange on nominal balances impacting income statement at maturity (up to 2059). See note 22 \u201cCapital and financial risk management\u201d for further details.\n6.

Basis of preparation\n\nThis section describes the critical accounting judgements and estimates that management has identified as having a potentially material impact on the Group\u2019s consolidated financial statements and sets out our significant accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole. Where an accounting policy is generally applicable to a specific note to the financial statements, the policy is described within that note. We have also detailed below the new accounting pronouncements that we will adopt in future years and our current view of the impact they will have on our financial reporting.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (\u2018IASB\u2019) and are also prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union (\u2018EU\u2019), the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulations. The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis (see page 126).\n\nVodafone Group Plc is incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales (registration number 1833679). The registered address of the Company is Vodafone House, The Connection, Newbury, Berkshire, RG14 2FN, England.\n\nIFRS requires the Directors to adopt accounting policies that are the most appropriate to the Group\u2019s circumstances. These have been applied consistently to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. In determining and applying accounting policies, Directors and management are required to make judgements and estimates in respect of items where the choice of specific policy, accounting judgement, estimate or assumption to be followed could materially affect the Group\u2019s reported financial position, results or cash flows and disclosure of contingent assets or liabilities during the reporting period; it may later be determined that a different choice may have been more appropriate.\n\nThe Group\u2019s critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty are detailed below. Actual outcomes could differ from those estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period; they are recognised in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nManagement regularly reviews, and revises as necessary, the accounting judgements that significantly impact the amounts recognised in the financial statements and the estimates that are considered to be \u201ccritical estimates\u201d due to their potential to give rise to material adjustments in the Group\u2019s financial statements in the year to 31 March 2021. As at 31 March 2020, management has identified critical judgements in respect of revenue recognition, lease accounting, valuing assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations, the accounting for tax disputes in India, the classification of joint arrangements and whether to recognise provisions or to disclose contingent liabilities. In addition, management has identified critical accounting estimates in relation to the recovery of deferred tax assets, post employment benefits and impairments; estimates have also been identified that are not considered to be critical in respect of the allocation of revenue to goods and services, the useful economic lives of finite lived intangibles and property, plant and equipment.\n\nThe majority of the Group\u2019s provisions are either long-term in nature (such as asset retirement obligations) or relate to shorter-term liabilities (such as those relating to restructuring and property) where there is not considered to be a significant risk of material adjustment in the next financial year. Critical judgements are exercised in respect of tax disputes in India, including the cases relating to our acquisition of Hutchison Essar Limited (Vodafone India).\n\nThese critical accounting judgements, estimates and related disclosures have been discussed with the Group\u2019s Audit and Risk Committee.\n\nCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nRevenue recognition\n\nRevenue recognition under IFRS 15 necessitates the collation and processing of very large amounts of data, use of management judgements and estimates to produce financial information. The most significant accounting judgements and source of estimation uncertainty are disclosed below.\n\nGross versus net presentation\n\nIf the Group has control of goods or services when they are delivered to a customer, then the Group is the principal in the sale to the customer; otherwise the Group is acting as an agent. Whether the Group is considered to be the principal or an agent in the transaction depends on analysis by management of both the legal form and substance of the agreement between the Group and its business partners; such judgements impact the amount of reported revenue and operating expenses (see note 2 \u201cRevenue disaggregation and segmental analysis\u201d) but do not impact reported assets, liabilities or cash flows. Scenarios requiring judgement to determine whether the Group is a principal or an agent include, for example, those where the Group delivers third-party branded services (such as premium music or TV content) to customers.\n\nAllocation of revenue to goods and services provided to customers\n\nRevenue is recognised when goods and services are delivered to customers (see note 2). Goods and services may be delivered to a customer at different times under the same contract, hence it is necessary to allocate the amount payable by the customer between goods and services on a \u2018relative standalone selling price basis\u2019; this requires the identification of performance obligations (\u2018obligations\u2019) and the determination of standalone selling prices for the identified obligations. The determination of obligations is, for the primary goods and services sold by the Group, not considered to be a critical accounting judgement; the Group\u2019s policy on identifying obligations is disclosed in note 2. The determination of standalone selling prices for identified obligations is discussed below.\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n1. Basis of preparation (continued)\n\nIt is necessary to estimate the standalone price when the Group does not sell equivalent goods or services in similar circumstances on a standalone basis. When estimating the standalone price the Group maximises the use of external inputs; methods for estimating standalone prices include determining the standalone price of similar goods and services sold by the Group, observing the standalone prices for similar goods and services, when sold by third parties or using a cost-plus reasonable margin approach (which is sometimes the case for handsets and other equipment). Where it is not possible to reliably estimate standalone prices due to a lack of observable standalone sales or highly variable pricing, which is sometimes the case for services, the standalone price of an obligation may be determined as the transaction price less the standalone prices of other obligations in the contract. The standalone price determined for obligations materially impacts the allocation of revenue between obligations and impacts the timing of revenue when obligations are provided to customers at different times \u2013 for example, the allocation of revenue between handsets, which are usually delivered up-front, and services which are typically delivered over the contract period. However, there is not considered to be a significant risk of material adjustment to the carrying value of contract-related assets or liabilities in the 12 months after the balance sheet date if these estimates were revised.\n\nLease accounting\n\nLease accounting under IFRS 16 is significantly more complex than under previous reporting requirements and necessitates the collation and processing of very large amounts of data and the increased use of management judgements and estimates to produce financial information. The most significant accounting judgements are disclosed below.\n\nLease identification\n\nWhether the arrangement is considered a lease or a service contract depends on the analysis by management of both the legal form and substance of the arrangement between the Group and the counter-party to determine if control of an identified asset has been passed between the parties; if not, the arrangement is a service arrangement. Control exists if the Group obtains substantially all of the economic benefit from the use of the asset, and has the ability to direct its use, for a period of time. An identified asset exists where an agreement explicitly or implicitly identifies an asset or a physically distinct portion of an asset which the lessor has no substantive right to substitute.\n\nThe scenarios requiring the greatest judgement include those where the arrangement is for the use of fibre or other fixed telecommunication lines. Generally, where the Group has exclusive use of a physical line it is determined that the Group can also direct the use of the line and therefore leases will be recognised. Where the Group provides access to fibre or other fixed telecommunication lines to another operator on a wholesale basis the arrangement will generally be identified as a lease, whereas when the Group provides fixed line services to an end-user, generally control over such lines is not passed to the end-user and a lease is not identified.\n\nThe impact of determining whether an agreement is a lease or a service depends on whether the Group is a potential lessee or lessor in the arrangement and, where the Group is a lessor, whether the arrangement is classified as an operating or finance lease. The impacts for each scenario are described below where the Group is potentially:\n\n- A lessee. The judgement impacts the nature and timing of both costs and reported assets and liabilities. A lease results in an asset and a liability being reported and depreciation and interest being recognised; the interest charge will decrease over the life of the lease. A service contract results in operating expenses being recognised evenly over the life of the contract and no assets or liabilities being recorded (other than trade payables, prepayments and accruals).\n- An operating lessor. The judgement impacts the nature of income recognised. An operating lease results in lease income being recognised whilst a service contract results in service revenue. Both are recognised evenly over the life of the contract.\n- A finance lessor. The judgement impacts the nature and timing of both income and reported assets. A finance lease results in the lease income being recognised at commencement of the lease and an asset (the net investment in the lease) being recorded.\n\nLease term\n\nWhere leases include additional optional periods after an initial lease term, significant judgement is required in determining whether these optional periods should be included when determining the lease term. The impact of this judgement is significantly greater where the Group is a lessee. As a lessee, optional periods are included in the lease term if the Group is reasonably certain it will exercise an extension option or will not exercise a termination option; this depends on an analysis by management of all relevant facts and circumstances including the leased asset\u2019s nature and purpose, the economic and practical potential for replacing the asset and any plans that the Group has in place for the future use of the asset. Where a leased asset is highly customised (either when initially provided or as a result of leasehold improvements) or it is impractical or uneconomic to replace then the Group is more likely to judge that lease extension options are reasonably certain to be exercised. The value of the right-of-use asset and lease liability will be greater when extension options are included in the lease term. The normal approach adopted for lease term by asset class is described below.\n\nThe lease terms can vary significantly by type and use of asset and geography. In addition, the exact lease term is subject to the non-cancellable period and rights and options in each contract. Generally, lease terms are judged to be the longer of the minimum lease term and:\n\n- Between 5 and 10 years for land and buildings (excluding retail), with terms at the top end of this range if the lease relates to assets that are considered to be difficult to exit sooner for economic, practical or reputational reasons;\n- To the next contractual lease break date for retail premises (excluding breaks within the next 12 months);\n- Where leases are used to provide internal connectivity the lease term for the connectivity is aligned to the lease term or useful economic life of the assets connected; and\n- The customer service agreement length for leases of local loop connections or other assets required to provide fixed line services to individual customers.\n\nIn most instances the Group has options to renew or extend leases for additional periods after the end of the lease term which are assessed using the criteria above.\nTaxation\nThe Group\u2019s tax charge on ordinary activities is the sum of the total current and deferred tax charges. The calculation of the Group\u2019s total tax charge involves estimation and judgement in respect of certain matters, being principally:\n\nRecognition of deferred tax assets\nSignificant items on which the Group has exercised accounting estimation and judgement include the recognition of deferred tax assets in respect of losses in Luxembourg, Germany and Spain as well as capital allowances in the United Kingdom. The recognition of deferred tax assets, particularly in respect of tax losses, is based upon whether management judge that it is probable that there will be sufficient and suitable taxable profits in the relevant legal entity or tax group against which to utilise the assets in the future. The Group assesses the availability of future taxable profits using the same undiscounted five year forecasts for the Group\u2019s operations as are used in the Group\u2019s value in use calculations (see note 4 \u201cImpairment (losses\u201d).\n\nWhere tax losses are forecast to be recovered beyond the five year period, the availability of taxable profits is assessed using the cash flows and long-term growth rates used for the value in use calculations.\n\nThe estimated cash flows inherent in these forecasts include the unsystematic risks of operating in the telecommunications business including the potential impacts of changes in the market structure, trends in customer pricing, the costs associated with the acquisition and retention of customers, future technological evolutions and potential regulatory changes, such as our ability to acquire and/or renew spectrum licences.\n\nChanges in the estimates which underpin the Group\u2019s forecasts could have an impact on the amount of future taxable profits and could have a significant impact on the period over which the deferred tax asset would be recovered.\n\nThe Group only considers substantively enacted tax laws when assessing the amount and availability of tax losses to offset against the future taxable profits. See note 6 \u201cTaxation\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nUncertain tax positions\nThe tax impact of a transaction or item can be uncertain until a conclusion is reached with the relevant tax authority or through a legal process. The Group uses in-house tax experts when assessing uncertain tax positions and seeks the advice of external professional advisors where appropriate. The most significant judgement in this area relates to the Group\u2019s tax disputes in India, including the cases relating to the Group\u2019s acquisition of Hutchison Essar Limited (Vodafone India) and the impact of the European Commission\u2019s challenge to the UK\u2019s Controlled Foreign Company rules. Further details of the tax disputes in India are included in note 29 \u201cContingent liabilities and legal proceedings\u201d and further information on the European Commission\u2019s challenge are include in note 6 \u201cTaxation\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nBusiness combinations and goodwill\nWhen the Group completes a business combination, the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, including intangible assets, are recognised. The determination of the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities is based, to a considerable extent, on management\u2019s judgement. If the purchase consideration exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired then the incremental amount paid is recognised as goodwill. If the purchase price consideration is lower than the fair value of the assets acquired then the difference is recorded as a gain in the income statement.\n\nAllocation of the purchase price between finite lived assets (discussed below) and indefinite lived assets such as goodwill affects the subsequent results of the Group as finite lived intangible assets are amortised, whereas indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortised.\n\nSee note 27 \u201cAcquisitions and disposals\u201d to the consolidated financial statements for further details.\nJoint arrangements\nThe Group participates in a number of joint arrangements where control of the arrangement is shared with one or more other parties. Judgement is required to classify joint arrangements in a separate legal entity as either a joint operation or as a joint venture, which depends on management\u2019s assessment of the legal form and substance of the arrangement taking into account relevant facts and circumstances such as whether the owners have rights to substantially all the economic outputs and, in substance, settle the liabilities of the entity.\n\nThe classification can have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The Group\u2019s share of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows of joint operations are included in the consolidated financial statements on a line-by-line basis, whereas the Group\u2019s investment and share of results of joint ventures are shown within single line items in the consolidated statement of financial position and consolidated income statement respectively. See note 12 \u201cInvestments in associates and joint arrangements\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nFinite lived intangible assets\nOther intangible assets include amounts spent by the Group acquiring licences and spectrum, customer bases and the costs of purchasing and developing computer software.\n\nWhere intangible assets are acquired through business combinations and no active market for the assets exists, the fair value of these assets is determined by discounting estimated future net cash flows generated by the asset. Estimates relating to the future cash flows and discount rates used may have a material effect on the reported amounts of finite lived intangible assets.\n\nEstimation of useful life\nThe useful life over which intangible assets are amortised depends on management\u2019s estimate of the period over which economic benefit will be derived from the asset. Useful lives are periodically reviewed to ensure that they remain appropriate. Management\u2019s estimates of useful life have a material impact on the amount of amortisation recorded in the year, but there is not considered to be a significant risk of material adjustment to the carrying values of intangible assets in the year to 31 March 2021 if these estimates were revised. The basis for determining the useful life for the most significant categories of intangible assets are discussed below.\n\nCustomer bases\nThe estimated useful life principally reflects management\u2019s view of the average economic life of the customer base and is assessed by reference to customer churn rates. An increase in churn rates may lead to a reduction in the estimated useful life and an increase in the amortisation charge.\n\nCapitalised software\nFor computer software, the estimated useful life is based on management\u2019s view, considering historical experience with similar products as well as anticipation of future events which may impact their life such as changes in technology. The useful life will not exceed the duration of a licence.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment represents 23.3% (2019: 19.2%) of the Group\u2019s total assets; estimates and assumptions made may have a material impact on their carrying value and related depreciation charge. See note 11 \u201cProperty, plant and equipment\u201d to the consolidated financial statements for further details.\n\nEstimation of useful life\nThe depreciation charge for an asset is derived using estimates of its expected useful life and expected residual value, which are reviewed annually. Management\u2019s estimates of useful life have a material impact on the amount of depreciation recorded in the year, but there is not considered to be a significant risk of material adjustment to the carrying values of property, plant and equipment in the year to 31 March 2021 if these estimates were revised.\n\nManagement determines the useful lives and residual values for assets when they are acquired, based on experience with similar assets and taking into account other relevant factors such as any expected changes in technology.\nPost employment benefits\nManagement uses estimates when determining the Group\u2019s liabilities and expenses arising for defined benefit pension schemes. Management is required to estimate the future rates of inflation, salary increases, discount rates and longevity of members, each of which may have a material impact on the defined benefit obligations that are recorded. Further details, including a sensitivity analysis, are included in note 25 \u201cPost employment benefits\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nContingent liabilities\nThe Group exercises judgement to determine whether to recognise provisions and the exposures to contingent liabilities related to pending litigations or other outstanding claims subject to negotiated settlement, mediation, arbitration or government regulation, as well as other contingent liabilities (see note 29 \u201cContingent liabilities and legal proceedings\u201d to the consolidated financial statements). Judgement is necessary to assess the likelihood that a pending claim will succeed, or a liability will arise.\n\nImpairment reviews\nIFRS requires management to perform impairment tests annually for indefinite lived assets, for finite lived assets and for equity accounted investments, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\n\nImpairment testing requires management to judge whether the carrying value of assets can be supported by the net present value of future cash flows that they generate. Calculating the net present value of the future cash flows requires estimates to be made in respect of highly uncertain matters including management\u2019s expectations of:\n\n- growth in adjusted EBITDA, calculated as adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortisation;\n- timing and amount of future capital expenditure, licence and spectrum payments;\n- long-term growth rates; and\n- appropriate discount rates to reflect the risks involved.\n\nManagement prepares formal five year forecasts for the Group\u2019s operations, which are used to estimate their value in use; a long-term growth rate into perpetuity has been determined as the lower of:\n\n- the nominal GDP growth rates for the country of operation; and\n- the long-term compound annual growth rate in adjusted EBITDA in years six to ten, as estimated by management.\n\nChanging the assumptions selected by management, in particular the adjusted EBITDA and growth rate assumptions used in the cash flow projections, could significantly affect the Group\u2019s impairment evaluation and hence reported assets and profits or losses. Further details, including a sensitivity analysis, are included in note 4 \u201cImpairment losses\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nFor operations that are classified as held for sale, impairment testing requires management to determine whether the carrying value of the discontinued operation can be supported by the fair value less costs to sell. Where not observable in a quoted market, management have determined fair value less costs to sell by reference to the outcomes from the application of a number of potential valuation techniques, determined from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\nSignificant accounting policies applied in the current reporting period that relate to the financial statements as a whole\n\nAccounting convention\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis except for certain financial and equity instruments that have been measured at fair value.\n\nBasis of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company, subsidiaries controlled by the Company (see note 33 \u201cRelated undertakings\u201d to the consolidated financial statements) and joint operations that are subject to joint control (see note 12 \u201cInvestments in associates and joint arrangements\u201d to the consolidated financial statements).\n\nSignificant new accounting pronouncements\nIFRS 16 \u201cLeases\u201d was adopted by the Group on 1 April 2019; the key changes to the accounting policies previously applied by the Group are disclosed below within this note. The Group\u2019s new leasing policy is disclosed in note 20.\n\nForeign currencies\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in euro, which is also the Company\u2019s functional currency. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the respective functional currency of the entity at the rates prevailing on the reporting period date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the initial transaction dates. Non-monetary items measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.\n\nChanges in the fair value of monetary securities denominated in foreign currency are analysed between translation differences and other changes in the carrying amount of the security. Translation differences are recognised in the consolidated income statement and other changes in carrying amount are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\n\nTranslation differences on non-monetary financial assets, such as investments in equity securities classified at fair value through other comprehensive income, are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss and are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\n\nShare capital, share premium and other capital reserves are initially recorded at the functional currency rate prevailing at the date of the transaction and are not retranslated.\n\nFor the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of entities with a functional currency other than euro are expressed in euro using exchange rates prevailing at the reporting period date. Income and expense items and cash flows are translated at the average exchange rates for each month and exchange differences arising are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign entity, the cumulative amount previously recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in profit or loss in the consolidated income statement.\n\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated accordingly.\n\nThe net foreign exchange loss recognised in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 March 2020 is \u20ac146 million (31 March 2019: \u20ac2,277 million loss; 2018: \u20ac476 million gain). The net gains and net losses are recorded within operating profit (2020: \u20ac24 million credit; 2019: \u20ac1 million charge; 2018: \u20ac65 million credit), non-operating income and expense (2020: \u20ac37 million credit; 2019: \u20acnil; 2018: \u20ac80 million credit), investment and financing income (2020: \u20ac205 million charge; 2019: \u20ac190 million charge; 2018: \u20ac322 million credit), income tax expense (2020: \u20ac2 million charge; 2019: \u20ac7 million charge; 2018: \u20ac9 million credit) and loss for the financial year from discontinued operations (2020: \u20acnil; 2019: \u20ac2,079 million charge; 2018: \u20acnil). The foreign exchange gains and losses included within other income and expense and non-operating income and expense arise on the disposal of discontinued operations, interests in joint ventures, associates and investments from the recycling of foreign exchange gains previously recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\n\nCurrent or non-current classification\nAssets are classified as current in the consolidated statement of financial position where recovery is expected within 12 months of the reporting date. All assets where recovery is expected more than 12 months from the reporting date and all deferred tax assets, goodwill and intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and investments in associates and joint ventures are reported as non-current.\n\nLiabilities are classified as current unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date. For provisions, where the timing of settlement is uncertain, amounts are classified as non-current where settlement is expected more than 12 months from the reporting date. In addition, deferred tax liabilities and post-employment benefits are reported as non-current.\n\nInventory\nInventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on the basis of weighted average costs and comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.\nNew accounting pronouncements adopted on 1 April 2019\n\nA new accounting standard, IFRS 16 \u201cLeases\u201d was adopted by the Group on 1 April 2019. The impact of adopting this standard on the financial statements at 1 April 2019, and the key changes to the accounting policies previously applied by the Group, are disclosed below within this note. The Group\u2019s new IFRS 16 accounting policy and previous lease accounting policy under IAS 17 \u201cLeases\u201d is disclosed in note 20. In addition, the following new accounting pronouncements, none of which were considered by the Group as significant on adoption, were adopted by the Group to comply with amendments to IFRS and have all been endorsed by the EU.\n\n- Amendments to IAS 28 \u201cLong-term interests in Associates and Joint Ventures\u201d;\n- \u201cImprovements to IFRS: 2015-2017 cycle\u201d;\n- Amendments to IAS 19 \u201cPlan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement\u201d;\n- Amendments to IFRS 9 \u201cPrepayment Features with Negative Compensation\u201d; and\n- IFRIC 25 \u201cUncertainty over Income Tax Treatments\u201d.\n\nNew accounting pronouncements to be adopted on 1 April 2020\n\nThe following pronouncements, issued by the IASB, are effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2020 and have been endorsed by the EU. The Group\u2019s financial reporting will be presented in accordance with these new standards, which are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of financial position or consolidated cash flow statement from 1 April 2020.\n\n- Amendments to IFRS 3 \u201cDefinition of a Business\u201d;\n- Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 \u201cDefinition of Material\u201d; and\n- Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 \u201cInterest Rate Benchmark Reform\u201d.\n\nNew accounting pronouncements to be adopted on or after 1 April 2021\n\nThe IASB has issued Amendments to IAS 1 \u201cClassification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current\u201d, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021 and IFRS 17 \u201cInsurance Contracts\u201d, which is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023; the IASB has proposed deferring the adoption of these standards but no changes have yet been issued.\n\nAlthough not yet endorsed by the EU or the new UK endorsement board the Group\u2019s financial reporting will be presented in accordance with the above new standards from 1 April 2021 and 1 April 2023 respectively. The Group\u2019s work to assess the impact of these accounting changes is continuing; however, the changes are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of financial position or consolidated cash flow statement.\n\nThe following narrow-scope amendments were issued by the IASB during May 2020 and are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022, they have not yet been endorsed by the EU or the new UK endorsement board.\n\n- Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020;\n- Amendment to IAS 16 \u201cProperty, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use\u201d;\n- Amendment to IAS 37 \u201cOnerous Contracts \u2013 Cost of Fulfilling a Contract\u201d; and\n- Amendment to IFRS 3 \u201cReference to the Conceptual Framework\u201d.\n\nThe Group is assessing the impact of these new standards and the Group\u2019s financial reporting will be presented in accordance with these standards from 1 April 2022.\n\nAdoption of new accounting pronouncements\n\nIFRS 16 \u201cLeases\u201d\n\nIFRS 16 \u201cLeases\u201d was adopted by the Group on 1 April 2019 with the cumulative retrospective impact reflected as an adjustment to equity on the date of adoption and therefore the comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4. The Group has applied the following expedients in relation to the adoption of IFRS 16:\n\n- The right-of-use assets were measured at an amount based on the lease liability at adoption; initial direct costs incurred when obtaining leases were excluded from this measurement. Lease prepayments and accruals previously recognised under IAS 17 at 31 March 2019 were added to and deducted from, respectively, the value of the right-of-use assets on adoption. In determining the cumulative retrospective impact recorded on 1 April 2019, some of the Group\u2019s joint ventures have measured right-of-use assets, for certain leases, as if IFRS 16 had been applied since lease commencement but using their incremental borrowing rate at adoption; and\n- The Group impaired the right-of-use assets recognised on adoption by the value of the provisions for onerous leases held under IAS 37 at 31 March 2019 instead of performing a new impairment assessment for those assets on adoption.\n\nThe Group\u2019s right-of-use assets are recorded together with other property, plant and equipment assets (see note 11 \u201cProperty, plant and equipment\u201d) and lease liabilities are recognised in borrowings (see note 21 \u201cBorrowings\u201d).\n\nThe key differences between the Group\u2019s IAS 17 accounting policy (the \u2018previous policy\u2019 which is disclosed in note 20 \u201cLeases\u201d) and the Group\u2019s IFRS 16 accounting policy (which is also provided in note 20 \u201cLeases\u201d) as well as the primary impacts of applying IFRS 16 in the current financial period are disclosed on page 153 below.\nPrimary impacts of applying the IFRS 16 accounting policy\n\nThe primary impacts on the Group\u2019s financial statements, and the key causes of the movements recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position on 1 April 2019 (see page 153), as a result of applying the IFRS 16 (\u2018current\u2019) accounting policy in place of the previous policy under IAS 17 are:\n\n- Under IAS 17, lessees classified leases as either operating or finance leases. Operating lease costs were expensed on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Finance leases resulted in the recognition, in the statement of financial position, of an asset and a corresponding liability for lease payments, at present value. Under IFRS 16 all lease agreements give rise to the recognition of a \u2018right-of-use asset\u2019 representing the right to use the leased item and a liability for any future lease payments (see page 178) over the \u2018reasonably certain\u2019 period of the lease, which may include future lease periods for which the Group has extension options.\n\n- Lessee accounting under IFRS 16 is similar to finance lease accounting for lessees under IAS 17; lease costs are recognised in the form of depreciation of the right-of-use asset and interest on the lease liability which is generally discounted at the incremental borrowing rate of the relevant Group entity, although the interest rate implicit in the lease is used when it is more readily determinable. Interest charges will typically be higher in the early stages of a lease and will reduce over the term. Lease interest costs are recorded in financing costs and associated cash payments are classified as financing cash flows in the Group\u2019s cash flow statement.\n\n- Under IFRS 16 cash inflows from operating activities and payments classified within cash flow from financing activities both increase, as payments made at both lease inception and subsequently are characterised as repayments of lease liabilities and interest. Under IAS 17 operating lease payments were treated as an operating cash outflow. Net cash flow is not impacted by the change in policy.\n\n- Lessor accounting under IFRS 16 is similar to IAS 17. The only substantive change is that when the Group sub-leases assets it classifies the lease out as either operating or finance leases by reference to the terms of the head lease contract whereas under IAS17 the classification was determined by reference to the underlying asset leased out. This has resulted in additional finance leases out being recognised under IFRS 16 (see net investment in leases in note 14 \u201cTrade and other receivables\u201d).\n\n- The expedients applied at adoption, above, have resulted in reclassifications of lease-related prepayments, accruals and provisions at 1 April 2019 (see page 153) to the right-of-use assets. Where certain of the Group\u2019s joint ventures have valued right-of-use assets as if IFRS 16 had been applied since lease inception, this has resulted in the reduction in the value of investments in associates and joint arrangements (see note 12 \u201cInvestments in associates and joint arrangements\u201d).\n\n- During the year ended 31 March 2019 an expense of \u20ac3,826 million was charged for operating leases and depreciation and interest of \u20ac71 million was charged for finance leases. During the year ended 31 March 2020, depreciation of \u20ac3,720 million and interest of \u20ac330 million has been charged in relation to leases.\n\nTransition disclosures\n\nThe weighted average incremental borrowing rate applied to the Group\u2019s lease liabilities recognised in the balance sheet at 1 April 2019 was 3.5%. The Group\u2019s undiscounted operating lease commitments at 31 March 2019 were \u20ac10.8 billion; the most significant differences between the IAS 17 lease operating lease commitments and the lease liabilities recognised on transition to IFRS 16 are set out below.\n\n| Description | \u20acbn |\n|-------------|-----|\n| Operating lease commitments at 31 March 2019 | 10.8 |\n| Less effect of discounting on payments included in the operating lease commitment | (1.6) |\n| Plus lease liabilities in respect of additional \u2018reasonably certain\u2019 lease extensions assumed under IFRS 16 | 0.8 |\n| Plus finance lease liabilities already reported under IAS 17 | 0.3 |\n| **Lease liability opening balance reported at 1 April 2019** | **10.3** |\n\nThe Group applied the lease identification requirements of IFRS 16 at the date of adoption and no material changes to the Group\u2019s lease portfolio were identified.\n### Impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 on the opening balance sheet at 1 April 2019\n\nThe impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 on the consolidated statement of financial position at 1 April 2019 is set out below:\n\n| Consolidated statement of financial position | 31 March

Revenue disaggregation and segmental analysis\n\nThe Group\u2019s businesses are managed on a geographical basis. Selected financial data is presented on this basis below.\n\nAccounting policies\n\nRevenue\n\nWhen the Group enters into an agreement with a customer, goods and services deliverable under the contract are identified as separate performance obligations (\u2018obligations\u2019) to the extent that the customer can benefit from the goods or services on their own and that the separate goods and services are considered distinct from other goods and services in the agreement. Where individual goods and services do not meet the criteria to be identified as separate obligations they are aggregated with other goods and/or services in the agreement until a separate obligation is identified. The obligations identified will depend on the nature of individual customer contracts, but might typically be separately identified for mobile handsets, other equipment such as set-top boxes and routers provided to customers and services provided to customers such as mobile and fixed line communication services. Where goods and services have a functional dependency (for example, a fixed line router can only be used with the Group\u2019s services) this does not, in isolation, prevent those goods or services from being assessed as separate obligations.\n\nThe Group determines the transaction price to which it expects to be entitled in return for providing the promised obligations to the customer based on the committed contractual amounts, net of sales taxes and discounts. Where indirect channel dealers, such as retailers, acquire contract customers on behalf of the Group and receive commission, any commissions that the dealer is compelled to use to fund discounts or other incentives to the customer are treated as payments to the customer when determining the transaction price and consequently are not included in contract acquisition costs.\n\nThe transaction price is allocated between the identified obligations according to the relative standalone selling prices of the obligations. The standalone selling price of each obligation deliverable in the contract is determined according to the prices that the Group would achieve by selling the same goods and/or services included in the obligation to a similar customer on a standalone basis; where standalone selling prices are not directly observable, estimation techniques are used maximising the use of external inputs. See \u201cCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\u201d in note 1 for details.\n\nRevenue is recognised when the respective obligations in the contract are delivered to the customer and payment remains probable.\n\nRevenue for the provision of services, such as mobile airtime and fixed line broadband, is recognised when the Group provides the related service during the agreed service period.\n\nRevenue for device sales to end customers is generally recognised when the device is delivered to the end customer. For device sales made to intermediaries such as indirect channel dealers, revenue is recognised if control of the device has transferred to the intermediary and the intermediary has no right to return the device to receive a refund; otherwise revenue recognition is deferred until sale of the device to an end customer by the intermediary or the expiry of any right of return.\n\nWhere refunds are issued to customers they are deducted from revenue in the relevant service period.\n\nWhen the Group has control of goods or services prior to delivery to a customer, then the Group is the principal in the sale to the customer. As a principal, receipts from, and payments to, suppliers are reported on a gross basis in revenue and operating costs. If another party has control of goods or services prior to transfer to a customer, then the Group is acting as an agent for the other party and revenue in respect of the relevant obligations is recognised net of any related payments to the supplier and recognised revenue represents the margin earned by the Group. See \u201cCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\u201d in note 1 for details.\n\nCustomers typically pay in advance for prepay mobile services and monthly for other communication services. Customers typically pay for handsets and other equipment either up-front at the time of sale or over the term of the related service agreement.\n\nWhen revenue recognised in respect of a customer contract exceeds amounts received or receivable from a customer at that time a contract asset is recognised; contract assets will typically be recognised for handsets or other equipment provided to customers where payment is recovered by the Group via future service fees. If amounts received or receivable from a customer exceed revenue recognised for a contract, for example if the Group receives an advance payment from a customer, a contract liability is recognised.\n\nWhen contract assets or liabilities are recognised, a financing component may exist in the contract; this is typically the case when a handset or other equipment is provided to a customer up-front but payment is received over the term of the related service agreement, in which case the customer is deemed to have received financing. If a significant financing component is provided to the customer, the transaction price is reduced and interest revenue is recognised over the customer\u2019s payment period using an interest rate reflecting the relevant central bank rates and customer credit risk.\n\nContract-related costs\n\nWhen costs directly relating to a specific contract are incurred prior to recognising revenue for a related obligation, and those costs enhance the ability of the Group to deliver an obligation and are expected to be recovered, then those costs are recognised on the statement of financial position as fulfilment costs and are recognised as expenses in line with the recognition of revenue when the related obligation is delivered.\n\nThe direct and incremental costs of acquiring a contract including, for example, certain commissions payable to staff or agents for acquiring customers on behalf of the Group, are recognised as contract acquisition cost assets in the statement of financial position when the related payment obligation is recorded. Costs are recognised as an expense in line with the recognition of the related revenue that is expected to be earned by the Group; typically this is over the customer contract period as new commissions are payable on contract renewal. Certain amounts payable to agents are deducted from revenue recognised (see above).\nRevenue disaggregation\n\nRevenue reported for the year includes revenue from contracts with customers, comprising service and equipment revenue, as well as other revenue items including revenue from leases and interest revenue arising from transactions with a significant financing component. The table below disaggregates the Group\u2019s revenue by reporting segment.\n\n| 31 March 2020 | Service revenue \u00a3m | Equipment revenue \u00a3m | Revenue from contracts with customers \u00a3m |

Other revenue includes lease revenue recognised under IAS 17 \u201cLeases\u201d for the year ended 31 March 2019 and IFRS 16 \u201cLeases\u201d for the year ended 31 March 2020 (see note 20).\n2. Comprises central teams and business functions.\n\nThe total future revenue from the Group\u2019s contracts with customers with performance obligations not satisfied at 31 March 2020 is \u00a320,336 million (2019: \u20ac18,447 million), of which \u00a313,456 million (2019: \u20ac12,566 million) is expected to be recognised within the next year and the majority of the remaining amount in the following 12 months.\n2. Revenue disaggregation and segmental analysis (continued)\n\nSegmental analysis\n\nThe Group\u2019s operating segments are established on the basis of those components of the Group that are evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Group has determined the chief operating decision maker to be its Chief Executive Officer. The Group has a single group of similar services and products, being the supply of communications services and products. Revenue is attributed to a country or region based on the location of the Group company reporting the revenue. Transactions between operating segments are charged at arm\u2019s-length prices.\n\nSegment information is primarily provided on the basis of geographic areas, with the exception of Vodacom which encompasses South Africa and certain other smaller African markets, being the basis on which the Group manages its worldwide interests.\n\nThe aggregation of operating segments into the Europe and Rest of the World regions reflects, in the opinion of management, the similar economic characteristics within each of those regions as well as the similar products and services offered and supplied, classes of customers and the regulatory environment. In the case of the Europe region this largely reflects membership of the European Union, while for the Rest of the World region this largely includes emerging and developing economies that are in the process of rapid growth and industrialisation.\n\nCertain financial information is provided separately within the Europe region for Germany, Italy, the UK and Spain, and within the Rest of the World region for Vodacom, as these operating segments are individually material for the Group. The segmental revenue and profit of India are included in discontinued operations for all years reported until 31 August 2018, the date of disposal, and segmental assets and cash flows are included in assets and liabilities held for sale at 31 March 2018. See note 7 \u201cDiscontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale\u201d and note 27 \u201cAcquisitions and disposals\u201d for details.\n\nSegmental information used for internal decision making during the years ended 31 March 2018 and 2019 was on an IAS 18 (pre-IFRS 15) basis. In the year ended 31 March 2020 internal decisions were based upon IFRS 15 financial information and accordingly comparative information for the year ended 31 March 2019 was re-presented. Consequently, segmental information for the year ended 31 March 2018 is presented on an IAS 18 (pre-IFRS 15) basis and information for years ended 31 March 2020 and 2019 is presented on an IFRS 15 basis in accordance with the above revenue recognition policy. See note 32 \u201cIAS 18 basis primary statements\u201d for details of the IAS 18 revenue recognition policy.\n\nThe Group\u2019s measure of segment profit, adjusted EBITDA, excludes depreciation, amortisation, impairment loss, restructuring costs, loss on disposal of fixed assets, the Group\u2019s share of results in associates and joint ventures and other income and expense. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to operating profit is shown below. For a reconciliation of operating profit to profit for the financial year, see the Consolidated income statement on page 141.\n\n| Segmental Information | 2020 | 2019 (re-presented) | 2018 |\n|-----------------------|------|---------------------|------|\n| Adjusted EBITDA       | 14,881 | 13,918              | 14,737 |\n| Depreciation, amortisation and loss on disposal of fixed assets | (10,085) | (9,665) | (9,910) |\n| Share of adjusted results in equity accounted associates and joint ventures | (241) | (348) | 389 |\n| Adjusted operating profit | 4,555 | 3,905              | 5,216 |\n| Impairment losses     | (1,685) | (3,525)            | \u2013    |\n| Restructuring costs   | (720)  | (486)              | (156) |\n| Amortisation of acquired customer based and brand intangible assets | (638) | (583) | (974) |\n| Other income/(expense) | 2,257 | (262)              | 213  |\n| Interest on lease liabilities | 330 | \u2013                  | \u2013    |\n| Operating profit/(loss) | 4,099 | (951)              | 4,299 |\n\nNotes:\n1. The results reflected in this table for the year ended 31 March 2019 were previously disclosed on an IAS 18 basis in the Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2019 and have been re-presented in the table above on an IFRS 15 basis.\n2. Share of results of equity accounted associates and joint ventures presented within the Consolidated income statement includes \u20ac241m (2019: \u20ac348 million, 2018 \u20ac389 million) included within Adjusted operating profit, \u20ac25m (2019: \u20ac26 million, 2018: \u20ac9 million) included within Restructuring costs, \u20ac215 million (2019: \u20ac420 million, 2018: \u20ac439 million) included within Amortisation of acquired customer based and brand intangible assets and \u20ac2,024 million which is principally related to Vodafone Idea Limited (2019: \u20ac114 million, 2018

Amounts for the years ended 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2019 relate to fees for the interim review and statutory and regulatory filings during the year. The amount for the year ended 31 March 2018 includes non-recurring fees that were incurred during the preparations for a potential IPO of Vodafone New Zealand and the merger of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular.\n3. At the time of the Board decision to recommend Ernst & Young LLP as the statutory auditor for the year ended 31 March 2020 in February 2019, Ernst & Young LLP were providing a range of services to the Group. All services that were prohibited by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) or Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a statutory auditor to provide ceased by 31 March 2019. All engagements that were not prohibited by the FRC or SEC, but were not in accordance with the Group\u2019s own internal approval policy for non-audit services, ceased early in the financial year to enable a smooth transition to alternative suppliers, where required. These services had a value of approximately \u20ac5.2 million through to completion and are included in the table above.\n\nA description of the work performed by the Audit and Risk Committee in order to safeguard auditor independence when non-audit services are provided is set out in the Audit and Risk Committee report on pages 90 to 95.\n4. Impairment losses\n\nImpairment occurs when the carrying value of assets is greater than the present value of the net cash flows they are expected to generate. We review the carrying value of assets for each country in which we operate at least annually. For further details of our impairment review process see \u201cCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\u201d in note 1 \u201cBasis of preparation\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAccounting policies\n\nGoodwill\n\nGoodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.\n\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows, known as cash-generating units. The determination of the Group\u2019s cash-generating units is primarily based on the country where the Group supplies communications services and products. If cash flows from assets within one jurisdiction are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets in that same jurisdiction and management monitors performance separately, multiple cash-generating units are identified within that country.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Impairment losses recognised for goodwill are not reversible in subsequent periods.\n\nThe recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.\n\nManagement prepares formal five year management plans for the Group\u2019s cash-generating units, which are the basis for the value in use calculations.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets\n\nAt each reporting period date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment, finite lived intangible assets and equity-accounted investments to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount and an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nWhere there has been a change in the estimates used to determine recoverable amount and an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, not to exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years and an impairment loss reversal is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nImpairment losses\n\nFollowing our annual impairment review, the impairment charges recognised in the consolidated income statement within operating profit are stated below. Further detail on the events and circumstances that led to the recognition of the impairment charges is included later in this note.\n\n| Cash-generating unit          | Reportable segment | 2020 \u20acm | 2019 \u20acm | 2018 \u20acm |\n|------------------------------|--------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Spain                        | Spain              | 840     | 2,930   | \u2013       |\n| Ireland                      | Other Europe       | 630     | \u2013       | \u2013       |\n| Romania                      | Other Europe       | 110     | 310     | \u2013       |\n| Vodafone Automotive          | Common Functions   | 105     | 30      | \u2013       |\n| Vodafone Idea                | Other Markets      | \u2013       | 255     | \u2013       |\n| **Total**                    |                    | **1,685** | **3,525** | **\u2013** |\n\nFor the year ended 31 March 2019, the Group recorded a loss on disposal of Vodafone India of \u20ac3,420 million, including a loss on disposal of \u20ac1,276 million and a foreign exchange loss of \u20ac2,079 million which is included in discontinued operations. See note 27 \u201cAcquisitions and disposals\u201d for further details.\n\nFor the year ended 31 March 2018, the Group recorded a non-cash charge of \u20ac3,170 million (\u00a32,245 million net of tax), included in discontinued operations, as a result of the re-measurement of Vodafone India\u2019s fair value less costs of disposal.\n4. Impairment losses (continued)\n\nGoodwill\n\nThe remaining carrying value of goodwill at 31 March was as follows:\n\n|                | 2020  | 2019  |\n|----------------|-------|-------|\n| Germany        | 22,900| 12,479|\n| Italy          | 2,480 | 3,654 |\n| Other          | 5,891 | 7,220 |\n| **Total**      | 25,380| 16,133|\n\nKey assumptions used in the value in use calculations\n\nThe key assumptions used in determining the value in use are:\n\n| Assumption                        | How determined                                                                 |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Projected adjusted EBITDA         | Projected adjusted EBITDA has been based on past experience adjusted for the following: |\n|                                  | \u2022 In Europe, mobile revenue is expected to benefit from increased usage as customers transition to higher data bundles, and new products and services are introduced.

The segment is also expected to benefit from increased usage and penetration of M-Pesa in Africa; and |\n|                                  | \u2022 Margins are expected to be impacted by negative factors such as the cost of acquiring and retaining customers in increasingly competitive markets and by positive factors such as the efficiencies expected from the implementation of Group initiatives. |\n| Projected capital expenditure     | The cash flow forecasts for capital expenditure are based on past experience and include the ongoing capital expenditure required to increase capacity, meet the population coverage requirements of certain of the Group\u2019s licences and facilitate the continued growth in revenue and EBITDA discussed above. In Europe, capital expenditure is required to roll out capacity-building next generation 5G and gigabit networks. In the Rest of the World, capital expenditure will be required for the continued rollout of current and next generation mobile networks in emerging markets. Capital expenditure includes cash outflows for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and computer software. |\n| Projected licence and spectrum payments | To enable the continued provision of products and services, the cash flow forecasts for licence and spectrum payments for each relevant cash-generating unit include amounts for expected renewals and newly available spectrum. Beyond the five year forecast period, a long-run cost of spectrum is assumed. |\n| Long-term growth rate             | For the purposes of the Group\u2019s value in use calculations, a long-term growth rate into perpetuity is applied immediately at the end of the five year forecast period and is based on the lower of: |\n|                                  | \u2022 the nominal GDP growth rate forecasts for the country of operation; and |\n|                                  | \u2022 the long-term compound annual growth rate in adjusted EBITDA as estimated by management. |\n|                                  | Long-term compound annual growth rates determined by management may be lower than forecast nominal GDP growth rates due to the following market-specific factors: competitive intensity levels, maturity of business, regulatory environment or sector-specific inflation expectations. |\n| Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate | The discount rate applied to the cash flows of each of the Group\u2019s cash-generating units is generally based on the risk free rate for ten year bonds issued by the government in the respective market. Where government bond rates contain a material component of credit risk, high-quality local corporate bond rates may be used. These rates are adjusted for a risk premium to reflect both the increased risk of investing in equities and the systematic risk of the specific cash-generating unit. In making this adjustment, inputs required are the equity market risk premium (that is the required return over and above a risk free rate by an investor who is investing in the market as a whole) and the risk adjustment, beta, applied to reflect the risk of the specific cash-generating unit relative to the market as a whole. |\n|                                  | In determining the risk adjusted discount rate, management has applied an adjustment for the systematic risk to each of the Group\u2019s cash-generating companies determined using an average of the betas of comparable listed telecommunications companies and, where available and appropriate, across a specific territory. Management has used a forward-looking equity market risk premium that takes into consideration both studies by independent economists, the long-term average equity market risk premium and the market risk premiums typically used by valuations practitioners. |\n|                                  | The risk adjusted discount rate is also based on typical leverage ratios of telecommunications companies in each cash-generating unit\u2019s respective market or region. |\nYear ended 31 March 2020\n\nFor the year ended 31 March 2020, the Group recorded impairment charges of \u20ac0.8 billion, \u20ac0.6 billion, \u20ac0.1 billion and \u20ac0.1 billion with respect to the Group\u2019s investments in Spain, Ireland, Romania and Vodafone Automotive respectively. The impairment charges relate solely to goodwill and are recognised in the consolidated income statement within operating profit/(loss). The recoverable amounts for Spain, Ireland, Romania and Vodafone Automotive are \u20ac5.6 billion, \u20ac1.2 billion, \u20ac0.9 billion and \u20ac0.0 billion respectively, and based on value in use calculations.\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has developed rapidly in early 2020. Many countries have required businesses to limit or suspend operations and implemented travel restrictions and quarantine measures. The measures taken to contain the virus have adversely affected economic activity and disrupted many businesses. As the outbreak continues to progress and evolve, it is extremely challenging to predict the full extent and duration of its impact on Vodafone\u2019s businesses and the countries where Vodafone operates. Based on information available as at 31 March 2020, management has made additional adjustments to the five year business plans used in the Group\u2019s impairment testing in order to reflect the estimated impact. The impairment charges recognised and discussed immediately below, are based on expected cash flows after applying these adjustments.\n\nChallenging trading and economic conditions in Spain materialised in the prior financial year and management recognised an impairment charge following a reduction in projected cash flows. During the year ended 31 March 2020 there has been an observable repositioning towards low-cost brands and competitive intensity within the multi-branded market is expected to remain elevated in the medium term. These factors have led to management projecting lower cash flows and recognising an impairment charge with respect to the Group\u2019s investment in Spain.\n\nThe impairment charge recognised with respect to Ireland is attributable to increased competition and the aforementioned increased economic uncertainty. As a consequence, growth and ARPU\u2019s are expected to be lower. Management has reflected these assumptions in expected cash flows.\n\nThe impairment charges recognised with respect to Romania and Vodafone Automotive reflect management\u2019s latest assessment of likely trading and economic conditions in the five year business plan. Management\u2019s view of the long-term potential in these markets remains unchanged.\n\nThe European Liberty Global assets acquired in July 2019 (see note 27) have been subsumed within existing cash-generating units in Germany, Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania. The primary reason for acquiring the businesses was to create a converged national provider of digital infrastructure in Germany, together with creating converged communications operators in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania. Following the integration of the acquired businesses, management considers the cash flows within these cash-generating units to be largely interdependent and monitors performance on a country-level basis.\n\nOn 31 March 2020, the Group merged its passive tower infrastructure in Italy with INWIT (see note 27). On the date of the merger, management monitored performance of its operations in Italy on a country-wide basis and considered Vodafone Italy, including its passive tower infrastructure, to be one cash-generating unit for the purpose of impairment testing as at 31 March 2020. No impairment in relation to Vodafone Italy would be necessary if impairment testing was performed on a post-merger basis at 31 March 2020.\n\nValue in use assumptions\n\nThe table below shows key assumptions used in the value in use calculations.\n\n| Assumptions used in value in use calculation | Germany | Italy | Spain | Ireland | Romania | Vodafone Automotive |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------|-------|-------|---------|---------|---------------------|\n| Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate          | 7.5     | 10.3  | 9.2   | 7.6     | 10.2    | 9.1                 |\n| Long-term growth rate                       | 0.5     | 0.5   | 0.5   | 0.5     | 1.0     | 1.9                 |\n| Projected adjusted EBITDA\u00b9                  | 3.8     | 0.2   | 8.2   | 3.0     | 8.0     | 31.3                |\n| Projected capital expenditure\u00b2              | 20.1-20.7 | 12.5-13.4 | 16.2-18.1 | 10.7-15.2 | 13.7-18.5 | 14.1-23.4          |\n\nSensitivity analysis\n\nThe estimated recoverable amount of the Group\u2019s operations in Germany and Italy exceed their carrying values by \u20ac6.6 billion and \u20ac1.8 billion respectively. If the assumptions used in the impairment review were changed to a greater extent than as presented in the following table, the changes would, in isolation, lead to an impairment loss being recognised for the year ended 31 March 2020.\n\n| Change required for carrying value to equal recoverable amount | Germany | Italy |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-------|\n| Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate                           | 1.1     | 1.7   |\n| Long-term growth rate                                        | (1.0)   | (2.0) |\n| Projected adjusted EBITDA\u00b9                                   | (3.2)   | (3.1) |\n| Projected capital expenditure\u00b2                               | 11.4    | 7.9   |\nManagement considered the following reasonably possible changes in the key adjusted EBITDA\\(^1\\) and long-term growth rate assumptions, leaving all other assumptions unchanged. Due to increased uncertainty following the COVID-19 outbreak, management has widened the range of reasonably possible changes in the key adjusted EBITDA growth rate assumption to plus or minus 5 percentage points (2019: 2 percentage points). The sensitivity analysis presented is prepared on the basis that the reasonably possible change in each key assumption would not have a consequential impact on other assumptions used in the impairment review. The associated impact on the impairment assessment is presented in the table below, with the exception of Vodafone Automotive, where no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would materially change the impairment charge recognised.\n\nManagement believes that no reasonably possible or foreseeable change in the pre-tax adjusted discount rate or projected capital expenditure\\(^2\\) would cause the difference between the carrying value and recoverable amount for any cash-generating unit to be materially different to the base case disclosed below.\n\nThe carrying values for Vodafone UK, Portugal, Czech Republic and Hungary include goodwill arising from acquisitions and/or the purchase of operating licences or spectrum rights. While the recoverable amounts for these operating companies are not materially greater than their carrying value, each has a lower risk of giving rise to an impairment that would be material to the Group given their relative size or the composition of their carrying value.\n\nIf the assumptions used in the impairment review were changed to a greater extent than as presented in the following table, the changes would, in isolation, lead to an impairment loss being recognised in the year ended 31 March 2020.\n\n### Notes\n\n1. Projected adjusted EBITDA is expressed as the compound annual growth rates in the initial five years for all cash-generating units of the plans used for impairment testing.\n2. Projected capital expenditure, which excludes licences and spectrum, is expressed as capital expenditure as a percentage of revenue in the initial five years for all cash-generating units of the plans used for impairment testing.\n\n---\n\n**VodafoneZiggo**\n\nThe recoverable amount for VodafoneZiggo is not materially greater than its carrying value. If adverse impacts of economic, competitive, regulatory or other factors were to cause significant deterioration in the operations of VodafoneZiggo and the entity\u2019s expected future cash flows, this may lead to an impairment loss being recognised.\nYear ended 31 March 2019\n\nThe disclosures below for the year ended 31 March 2019 are as previously disclosed in the 31 March 2019 Annual Report.\n\nFor the year ended 31 March 2019, the Group recorded impairment charges of \u20ac2.9 billion, \u20ac0.3 billion, and \u20ac0.3 billion in respect of the Group\u2019s investments in Spain, Romania and Vodafone Idea respectively. The impairment charges with respect to Spain and Romania relate solely to goodwill and the impairment charge with respect to Vodafone Idea relates to the joint venture\u2019s carrying value. All impairment charges are recognised in the consolidated income statement within operating (loss)/profit. The recoverable amounts for Spain and Romania are \u20ac7.1 billion and \u20ac0.7 billion respectively and are based on value in use calculations. The recoverable amount for the Group\u2019s stake in Vodafone Idea is \u20ac1.6 billion and is based on its fair value less costs of disposal.\n\nFollowing challenging current trading and economic conditions, management has reassessed the expected future business performance in Spain. Following this reassessment, projected cash flows are lower and this has led to an impairment charge with respect to the Group\u2019s investment in Spain. The impairment charge with respect to the Group\u2019s investment in Romania was driven by an increase in the yield on Romanian government bonds which increased the discount rate and management\u2019s reassessment of the long-term growth rate applied beyond the five year business plan.\n\nVodafone Idea Limited\n\nThe Group\u2019s investment in Vodafone Idea was tested for impairment at 31 March 2019 in accordance with applicable IFRS. Impairment testing was considered appropriate as a result of market conditions and declines in the quoted share price of the company during the period.\n\nThe market environment in India remains highly challenging with significant pricing pressure, which has led to industry consolidation but a significantly lower level of profitability and greater pressure on financing. Management continues to consider it reasonable to assume an overall market and pricing recovery, however the timing and magnitude remains highly uncertain. Accordingly, there are a wide range of potential outcomes in deriving a current view of future business performance, cash flows and debt financing requirements for value in use purposes.\n\nManagement has concluded that the fair value less costs of disposal based on an observable share price is the appropriate basis to determine the recoverable amount of the Group\u2019s investment in Vodafone Idea for the purpose of impairment testing for the year ended 31 March 2019. Where the recoverable amount is less than the investment\u2019s carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount and an impairment is recognised.\n\nThe investment in Vodafone Idea was also tested for impairment as at 30 September 2018. The share price of INR38.55 implied a recoverable amount of INR152 billion (\u20ac1.8 billion) which was lower than the carrying value of the investment at the same date. An impairment charge of \u20ac0.3 billion was recognised to reduce the carrying value of the joint venture in the Group\u2019s consolidated statement of financial position.\n\nFollowing the formal announcement of the terms of Vodafone Idea\u2019s rights issue on 20 March 2019, the Vodafone Idea share price went \u2018ex-rights\u2019 on 29 March 2019 and closed at INR18.25. Based on information available to management on 31 March 2019, the recoverable amount of the Group\u2019s investment in Vodafone Idea was determined based on key assumptions relating to the number of new shares to which management intended to subscribe (8.8 billion) and the associated cost under the terms of the rights issue (INR12.5 per share). After taking into account these key assumptions and the quoted share price, the recoverable amount of the Group\u2019s interest in Vodafone Idea was determined to be INR123 billion (\u20ac1.6 billion) as at 31 March 2019.\n\nVodafone Idea\u2019s share price is observable in a quoted market and is considered a level 1 input under the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy. As management has also considered the observable and unquoted inputs related to the number and cost of the new shares to be issued under the rights issue, the recoverable amount quoted above is considered to be a level 2 valuation under the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe recoverable amount is \u20ac0.2 billion higher than the carrying value of the investment as at 31 March 2019 and no further changes to the carrying value or impairment charge recognised in September 2018 are required.\n\nThe carrying value of Vodafone Idea that has been tested for impairment is dependent on a wide range of assumptions, including the level of market pricing and the realisation of anticipated merger-related operating expenses and capital expenditure synergies. Should any of the assumptions not materialise, in whole or in part, these will impact the entity\u2019s expected future cash flows and may result in a future impairment. The carrying value is also dependent on the ability of the entity to refinance its liabilities as they fall due. Should this not be achievable, this will impact the liquidity of Vodafone Idea and will result in a future impairment, in whole or in part, of the Group\u2019s investment.\n\nBased solely on the closing share price of Vodafone Idea on 13 May 2019, the recoverable amount of the Group\u2019s 45.2% interest would be \u20ac0.6 billion lower than the recoverable amount as at 31 March 2019. No adjustment has been made to the carrying value of the Vodafone Idea joint venture as this is considered a non-adjusting event.\n\nValue in use assumptions\n\nThe table below shows key assumptions used in the value in use calculations.\n\n| Assumptions used in value in use calculation | Germany % | Italy % | Spain % | Romania % |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|---------|-----------|\n| Pre-tax adjusted discount rate              | 8.3       | 10.5   | 9.3     | 11.1      |\n| Long-term growth rate                       | 0.5       | 1.0    | 0.5     | 1.0       |\n| Projected adjusted EBITDA1                  | 2.9       | (0.1)  | 9.2     | 3.8       |\n| Projected capital expenditure2              | 16.9\u201319.9 | 12.2\u201312.5 | 17.1\u201318.4 | 12.1\u201312.7 |\n\nNotes:\n1.

Impairment losses (continued)\n\nSensitivity analysis\n\nThe estimated recoverable amount of the Group\u2019s operations in Germany, Italy, Spain and Romania exceed their carrying values by \u20ac7.4 billion, \u20ac2.7 billion, \u20ac0.5 billion and \u20ac0.1 billion respectively.

Financing costs mainly arise from interest due on bonds and commercial paper issued, bank loans and the results of hedging transactions used to manage foreign exchange and interest rate movements.\n\n|                      | 2020  | 2019  | 2018  |\n|----------------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| **Investment income:** |       |       |       |\n| Amortised cost       | 157   | 286   | 339   |\n| Fair value through profit and loss | 91    | 147   | 24    |\n| Foreign exchange     | \u2013     | \u2013     | 322   |\n| **Total**            | 248   | 433   | 685   |\n\n|                      | 2020  | 2019  | 2018  |\n|----------------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| **Financing costs:** |       |       |       |\n| Items in hedge relationships: |       |       |       |\n| Other loans          | \u2013     | 17    | 74    |\n| Interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps | (583) | (414) | (128) |\n| Fair value hedging instrument | (14)  | (8)   | 48    |\n| Fair value of hedged item | 6     | 10    | (36)  |\n| Other financial liabilities held at amortised cost: |       |       |       |\n| Bank loans and overdrafts | 586   | 336   | 317   |\n| Bonds and other liabilities | 1,850 | 1,567 | 885   |\n| Interest charge/(credit) on settlement of tax issues | 40    | (1)   | (11)  |\n| Fair value through profit and loss: |       |       |       |\n| Derivatives \u2013 options, forward starting swaps and futures | 1,129 | 391   | (75)  |\n| Foreign exchange      | 205   | 190   | \u2013     |\n| Interest on lease liabilities | 330   | \u2013     | \u2013     |\n| **Total**             | 3,549 | 2,088 | 1,074 |\n\n**Net financing costs**\n\n|                      | 2020  | 2019  | 2018  |\n|----------------------|-------|-------|-------|\n|                      | 3,301 | 1,655 | 389   |\n\nNotes:\n1.

Taxation\n\nThis note explains how our Group tax charge arises. The deferred tax section of the note also provides information on our expected future tax charges and sets out the tax assets held across the Group together with our view on whether or not we expect to be able to make use of these in the future.\n\nAccounting policies\n\nIncome tax expense represents the sum of the current and deferred taxes.\n\nCurrent tax payable or recoverable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because some items of income or expense are taxable or deductible in different years or may never be taxable or deductible. The Group\u2019s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date.\n\nThe Group recognises provisions for uncertain tax positions when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and management judge that it is probable that there will be a future outflow of economic benefits from the Group to settle the obligation. Uncertain tax positions are assessed and measured on an issue by issue basis within the jurisdictions that we operate either using management\u2019s estimate of the most likely outcome where the issues are binary, or the expected value approach where the issues have a range of possible outcomes. The Group recognises interest on late paid taxes as part of financing costs, and any penalties, if applicable, as part of the income tax expense.\n\nDeferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable in the future arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. It is accounted for using the statement of financial position liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that temporary differences or taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.\n\nSuch assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised to the extent they arise from the initial recognition of non-tax deductible goodwill.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint arrangements, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting period date and adjusted to reflect changes in the Group\u2019s assessment that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date.\n\nTax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they either relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or on different taxable entities which intend to settle the current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.\n\nTax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case the tax is recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity.\n\n| Income tax expense | 2020 \u20acm | 2019 \u20acm | 2018 \u20acm |\n|--------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| United Kingdom corporation tax expense/(credit): | | | |\n| Current year | 42 | 21 | 70 |\n| Adjustments in respect of prior years | (6) | (9) | (5) |\n| **Total** | **36** | **12** | **65** |\n| Overseas current tax expense/(credit): | | | |\n| Current year | 900 | 1,098 | 1,055 |\n| Adjustments in respect of prior years | 80 | (48) | (102) |\n| **Total** | **980** | **1,050** | **953** |\n| **Total current tax expense** | **1,016** | **1,062** | **1,018** |\n| Deferred tax on origination and reversal of temporary differences: | | | |\n| United Kingdom deferred tax | (318) | (232) | 39 |\n| Overseas deferred tax | 552 | 666 | (1,936) |\n| **Total deferred tax expense/(credit)** | **234** | **434** | **(1,897)** |\n| **Total income tax expense/(credit)** | **1,250** | **1,496** | **(879)** |\n\nUK operating profits are more than offset by statutory allowances for capital investment in the UK network and systems plus ongoing interest costs including those arising from the \u20ac10.7 billion of spectrum payments to the UK government in 2000, 2013 and 2018.\n6.

This is in accordance with the requirements on IAS 12.\n6. Taxation (continued)\n\nFactors affecting the tax charge in future years\n\nThe Group\u2019s future tax charge, and effective tax rate, could be affected by several factors including: tax reform in countries around the world, including any arising from the OECD\u2019s or European Commission\u2019s work on the taxation of the digital economy and European Commission initiatives such as the proposed tax and financial reporting directive or as a consequence of state aid investigations, future corporate acquisitions and disposals, any restructuring of our businesses and the resolution of open tax issues (see below).\n\nOn 25 April 2019, the European Commission published its full decision in relation to its investigation into the \u2018group financing exemption\u2019 (GFE) in the UK\u2019s controlled foreign company rules and whether the GFE constituted unlawful State Aid. They concluded the GFE does not constitute unlawful state aid when the managing of the financing activities is outside the UK. As the Group\u2019s Luxembourg financing activities are properly established and operate in accordance with EU and local law as well as the OECD\u2019s transfer pricing guidelines, we do not anticipate any significant impact as a result of the Commissions findings.\n\nWe do not anticipate any significant impact on our future tax charge, liabilities or assets, as a result of the UK leaving the European Union on 31 January 2020 but cannot rule out the possibility that a failure to reach satisfactory arrangements for the UK\u2019s future relationship with the European Union at the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020, could have an impact on such matters. We continue to monitor developments in this area.\n\nThe Group is routinely subject to audit by tax authorities in the territories in which it operates. The Group considers each issue on its merits and, where appropriate, holds provisions in respect of the potential tax liability that may arise. As at 31 March 2020, the Group holds provisions for such potential liabilities of \u20ac638 million (2019: \u20ac460 million). These provisions relate to multiple issues, across the jurisdictions in which the Group operates.\n\nAs the tax impact of a transaction can be uncertain until a conclusion is reached with the relevant tax authority or through a legal process, the amount ultimately paid may differ materially from the amount accrued and could therefore affect the Group\u2019s overall profitability and cash flows in future periods. See note 29 \u201cContingent liabilities and legal proceedings\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAt 31 March 2020, the gross amount and expiry dates of losses available for carry forward are as follows:\n\n| Losses for which a deferred tax asset is recognised | Expiring within 5 years \u00a3m | Expiring beyond 6 years \u00a3m | Unlimited \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------------|---------|\n| Losses for which no deferred tax is recognised     | 531                       | 143                       | 99,828       | 100,502 |\n|                                                   | 759                       | 9,404                     | 22,772       | 32,935  |\n|                                                   | **1,290**                 | **9,547**                 | **122,600**  | **133,437** |\n\nAt 31 March 2019, the gross amount and expiry dates of losses available for carry forward were as follows:\n\n| Losses for which a deferred tax asset is recognised | Expiring within 5 years \u00a3m | Expiring beyond 6 years \u00a3m | Unlimited \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------------|---------|\n| Losses for which no deferred tax is recognised     | 207                       | 37                        | 99,967       | 100,211 |\n|                                                   | 632                       | 7,063                     | 22,659       | 30,354  |\n|                                                   | **839**                   | **7,100**                 | **122,626**  | **130,565** |\n\nDeferred tax assets on losses in Luxembourg\n\nIncluded in the table above are losses of \u20ac82,372 million (2019: \u20ac82,372 million) that have arisen in Luxembourg companies, principally as a result of revaluations of those companies\u2019 investments for local GAAP purposes.\n\nA deferred tax asset of \u20ac20,544 million (2019: \u20ac21,425 million) has been recognised in respect of these losses, as we conclude it is probable that the Luxembourg entities will continue to generate taxable profits in the future against which we can utilise these losses. The Luxembourg companies\u2019 income is derived from the Group\u2019s internal financing and procurement and roaming activities. The Group has reviewed the latest forecasts for the Luxembourg companies, including their ability to continue to generate income beyond the forecast period under the tax laws substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. The assessment also considered whether the structure of the Group would continue to allow the generation of taxable income. Based on this, Group\u2019s management concludes that it is probable that the Luxembourg companies will continue to generate taxable income in the future. Any future changes in tax law or the structure of the Group could have a significant effect on the use of losses, including the period over which the losses can be utilised.\n\nBased on the current forecasts the losses will be fully utilised over the next 40 to 45 years. A 5%-10% change in the forecast income in Luxembourg would change the period over which the losses will be fully utilised by 2 to 5 years. The shorter recovery period in the current year is primarily driven by the consequences of the acquisition of Unity Media in Germany and the UPC entities in Central Europe.\n\nThe Group\u2019s effective tax rate reconciliation includes \u20ac348 million (2019: \u20ac488 million) as a result of the revaluation of investments based upon the local GAAP financial statements and tax returns at 31 March 2020. These revaluations of investments for local GAAP purposes, which are based on the Group\u2019s value in use calculations, can give rise to impairments or the reversal of previous impairments. The reversal of impairments can result in a significant change to our deferred tax assets and the period over which these assets can be utilised. Impairments have a narrower impact as losses incurred in the year expire after 17 years and are used after any pre-existing losses.\nIn addition to the above, \u20ac9,242 million (2019: \u20ac7,063 million) of the Group\u2019s Luxembourg losses expire after 14 to 17 years and no deferred tax asset is recognised as they will expire before we can use these losses. The remaining losses do not expire. We also have \u20ac9,136 million (2019: \u20ac9,132 million) of Luxembourg losses in a former Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group company, for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised as it is uncertain whether these losses will be utilised.\n\n**Deferred tax assets on losses in Germany**\n\nThe Group has tax losses of \u20ac17,160 million (2019: \u20ac17,417 million) in Germany arising on the write down of investments in Germany in 2000. The losses are available to use against both German federal and trade tax liabilities and they do not expire.\n\nA deferred tax asset of \u20ac2,662 million (2019: \u20ac2,701 million) has been recognised in respect of these losses as we conclude it is probable that the German business will continue to generate taxable profits in the future against which we can utilise these losses. The Group has reviewed the latest forecasts for the German business which incorporate the unsystematic risks of operating in the telecommunications business. In the period beyond the 5 year forecast we have reviewed the profits inherent in the terminal period and based on these and our expectations for the German business we believe it is probable the German losses will be fully utilised.\n\nBased on the current forecasts the losses will be fully utilised over the next 9 to 14 years. A 5%-10% change in the forecast profits of the German business would alter the utilisation period by 1 to 2 years.\n\n**Deferred tax assets on losses in Spain**\n\nThe Group has tax losses of \u20ac4,281 million (2019: \u20ac3,821 million) in Spain which are available to offset against the future profits of the Grupo Corporativo ONO business. The losses do not expire and no deferred tax asset is recognised for these losses due to the trading environment in Spain.\n\n**Other tax losses**\n\nThe Group has losses amounting to \u20ac7,500 million (2019: \u20ac7,678 million) in respect of UK subsidiaries which are only available for offset against future capital gains and since it is uncertain whether these losses will be utilised, no deferred tax asset has been recognised, in line with the prior year.\n\nThe remaining losses relate to a number of other jurisdictions across the Group. There are also \u20ac1,514 million (2019: \u20ac798 million) of unrecognised temporary differences relating to treasury items and other items.\n\nNo deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of a further \u20ac7,130 million (2019: \u20ac10,425 million) of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognised deferred tax liabilities in respect of these unremitted earnings.\n7. Discontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale\n\nIn the prior financial year, following the agreement to combine our Indian operations with Idea Cellular into a jointly controlled company, in accordance with IFRS accounting standards, the results of Vodafone India were included in discontinued operations until the transaction completed on 31 August 2018.\n\nThe Group classifies non-current assets and assets and liabilities within disposal groups (\u2018assets\u2019) as held for sale if the assets are available immediately for sale in their present condition, management is committed to a plan to sell the assets under usual terms, it is highly probable that their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and the sale is expected to be completed within one year from the date of the initial classification.\n\nAssets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately as current items in the consolidated statement of financial position and are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not depreciated or amortised once classified as held for sale.\n\nWhere operations constitute a separately reportable segment (see note 2 \u201cRevenue disaggregation and segmental analysis\u201d) and have been disposed of, or are classified as held for sale, the Group classifies such operations as discontinued.\n\nDiscontinued operations are excluded from the results of continuing operations and are presented as a single amount as profit or loss after tax from discontinued operations in the Group consolidated income statement. Discontinued operations are also excluded from segment reporting. All other notes to the financial statements include amounts for continuing operations, unless indicated otherwise.\n\nDiscontinued operations\n\nOn 20 March 2017, Vodafone announced the agreement to combine its subsidiary, Vodafone India (excluding its 42% stake in Indus Towers), with Idea Cellular in India.

Fair value of the Group\u2019s equity interest at 31 March 2018 was assessed to be INR 223 billion (2017: INR 370 billion), equivalent to \u20ac2.8 billion (2017: \u20ac5.3 billion) at the foreign exchange rates prevailing at those dates. The fair value of Vodafone India at 31 March 2018 was assessed to be primarily determinable by reference to the Idea Cellular Limited quoted share price as at 31 March 2018 of INR 75.9 per share. This technique was considered to result in a level 2 valuation as per IFRS 13, as while the quoted share price for Idea Cellular Limited was observable, further adjustments, such as an assumption regarding the disposal of Vodafone India with a certain level of debt, were required to estimate fair value less costs of disposal.\n\n**Assets and liabilities held for sale**\n\nAssets and liabilities held for sale at 31 March 2020 comprise:\n\n- A 24.95% interest in Vodafone Hutchison Australia; and\n- The Group\u2019s 55% interest in Vodafone Egypt following the announcement on 29 January 2020 that the Group has signed a memorandum of understanding with Saudi Telecom Company for the sale of Vodafone Egypt.\n\nAssets and liabilities held for sale at 31 March 2019 comprise a 24.95% interest in Vodafone Hutchison Australia and a 12.6% interest in Indus Towers. The held for sale classification for 12.6% of Indus Towers was reversed during the year ended 31 March 2020 due to events that occurred during the year. The stake is now equity accounted with the remainder of the Group\u2019s interest in Indus Towers (see note 28).\n\nThe relevant assets and liabilities are detailed in the table below.\n\n**Assets and liabilities held for sale**\n\n|                      | 2020 \u20acm | 2019 \u20acm |\n|----------------------|---------|---------|\n| **Non-current assets** |         |         |\n| Goodwill             | 107     | \u2013       |\n| Other intangible assets | 379     | \u2013       |\n| Property, plant and equipment | 916     | \u2013       |\n| Investments in associates and joint ventures | (412) | (231) |\n| Trade and other receivables | 15     | \u2013       |\n| **Total**            | 1,005   | (231)   |\n| **Current assets**   |         |         |\n| Inventory            | 13      | \u2013       |\n| Taxation recoverable | 3       | \u2013       |\n| Trade and other receivables | 313     | \u2013       |\n| Cash and cash equivalents | 273     | \u2013       |\n| **Total**            | 602     | \u2013       |\n| **Total assets held for sale** | 1,607   | (231)   |\n| **Non-current liabilities** |         |         |\n| Long-term borrowings | 57      | \u2013       |\n| Deferred tax liabilities | 60     | \u2013       |\n| Provisions           | 5       | \u2013       |\n| **Total**            | 122     | \u2013       |\n| **Current liabilities** |         |         |\n| Short-term borrowings | 150     | \u2013       |\n| Taxation liabilities | 116     | \u2013       |\n| Provisions           | 29      | \u2013       |\n| Trade and other payables | 634     | \u2013       |\n| **Total**            | 929     | \u2013       |\n| **Total liabilities held for sale** | 1,051   | \u2013       |\n8.

Intangible assets\n\nThe statement of financial position contains significant intangible assets, mainly in relation to goodwill and licences and spectrum. Goodwill, which arises when we acquire a business and pay a higher amount than the fair value of its net assets primarily due to the synergies we expect to create, is not amortised but is subject to annual impairment reviews. Licences and spectrum are amortised over the life of the licence. For further details see \u201cCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\u201d in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAccounting policies\n\nIdentifiable intangible assets are recognised when the Group controls the asset, it is probable that future economic benefits attributed to the asset will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be reliably measured. Identifiable intangible assets are recognised at fair value when the Group completes a business combination. The determination of the fair values of the separately identified intangibles, is based, to a considerable extent, on management\u2019s judgement.\n\nGoodwill\n\nGoodwill arising on the acquisition of an entity represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group\u2019s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the entity recognised at the date of acquisition.\n\nGoodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is evidence that it may be required. Goodwill is denominated in the currency of the acquired entity and revalued to the closing exchange rate at each reporting period date.\n\nNegative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised directly in the income statement.\n\nOn disposal of a subsidiary or a joint arrangement, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss recognised in the income statement on disposal.\n\nFinite lived intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets with finite lives are stated at acquisition or development cost, less accumulated amortisation. The amortisation period and method is reviewed at least annually. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates.\n\nLicence and spectrum fees\n\nAmortisation periods for licence and spectrum fees are determined primarily by reference to the unexpired licence period, the conditions for licence renewal and whether licences are dependent on specific technologies. Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives from the commencement of related network services.\n\nComputer software\n\nComputer software comprises software purchased from third parties as well as the cost of internally developed software. Computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software. Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and are probable of producing future economic benefits, are recognised as intangible assets. Direct costs of software development include employee costs and directly attributable overheads.\n\nSoftware integral to an item of hardware equipment is classified as property, plant and equipment.\n\nCosts associated with maintaining software programs are recognised as an expense when they are incurred.\n\nAmortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life from the date the software is available for use.\n\nOther intangible assets\n\nOther intangible assets, including brands and customer bases, are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. Amortisation is charged to the income statement, over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets from the date they are available for use, on a straight-line basis. The amortisation basis adopted for each class of intangible asset reflects the Group\u2019s consumption of the economic benefit from that asset. From 1 April 2019, the Group revised the method of allocating the amortisation of acquired customer base intangibles over their useful economic lives from a sum of digits calculation to a straight-line basis. Customer base assets at 1 April 2019 related to acquired joint ventures; the revision to the allocation methodology resulted in a \u20ac152 million reduction in losses recorded in the Group\u2019s share of results of equity accounted associates and joint ventures for the year ended 31 March 2020.\n\nEstimated useful lives\n\nThe estimated useful lives of finite lived intangible assets are as follows:\n\n- Licence and spectrum fees 3 - 25 years\n- Computer software 3 - 5 years\n- Brands 1 - 10 years\n- Customer bases 2 - 18 years\n### 10.

Depreciation of these assets commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.\n\nThe cost of property, plant and equipment includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and installation.\n\nDepreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land, using the straight-line method, over their estimated useful lives, as follows:\n\n| Land and buildings          | 25 - 50 years |\n|-----------------------------|--------------|\n| Freehold buildings          | 25 - 50 years |\n| Leasehold premises          | the term of the lease |\n\n| Equipment, fixtures and fittings | 1 - 35 years |\n|----------------------------------|--------------|\n| Network infrastructure and other | 1 - 35 years |\n\nDepreciation is not provided on freehold land.\n\nRight-of-use assets arising from the Group\u2019s lease arrangements are depreciated over their reasonably certain lease term, as determined under the Group\u2019s leases policy (see note 20 \u201cLeases\u201d and \u201cCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\u201d in note 1 for details).\n\nThe gain or loss arising on the disposal, retirement or granting of a finance lease on an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between any proceeds from sale or receivables arising on a lease and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.\n### 11.

Additions of \u20ac4,593 million and a depreciation charge of \u20ac3,720 million were recorded in respect of right-of-use assets during the year to 31 March 2020.\n12. Investments in associates and joint arrangements\n\nThe Group holds interests in an associate in Kenya, where we have significant influence, as well as in a number of joint arrangements in the UK, Italy, the Netherlands, India and Australia, where we share control with one or more third parties. For further details see \u201cCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\u201d in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAccounting policies\n\nInterests in joint arrangements\n\nA joint arrangement is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control; that is, when the relevant activities that significantly affect the investee\u2019s returns require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Joint arrangements are either joint operations or joint ventures.\n\nGains or losses resulting from the contribution or sale of a subsidiary as part of the formation of a joint arrangement are recognised in respect of the Group\u2019s entire equity holding in the subsidiary.\n\nJoint operations\n\nA joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have the rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement or that other facts and circumstances indicate that this is the case. The Group\u2019s share of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows are combined with the equivalent items in the financial statements on a line-by-line basis.\n\nAny goodwill arising on the acquisition of the Group\u2019s interest in a joint operation is accounted for in accordance with the Group\u2019s accounting policy for goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary.\n\nJoint ventures\n\nA joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have the rights to the net assets of the arrangement.\n\nAt the date of acquisition, any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group\u2019s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the joint venture is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment.\n\nThe results and assets and liabilities of joint ventures, other than those joint ventures or part thereof that are held for sale (see note 7 \u201cDiscontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale\u201d), are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, investments in joint ventures are carried in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group\u2019s share of the net assets of the joint venture, less any impairment in the value of the investment. The Group\u2019s share of post-tax profits or losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement. Losses of a joint venture in excess of the Group\u2019s interest in that joint venture are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.\n\nAssociates\n\nAn associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint arrangement.\n\nSignificant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but where the Group does not have control or joint control over those policies.\n\nAt the date of acquisition, any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group\u2019s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the associate is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment.\n\nThe results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group\u2019s share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of the investment. The Group\u2019s share of post-tax profits or losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement. Losses of an associate in excess of the Group\u2019s interest in that associate are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.\n\nJoint operations\n\nThe Company\u2019s principal joint operation has share capital consisting solely of ordinary shares and is indirectly held, and principally operates in the UK. The financial and operating activities of the operation are jointly controlled by the participating shareholders and are primarily designed for all but an insignificant amount of the output to be consumed by the shareholders.\n\n| Name of joint operation | Principal activity | Country of incorporation or registration | Percentage shareholdings |\n|-------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Cornerstone Telecommunications Infrastructure Limited | Network infrastructure | UK | 50.0 |\n\nNote:\n\n1 Effective ownership percentages of Vodafone Group Plc at 31 March 2020 rounded to the nearest tenth of one percent.\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n12.

Effective ownership percentages of Vodafone Group Plc at 31 March 2020 rounded to the nearest tenth of one percent.\n2. At 31 March 2020 the fair value of the Group\u2019s interest in Vodafone Idea Limited was INR 40 billion (\u20ac476 million) (2019: INR 123 billion (\u20ac1,580 million)) based on the quoted share price on the National Stock Exchange of India.\n3. At 31 March 2020 the fair value of the Group\u2019s interest in INWIT S.p.A was \u20ac3,345 million based on the quoted share price on the Milan Stock Exchange.\n4. Vodafone Idea was formed on 31 August 2018 following the combination of Vodafone India Ltd with Idea Cellular Limited.\n\nVodafone Idea\n\nThe equity accounted results for Vodafone Idea Limited (VIL) for the period included an estimate for a material charge for amounts due following the recent Supreme Court of India judgement in the case Union of India v Association of Unified Telecom Service Providers of India and Others regarding the definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) used to calculate regulatory fees. Further detail is provided in note 29.\n\nThe Group\u2019s recorded share of VIL\u2019s resulting losses has been restricted to the amount that reduced the Group\u2019s carrying value in VIL to \u20acnil at 30 September 2019. The Group\u2019s carrying value was \u20ac1,392 million at 31 March 2019 and in May 2019, the Group invested \u20ac1,410 million via a rights issue. Significant uncertainties exist in relation to VIL\u2019s ability to generate the cash flow that it needs to settle, or refinance its liabilities and guarantees as they fall due, including those relating to the AGR judgement.\n\nThe value of the Group\u2019s 42% shareholding in Indus Towers Limited (\u2018Indus\u2019) is, in part, dependent on the income generated by Indus from tower rentals to major customers, including VIL. Any inability of these major customers to pay such amounts in the future may result in an impairment in the carrying value of the Group\u2019s investment in Indus (31 March 2020: \u20ac0.8 billion).\n\nThe following table provides aggregated financial information for the Group\u2019s joint ventures as it relates to the amounts recognised in the income statement, statement of comprehensive income and statement of financial position.\n\n| Name of joint venture | Investment in joint ventures | (Loss)/profit from continuing operations | Other comprehensive income | Total comprehensive (expense)/income |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                       | 2020 \u20acm | 2019 \u20acm | 2018 \u20acm | 2020 \u20acm | 2019 \u20acm | 2018 \u20acm | 2020 \u20acm | 2019 \u20acm | 2018 \u20acm | 2020 \u20acm | 2019 \u20acm | 2018 \u20acm |\n| Vodafone Idea Limited | \u2013       | 1,392   | \u2013       | (2,546) | (903)   | \u2013       | (8)     | (1)     | \u2013       | (2,554) | (904)   | \u2013       |\n| VodafoneZiggo Group Holding B.V. | 1,630 | 1,842   | 2,119   | (64)    | (239)   | (398)   | \u2013       | 4       | 1       | (64)    | (235)   | (397)   |\n| INWIT S.p.A.          | 3,345   | \u2013       | \u2013       | \u2013       | \u2013       | \u2013       | \u2013       | \u2013       | \u2013       | \u2013       | \u2013       | \u2013       |\n| Indus Towers Limited  | 766     | 601     | 893     | 19      | 55      | 135     | 7       | \u2013       | \u2013       | 26      | 55      | 135     |\n| Vodafone Hutchison Australia Pty Limited | (466) | (484)   | (979)   | (35)    | (23)    | 32      | \u2013       | \u2013       | \u2013       | (35)    | (23)    | 32      |\n| Other                | 48      | 48      | 64      | (125)   | (14)    | (15)    | \u2013       | \u2013       | \u2013       | (125)   | (14)    | (15)    |\n| Total                | 5,323   | 3,399   | 2,097   | (2,751) | (1,124) | (246)   | (1)     | 3       | 1       | (2,752) | (1,121) | (245)   |\nSummarised financial information for each of the Group\u2019s material joint ventures on a 100% ownership basis is set out below.\n\nFinancial information is presented for VIL for the six month period to, and as at 30 September 2019 on the basis that full-year information in relation to VIL has not been released at the date of approval of these financial statements and as such is market sensitive for VIL.

Other investments\n\nThe Group holds a number of other listed and unlisted investments, mainly comprising managed funds, deposits and government bonds.\n\nAccounting policies\n\nOther investments comprising debt and equity instruments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at fair value, including transaction costs.\n\nDebt securities that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. Debt securities that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost are measured at fair value through profit and loss.\n\nEquity securities are classified and measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to profit or loss following derecognition of the investment.\n\n| Included within non-current assets: | 2020 \u20acm | 2019 \u20acm |\n|-----------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Equity securities\u00b9 | 77 | 48 |\n| Debt securities\u00b2 | 715 | 822 |\n| **Total** | **792** | **870** |\n\nDebt securities include \u20ac0.7 billion (2019: \u20ac0.8 billion) of loan notes issued by VodafoneZiggo Holding B.V.\n\nCurrent other investments comprise the following:\n\n| Included within current assets: | 2020 \u20acm | 2019 \u20acm |\n|---------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Short-term investments: | | |\n| Bonds and debt securities\u00b3 | 2,796 | 4,690 |\n| Managed investment funds\u2074 | 2,451 | 6,405 |\n| **Total** | **5,247** | **11,095** |\n| Other investments\u2075 | 1,842 | 1,917 |\n| **Total** | **7,089** | **13,012** |\n\nNotes:\n\n1. Items are measured at fair value and the valuation basis is level 2 classification, which comprises items where fair value is determined from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\n2. Items are measured at amortised cost and the carrying amount approximates fair value.\n3. \u20ac1,115 million (2019: \u20ac1,184 million) is measured at amortised cost and remaining items are measured at fair value. For \u20ac1,681 million (2019: \u20ac3,011 million) the valuation basis is level 1 classification, which comprises financial instruments where fair value is determined by unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The remaining balance is level 2 classification.\n4. Items measured at fair value and the valuation basis is level 2 classification.\n5. \u20ac1,017 million (2019: \u20ac1,097 million) is measured at fair value and the valuation basis is level 1. The remaining items are measured at amortised cost and the carrying amount approximates fair value.\n\nThe Group invests surplus cash positions across a portfolio of short-term investments to manage liquidity and credit risk whilst achieving suitable returns. These assets do not meet the definition of cash and cash equivalents, but are included in the Group\u2019s net debt based on their liquidity.\n\nBonds and debt securities includes \u20ac194 million (2019: \u20ac941 million) of highly liquid Japanese and \u20acnil (2019: \u20ac955 million) German government securities; \u20ac1,016 million (2019: \u20acnil) of German government backed securities; \u20ac471 million (2019: \u20ac1,115 million) of UK government bonds and \u20ac1,115 million (2019: \u20ac1,184 million) of other assets paid as collateral on derivative financial instruments. Managed investment funds of \u20ac2,451 million (2019: \u20ac5,513 million) are in funds with liquidity of up to 90 days.\n\nOther investments are excluded from net debt based on their liquidity and primarily consist of restricted debt securities including amounts held in qualifying assets by Group insurance companies to meet regulatory requirements.\n14. Trade and other receivables\n\nTrade and other receivables mainly consist of amounts owed to us by customers and amounts that we pay to our suppliers in advance. Derivative financial instruments with a positive market value are reported within this note as are contract assets, which represent an asset for accrued revenue in respect of goods or services delivered to customers for which a trade receivable does not yet exist and finance lease receivables, recognised where the Group acts as a lessor. See note 20 \u201cLeases\u201d for more information on the Group\u2019s leasing activities.\n\nAccounting policies\n\nTrade receivables represent amounts owed by customers where the right to payment is conditional only on the passage of time. Trade receivables that are recovered in instalments from customers over an extended period are discounted at market rates and interest revenue is accreted over the expected repayment period. Other trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value. When the Group establishes a practice of selling portfolios of receivables from time to time these portfolios are recorded at fair value through other comprehensive income; all other trade receivables are recorded at amortised cost.\n\nThe carrying value of all trade receivables, contract assets and finance lease receivables recorded at amortised cost is reduced by allowances for lifetime estimated credit losses. Estimated future credit losses are first recorded on the initial recognition of a receivable and are based on the ageing of the receivable balances, historical experience and forward looking considerations. Individual balances are written off when management deems them not to be collectible.\n\n| Included within non-current assets: | 2020 \u00a3m | 2019 \u00a3m |\n|-----------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Trade receivables                 | 68      | 197     |\n| Trade receivables held at fair value through other comprehensive income | 261 | 179 |\n| Net investment in leases\u00b9         | 118     | \u2013       |\n| Contract assets                   | 583     | 531     |\n| Contract-related costs            | 628     | 375     |\n| Other receivables                 | 84      | 78      |\n| Prepayments                       | 212     | 371     |\n| Derivative financial instruments\u00b2 | 8,424   | 3,439   |\n| **Total**                         | **10,378** | **5,170** |\n\n| Included within current assets:   | 2020 \u00a3m | 2019 \u00a3m |\n|-----------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Trade receivables                 | 3,706   | 4,088   |\n| Trade receivables held at fair value through other comprehensive income | 556 | 613 |\n| Net investment in leases\u00b9         | 32      | \u2013       |\n| Contract assets                   | 2,980   | 3,671   |\n| Contract-related costs            | 1,293   | 1,132   |\n| Amounts owed by associates and joint ventures | 362 | 388 |\n| Other receivables                 | 871     | 876     |\n| Prepayments                       | 859     | 1,227   |\n| Derivative financial instruments\u00b2 | 752     | 195     |\n| **Total**                         | **11,411** | **12,190** |\n\nNotes:\n\n1 Previously disclosed as part of prepayments in the year ended 31 March 2019.\n2 Items are measured at fair value and the valuation basis is level 2 classification, which comprises items where fair value is determined from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\n\nThe Group\u2019s trade receivables and contract assets are classified at amortised cost unless stated otherwise and are measured after allowances for future expected credit losses, see note 22 \u201cCapital and financial risk management\u201d for more information on credit risk.\n\nThe carrying amounts of trade and other receivables, which are measured at amortised cost, approximate their fair value and are predominantly non-interest bearing.\n\nThe Group\u2019s contract-related costs comprise \u20ac1,855 million (2019: \u20ac1,433 million) relating to costs incurred to obtain customer contracts and \u20ac66 million (2019: \u20ac74 million) relating to costs incurred to fulfil customer contracts; an amortisation and impairment expense of \u20ac1,475 million (2019: \u20ac1,506 million) was recognised in operating profit during the year.\n\nIn February 2020 \u20ac357m (January and February 2019 \u20ac57 million and \u20ac70 million, respectively) of trade receivables were reclassified from amortised cost to fair value through other comprehensive income following changes to the Group\u2019s business model under which the balances may be sold to a third party. The fair values of the derivative financial instruments are calculated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market interest rates and foreign currency rates prevailing at 31 March.\n15. Trade and other payables\n\nTrade and other payables mainly consist of amounts owed to suppliers that have been invoiced or are accrued and contract liabilities relating to consideration received from customers in advance. They also include taxes and social security amounts due in relation to the Group\u2019s role as an employer. Derivative financial instruments with a negative market value are reported within this note.\n\nAccounting policies\n\nTrade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal value.\n\n| Included within non-current liabilities: | 2020 \u00a3m | 2019 \u00a3m |\n|----------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Other payables                         | 340     | 327     |\n| Accruals                               | 60      | 113     |\n| Contract liabilities                   | 612     | 574     |\n| Derivative financial instruments\u00b9      | 4,177   | 1,924   |\n| **Total**                              | **5,189** | **2,938** |\n\n| Included within current liabilities:   |         |         |\n|----------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Trade payables                         | 6,599   | 6,541   |\n| Amounts owed to associates and joint ventures | 51      | 26      |\n| Other taxes and social security payable | 1,104   | 1,218   |\n| Other payables                         | 2,037   | 1,410   |\n| Accruals\u00b2                              | 4,713   | 6,120   |\n| Contract liabilities                   | 1,991   | 1,818   |\n| Derivative financial instruments\u00b9      | 590     | 520     |\n| **Total**                              | **17,085** | **17,653** |\n\nNotes:\n\n1.

Includes \u00a3nil (2019: \u00a3823 million) payable in relation to the irrevocable and non-discretionary share buyback programme announced in January 2019.\n\nThe carrying amounts of trade and other payables approximate their fair value.\n\nMaterially all of the \u20ac1,818 million recorded as current contract liabilities at 1 April 2019 was recognised as revenue during the year.\n\nOther payables included within non-current liabilities include \u20ac294 million (2019: \u20ac288 million) in respect of the re-insurance of a third party annuity policy related to the Vodafone and CWW Sections of the Vodafone UK Group Pension Scheme.\n\nThe fair values of the derivative financial instruments are calculated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market interest rates and foreign currency rates prevailing at 31 March.\n16. Provisions\n\nA provision is a liability recorded in the statement of financial position, where there is uncertainty over the timing or amount that will be paid, and is therefore often estimated. The main provisions we hold are in relation to asset retirement obligations, which include the cost of returning network infrastructure sites to their original condition at the end of the lease, and claims for legal and regulatory matters.\n\nAccounting policies\n\nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors\u2019 best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material. Where the timing of settlement is uncertain amounts are classified as non-current where settlement is expected more than 12 months from the reporting date.\n\nAsset retirement obligations\n\nIn the course of the Group\u2019s activities, a number of sites and other assets are utilised which are expected to have costs associated with decommissioning. The associated cash outflows are substantially expected to occur at the dates of decommissioning of the assets to which they relate, and are long term in nature.\n\nLegal and regulatory\n\nThe Group is involved in a number of legal and other disputes, including notifications of possible claims. The Directors of the Company, after taking legal advice, have established provisions after taking into account the facts of each case. For a discussion of certain legal issues potentially affecting the Group see note 29 \u201cContingent liabilities and legal proceedings\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nOther provisions\n\nOther provisions comprise various amounts including those for restructuring costs and, for the year ended 31 March 2019, unutilised property. The associated cash outflows for restructuring costs are primarily less than one year.\n\n|                      | Asset retirement obligations \u00a3m | Legal and regulatory \u00a3m | Other \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n|----------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------|----------|----------|\n| 31 March 2018        | 583                             | 522                     | 851      | 1,956    |\n| Exchange movements   | (4)                             | (5)                     | 5        | (4)      |\n| Amounts capitalised in the year | 210                             | \u2013                       | \u2013        | 210      |\n| Amounts charged to the income statement | \u2013                              | 91                      | 643      | 734      |\n| Utilised in the year - payments | (32)                            | (53)                    | (253)    | (338)    |\n| Amounts released to the income statement | \u2013                              | (48)                    | (108)    | (156)    |\n| 31 March 2019        | 757                             | 507                     | 1,138    | 2,402    |\n| Adoption of IFRS 16  | \u2013                               | \u2013                       | (85)     | (85)     |\n| 1 April 2019         | 757                             | 507                     | 1,053    | 2,317    |\n| Exchange movements   | (16)                            | (2)                     | 3        | (15)     |\n| Acquisition of subsidiaries | 56                             | 18                      | 104      | 178      |\n| Disposal of subsidiaries | (69)                            | \u2013                       | (6)      | (75)     |\n| Amounts capitalised in the year | 270                             | \u2013                       | \u2013        | 270      |\n| Amounts charged to the income statement | \u2013                              | 122                     | 712      | 834      |\n| Utilised in the year - payments | (34)                            | (98)                    | (579)    | (711)    |\n| Amounts released to the income statement | (9)                             | (45)                    | (212)    | (266)    |\n| Transfer to liabilities held for resale | (5)                             | (27)                    | (2)      | (34)     |\n| 31 March 2020        | 950                             | 475                     | 1,073    | 2,498    |\n\nNote:\n\n1 Other includes restructuring provisions of \u20ac543 million (2019: \u20ac499 million).\nProvisions have been analysed between current and non-current as follows:\n\n### 31 March 2020\n\n|                      | Asset retirement obligations \u00a3m | Legal and regulatory \u00a3m | Other \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n|----------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Current liabilities  | 23                              | 292                      | 709      | 1,024    |\n| Non-current liabilities | 927                            | 183                      | 364      | 1,474    |\n|                      | **950**                          | **475**                  | **1,073**| **2,498**|\n\n### 31 March 2019\n\n|                      | Asset retirement obligations \u00a3m | Legal and regulatory \u00a3m | Other \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n|----------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Current liabilities  | 28                              | 274                      | 858      | 1,160    |\n| Non-current liabilities | 729                            | 233                      | 280      | 1,242    |\n|                      | **757**                          | **507**                  | **1,138**| **2,402**|\n\n### 17.

The market value of shares held was \u20ac2,610 million (2019: \u20ac2,566 million). During the year, 49,629,851 (2019: 45,657,750) treasury shares were reissued under Group share schemes. On 25 February 2019, 799,067,749 treasury shares were issued in settlement of tranche 2 of the maturing subordinated mandatory convertible bond.\n2. On 5 March 2019 the Group announced the placing of subordinated mandatory convertible bonds totaling \u20ac1.72 billion with a 2 year maturity date in 2021 and \u20ac1.72 billion with a 3 year maturity date due in 2022. The bonds are convertible into a total of 2,684,563,759 ordinary shares with a conversion price of \u20ac1.2814 per share. For further details see note 21 \u201cBorrowings\u201d.\n3.

Cash and cash equivalents\n\nThe majority of the Group\u2019s cash is held in bank deposits or money market funds which have a maturity of three months or less to enable us to meet our short-term liquidity requirements.\n\nAccounting policies\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and call deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Assets in money market funds, whose contractual cash flows do not represent solely payments of interest and principal, are measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value included in net profit or loss for the period. All other cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortised cost.\n\n| | 2020 \u20acm | 2019 \u20acm |\n|---|---------|---------|\n| Cash at bank and in hand | 1,947 | 2,434 |\n| Repurchase agreements and bank deposits | 2,202 | 2,196 |\n| Money market funds1 | 9,135 | 9,007 |\n| **Cash and cash equivalents as presented in the statement of financial position** | **13,284** | **13,637** |\n| Bank overdrafts | (269) | (32) |\n| Cash and cash equivalents held for sale | 273 | \u2013 |\n| **Cash and cash equivalents as presented in the statement of cash flows** | **13,288** | **13,605** |\n\nNote:\n\n1. Items are measured at fair value and the valuation basis is level 1 classification, which comprises financial instruments where fair value is determined by unadjusted quoted prices in active markets.\n\nThe carrying amount of balances at amortised cost approximates their fair value.\n\nCash and cash equivalents of \u20ac1,460 million (2019: \u20ac1,381 million) are held in countries with restrictions on remittances but where the balances could be used to repay subsidiaries\u2019 third party liabilities.\n20. Leases\n\nAs disclosed in note 1, the Group applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach and therefore the comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4. The details of accounting policies under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 are disclosed separately; key differences between IFRS 16 and IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 are described in note 1.\n\nLease accounting policy under IFRS 16\n\nAs a lessee\n\nWhen the Group leases an asset, a \u2018right-of-use asset\u2019 is recognised for the leased item and a lease liability is recognised for any lease payments to be paid over the lease term at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, being the present value of the lease payments paid or payable, plus any initial direct costs incurred in entering the lease and less any lease incentives received.\n\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the asset\u2019s useful life or the end of the lease term. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease plus any periods for which the Group is \u2018reasonably certain\u2019 to exercise any extension options (see below). The useful life of the asset is determined in a manner consistent to that for owned property, plant and equipment (as described in note 11). If right-of-use assets are considered to be impaired, the carrying value is reduced accordingly.\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the value of the lease payments over the lease term that are not paid at the commencement date and are usually discounted using the incremental borrowing rates of the applicable Group entity (the rate implicit in the lease is used if it is readily determinable). Lease payments included in the lease liability include both fixed payments and in-substance fixed payments during the term of the lease.\n\nAfter initial recognition, the lease liability is recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate (e.g. an inflation related increase) or if the Group\u2019s assessment of the lease term changes; any changes in the lease liability as a result of these changes also results in a corresponding change in the recorded right-of-use asset.\n\nAs a lessor\n\nWhere the Group is a lessor, it determines at inception whether the lease is a finance or an operating lease. When a lease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the underlying asset then the lease is a finance lease; otherwise the lease is an operating lease.\n\nWhere the Group is an intermediate lessor, the interests in the head lease and the sub-lease are accounted for separately and the lease classification of a sub-lease is determined by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease.\n\nIncome from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Income from finance leases is recognised at lease commencement with interest income recognised over the lease term.\n\nLease income is recognised as revenue for transactions that are part of the Group\u2019s ordinary activities (primarily leases of handsets or other equipment to customers or leases of wholesale access to the Group\u2019s fibre and cable networks). The Group uses IFRS 15 principles to allocate the consideration in contracts between any lease and non-lease components.\n\nPrevious accounting policies for comparative periods under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4\n\nAs a lessee\n\nLeases were classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to the lessee; all other leases were classified as operating leases.\n\nAssets held under finance leases were recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments as determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor was included in the statement of financial position as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments were apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Depreciation and finance charges were recognised in the income statement.\n\nRentals payable under operating leases were charged, and lease incentives received, were credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.\n\nAs a lessor\n\nLessor accounting applied in the comparative period was consistent with that described for IFRS 16 above, except for the lease classification, as a finance or operating lease, of a sub-lease which was determined by reference to the underlying asset.\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n20. Leases (continued)\n\nThe Group\u2019s leasing activities\n\nAs a lessee\nThe Group leases buildings for its retail stores, offices and data centres, land on which to construct mobile base stations, space on mobile base stations to place active RAN equipment and network space (primarily rack space or duct space). In addition, the Group leases fibre and other fixed connectivity to provide internal connectivity for the Group\u2019s operations and on a wholesale basis from other operators to provide fixed connectivity services to the Group\u2019s customers.\n\nThe Group\u2019s general approach to determining lease term by class of asset is described on page 146 under critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty in note 1.\n\nMost of the Group\u2019s leases include future price increases through fixed percentage increases, indexation to inflation measures on a periodic basis or rent review clauses. Other than fixed percentage increases the lease liability does not reflect the impact of these future increases unless the measurement date has passed. The Group\u2019s leases contain no material variable payments clauses other than those related to the number of operators sharing space on third party mobile base stations.\n\nThe Group sub-leases excess retail and office properties under both operating and finance leases; see disclosure on the Group\u2019s leasing activities as a lessor below.\n\nOperational lease periods\nWhere practicable the Group seeks to include extension or break options in leases to provide operational flexibility, therefore many of the Group\u2019s lease contracts contain optional periods. The Group\u2019s policy on assessing and reassessing whether it is reasonably certain that the optional period will be included in the lease term is described on page 146 under critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty in note 1.\n\nAfter initial recognition of a lease, the Group only reassesses the lease term when there is a significant event or a significant change in circumstances, which was not anticipated at the time of the previous assessment. Significant events or significant changes in circumstances could include merger and acquisition or similar activity, significant expenditure on the leased asset not anticipated in the previous assessment, or detailed management plans indicating a different conclusion on optional periods to the previous assessment. Where a significant event or significant change in circumstances does not occur, the lease term and therefore lease liability and right-of-use asset value, will decline over time.\n\nThe Group\u2019s cash outflow for leases in the year ended 31 March 2020 was \u20ac3,902 million and, absent significant future changes in the volume of the Group\u2019s activities or strategic changes to use more or fewer owned assets this level of cash outflow from leases would be expected to continue for future periods, subject to contractual price increases. The future cash flows included within lease liabilities are shown in the maturity analysis below on page 191. The maturity analysis only includes the reasonably certain payments to be made; cash outflows in these future periods will likely exceed these amounts as payments will be made on optional periods not considered reasonably certain at present and on new leases entered into in future periods.\n\nThe Group\u2019s leases for customer connectivity are normally either under regulated access or network sharing or similar preferential access arrangements and as a result the Group normally has significant flexibility over the term it can lease such connections for; generally the notice period required to cancel the lease is less than the notice period included in the service contract with the end customer. As a result, the Group does not have any significant cash exposure to optional periods on customer connectivity as the Group can cancel the lease when the service agreement ends. In some circumstances the Group is committed to minimum spend amounts for connectivity leases, which are included within reported lease liabilities.\n\nSale and leaseback\nThe Group sold its Italian mobile base station assets to Infrastrutture Wireless Italiane S.p.A. (INWIT) (see note 27 \u201cAcquisitions and disposals\u201d for additional details), and entered into an agreement to lease back space on these and other INWIT mobile base station towers to locate network equipment for 8 years (see note 30). The Group de-recognised assets related to the mobile base stations with a net book value of \u20ac548 million. A total gain on disposal of \u20ac4,100 million will be realised as a result of the disposal; \u20ac744 million of this gain, reflecting the gain on the proportion of sold towers that has been retained through the leaseback, has been recorded as a reduction in the value of the right-of-use asset recognised for the leaseback of tower space and will be realised as a reduction in depreciation over the lease term.\n\nOther sale and leaseback transactions entered into by the Group were not material, individually or in aggregate.\nAmounts recognised in the primary financial statements in relation to lessee transactions\n\nRight-of-use assets\nThe carrying value of the Group\u2019s right-of-use assets, depreciation charge for the year and additions during the year are disclosed in note 11 \u201cProperty, plant and equipment\u201d.\n\nLease liabilities\nThe Group\u2019s lease liabilities are disclosed in note 21 \u201cBorrowings\u201d. The maturity profile of the Group\u2019s lease liabilities is as follows:\n\n| Maturity                  | 2020 \u00a3m |\n|---------------------------|---------|\n| Within one year           | 3,172   |\n| In more than one year but less than two years | 1,998   |\n| In more than two years but less than three years | 1,523   |\n| In more than three years but less than four years | 1,328   |\n| In more than four years but less than five years | 1,127   |\n| In more than five years   | 4,443   |\n| **Total**                 | **13,591** |\n\nEffect of discounting (note 21 \u201cBorrowings\u201d)\n(1,528)\n\nLease liability (note 21 \u201cBorrowings\u201d)\n12,063\n\nAt 31 March 2020 the Group has entered into lease contracts with payment obligations with an undiscounted value of \u20ac67 million that had not commenced at 31 March 2020.\n\nInterest expense on lease liabilities for the year is disclosed in note 5 \u201cInvestment income and financing costs\u201d.\n\nThe Group has no material liabilities under residual value guarantees and makes no material payments for variable payments not included in the lease liability. The Group does not apply either the short term or low value expedient options in IFRS 16.\n\nAs a lessor\nThe Group has a wide range of lessor activities with consumer and enterprise customers, other telecommunication companies and other companies. With consumer and enterprise customers, the Group generates lease income from the provision of handsets, routers and other communications equipment. The Group provides wholesale access to the Group\u2019s fibre and cable networks and leases out space on the Group\u2019s owned mobile base stations to other telecommunication companies. In addition, the Group sub-leases retail stores to franchise partners in certain markets and leases out surplus assets (e.g. vacant offices and retail stores) to other companies.\n\nLessor transactions are classified as operating or finance leases based on whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset. Leases are individually assessed, but generally, the Group\u2019s lessor transactions are classified as:\n\n- Operating leases where the Group is lessor of space on owned mobile base stations, provides wholesale access to its fibre and cable networks or provides routers or similar equipment to fixed customers; and\n- Finance leases where the Group is sub-lessee of handsets or similar items in back-to-back arrangements or where surplus assets are sublet out for all or substantially all of the remaining head lease term.\n\nThe Group\u2019s income as a lessor in the year is as follows:\n\n| 2020 \u00a3m |\n|---------|\n| Operating Leases |\n| Lease revenue (note 2 \u201cRevenue disaggregation and segmental analysis\u201d) | 502 |\n| Income from leases not recognised as revenue | 203 |\n\nThe Group\u2019s net investments in leases are disclosed in note 14 \u201cTrade and other receivables\u201d. The committed amounts to be received from the Group\u2019s operating leases are as follows:\n\n| Maturity                  | 2020 \u00a3m |\n|---------------------------|---------|\n| Within one year           | 442     |\n| In one to two years       | 211     |\n| In two to three years     | 114     |\n| In three to four years    | 53      |\n| In four to five years     | 44      |\n| In more than five years   | 223     |\n| **Total**                 | **1,087** |\n\nThe Group has no material lease income arising from variable lease payments.\n21. Borrowings\n\nThe Group\u2019s sources of borrowing for funding and liquidity purposes come from a range of committed bank facilities and through short-term and long-term issuances in the capital markets including bond and commercial paper issues and bank loans. Liabilities arising from the Group\u2019s lease arrangements are also reported in borrowings; see note 20 \u201cLeases\u201d. We manage the basis on which we incur interest on debt between fixed interest rates and floating interest rates depending on market conditions using interest rate derivatives. The Group enters into foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of exchange rate movements on certain monetary items.\n\nAccounting policies\n\nInterest-bearing loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair value (which is equal to cost at inception), and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method. Where they are identified as a hedged item in a designated fair value hedge relationship, fair value adjustments are recognised in accordance with policy (see note 22 \u201cCapital and financial risk management\u201d). Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the amount due on settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowing. Where bonds issued with certain conversion rights are identified as compound instruments they are initially measured at fair value with the nominal amounts recognised as a component in equity and the fair value of future coupons included in borrowings. These are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.\n\nBorrowings\n\n|                      | 2020 \u20acm | 2019 \u20acm |\n|----------------------|---------|---------|\n| **Short-term borrowings** |         |         |\n| Bonds                | (1,912) | (53)    |\n| Commercial paper     | \u2013       | (873)   |\n| Bank loans           | (1,228) | (1,220) |\n| Lease liabilities    | (2,986) | \u2013       |\n| Other short-term borrowings\u00b9 | (5,700) | (2,124) |\n| **Total**            | (11,826)| (4,270) |\n| **Long-term borrowings** |         |         |\n| Bonds                | (47,500)| (44,439)|\n| Bank loans           | (1,500) | (1,780) |\n| Lease liabilities    | (9,077) | \u2013       |\n| Bank borrowings secured against Indian assets | (1,346) | \u2013 |\n| Other long-term borrowings\u00b2 | (3,469) | (2,466) |\n| **Total**            | (62,892)| (48,685)|\n\nNotes:\n\n1. At 31 March 2020 the amount includes \u20ac5,292 million (2019: \u20ac2,011 million) in relation to cash received under collateral support agreements.\n2. Includes \u20ac3,215 million (2019: \u20ac1,919 million) of spectrum licence payables following the completion of recent auctions in Germany of \u20ac1,370 million.\n\nThe fair value of the Group\u2019s financial assets and financial liabilities held at amortised cost approximate to fair value with the exception of long-term bonds with a carrying value of \u20ac47,500 million (2019: \u20ac44,439 million) which have a fair value of \u20ac48,216 million (2019: \u20ac43,616 million). Fair value is based on level 1 of the fair value hierarchy using quoted market prices.\n\nThe Group\u2019s borrowings include certain bonds which have been designated in hedge relationships, which are carried at \u20ac1.5 billion higher than their euro equivalent redemption value. In addition, where bonds are issued in currencies other than euros, the Group has entered into foreign currency swaps to fix the euro cash outflows on redemption. The impact of these swaps are not reflected in gross debt and would decrease the euro equivalent redemption value of the bonds by \u20ac1.3 billion.\n\nCommercial paper programmes\n\nWe currently have US and euro commercial paper programmes of US$15 billion and \u20ac8 billion respectively which are available to be used to meet short-term liquidity requirements. At 31 March 2020 \u20acnil (2019: \u20ac873 million) was drawn under the euro commercial paper programme. The US commercial paper programme remained undrawn.\n\nThe commercial paper facilities were supported by US$4.2 billion (\u20ac3.8 billion) and \u20ac3.9 billion of syndicated committed bank facilities. No amounts had been drawn under these facilities.\nBonds\nWe have a \u20ac30 billion euro medium-term note programme and a US shelf programme which are used to meet medium to long-term funding requirements. At 31 March 2020 the total amounts in issue under these programmes split by currency were US$25.1 billion, \u20ac19.3 billion, \u00a33.4 billion, AUD1.2 billion, HKD2.1 billion, NOK2.2 billion, CHF0.7 billion and JPY10 billion.\n\nAt 31 March 2020 the Group had bonds outstanding with a nominal value equivalent to \u20ac47.8 billion. During the year ended 31 March 2020, bonds with a nominal value equivalent of US$3.8 billion were issued under the US shelf programme, \u00a32.5 billion were issued under the euro medium-term note programme and US$2 billion were issued under stand-alone documentation.\n\nBonds mature between 2020 and 2059 (2019: 2020 and 2056) and have interest rates between 0.0% and 7.875% (2019: 0.0% and 7.875%).\n\nMandatory convertible bonds\nOn 12 March 2019 the Group issued \u00a33.4 billion of subordinated mandatory convertible bonds (\u2018MCBs\u2019) split into two equal tranches of \u00a31.7 billion, the first maturing on 12 March 2021 and the second on 12 March 2022 with coupons of 1.2% and 1.5% respectively. These were recognised as compound instruments with nominal values of \u00a33.4 billion (\u00a33.8 billion) recognised as a component of shareholders\u2019 funds in equity and the fair value of future coupons \u00a30.1 billion (\u00a30.1 billion) recognised as a financial liability in borrowings. At 31 March 2020, the conversion price of the bonds was \u00a31.2814. The Group\u2019s strategy is to hedge the equity risk associated with the MCB issuance to any future movement in its share price by an option strategy designed to hedge the economic impact of share price movements during the term of the bonds. Should the Group decide to buy back ordinary shares to mitigate dilution resulting from the conversion the hedging strategy will provide a hedge for the repurchase price.\n\nTreasury shares\nThe Group held a maximum of 2,091,894,691 (2019: 2,139,038,029) of its own shares during the year which represented 7.3% (2019: 7.4%) of issued share capital at that time.\n22. Capital and financial risk management\n\nThis note details the treasury management and financial risk management objectives and policies, as well as the exposure and sensitivity of the Group to credit, liquidity, interest and foreign exchange risk, and the policies in place to monitor and manage these risks.\n\nAccounting policies\n\nFinancial instruments\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities, in respect of financial instruments, are recognised on the Group\u2019s statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments\n\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. An equity instrument is any contract that provides a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities and includes no obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets. The accounting policies adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.\n\nFinancial liabilities under put option arrangements\n\nThe Group has an obligation to pay a fixed rate of return to minority equity shareholders in the Group\u2019s subsidiary Kabel Deutschland AG, under the terms of a court imposed domination and profit and loss transfer agreement. This agreement also provides the minority shareholders the option to put their shareholding to Vodafone at a fixed price per share. The obligation to purchase the shares has been recognised as a financial liability and no non-controlling interests are recognised in respect of minority shareholders. Interest costs are accrued at the agreed rate of return and recognised in financing costs.\n\nDerivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nThe Group\u2019s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates which it manages using derivative financial instruments. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group\u2019s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives consistent with the Group\u2019s risk management strategy. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nThe Group designates certain derivatives as:\n\n- hedges of the change of fair value of recognised assets and liabilities (\u2018fair value hedges\u2019); or\n- hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or hedges of foreign currency or interest rate risks of firm commitments (\u2018cash flow hedges\u2019); or\n- hedges of net investments in foreign operations.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently re-measured to fair value at each reporting date. Changes in values of all derivatives of a financing nature are included within investment income and financing costs in the income statement unless designated in an effective cash flow hedge relationship or a hedge of a net investment in foreign operations when the effective portion of changes in value are deferred to other comprehensive income. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument. For fair value hedges, the carrying value of the hedged item is also adjusted for changes in fair value for the hedged risk, with gains and losses recognised in the income statement for the period.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. When hedge accounting is discontinued, any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income at that time remains in equity and is recognised in the income statement when the hedged transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.\n\nFor cash flow hedges, when the hedged item is recognised in the income statement, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity for the hedging instrument are reclassified to the income statement. However, when the hedged transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability. If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nFor net investment hedges, gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.\nCapital management\n\nThe following table summarises the capital of the Group at 31 March:\n\n|                                | 2020 Cm | 2019 Cm |\n|--------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Total borrowings (note 21)     | 74,718  | 52,955  |\n| Cash and cash equivalents (note 19) | (13,284) | (13,637) |\n| Derivative financial instruments included in trade and other receivables (note 14) | (9,176) | (3,634) |\n| Derivative financial instruments included in trade and other payables (note 15) | 4,767 | 2,444 |\n| Short-term investments (note 13) | (5,247) | (11,095) |\n| Financial liabilities under put option arrangements | 1,850 | 1,844 |\n| Equity                          | 62,625  | 63,445  |\n| **Capital**                     | **116,253** | **92,322** |\n\nThe Group\u2019s policy is to borrow centrally using a mixture of long-term and short-term capital market issues and borrowing facilities to meet anticipated funding requirements. These borrowings, together with cash generated from operations, are loaned internally or contributed as equity to certain subsidiaries.\n\nDividends from associates and to non-controlling shareholders\n\nDividends from our associates are generally paid at the discretion of the Board of Directors or shareholders of the individual operating and holding companies, and we have no rights to receive dividends except where specified within certain of the Group\u2019s shareholders\u2019 agreements. Similarly, other than ongoing dividend obligations to the Kabel Deutschland A.G. minority shareholders, should they continue to hold their minority stake, we do not have existing obligations under shareholders\u2019 agreements to pay dividends to non-controlling interest partners of our subsidiaries or joint ventures. The amount of dividends received and paid in the year are disclosed in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\nPotential cash outflows from option agreements and similar arrangements\n\nPut options issued as part of the hedging strategy for the MCBs permit the holders to exercise against the Group at maturity of the option if there is a decrease in our share price. Under the terms of the options, settlement must be made in cash which will equate to the reduced value of shares from the initial conversion price, adjusted for dividends declared, on 2,547 million shares.\n\nSale of trade receivables\n\nDuring the year, the Group sold certain trade receivables to a financial institution. Whilst there are no repurchase obligations in respect of these receivables, the Group provided a credit guarantee which would only become payable if default rates were significantly higher than historical rates. The credit guarantee is not considered substantive and substantially all risks and rewards associated with the receivables passed to the purchaser at the date of sale, therefore the receivables were derecognised. The maximum payable under the guarantees at 31 March 2020 was \u20ac1,283 million (2019: \u20ac757 million). No provision has been made in respect of these guarantees as the likelihood of a cash outflow has been assessed as remote.\n\nSupplier financing arrangements\n\nThe Group offers suppliers the opportunity to use supply chain financing (\u2018SCF\u2019). SCF allows suppliers that decide to use it to receive funding earlier than the invoice due date. At 31 March 2020, the financial institutions that run the SCF programmes had purchased \u20ac2.4 billion (2019: \u20ac2.5 billion) of supplier invoices, principally from larger suppliers. The Group does not provide any financial guarantees to the financial institutions under this programme and continues to cash settle supplier payables in accordance with their contractual terms. As such, the programme does not change the Group\u2019s net debt, trade payable balances or cash flows.\n\nThe Group evaluates supplier arrangements against a number of indicators to assess if the payable continues to hold the characteristics of a trade payable or should be classified as borrowings; these indicators include whether the payment terms exceed customary payment terms in the industry or 180 days. At 31 March 2020, none of the payables subject to supplier financing arrangements met the criteria to be reclassified as borrowings.\n\nFinancial risk management\n\nThe Group\u2019s treasury function centrally manages the Group\u2019s funding requirement, net foreign exchange exposure, interest rate management exposures and counterparty risk arising from investments and derivatives. Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines authorised and reviewed by the Board, most recently in July 2019. A treasury risk committee comprising of the Group\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, Group Financial Controller, Group Treasury Director and Group Director of Financial Controlling and Operations meets three times a year to review treasury activities and its members receive management information relating to treasury activities on a quarterly basis. The Group\u2019s accounting function, which does not report to the Group Treasury Director, provides regular update reports of treasury activity to the Board. The Group\u2019s Internal Auditor reviews the internal control environment regularly.\n\nThe Group uses a number of derivative instruments for currency and interest rate risk management purposes only that are transacted by specialist treasury personnel. The Group mitigates banking sector credit risk by the use of collateral support agreements.\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n22. Capital and financial risk management (continued)\n\nCOVID-19\nThe macro economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain, and continues to evolve, with potential disruption to financial markets including to currencies, interest rates, borrowing costs and the availability of debt financing. However, the Group\u2019s financial risk management strategies seek to reduce our potential exposure in relation to these risks.\n\nThe Group has a combined cash and cash equivalent and short term investments of \u20ac18.5 billion, providing significant headroom over short term liquidity requirements. Additionally the Group maintains undrawn committed facilities of \u20ac7.7 billion euro equivalent. As at 31 March 2020 and after hedging, substantially all the Group\u2019s borrowings are held on a fixed interest basis, mitigating exposure to interest rate risk. The Group has no significant currency exposures other than positions in economic hedging relationships. The Group\u2019s credit risk under financing activities is spread across a portfolio of highly rated institutions to reduce counterparty exposures and derivative balances are substantially all collateralised. The Group\u2019s operating activities result in customer credit risk, for which provisions for expected credit losses are recognised. This customer related credit risk is generally short term in duration and while COVID-19 impacts on our customers had no material impact on credit loss provisioning at 31 March 2020 there remains a risk in relation to this matter for the year ending 31 March 2021.\n\nCredit risk\nCredit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial asset leading to a financial loss for the Group. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities and from its financing activities, the Group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 March to be:\n\n| Financial Asset | 2020 (\u20acm) | 2019 (\u20acm) |\n|-----------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Cash at bank and in hand | 1,947 | 2,434 |\n| Repurchase agreements and bank deposits | 2,202 | 2,196 |\n| Money market funds | 9,135 | 9,007 |\n| Managed investment funds | 2,451 | 6,405 |\n| Government/government backed securities | 1,681 | 3,011 |\n| Long term debt securities | 715 | 822 |\n| Cash collateral pledged | 1,115 | 1,184 |\n| Restricted debt securities | 1,842 | 1,712 |\n| Other investments | \u2013 | 700 |\n| Derivative Financial Instruments | 9,176 | 3,634 |\n| Trade receivables | 4,591 | 5,077 |\n| Contract assets and other receivables | 4,518 | 5,155 |\n| **Total** | **39,373** | **41,337** |\n\nExpected credit loss\nThe Group has financial assets classified and measured at amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive income that are subject to the expected credit loss model requirements of IFRS 9. Cash at bank and in hand and certain other investments are both classified and measured at amortised cost and subject to these impairment requirements. However, the identified expected credit loss is considered to be immaterial.\n\nInformation about expected credit losses for trade receivables and contract assets can be found under \u201coperating activities\u201d on page 197.\n\nFinancing activities\nThe Group invests in UK, German and Japanese government securities on the basis they generate a fixed rate of return and are amongst the most creditworthy of investments available.\n\nMoney market investments are made in accordance with established internal treasury policies which dictate that an investment\u2019s long-term credit rating is no lower than mid BBB. Additionally, the Group invests in AAA unsecured money market mutual funds where the investment is limited to 10% of each fund.\n\nThe Group has two managed investment funds that hold fixed income euro securities with an average credit quality of AA.\n\nIn respect of financial instruments used by the Group\u2019s treasury function, the aggregate credit risk the Group may have with one counterparty is limited by (i) reference to the long-term credit ratings assigned for that counterparty by Moody\u2019s, Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor\u2019s; (ii) that counterparty\u2019s five year credit default swap (\u2018CDS\u2019) spread; and (iii) the sovereign credit rating of that counterparty\u2019s principal operating jurisdiction. Furthermore, collateral support agreements reduce the Group\u2019s exposure to counterparties who must post cash collateral when there is value due to the Group under outstanding derivative contracts that exceeds a contractually agreed threshold amount. When value is due to the counterparty the Group is required to post collateral on identical terms. Such cash collateral is adjusted daily as necessary.\nIn the event of any default, ownership of the cash collateral would revert to the respective holder at that point. Detailed below is the value of the cash collateral, which is reported within short-term borrowings, held by the Group at 31 March:\n\n|                | 2020 \u00a3m | 2019 \u00a3m |\n|----------------|---------|---------|\n| Cash collateral| 5,292   | 2,011   |\n\nAs discussed in note 29 \u201cContingent liabilities and legal proceedings\u201d, the Group has covenanted to provide security in favour of the trustee of the Vodafone Group UK Pension Scheme in respect of the funding deficit in the scheme. The Group has also pledged cash and debt securities as collateral against derivative financial instruments as disclosed in note 13 \u201cOther investments\u201d.\n\n**Operating activities**\n\nCustomer credit risk is managed by the Group\u2019s business units which each have policies, procedures and controls relating to customer credit risk management. Outstanding trade receivables and contract assets are regularly reviewed to monitor any changes in credit risk with concentrations of credit risk considered to be limited given that the Group\u2019s customer base is large and unrelated. The Group applies the simplified approach and records lifetime expected credit losses for trade receivables and contract assets. Expected credit losses are measured using historical cash collection data for periods of at least 24 months wherever possible and grouped into various customer segments based on product or customer type. The historical loss rates are adjusted where macroeconomic factors, for example changes in interest rates or unemployment rates, or other commercial factors are expected to have a significant impact when determining future expected credit loss rates. For trade receivables the expected credit loss provision is calculated using a provision matrix, in which the provision increases as balances age, and for receivables paid in instalments and contract assets a weighted loss rate is calculated to reflect the period over which the amounts become due for payment by the customer. Trade receivables and contract assets are written off when each business unit determines there to be no reasonable expectation of recovery and enforcement activity has ceased.\n\nMovements in the allowance for expected credit losses during the year were as follows:\n\n|                | 2020 \u00a3m | 2019 \u00a3m | 2020 \u00a3m | 2019 \u00a3m | 2020 \u00a3m | 2019 \u00a3m |\n|----------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n|                |         |         |         |         |         |         |\n| 31 March 2018 as previously reported | \u2014       | \u2014       | 1,249   | \u2014       | \u2014       | \u2014       |\n| Impact of adoption of IFRS 15 | \u2014       | 78      | \u2014       | \u2014       | \u2014       | \u2014       |\n| Impact of adoption of IFRS 9 | \u2014       | 56      | 185     | \u2014       | 23      |         |\n| **1 April** | **129** | **134** | **1,347** | **1,434** | **40** | **23** |\n| Exchange movements | (2)     | 1       | (26)    | (19)    | \u2014       | \u2014       |\n| Amounts charged to credit losses on financial assets | 73      | 54      | 576     | 504     | 11      | 17      |\n| Other1 | (63)    | (60)    | (531)   | (572)   | \u2014       | \u2014       |\n| **31 March** | **137** | **129** | **1,366** | **1,347** | **51** | **40** |\n\nNotes:\n1.

Capital and financial risk management (continued)\n\nThe majority of the Group\u2019s trade receivables are due for maturity within 90 days and largely comprise amounts receivable from consumers and business customers.\n\nThe following table presents information on trade receivables past due\u00b9 and their associated expected credit losses:\n\n| 31 March 2020 | Trade receivables at amortised cost past due |\n|---------------|------------------------------------------|\n|               | Current \u00a3m | 30 days or less \u00a3m | 31\u201360 days \u00a3m | 61\u2013180 days \u00a3m | 180 days+ \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n| Gross carrying amount | 2,448 | 817 | 223 | 473 | 1,179 | 5,140 |\n| Expected credit loss allowance | (63) | (74) | (55) | (213) | (961) | (1,366) |\n| Net carrying amount | 2,385 | 743 | 168 | 260 | 218 | 3,774 |\n\n| 31 March 2019 | Trade receivables at amortised cost past due |\n|---------------|------------------------------------------|\n|               | Current \u00a3m | 30 days or less \u00a3m | 31\u201360 days \u00a3m | 61\u2013180 days \u00a3m | 180 days+ \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n| Gross carrying amount | 3,340 | 448 | 253 | 550 | 1,041 | 5,632 |\n| Expected credit loss allowance | (91) | (94) | (64) | (216) | (882) | (1,347) |\n| Net carrying amount | 3,249 | 354 | 189 | 334 | 159 | 4,285 |\n\nNote:\n\u00b9 Contract assets relate to amounts not yet due to customers. These amounts will be reclassified as trade receivables before they become due. Trade receivables at fair value through other comprehensive income are not materially past due.\n\nLiquidity risk\n\nLiquidity is reviewed daily on at least a 12 month rolling basis and stress tested on the assumption that any commercial paper outstanding matures and is not reissued. The Group maintains substantial cash and cash equivalents which at 31 March 2020 amounted to cash \u20ac13,284 million (2019: \u20ac13,637 million) and undrawn committed facilities of \u20ac7,749 million (2019: \u20ac7,880 million), principally euro and US dollar revolving credit facilities of \u20ac3.9 billion and US$4.2 billion (\u20ac3.8 billion). All of the euro revolving credit facilities mature in 2025 except for \u20ac80 million which mature in 2023 and all of the US dollar revolving credit facilities mature in 2022 except for US$75 million (\u20ac68 million) which mature in 2021.\n\nThe Group manages liquidity risk on long-term borrowings by maintaining a varied maturity profile with a cap on the level of debt maturity in any one calendar year, therefore minimising refinancing risk. Long-term borrowings mature between 1 and 39 years.\n\nThe maturity profile of the anticipated future cash flows including interest in relation to the Group\u2019s non-derivative financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis which, therefore, differs from both the carrying value and fair value, is as follows:\n\n| Maturity profile\u00b9 | Bank loans and Commercial paper \u00a3m | Bonds \u00a3m | Lease liabilities \u00a3m | Other borrowings/\u00a3m | Total borrowings \u00a3m | Trade payables and other financial liabilities \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n|-------------------|----------------------------------|---------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Within one year   | 1,348                            | 3,617   | 3,172               | 5,750               | 13,887              | 15,250                                        | 29,137  |\n| In one to two years | 746                              | 4,682   | 1,998               | 316                 | 7,742               | 67                                            | 7,809   |\n| In two to three years | 279                              | 3,852   | 1,523               | 3,270               | 8,924               | \u2013                                             | 8,924   |\n| In three to four years | 369                              | 8,242   | 1,328               | 390                 | 10,329              | \u2013                                             | 10,329  |\n| In four to five years | 181                              | 2,845   | 1,127               | 166                 | 4,319               | \u2013                                             | 4,319   |\n| In more than five years | \u2013                                | 47,947  | 4,443               | 1,185               | 53,575              | \u2013                                             | 53,575  |\n| **2,923**         | **71,185**                       | **13,591** | **11,077**         | **98,776**          | **15,317**          | **114,093**                                   |         |\n\nEffect of discount/financing rates\n\n| 31 March 2020 | Bank loans and Commercial paper \u00a3m | Bonds \u00a3m | Lease liabilities \u00a3m | Other borrowings/\u00a3m | Total borrowings \u00a3m | Trade payables and other financial liabilities \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n|---------------|----------------------------------|---------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Within one year | 2,728                            | 49,412  | 12,063              | 10,515              | 74,718              | 15,311                                        | 90,029  |\n| In one to two years | 2,371                            | 1,486   | \u2013                   | 2,155               | 6,012               | 15,941                                        | 21,953  |\n| In two to three years | 714                              | 4,826   | \u2013                   | 158                 | 5,698               | 125                                           | 5,823   |\n| In three to four years | 568                              | 4,917   | \u2013                   | 96                  | 5,581               | \u2013                                             | 5,581   |\n| In four to five years | 350                              | 7,878   | \u2013                   | 320                 | 8,548               | \u2013                                             | 8,548   |\n| In more than five years | \u2013                                | 37,586  | \u2013                   | 336                 | 37,922              | \u2013                                             | 37,922  |\n| **4,003**       | **61,251**                       | \u2013       | **4,840**           | **70,094**          | **16,066**          | **86,160**                                    |         |\n\nEffect of discount/financing rates\n\n| 31 March 2019 | Bank loans and Commercial paper \u00a3m | Bonds \u00a3m | Lease liabilities \u00a3m | Other borrowings/\u00a3m | Total borrowings \u00a3m | Trade payables and other financial liabilities \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n|---------------|----------------------------------|---------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Within one year | 3,873                            | 44,492  | \u2013                   | 4,590               | 52,955              | 16,054                                        | 69,009  |\n\nNotes:\n\u00b9 Maturities reflect contractual cash flows applicable except in the event of a change of control or event of default, upon which lenders have the right, but not the obligation, to request payment within 30 days.

The policy also allows euros, US dollars and sterling to be moved to a fixed rate basis if interest rates are statistically low. Where assets and liabilities are denominated in other currencies interest rates may also be fixed. In addition, fixing is undertaken for longer periods when interest rates are statistically low.\n\nAt 31 March 2020 and after hedging, substantially all of our outstanding liabilities are held on a fixed interest rate basis in accordance with treasury policy.\n\nFor each one hundred basis point rise in market interest rates for all currencies in which the Group had borrowings at 31 March 2020 there would be an increase in profit before tax by \u20ac695 million (2019: \u20ac399 million) including mark to market revaluations of interest rate and other derivatives and the potential interest on cash and short term investments. There would be no material impact on equity.\n\n**Foreign exchange management**\n\nAs Vodafone\u2019s primary listing is on the London Stock Exchange its share price is quoted in sterling. Since the sterling share price represents the value of its future multi-currency cash flows, principally in euro, South African rand and sterling, the Group maintains the currency of debt and interest charges in proportion to its expected future principal cash flows and has a policy to hedge external foreign exchange risks on transactions denominated in other currencies above a certain de minimis level.\n\nAt 31 March 2020 14% of net debt was denominated in currencies other than euro (9% sterling, 3% South African rand and 2% other). This allows sterling, South African rand and other debt to be serviced in proportion to expected future cash flows and therefore provides a partial economic hedge against income statement translation exposure, as interest costs will be denominated in foreign currencies.\n\nUnder the Group\u2019s foreign exchange management policy, foreign exchange transaction exposure in Group companies is generally maintained at the lower of \u00a35 million per currency per month or \u20ac15 million per currency over a six month period.\n\nThe Group recognises foreign exchange movements in equity for the translation of net investment hedging instruments and balances treated as investments in foreign operations. However, there is no net impact on equity for exchange rate movements on net investment hedging instruments as there would be an offset in the currency translation of the foreign operation. At 31 March 2020 the Group held financial liabilities in a net investment hedge against the Group\u2019s South African rand operations. Sensitivity to foreign exchange movements on the hedging liabilities, analysed against a strengthening of the South African rand by 11% (2019: 9%) would result in a decrease in equity of \u20ac212 million (2019: \u20ac175 million) which would be fully offset by foreign exchange movements on the hedged net assets. In addition, cash flow hedges of principally US dollar borrowings would result in an increase in equity of \u20ac713 million (2019: \u20ac651 million) against a strengthening of US dollar by 5% (2019: 5%).\n\nThe Group profit and loss account is exposed to foreign exchange risk within both operating profit and financing income and expense. The principal operating segment not generating incomes in euro is the Vodacom business, whose functional currency is South African Rand. Financing income and expense includes foreign currency gains/losses incurred on the translation of balance sheet items not held in functional currency. These are principally on certain borrowings, derivatives, and other investments denominated in sterling and US dollar.\nThe following table details the Group\u2019s sensitivity to foreign exchange risk. The percentage movement applied to the currency is based on the average movements in the previous three annual reporting periods.\n\n| Currency | Percentage Change | 2020 | 2019 |\n|----------|-------------------|------|------|\n| ZAR      | 11% (2019: 9%)    | 126  | 147  |\n| USD      | 9% (2019: 10%)    | (64) | (81) |\n| GBP      | 2% (2019: 4%)     | 63   | 183  |\n\nNote:\n1. Operating profit before impairment losses and other income and expense.\n\n**Equity risk**\n\nThere is no material equity risk relating to the Group\u2019s equity investments which are detailed in note 13 \u201cOther investments\u201d.\n\nThe Group has hedged its exposure under the subordinated mandatory convertible bonds to any future movements in its share price by an option strategy designed to hedge the economic impact of share price movements during the term of the bonds. As at 31 March 2020 the Group\u2019s sensitivity to a movement of 23% (2019: 8%) in its share price would result in an increase or decrease in profit before tax of \u20ac767 million (2019: \u20ac319 million).\n\n**Risk management strategy of hedge relationships**\n\nThe risk strategies of the designated cash flow, fair value, and net investment hedges reflect the above market risk strategies.\n\nThe objective of the cash flow hedges is principally to convert foreign currency denominated fixed rate borrowings in US dollar, pound sterling, Australian dollar, Swiss Franc, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen, Norwegian krona and euro and US dollar floating rate borrowings into euro fixed rate borrowings and hedge the foreign exchange spot rate and interest rate risk. Derivative financial instruments designated in cash flow hedges are cross-currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange swaps. The swap maturity dates and liquidity profiles of the nominal cash flows match those of the underlying borrowings.\n\nThe objective of the net investment hedges is to hedge foreign exchange risk in foreign operations. Derivative financial instruments designated in net investment hedges are cross-currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange swaps. The hedging instruments are rolled on an ongoing basis as determined by the nature of the business.\n\nThe objective of the fair value hedges is to hedge a proportion of the Group\u2019s fixed rate euro denominated borrowing to a euro floating rate borrowing. The swap maturity dates match those of the underlying borrowing and the nominal cash flows are converted to quarterly payments.\n\nHedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument.\n\nFor hedges of foreign currency denominated borrowings and investments, the Group uses a combination of cross-currency and foreign exchange swaps to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk and enters into hedge relationships where the critical terms of the hedging instrument match with the terms of the hedged item. Therefore the Group expects a highly effective hedging relationship with the swap contracts and the value of the corresponding hedged items to change systematically in the opposite direction in response to movements in the underlying exchange rates and interest rates. The Group therefore performs a qualitative assessment of effectiveness. If changes in circumstances affect the terms of the hedged item such that the critical terms no longer match with the critical terms of the hedging instrument, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method to assess effectiveness.\n\nHedge ineffectiveness may occur due to:\n\na) The fair value of the hedging instrument on the hedge relationship designation date if the fair value is not nil;\n\nb) Changes in the contractual terms or timing of the payments on the hedged item; and\n\nc) A change in the credit risk of the Group or the counterparty with the hedging instrument.\n\nThe hedge ratio for each designation will be established by comparing the quantity of the hedging instrument and the quantity of the hedged item to determine their relative weighting; for all of the Group\u2019s existing hedge relationships the hedge ratio has been determined as 1:1.\n\nThe fair values of the derivative financial instruments are calculated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates and foreign currency rates prevailing at 31 March. The valuation basis is level 2. This classification comprises items where fair value is determined from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset and liability, either directly or indirectly. Derivative financial assets and liabilities are included within trade and other receivables and trade and other payables in the statement of financial position.\nThe following table represents the carrying values and nominal amounts of derivatives in a continued hedge relationship as at 31 March 2020.\n\n### At 31 March 2020\n\n| Cash flow hedges - foreign currency risk | Other comprehensive income | Weighted average |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|\n| Nominal amounts | Carrying value Assets | Carrying value Liabilities | Opening balance 1 April 2019 | (Gain)/Loss deferred to OCI | Gain/(Loss) recycled to financing costs | Closing balance 31 March 2020 | Maturity year | FX rate | Euro interest rate % |\n| US dollar bonds | 20,383 | 5,371 | \u2013 | (179) | (4,233) | 490 | (3,922) | 2035 | 1.18 | 2.67 |\n| Australian dollar bonds | 736 | \u2013 | 65 | (17) | 77 | (86) | (26) | 2024 | 1.56 | 0.92 |\n| Swiss franc bonds | 624 | \u2013 | 17 | 22 | (27) | 33 | 28 | 2026 | 1.08 | 1.26 |\n| Pound sterling bonds | 3,180 | 29 | 186 | 38 | 79 | (23) | 94 | 2043 | 0.85 | 2.04 |\n| Hong Kong dollar bonds | 233 | 22 | \u2013 | 13 | (25) | 8 | (4) | 2028 | 9.08 | 1.48 |\n| Japanese yen bonds | 78 | 1 | \u2013 | 2 | \u2013 | 4 | 6 | 2037 | 128.53 | 2.47 |\n| Norwegian krona bonds | 241 | \u2013 | 46 | 1 | 34 | (38) | (3) | 2026 | 9.15 | 1.12 |\n\n### Cash flow hedges - foreign currency and interest rate risk\n\n| Cross-currency and foreign exchange swaps | Other comprehensive income | Weighted average |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|\n| Nominal amounts | Carrying value Assets | Carrying value Liabilities | Opening balance 1 April 2018 | Gain/(Loss) deferred to OCI | Gain/(Loss) recycled to financing costs | Closing balance 31 March 2019 | Maturity year | FX rate | Euro interest rate % |\n| Cross currency swaps - US dollar bonds | 905 | 46 | \u2013 | 12 | (14) | 20 | 18 | 2023 | 1.17 | 1.05 |\n| Cash flow hedges - interest rate risk | 668 | \u2013 | 13 | 11 | (4) | \u2013 | 7 | 2021 | \u2013 | 1.21 |\n| Fair value hedges - interest rate risk | 186 | 131 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 2028 | \u2013 | \u2013 |\n| Net investment hedge - foreign exchange risk | 2,138 | 314 | \u2013 | 810 | (179) | \u2013 | 631 | 2020 | 17 | 0.17 |\n\n### At 31 March 2019\n\n| Cash flow hedges - foreign currency risk | Other comprehensive income | Weighted average |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|\n| Nominal amounts | Carrying value Assets | Carrying value Liabilities | Opening balance 1 April 2018 | Gain/(Loss) deferred to OCI | Gain/(Loss) recycled to financing costs | Closing balance 31 March 2019 | Maturity year | FX rate | Euro interest rate % |\n| US dollar bonds | 18,444 | 1,273 | 83 | 132 | (1,410) | 1,099 | (179) | 2032 | 1.18 | 2.56 |\n| Australian dollar bonds | 736 | 14 | 2 | (4) | (21) | 8 | (17) | 2024 | 1.56 | 0.92 |\n| Swiss franc bonds | 624 | \u2013 | 43 | 16 | (25) | 31 | 22 | 2026 | 1.08 | 1.26 |\n| Pound sterling bonds | 2,720 | 76 | 112 | 8 | (39) | 69 | 38 | 2042 | 0.85 | 1.95 |\n| Hong Kong dollar bonds | 233 | 3 | 7 | 15 | (23) | 21 | 13 | 2028 | 9.08 | 1.48 |\n| Japanese yen bonds | 78 | 1 | \u2013 | \u2013 | (3) | 5 | 2 | 2037 | 128.53 | 2.47 |\n| Norwegian krona bonds | 241 | 2 | 14 | (4) | 5 | \u2013 | 1 | 2026 | 9.15 | 1.12 |\n\n### Notes\n1.

For cash flow hedges, the movement in the hypothetical derivative (hedged item) mirrors that of the hedging instrument. Hedge ineffectiveness of the swaps designated in a cash flow hedge during the period was \u20acnil (2019: \u20acnil).\n3. The carrying value of the bond includes \u20ac35 million loss (2019: \u20ac86 million loss) of cumulative fair value adjustment for the hedged interest rate risk. Net ineffectiveness on the fair value hedges, \u20ac8 million gain (2019: \u20ac2 million loss) is recognised in the income statement. The carrying value of bonds includes an additional \u20ac889 million loss (2019: \u20ac749 million loss) in relation to fair value of bonds previously designated in fair value hedge relationships.\n4. Hedge ineffectiveness of swaps designated in a net investment hedge during the period was \u20acnil (2019: \u20acnil).\n22. Capital and financial risk management (continued)\n\nFair value and carrying value information\n\nThe carrying value and valuation basis of the Group\u2019s financial assets are set out in notes 13 \u201cOther investments\u201d, 14 \u201cTrade and other receivables\u201d and 19 \u201cCash and cash equivalents\u201d. For all financial assets held at amortised cost the carrying values approximate fair value.\n\nThe carrying value and valuation basis of the Group\u2019s financial liabilities are set out in notes 15 \u201cTrade and other payables\u201d and 21 \u201cBorrowings\u201d. The carrying values approximate fair value for the Group\u2019s trade payables and other payables categories. For other financial liabilities a comparison of fair value and carrying value is disclosed in note 21 \u201cBorrowings\u201d.\n\nNet financial instruments\n\nThe table below shows the Group\u2019s financial assets and liabilities that are subject to offset in the balance sheet and the impact of enforceable master netting or similar agreements.\n\n| At 31 March 2020 | Gross amount | Amount set off | Amounts presented in balance sheet | Right of set off with derivative counterparties | Cash collateral | Net amount |\n|------------------|--------------|----------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------|------------|\n| Derivative financial assets | 9,176 | \u2013 | 9,176 | (3,556) | (5,292) | 328 |\n| Derivative financial liabilities | (4,767) | \u2013 | (4,767) | 3,556 | 1,115 | (96) |\n| Total | 4,409 | \u2013 | 4,409 | \u2013 | (4,177) | 232 |\n\n| At 31 March 2019 | Gross amount | Amount set off | Amounts presented in balance sheet | Right of set off with derivative counterparties | Cash collateral | Net amount |\n|------------------|--------------|----------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------|------------|\n| Derivative financial assets | 3,634 | \u2013 | 3,634 | (1,549) | (2,011) | 74 |\n| Derivative financial liabilities | (2,444) | \u2013 | (2,444) | 1,549 | 1,081 | 186 |\n| Total | 1,190 | \u2013 | 1,190 | \u2013 | (930) | 260 |\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the amount reported in the consolidated balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Derivative financial instruments that do not meet the criteria for offset could be settled net in certain circumstances under ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) agreements where each party has the option to settle amounts on a net basis in the event of default from the other. Collateral may be offset and net settled against derivative financial instruments in the event of default by either party. The aforementioned collateral balances are recorded in \u201cother short-term investments\u201d or \u201cshort-term debt\u201d respectively.\n\nChanges in assets and liabilities arising from financing activities\n\n| 1 April 2019 | Net proceeds/ (impayments) of borrowings | Interest paid | Net movement in short-term borrowings | Net Financing costs | Other | 31 March 2020 |\n|---------------|------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|-------|---------------|\n| Assets and liabilities arising from financing activities\u00b9 | 53,609 | (6,095) | (2,284) | 2,586 | (594) | 24,938 | 72,160 |\n\n| 1 April 2018 | Net proceeds/ (impayments) of borrowings | Interest paid | Net movement in short-term borrowings | Net Financing costs | Other | 31 March 2019 |\n|---------------|------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|-------|---------------|\n| Assets and liabilities arising from financing activities\u00b9 | 43,013 | 8,501 | (1,297) | (541) | 1,958 | 1,975 | 53,609 |\n\nNotes:\n1. This balance comprises gross borrowings of \u20ac7,471 million (2019: \u20ac5,295 million), net derivative financial assets of \u20ac4,409 million (2019: \u20ac1,190 million) and financial liabilities under put option arrangements previously included within borrowings of \u20ac1,850 million (2019: \u20ac1,844 million). This balance excludes \u20acnil of other payables in relation to the share buyback programme (2019: \u20ac823 million), with cash outflows of \u20ac821 million during the year (2019: \u20ac475 million).\n2. This amount includes interest, fair value and foreign exchange items which impact the income statement or other comprehensive income. Financing costs of \u20ac3,549 million (2019: \u20ac2,088 million) as disclosed in note 5 \u201cInvestment income and financing costs\u201d primarily exclude gains on cash flow hedges of \u20ac3,705 million (2019: \u20ac276 million) and additionally include foreign exchange and other movements on items such as cash and short-term investments.\n3.

Post employment benefits\n\nThe Group operates a number of Defined Benefit and Defined Contribution retirement plans for our employees. The Group\u2019s largest defined benefit plan is in the UK. For further details see \u201cCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\u201d in note 1 \u201cBasis of preparation\u201d.\n\nAccounting policies\n\nFor defined benefit retirement plans, the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the plan liabilities is recognised as an asset or liability on the statement of financial position. Defined benefit plan liabilities are assessed using the projected unit funding method and applying the principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting period date. Assets are valued at market value.\n\nActuarial gains and losses are taken to the statement of comprehensive income as incurred. For this purpose, actuarial gains and losses comprise both the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments arising from differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred. The return on plan assets, in excess of interest income, and costs incurred for the management of plan assets are also taken to other comprehensive income.\n\nOther movements in the net surplus or deficit are recognised in the income statement, including the current service cost, any past service cost and the effect of any settlements. The interest cost less the expected interest income on assets is also charged to the income statement. The amount charged to the income statement in respect of these plans is included within operating costs or in the Group\u2019s share of the results of equity accounted operations, as appropriate.\n\nThe Group\u2019s contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the income statement as they fall due.\n\nBackground\n\nAt 31 March 2020 the Group operated a number of retirement plans for the benefit of its employees throughout the world, with varying rights and obligations depending on the conditions and practices in the countries concerned. The Group\u2019s retirement plans are provided through both defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements. Defined benefit plans provide benefits based on the employees\u2019 length of pensionable service and their final pensionable salary or other criteria. Defined contribution plans offer employees individual funds that are converted into benefits at the time of retirement.\n\nThe Group operates defined benefit plans in Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, the UK, the United States and the Group operates defined benefit indemnity plans in Greece and Turkey. Defined Contribution plans are currently provided in Egypt, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, South Africa, Spain and the UK.\n\nIncome statement expense\n\n|                      | 2020 \u20acm | 2019 \u20acm | 2018 \u20acm |\n|----------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Defined contribution plans | 180     | 166     | 178     |\n| Defined benefit plans  | 46      | 57      | 44      |\n| **Total amount charged to income statement (note 24)** | **226** | **223** | **222** |\n\nDefined benefit plans\n\nThe Group\u2019s retirement policy is to provide competitive pension provision, in each operating country, in line with the market median for that location. The Group\u2019s preferred retirement provision is focused on Defined Contribution (DC) arrangements and/or State provision for future service.\n\nThe Group\u2019s main defined benefit funding liability is the Vodafone UK Group Pension Scheme (Vodafone UK plan). Since June 2014 the Vodafone UK plan has consisted of two segregated sections: the Vodafone Section and the Cable & Wireless Section (CWW Section). Both sections are closed to new entrants and to future accrual. The Group also operates smaller funded and unfunded plans in the UK, funded and unfunded plans in Germany and funded plans in Ireland. Defined benefit pension provision exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as longer than expected longevity of participants, lower than expected return on investments and higher than expected inflation, which may increase the liabilities or reduce the value of assets of the plans.\n\nThe main defined benefit plans are administered by trustee boards which are legally separate from the Group and consist of representatives who are employees, former employees or are independent from the Group. The trustee boards of the pension plans are required by legislation to act in the best interest of the participants, set the investment strategy and contribution rates and are subject to statutory funding regimes.\n\nThe Vodafone UK plan is registered as an occupational pension plan with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and is subject to UK legislation and operates within the framework outlined by the Pensions Regulator. UK legislation requires that pension plans are funded prudently and that valuations are undertaken at least every three years. Separate valuations are required for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section.\n\nThe trustees obtain regular actuarial valuations to check whether the statutory funding objective is met and whether a recovery plan is required to restore funding to the level of the agreed technical provisions. The 31 March 2016 triennial actuarial valuation for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section of the Vodafone UK plan showed a net deficit of \u00a3279 million (\u00a3317 million) on the funding basis, comprising of a \u00a3339 million (\u00a3385 million) deficit for the Vodafone Section and a \u00a360 million (\u00a368 million) surplus for the CWW Section.\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n25. Post employment benefits (continued)\n\nThese plan-specific actuarial valuations will differ to the IAS 19 accounting basis, which is used to measure pension assets and liabilities presented in the Group\u2019s consolidated statement of financial position.\n\nFollowing the 2016 triennial valuation, the Group and trustees of the Vodafone UK plan agreed a funding plan to address the valuation deficit in the Vodafone Section over the period to 31 March 2025 and made a cash contribution on 19 October 2017 of \u20ac185 million (\u20ac209 million) into the Vodafone Section and a further cash payment in accordance with the arrangements set under the previous valuation of \u20ac58 million (\u20ac66 million) into the CWW Section. These cash payments were invested into annuity policies issued by a third party insurance company which in turn entered into a reinsurance policy covering these risks with the Group\u2019s captive insurance company, see note 15 \u201cTrade and other payables\u201d. No further contributions are due in respect of the deficit revealed at the 2016 valuation.\n\nThe triennial actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2019 is currently in progress and will be completed during 2020. The Group and trustees have agreed the actuarial assumptions in principle and the outcome is expected to show an improvement compared to the 2016 actuarial valuation. As completion of the 2019 triennial valuation is at an advanced stage, the Group has reflected the outcome of the mortality analysis carried out for the 2019 actuarial valuation in its chosen accounting assumptions and update the accounting valuation to reflect experience emerging from the 2019 actuarial valuation.\n\nFunding plans are individually agreed for each of the Group\u2019s other defined benefit plans with the respective trustees or governing board, taking into account local regulatory requirements. It is expected that ordinary contributions relating to future service of \u20ac46 million will be paid into the Group\u2019s defined benefit plans during the year ending 31 March 2021. The Group has also provided certain guarantees in respect of the Vodafone UK plan; further details are provided in note 29 \u201cContingent liabilities and legal proceedings\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe investment strategy for the UK plans is controlled by the trustees in consultation with the Group and the plans have no direct investments in the Group\u2019s equity securities or in property or other assets currently used by the Group. The allocation of assets between different classes of investment is reviewed regularly and is a key factor in the trustee investment policy. The trustees aim to achieve the plan\u2019s investment objectives through investing partly in a diversified mix of growth assets which, over the long term, are expected to grow in value by more than the low risk assets. The low risk assets include cash and gilts, inflation and interest rate hedging and in substance insured pensioner annuity policies in both the Vodafone Section and CWW Sections of the Vodafone UK plan. A number of investment managers are appointed to promote diversification by assets, organisation and investment style and current market conditions and trends are regularly assessed, which may lead to adjustments in the asset allocation.\n\nActuarial assumptions\n\nThe Group\u2019s plan liabilities are measured using the projected unit credit method using the principal actuarial assumptions set out below:\n\n| Weighted average actuarial assumptions used at 31 March\u00b9: | 2020 % | 2019 % | 2018 % |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Rate of inflation\u00b2 | 2.2    | 2.9    | 2.9    |\n| Rate of increase in salaries | 2.5    | 2.7    | 2.7    |\n| Discount rate | 2.0    | 2.3    | 2.5    |\n\nNotes:\n1. Figures shown represent a weighted average assumption of the individual plans.\n2. The rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred revaluation are dependent on the rate of inflation.\n\nMortality assumptions used are based on recommendations from the individual local actuaries which include adjustments for the experience of the Group where appropriate. The Group\u2019s largest plan is the Vodafone UK plan. Further life expectancies assumed for the UK plans are 23.2/25.2 years (2019: 23.3/26.6 years) for a male/female pensioner currently aged 65 years and 25.1/27.2 (2019: 26.2/29.4 years) from age 65 for a male/female non-pensioner member currently aged 40.\n\nCharges made to the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of comprehensive income (\u2018SOCI\u2019) on the basis of the assumptions stated above are:\n\n| 2020 \u20acm | 2019 \u20acm | 2018 \u20acm |\n|---------|--------|--------|\n| Current service cost | 37 | 31 | 34 |\n| Past service costs\u00b9 | \u2013 | 16 | 2 |\n| Net interest charge | 9 | 10 | 8 |\n| **Total included within staff costs** | **46** | **57** | **44** |\n| Actuarial gains/(losses) recognised in the SOCI | 640 | (33) | (94) |\n\nNote:\n1. Following a High Court judgement on 21 October 2018 which concluded that affected defined benefit plans should equalise pension benefits for men and women in relation to guaranteed minimum pension (GMP) benefits the Group has recorded a pre-tax past service cost of \u20ac16 million (\u20ac14 million) in the year ended 31 March 2019.\n\nDuration of the benefit obligations\n\nThe weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation at 31 March 2020 is 21 years (2019: 22.0 years).\nFair value of the assets and present value of the liabilities of the plans\n\nThe amount included in the statement of financial position arising from the Group\u2019s obligations in respect of its Defined benefit plans is as follows:\n\n| Date       | Assets \u00a3m | Liabilities \u00a3m | Net deficit \u00a3m |\n|------------|-----------|----------------|----------------|\n| 1April 2018| 6,697     | (7,107)        | (410)          |\n| Service cost | \u2013         | (47)           | (47)           |\n| Interest income/(cost) | 167       | (177)          | (10)           |\n| Return on plan assets excluding interest income | 269       | \u2013              | 269            |\n| Actuarial gains/(losses) arising from changes in demographic assumptions | \u2013         | 5              | 5              |\n| Actuarial gains/(losses) arising from changes in financial assumptions | \u2013         | (253)          | (253)          |\n| Actuarial gains/(losses) arising from experience adjustments | \u2013         | 12             | 12             |\n| Employer cash contributions | 27        | \u2013              | 27             |\n| Member cash contributions | 9         | (9)            | \u2013              |\n| Benefits paid | (280)     | 280            | \u2013              |\n| Exchange rate movements | 87        | (87)           | \u2013              |\n| Other movements | (2)       | (48)           | (50)           |\n| 31 March 2019 | 6,974     | (7,431)        | (457)          |\n| Service cost | \u2013         | (37)           | (37)           |\n| Interest income/(cost) | 154       | (163)          | (9)            |\n| Return on plan assets excluding interest income | 108       | \u2013              | 108            |\n| Actuarial gains arising from changes in demographic assumptions | \u2013         | 252            | 252            |\n| Actuarial gains arising from changes in financial assumptions | \u2013         | 383            | 383            |\n| Actuarial losses arising from experience adjustments | \u2013         | (103)          | (103)          |\n| Employer cash contributions | 42        | \u2013              | 42             |\n| Member cash contributions | 10        | (10)           | \u2013              |\n| Benefits paid | (237)     | 237            | \u2013              |\n| Exchange rate movements | (143)     | 156            | 13             |\n| Other movements | (2)       | (38)           | (40)           |\n| 31 March 2020 | 6,906     | (6,754)        | 152            |\n\nAn analysis of the net surplus/(deficit) is provided below for the Group as a whole.\n\n| Year       | 2020 \u00a3m | 2019 \u00a3m | 2018 \u00a3m | 2017 \u00a3m | 2016 \u00a3m |\n|------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Analysis of net surplus/(deficit): |         |         |         |         |         |\n| Total fair value of plan assets | 6,906   | 6,974   | 6,697   | 6,709   | 6,229   |\n| Present value of funded plan liabilities | (6,641) | (7,315) | (7,028) | (7,222) | (6,487) |\n| Net surplus/(deficit) for funded plans | 265     | (341)   | (331)   | (513)   | (258)   |\n| Present value of unfunded plan liabilities | (113)   | (116)   | (79)    | (81)    | (83)    |\n| Net surplus/(deficit) | 152     | (457)   | (410)   | (594)   | (341)   |\n| Net surplus/(deficit) is analysed as: |         |         |         |         |         |\n| Assets\u00b9 | 590     | 94      | 110     | 57      | 224     |\n| Liabilities | (438)   | (551)   | (520)   | (651)   | (565)   |\n\nNote:\n\u00b9 Pension assets are deemed to be recoverable and there are no adjustments in respect of minimum funding requirements as economic benefits are available to the Group either in the form of future refunds or, for plans still open to benefit accrual, in the form of possible reductions in future contributions.\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n25. Post employment benefits (continued)\n\nAn analysis of net assets/(deficit) is provided below for the Vodafone UK plan, which is a funded plan. As part of the merger of the Vodafone UK plan and the Cable and Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan (CWWRP) plan on 6 June 2014 the assets and liabilities of the CWWRP Section are segregated from the Vodafone Section and hence are reported separately below.\n\n| Analysis of net surplus/(deficit): | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 |\n|----------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Total fair value of plan assets  | 2,842| 2,828| 2,760| 2,894| 2,762| 2,873| 2,926| 2,773| 2,654| 2,408|\n| Present value of plan liabilities| (2,393)| (2,734)| (2,655)| (2,842)| (2,543)| (2,731)| (3,157)| (2,945)| (2,962)| (2,548)|\n| Net surplus/(deficit)            | 449  | 94   | 105  | 52   | 219  | 142  | (231)| (172)| (308)| (140)|\n\nNet surplus/(deficit) are analysed by asset category above and are subdivided by assets that have a quoted market price in an active market and those that do not, such as investment funds. Where available, the fair values are quoted prices (e.g. listed equity, sovereign debt and corporate bonds). Unlisted investments without quoted prices in an active market (e.g. private equity) are included at values provided by the fund manager in accordance with relevant guidance. Other significant assets are valued based on observable inputs such as yield curves. The Vodafone UK plan annuity policies fully match the pension obligations of those pensioners insured and therefore are set equal to the present value of the related obligations. Investment funds of \u20ac533 million at 31 March 2020 include investments in diversified alternative beta funds held in the Vodafone Section of the Vodafone UK plan.\n\nThe actual return on plan assets over the year to 31 March 2020 was a gain of \u20ac262 million (2019: \u20ac436 million).\n\nSensitivity analysis\n\nMeasurement of the Group\u2019s defined benefit retirement obligation is sensitive to changes in certain key assumptions. The sensitivity analysis below shows how a reasonably possible increase or decrease in a particular assumption would, in isolation, result in an increase or decrease in the present value of the defined benefit obligation as at 31 March 2020.\n\n| (Decrease)/increase in present of defined benefit obligation | Rate of inflation | Rate of increase in salaries | Discount rate | Life expectancy |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|---------------|----------------|\n|                                                            | Decrease by 0.5%   | Increase by 0.5%             | Decrease by 0.5% | Increase by 0.5% | Decrease by 1 year | Increase by 1 year |\n|                                                            | \u20acm                | \u20acm                           | \u20acm             | \u20acm             | \u20acm               | \u20acm               |\n| (Decrease)/increase in present of defined benefit obligation| (492)            | 563                          | (3)            | 4              | 717              | (617)            | 205              | (206) |\n\n1 The sensitivity analysis may not be representative of an actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that changes in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another. In presenting this sensitivity analysis, the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated on the same basis as prior years using the projected unit credit method at the end of the year, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the statement of financial position. The rate of inflation assumption sensitivity factors in the impact of changes to all assumptions relating to inflation including the rate of increase in salaries, pension increases and deferred revaluations.\n26. Share-based payments\n\nThe Group has a number of share plans used to award shares to Executive Directors and employees as part of their remuneration package. A charge is recognised over the vesting period in the consolidated income statement to record the cost of these, based on the fair value of the award on the grant date.\n\nAccounting policies\nThe Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group\u2019s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. A corresponding increase in retained earnings is also recognised.\n\nSome share awards have an attached market condition, based on total shareholder return, which is taken into account when calculating the fair value of the share awards. The valuation for the TSR is based on Vodafone\u2019s ranking within the same group of companies, where possible, over the past five years.\n\nThe fair value of awards of non-vested shares is an average calculation of the closing price of the Group\u2019s shares on the days prior to the grant date, adjusted for the present value of the delay in receiving dividends where appropriate.\n\nThe maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares which may be issued in respect of share options or share plans will not (without shareholder approval) exceed:\n\n- 10% of the ordinary share capital of the Company in issue immediately prior to the date of grant, when aggregated with the total number of ordinary shares which have been allocated in the preceding ten year period under all plans; and\n- 5% of the ordinary share capital of the Company in issue immediately prior to the date of grant, when aggregated with the total number of ordinary shares which have been allocated in the preceding ten year period under all plans, other than any plans which are operated on an all-employee basis.\n\nShare options\n\nVodafone Group executive plans\nNo share options have been granted to any Directors or employees under the Company\u2019s discretionary share option plans in the year ended 31 March 2020. There were no options outstanding under the Vodafone Global Incentive Plan at the year-end.\n\nVodafone Sharesave Plan\nUnder the Vodafone Sharesave Plan UK staff may acquire shares in the Company through monthly savings of up to \u00a3375 over a three and/or five year period, at the end of which they may also receive a tax-free bonus. The savings and bonus may then be used to purchase shares at the option price, which is set at the beginning of the invitation period and usually at a discount of 20% to the then prevailing market price of the Company\u2019s shares.\n\nShare plans\n\nVodafone Group executive plans\nUnder the Vodafone Global Incentive Plan awards of shares are granted to Directors and certain employees. The release of these shares is conditional upon continued employment and for some awards achievement of certain performance targets measured over a three year period.\n\nVodafone Share Incentive Plan\nFollowing a review of the UK all-employee plans it was decided that with effect from 1 April 2017 employees would no longer be able to contribute to the Share Incentive Plan and would therefore no longer receive matching shares. Individuals who hold shares in the plan will continue to receive dividend shares.\n26.

Acquisitions and disposals\n\nWe completed a number of acquisitions and disposals during the year. The note below provides details of these transactions as well as those in the prior year. For further details see \u201cCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\u201d in note 1 \u201cBasis of preparation\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAccounting policies\n\nBusiness combinations\n\nAcquisitions of subsidiaries are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred. The acquiree\u2019s identifiable assets and liabilities are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to us. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the Group\u2019s previously held equity interest in the acquiree, if any, over the net amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The interest of the non-controlling shareholders in the acquiree may initially be measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling shareholders\u2019 proportion of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis.\n\nAcquisition of interests from non-controlling shareholders\n\nIn transactions with non-controlling parties that do not result in a change in control, the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid or received and the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted is recognised in equity.\n\nThe aggregate cash consideration in respect of purchases in subsidiaries, net of cash acquired, is as follows:\n\n|                      | 2020  | 2019  |\n|----------------------|-------|-------|\n| Cash consideration paid |       |       |\n| European Liberty Global Assets | 10,313 | \u2014     |\n| Other acquisitions during the period | 108   | 61    |\n| Net cash acquired     | (126) | 26    |\n|                      | 10,295| 87    |\n\nEuropean Liberty Global assets\n\nOn 31 July 2019, the Group completed the acquisition of a 100% interest in Unitymedia GmBH (\u2018Unitymedia\u2019) and Liberty Global\u2019s operations (excluding its \u2018Direct Home\u2019 business) in the Czech Republic (\u2018UPC Czech\u2019), Hungary (\u2018UPC Hungary\u2019) and Romania (\u2018UPC Romania\u2019) for an aggregate net cash consideration of \u20ac10,313 million. The primary reason for acquiring the businesses was to create a converged national provider of digital infrastructure in Germany, together with creating converged communications operators in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania.\n\nThe purchase price allocation is set out in the table below:\n\n| Net assets acquired                      | Fair value \u20acm |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Identifiable intangible assets\u00b9         | 5,818         |\n| Property, plant and equipment\u00b2         | 4,737         |\n| Inventory                               | 2             |\n| Trade and other receivables             | 856           |\n| Other investments                       | 2             |\n| Cash and cash equivalents               | 109           |\n| Current and deferred taxation           | (1,904)       |\n| Short and long-term borrowings          | (9,527)       |\n| Trade and other payables                | (1,066)       |\n| Post employment benefits                | (40)          |\n| Provisions                              | (178)         |\n| **Net identifiable liabilities acquired** | **(1,191)**  |\n| Goodwill\u00b9                               | 11,504        |\n| **Total consideration\u00b9**                | **10,313**    |\n\nNotes:\n\n1. Identifiable intangible assets of \u20ac5,818 million consisted of customer relationships of \u20ac5,569 million, brand of \u20ac71 million and software of \u20ac178 million.\n2. Includes Right-of-use assets.\n3. The goodwill is attributable to future profits expected to be generated from new customers and the synergies expected to arise after the Group\u2019s acquisition of the businesses.\n4. Transaction costs of \u20ac46 million were charged to Other income and expense in the consolidated income statement in the year ended 31 March 2020.\n\nFrom the date of acquisition, the acquired entities have contributed \u20ac1,993 million of revenue and a loss of \u20ac247 million towards the profit before tax of the Group. If the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the financial year, revenue would have been \u20ac45,975 million and the profit before tax would have been \u20ac822 million.\n27. Acquisitions and disposals (continued)\n\nOther acquisitions\nDuring the year ended 31 March 2020 the Group completed certain acquisitions for an aggregate consideration of \u20ac276 million, of which \u20ac108 million has been paid in cash. The aggregate provisional fair values of goodwill, identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired operations were \u20ac248 million, \u20ac113 million and \u20ac85 million, respectively.\n\nDisposals\nThe difference between the carrying value of the net assets disposed of and the fair value of consideration received is recorded as a gain or loss on disposal. Foreign exchange translation gains or losses relating to subsidiaries that the Group has disposed of, and that have previously recorded in other comprehensive income or expense, are also recognised as part of the gain or loss on disposal.\n\nVodafone New Zealand\nOn 31 July 2019, the Group sold its 100% interest in Vodafone New Zealand Limited (\u2018Vodafone New Zealand\u2019) for consideration of NZD $3.4 billion (\u20ac2.0 billion). The table below summarises the net assets disposed and the resulting net gain on disposal of \u20ac1.1 billion.\n\n| \u20acm       |          |          |          |\n|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Goodwill | (243)    |          |          |\n| Other intangible assets | (155)    |          |          |\n| Property, plant and equipment\u00b9 | (783)    |          |          |\n| Inventory | (29)     |          |          |\n| Trade and other receivables | (244)    |          |          |\n| Investments in associates and joint ventures | (4)      |          |          |\n| Current and deferred taxation | (11)     |          |          |\n| Short and long-term borrowings | 215      |          |          |\n| Trade and other payables | 261      |          |          |\n| Provisions | 35       |          |          |\n| **Net assets disposed** | **(958)** |          |          |\n| Net cash proceeds arising from the transaction | 2,023    |          |          |\n| Other effects\u00b2 | 13       |          |          |\n| **Net gain on transaction\u00b9** | **1,078** |          |          |\n\nNotes:\n1. Includes Right-of-use assets.\n2. Includes \u20ac59 million of recycled foreign exchange losses.\n3. Recorded within Other income and expense in the consolidated income statement.\n\nTower infrastructure in Italy\nOn 31 March 2020, the Group merged its passive tower infrastructure in Italy with Infrastrutture Wireless Italiane S.p.A. (\u2018INWIT\u2019), creating the leading tower company in Italy (the \u2018combination\u2019). As part of the combination, Vodafone received proceeds of \u20ac2,140 million and a 37.5% shareholding in the combined entity. As a result of the transaction, we no longer consolidate the tower assets and account for our interest as a joint venture using the equity method. We have also entered into an agreement to lease back space on the mobile base stations to locate network equipment (see note 20 \u201cLeases\u201d). The Group recognised a net gain on the combination of \u20ac3,356 million.\n\n| \u20acm       |          |          |          |\n|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Goodwill | (1,320)  |          |          |\n| Property, plant and equipment\u00b9 | (548)    |          |          |\n| Trade and other receivables | (164)    |          |          |\n| Current and deferred taxation | 44       |          |          |\n| Short and long-term borrowings | 270      |          |          |\n| Trade and other payables | 79       |          |          |\n| Provisions | 40       |          |          |\n| **Net assets contributed into INWIT** | **(1,599)** |          |          |\n| Fair value of investment in INWIT\u00b2 | 3,559    |          |          |\n| Net cash proceeds arising from the transaction | 2,140    |          |          |\n| Restriction of gain (note 20) | (744)    |          |          |\n| **Net gain on formation\u00b9** | **3,356** |          |          |\n\nNotes:\n1. Includes Right-of-use assets.\n2. The fair value of \u20ac3,559 million comprises an investment of \u20ac3,345 million recorded within Investments in associates and joint ventures (note 12) and a dividend receivable of \u20ac214 million, recorded within Other receivables (note 14).\n3. Recorded within Other income and expense in the consolidated income statement.\n\nVodafone Malta\nOn 31 March 2020, the Group sold its 100% interest in Vodafone Malta Limited (\u2018Vodafone Malta\u2019) for consideration of \u20ac242 million. A net gain on disposal of \u20ac170 million has been recorded within Other income and expense in the consolidated income statement.\nVodafone Idea\n\nOn 31 August 2018, the Group combined the operations of its subsidiary, Vodafone India (excluding its 42% stake in Indus Towers), with Idea Cellular Limited (\u2018Idea\u2019), to create Vodafone Idea Limited (\u2018Vodafone Idea\u2019), a company jointly controlled by Vodafone and the Aditya Birla Group (\u2018ABG\u2019).\n\nAs a result, the Group no longer consolidates its previous interest in Vodafone India which was presented within discontinued operations in the comparative period (see note 7 \u201cDiscontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale\u201d) and now accounts for its 45.2% interest in Vodafone Idea as a joint venture using the equity method.\n\nOn disposal, Vodafone India was valued based on the number of shares the Group held in the merged entity post completion and the Idea share price on 31 August 2018 (INR 51.50). The value was also adjusted for the proceeds from the sale of the 4.8% stake in Vodafone Idea from the Vodafone Group to ABG. As the price per share and proceeds from the sale to ABG are readily observable and no further adjustments were made, the valuation is considered to be a \u201clevel 1\u201d valuation as per IFRS 13. As a result of the transaction, the Group recognised a net loss of \u20ac3,420 million, including a loss on disposal of \u20ac1,276 million and a foreign exchange loss of \u20ac2,079 million.\n\n| Other intangible assets | (6,138) |\n|-------------------------|---------|\n| Property, plant and equipment | (3,091) |\n| Trade and other receivables | (1,572) |\n| Other investments | (6) |\n| Cash and cash equivalents | (751) |\n| Current and deferred taxation | (2,790) |\n| Short and long-term borrowings | 7,896 |\n| Trade and other payables | 1,669 |\n| Provisions | 720 |\n\n**Net assets contributed into Vodafone Idea**\n\n| Fair value of investment in Vodafone Idea | (4,063) |\n|------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Net cash proceeds arising from the transaction | 320 |\n| Other effects | (2,144) |\n\n**Net loss on formation of Vodafone Idea**\n\n| (3,420) |\n\nNotes:\n\n1. Includes \u20ac2,079 million of recycled foreign exchange losses.\n2. Includes a loss of \u20ac603 million related to the re-measurement of our retained interest in Vodafone Idea.\n3. Included in Disposal of interests in subsidiaries; net of cash disposed within the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n28. Commitments\n\nA commitment is a contractual obligation to make a payment in the future, mainly in relation to agreements to buy assets such as network infrastructure and IT systems and leases that have not commenced. These amounts are not recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position since we have not yet received the goods or services from the supplier. The amounts below are the minimum amounts that we are committed to pay.\n\nOperating lease commitments\n\nIn the prior year, the previous lease accounting policy applied and certain leases were classified as operating leases. The minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases previously disclosed in the prior year were as follows:\n\n|                      | 2019 \u00a3m |\n|----------------------|---------|\n| Within one year      | 2,834   |\n| In more than one year but less than two years | 1,654   |\n| In more than two years but less than three years | 1,227   |\n| In more than three years but less than four years | 950     |\n| In more than four years but less than five years | 739     |\n| In more than five years | 3,412   |\n|                      | 10,816  |\n\nThe total of future minimum sublease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable subleases at 31 March 2019 was \u20ac1,027 million.\n\nCapital commitments\n\n|                      | Company and subsidiaries | Share of joint operations | Group |\n|----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|-------|\n|                      | 2020 \u00a3m | 2019 \u00a3m | 2020 \u00a3m | 2019 \u00a3m | 2020 \u00a3m | 2019 \u00a3m |\n| Contracts placed for future capital expenditure not provided in the financial statements\u00b9 | 3,046 | 2,980 | 103 | 32 | 3,149 | 3,012 |\n\nNote:\n\u00b9 Commitment includes contracts placed for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.\n\nAcquisition and disposal commitments\n\nIndus Towers\n\nOn 25 April 2018, Vodafone, Bharti Airtel Limited and Vodafone Idea (previously Idea Cellular Limited) announced the merger of Indus Towers Limited (\u2018Indus Towers\u2019) into Bharti Infratel Limited (\u2018Bharti Infratel\u2019), creating a combined company that will own the respective businesses of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers. Indus Towers is currently jointly owned by Bharti Infratel (42%), Vodafone (42%), Vodafone Idea (11.15%) and Providence (4.85%). Bharti group and Vodafone will jointly control the combined company, in accordance with the terms of a new shareholders\u2019 agreement.\n\nVodafone Idea has the option to either sell its 11.15% shareholding in Indus Towers for cash or receive new shares in the combined company. Providence has the option to elect to receive cash or shares in the combined company for 3.35% of its 4.85% shareholding in Indus Towers, with the balance exchanged for shares.\n\nThe final number of shares issued to Vodafone and the cash paid or shares issued to Vodafone Idea and Providence, will be subject to closing adjustments, including but not limited to movements in net debt and working capital for Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers. At the time of entering into the transaction, Vodafone would have been issued with 783.1 million new shares in the combined company, in exchange for its 42% shareholding in Indus Towers. On the basis that (a) Providence decides to sell 3.35% of its 4.85% shareholding in Indus Towers for cash and (b) Vodafone Idea decides to sell its full 11.15% shareholding in Indus Towers for cash, these shares would be equivalent to a 29.4% shareholding in the combined company. Bharti group\u2019s shareholding will be diluted from 53.5% in Bharti Infratel today to 37.2% in the combined company.\n\nThe Group has extended the long stop date on the merger agreement to 24 June 2020.\n\nVodafone Hutchison Australia\n\nOn 30 August 2018, Vodafone announced that Vodafone Hutchison Australia Pty Limited (\u2018VHA\u2019) and TPG Telecom Limited (\u2018TPG\u2019) had agreed to merge. Vodafone and Hutchison Telecommunications (Australia) Limited (\u2018HTAL\u2019) will each own an economic interest of 25.05% in the new combined company, with TPG shareholders owning the remaining 49.9%. Of the net debt held by VHA prior to completion of the merger, Vodafone will provide a guarantee on approximately US$ 1.75 billion, which is lower than the guarantees of approximately US$ 1.75 billion and AUD 0.85 billion currently provided.\n\nOn 8 May 2019, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (\u2018ACCC\u2019) opposed the proposed merger. The Group challenged the ACCC\u2019s decision in Federal Court. On 13 February 2020, the Federal Court allowed the proposed merger to proceed. This transaction remains subject to TPG shareholder approval.\n\nVodafone Egypt\n\nThe Group signed a memorandum of understanding with Saudi Telecom Company in January 2020 to pursue the sale of the Group\u2019s 55% equity holding in Vodafone Egypt Telecommunications S.A.E (\u2018Vodafone Egypt\u2019) for cash consideration of US$ 2.4 billion (\u00a32.2 billion).\n29. Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings\n\nContingent liabilities are potential future cash outflows, where the likelihood of payment is considered more than remote, but is not considered probable or cannot be measured reliably.\n\n| Performance bonds | 2020 | 2019 |\n|-------------------|------|------|\n|                   | 414  | 337  |\n| Other guarantees  | 2,908| 2,943|\n\nNotes:\n1. Performance bonds require the Group to make payments to third parties in the event that the Group does not perform what is expected of it under the terms of any related contracts or commercial arrangements.\n2. Other guarantees principally comprise Vodafone Group Plc\u2019s guarantee of the Group\u2019s 50% share of an AUD1.7 billion loan facility and a US$3.5 billion loan facility of its joint venture, Vodafone Hutchison Australia Pty Limited. The Group\u2019s share of these loan balances is included in the net investment in joint venture (see note 12 \u201cInvestments in associates and joint arrangements\u201d).\n\nUK pension schemes\n\nThe Group\u2019s main defined benefit plan is the Vodafone UK Group Pension Scheme (Vodafone UK Plan) which has two segregated sections, the Vodafone Section and the CWW Section, as detailed in note 25 \u201cPost employment benefits\u201d.\n\nThe Group has covenanted to provide security in favour of both the Vodafone Section and CWW Section whilst a deficit remains. The deficit is measured on a prescribed basis agreed between the Group and trustee. The Group provides surety bonds as the security.\n\nThe level of the security has varied since inception in line with the movement in the Vodafone UK Plan deficit. At 31 March 2020 the Vodafone UK Plan retains security over \u20ac791 million (notional value) for the Vodafone Section and \u20ac198 million (notional value) for the CWW Section. The security may be substituted either on a voluntary or mandatory basis. The Company has also provided two guarantees to the Vodafone Section of the Vodafone UK Plan for a combined value up to \u20ac1.41 billion to provide security over the deficit under certain defined circumstances, including insolvency of the employers. The Company has also agreed a similar guarantee of up to \u20ac1.41 billion for the CWW Section.\n\nAn additional smaller UK defined benefit plan, the THUS Plc Group Scheme, has a guarantee from the Company for up to \u20ac113 million.\n\nLegal proceedings\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are currently, and may from time to time become, involved in a number of legal proceedings, including inquiries from, or discussions with, governmental authorities that are incidental to their operations. However, save as disclosed below, the Company does not believe that it or its subsidiaries are currently involved in (i) any legal or arbitration proceedings (including any governmental proceedings which are pending or known to be contemplated) which may have, or have had in the 12 months preceding the date of this report, a material adverse effect on the financial position or profitability of the Group; or (ii) any material proceedings in which any of the Company\u2019s Directors, members of senior management or affiliates are either a party adverse to the Company or its subsidiaries or have a material interest adverse to the Company or its subsidiaries. Due to inherent uncertainties, the Company cannot make any accurate quantification of any cost, or timing of such cost, which may arise from any of the legal proceedings referred to in this Annual Report, however costs in complex litigation can be substantial.\n\nIndian tax cases\n\nIn August 2007 and September 2007, Vodafone India Limited (Vodafone India) and Vodafone International Holdings BV (VIHBV) respectively received notices from the Indian tax authority alleging potential liability in connection with an alleged failure by VIHBV to deduct withholding tax from consideration paid to the Hutchison Telecommunications International Limited group (HTIL) in respect of HTIL\u2019s gain on its disposal to VIHBV of its interests in a wholly-owned Cayman Island incorporated subsidiary that indirectly held interests in Vodafone India. Following approximately five years of litigation in the Indian courts in which VIHBV sought to set aside the tax demand issued by the Indian tax authority, in January 2012 the Supreme Court of India handed down its judgement, holding that VIHBV\u2019s interpretation of the Income Tax Act 1961 was correct, that the HTIL transaction in 2007 was not taxable in India, and that consequently, VIHBV had no obligation to withhold tax from consideration paid to HTIL in respect of the transaction. The Supreme Court of India quashed the relevant notices and demands issued to VIHBV in respect of withholding tax and interest.\n\nOn 28 May 2012 the Finance Act 2012 became law. The Finance Act 2012, which amended various provisions of the Income Tax Act 1961 with retrospective effect, contained provisions intended to tax any gain on transfer of shares in a non-Indian company, which derives substantial value from underlying Indian assets, such as VIHBV\u2019s transaction with HTIL in 2007. Further, it sought to subject a purchaser, such as VIHBV, to a retrospective obligation to withhold tax. VIHBV received a letter on 3 January 2013 from the Indian tax authority reminding it of the tax demand raised prior to the Supreme Court of India\u2019s judgement and purporting to update the interest element of that demand to a total amount of INR142 billion, which included principal and interest as calculated by the Indian tax authority but did not include penalties.\n\nOn 10 January 2014, VIHBV served an amended trigger notice on the Indian Government under the Netherlands-India Bilateral Investment Treaty (Dutch BIT), supplementing a trigger notice filed on 17 April 2012, immediately prior to the Finance Act 2012 becoming effective, to add claims relating to an attempt by the Indian Government to tax aspects of the transaction with HTIL under transfer pricing rules. A trigger notice announces a party\u2019s intention to submit a claim to arbitration and triggers a cooling off period during which both parties may seek to resolve the dispute amicably. Notwithstanding their attempts, the parties were unable to amicably resolve the dispute within the cooling off period stipulated in the Dutch BIT. On 17 April 2014, VIHBV served its notice of arbitration under the Dutch BIT, formally commencing the Dutch BIT arbitration proceedings.\nIn June 2016, the tribunal was fully constituted with Sir Franklin Berman KC MG QC appointed as presiding arbitrator. The Indian Government raised objections to the application of the treaty to VHBV\u2019s claims and to the jurisdiction of the tribunal under the Dutch BIT. On 19 June 2017, the tribunal decided to try both these jurisdictional objections along with the merits of VHBV\u2019s claim in February 2019. Further attempts by the Indian Government to have the jurisdiction arguments heard separately also failed. VHBV filed its response to India\u2019s defence in July 2018 and India responded in December 2018. The arbitration hearing took place in February 2019, and a decision is expected mid to late 2020.\n\nSeparately, on 15 June 2015, Vodafone Group Plc and Vodafone Consolidated Holdings Limited served a trigger notice on the Indian Government under the United Kingdom-India Bilateral Investment Treaty (UK BIT) in respect of retrospective tax claims under the Income Tax Act 1961 (as amended by the Finance Act 2012). Although relating to the same underlying facts as the claim under the Dutch BIT, the claim brought by Vodafone Group Plc and Vodafone Consolidated Holdings Limited is a separate and distinct claim under a different treaty. On 24 January 2017, Vodafone Group Plc and Vodafone Consolidated Holdings Limited served a Notice of Arbitration on the Indian Government formally commencing the arbitration.\n\nThe Indian Government has indicated that it considers the arbitration under the UK BIT to be an abuse of process but this is strongly denied by Vodafone. On 22 August 2017, the Indian Government obtained an injunction from the Delhi High Court preventing Vodafone from progressing the UK BIT arbitration. Vodafone was not present when India obtained this injunction and applied to dismiss it. On 26 October 2017, the Delhi High Court varied its order to permit Vodafone to participate in the formation of the UK BIT tribunal. The UK BIT tribunal now consists of Marcelo Kohen, an Argentinian national and professor of international law in Geneva (appointed by India), Neil Kaplan, a British national (appointed by Vodafone Group Plc) and Professor Campbell McLachlan QC, a New Zealand national (appointed by the parties as presiding arbitrator). On 7 May 2018, the Delhi High Court dismissed the injunction. The Indian Government appealed the decision and hearings took place in 2018 and 2019, with frequent adjournments. The case will be heard once the courts reopen after the COVID-19 lockdown has passed. In the meantime, Vodafone has undertaken to take no steps advancing the UK BIT pending resolution of the Indian Government\u2019s appeal.\n\nOn 12 February 2016, VIHBV received a notice dated 4 February 2016 of an outstanding tax demand of INR221 billion (which included interest accruing since the date of the original demand) along with a statement that enforcement action, including against VHBV\u2019s indirectly held assets in India, would be taken if the demand was not satisfied. On 29 September 2017, VHBV received an electronically generated demand in respect of alleged principal, interest and penalties in the amount of INR190.7 billion. This demand does not appear to have included any element for alleged accrued interest liability.\n\nSeparate proceedings in the Bombay High Court taken against VHBV to seek to treat it as an agent of HTIL in respect of its alleged tax on the same transaction, as well as penalties of up to 100% of the assessed withholding tax for the alleged failure to have withheld such taxes, were listed for hearing at the request of the Indian Government on 21 April 2016 despite the issue having been ruled upon by the Supreme Court of India. The hearing has since been periodically listed and then adjourned or not reached hearing. VHBV and Vodafone Group Plc will continue to defend vigorously any allegation that VHBV or Vodafone India is liable to pay tax in connection with the transaction with HTIL and will continue to exercise all rights to seek redress including pursuant to the Dutch BIT and the UK BIT. We have not recorded a provision in respect of the retrospective provisions of the Income Tax Act 1961 (as amended by the Finance Act 2012) and any tax demands based upon such provisions.\n\n**Other Indian tax cases**\n\nVodafone India Services Private Limited (VISPL) (formerly 3GSPL) is involved in a number of tax cases with total claims exceeding \u20ac450 million plus interest, and penalties of up to 300% of the principal.\n\n**VISPL tax claims**\n\nVISPL has been assessed as owing tax of approximately \u20ac258 million (plus interest of \u20ac521 million) in respect of (i) a transfer pricing margin charged for the international call centre of HTIL prior to the 2007 transaction with Vodafone for HTIL assets in India; (ii) the sale of the international call centre by VISPL to HTIL; and (iii) the acquisition of and/or the alleged transfer of options held by VISPL for Vodafone India. The first two of the three heads of tax are subject to an indemnity by HTIL. The larger part of the potential claim is not subject to any indemnity. VISPL unsuccessfully challenged the merits of the tax demand in the statutory tax tribunal and the jurisdiction of the tax office to make the demand in the High Court. The Tax Appeal Tribunal heard the appeal and ruled in the Tax Office\u2019s favour. VISPL lodged an appeal (and stay application) in the Bombay High Court which was concluded in early May 2015. On 13 July 2015 the tax authorities issued a revised tax assessment reducing the tax VISPL had previously been assessed as owing in respect of (i) and (ii) above. In the meantime, (i) a stay of the tax demand on a deposit of \u20ac20 million and (ii) a corporate guarantee by VHBV for the balance of tax assessed remain in place. On 8 October 2015, the Bombay High Court ruled in favour of Vodafone in relation to the options and the call centre sale. The Tax Office has appealed to the Supreme Court of India. A hearing has been adjourned with no specified date.\n\n**Indian regulatory cases**\n\nLitigation remains pending in the Telecommunications Dispute Settlement Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), High Courts and the Supreme Court of India in relation to a number of significant regulatory issues including mobile termination rates, spectrum and licence fees, licence extension and 3G intracircle roaming.\n\n**Vodafone Idea**\n\nAs part of the agreement to merge Vodafone India and Idea Cellular, the parties agreed a mechanism for payments between the Group and Vodafone Idea Limited (VIL) pursuant to the crystallisation of certain identified contingent liabilities in relation to legal, regulatory, tax and other matters, including the AGR case, and refunds relating to Vodafone India and Idea Cellular. Cash payments or cash receipts relating to the aforementioned matters must have been made or received by VIL before any amount becomes due from or owed to the Group. Any future payments by the Group to VIL as a result of this agreement would only be made after satisfaction of this and other contractual conditions.\nThe Group\u2019s potential exposure under this mechanism is capped at INR 84 billion (approximately \u20ac1 billion). Having considered the payments made and refunds received by VIL in relation to certain contingent liabilities relating to Vodafone India and Idea Cellular, including those relating to the AGR case, and the significant uncertainties in relation to VIL\u2019s ability to settle all liabilities relating to the AGR judgement, the Group has assessed a cash outflow of \u20ac235 million under the agreement to be probable at this time. On 22 April 2020, the Group announced that it has made an advance payment of US $200 million to VIL for amounts likely to be due under the terms of this mechanism.\n\n3G Intra Circle Roaming: Vodafone India and others v Union of India\nIn April 2013, the Indian Department of Telecommunications (DoT) issued a stoppage notice to Vodafone India\u2019s operating subsidiaries and other mobile operators requiring the immediate stoppage of the provision of 3G services on other operators\u2019 mobile networks in an alleged breach of licence claim. The DoT also imposed a fine of approximately \u20ac5.5 million. Vodafone India applied to the Delhi High Court for an order quashing the DoT\u2019s notice. Interim relief from the notice was granted (but limited to existing customers at the time with the effect that Vodafone India was not able to provide 3G services to new customers on other operators\u2019 3G networks pending a decision on the issue). The dispute was referred to the TDSAT for decision, which ruled on 28 April 2014 that Vodafone India and the other operators were permitted to provide 3G services to their customers (current and future) on other operators\u2019 networks. The DoT has appealed the judgement and sought a stay of the tribunal\u2019s judgement. The DoT\u2019s stay application was rejected by the Supreme Court of India. The matter is pending before the Supreme Court of India.\n\nOther public interest litigation\nThree public interest litigations have been initiated in the Supreme Court of India against the Indian Government and private operators on the grounds that the grant of additional spectrum beyond 4.4/6.2MHz was illegal. The cases seek appropriate investigation and compensation for the loss to the exchequer.\n\nOne time spectrum charges: Vodafone India v Union of India\nThe Indian Government has sought to impose one time spectrum charges of approximately \u20ac400 million on certain operating subsidiaries of Vodafone India. Vodafone India filed a petition before the TDSAT challenging the one time spectrum charges on the basis that they are illegal, violate Vodafone India\u2019s licence terms and are arbitrary, unreasonable and discriminatory. The tribunal stayed enforcement of the Government\u2019s spectrum demand pending resolution of the dispute. In July 2019, the TDSAT upheld the demand, in part, and in October VIL filed an appeal which was heard in the Supreme Court in March 2020. The Court rejected VIL\u2019s appeal, upholding the TDSAT order. The DoT may now seek payment in accordance with that order.\n\nAdjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) dispute before the Supreme Court of India: VIL and others v Union of India\nThe DoT has been in dispute with telecom service providers in India for over a decade concerning the correct interpretation of licence provisions for fees based on AGR, a concept that is used in the calculation of licence and other fees payable by telecom service providers. On an appeal to the Supreme Court from a decision of the TDSAT substantially upholding the telecom service providers\u2019 interpretation of AGR, the Supreme Court on 24 October 2019 held against the telecom service providers, including VIL. The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in favour of the DoT rendered the telecom service providers, including VIL, liable for principal, interest, penalties and interest on penalties on demands of the DoT in relation to licence fees. The DoT demands became due and payable within three months of the Supreme Court judgement.\n\nIn November 2019, the DoT issued an order for the AGR judgement debt to be determined through self-assessment and paid on or before 23 January 2020. VIL and other operators filed review petitions against the judgement, which were heard and dismissed on 16 January 2020. On 23 January 2020, the DoT announced that it would not take coercive action against telecom service providers which have not repaid their respective AGR judgement debts. Consequently, VIL and others did not pay any amount to the DoT. On 14 February 2020, after hearing applications from VIL and other operators, the Supreme Court ordered the DoT to withdraw its non-coercive order as well as requiring all Directors of VIL and other relevant operators to show cause as to why contempt proceedings should not be brought against them. On 17 February, 20 February and 16 March 2020, the company made payments totalling INR 68.5 billion (\u20ac6.8 billion) to the DoT. In another hearing on 18 March 2020, the Supreme Court ordered that no exercise of self-assessment/re-assessment should be performed and that the dues, as calculated by the DoT, should apply as per their original ruling in October 2019.\n\nBased on submissions of the DoT in the Supreme Court proceedings (which the Group is unable to confirm as to their accuracy), VIL\u2019s current liability appears to be INR 514 billion (\u20ac6.2 billion). The next hearing, where the Supreme Court is expected to consider the DoT\u2019s request to give a reasonable time for payment to be made, has been delayed as a result of the COVID-19 related restrictions.\n\nOther cases in the Group\nPatent litigation\nGermany\nThe telecoms industry is currently involved in significant levels of patent litigation brought by non-practising entities (NPEs) which have acquired patent portfolios from current and former industry companies. Vodafone is currently a party to patent litigation cases in Germany brought against Vodafone Germany by IPCom and Intellectual Ventures. Vodafone has contractual indemnities from suppliers which have been invoked in relation to the alleged patent infringement liability.\n\nSpain\nVodafone Group Plc has been sued in Spain by TOT Power Control (TOT), an affiliate of Top Optimized Technologies. The claim makes a number of allegations including patent infringement, with TOT initially seeking over \u20ac500 million from Vodafone Group Plc as well as an injunction against using the technology in question. Vodafone\u2019s initial challenge of the appropriateness of Spain as a venue for this dispute was denied. Vodafone Group Plc appealed the denial and was partially successful. In a decision dated 30 October 2017, the court ruled that while it did have jurisdiction to hear the infringement case relating to the Spanish patent, it was not competent to hear TOT\u2019s contractual and competition law claims. This decision is subject to appeal. TOT\u2019s application for an injunction was unsuccessful and TOT is appealing. The trial took place in September 2018 and in January 2020 judgement was handed down in Vodafone\u2019s favour. TOT has appealed but is no longer seeking \u20ac500 million from Vodafone Group Plc.\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n29. Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings (continued)\n\nUK\nOn 22 February 2019, IPCom sued Vodafone Group Plc and Vodafone Limited for alleged patent infringement of two patents claimed to be essential to UMTS and LTE network standards. If IPCom could have established that one or more of its patents were valid and infringed, it could have sought an injunction against the UK network if a global licence for the patents was not agreed. The Court ordered expedited trials of the infringement and validity issues. The first was in November 2019 and the second in May 2020. However, after the trial in November 2019 the risk of injunction was removed, and IPCom has given up the second trial listed for May 2020. TOT, which had previously sued Vodafone in Spain, in December 2019 brought a similar claim in the English High Court. Vodafone is challenging jurisdiction.\n\nGermany: Kabel Deutschland takeover - class actions\nThe German courts have been determining the adequacy of the mandatory cash offer made to minority shareholders in Vodafone\u2019s takeover of Kabel Deutschland. Hearings took place in May 2019 and a decision was delivered in November 2019 in Vodafone\u2019s favour, rejecting all claims by minority shareholders. A number of shareholders have appealed.\n\nItaly: British Telecom (Italy) v Vodafone Italy\nThe Italian Competition Authority concluded an investigation in 2007 when Vodafone Italy gave certain undertakings in relation to allegations that it had abused its dominant position in the wholesale market for mobile termination. In 2010, British Telecom (Italy) brought a civil damages claim against Vodafone Italy on the basis of the Competition Authority\u2019s investigation and Vodafone Italy\u2019s undertakings. British Telecom (Italy) sought damages in the amount of \u20ac280 million for abuse of dominant position by Vodafone Italy in the wholesale fixed to mobile termination market for the period from 1999 to 2007. A court appointed expert delivered an opinion to the Court that the range of damages in the case should be in the region of \u20ac10 million to \u20ac25 million which was reduced in a further supplementary report published in September 2014 to a range of \u20ac8 million to \u20ac11 million. Judgement was handed down by the court in August 2015, awarding \u20ac12 million (including interest) to British Telecom (Italy).\n\nBritish Telecom (Italy) appealed the amount of the damages to the Court of Appeal of Milan. In addition, British Telecom (Italy) has asked again for a reference to the European Court of Justice for an interpretation of the European community law on antitrust damages. Vodafone Italy also filed an appeal which was successful. British Telecom (Italy) was ordered to repay to Vodafone Italy the \u20ac12 million with interest and legal costs. British Telecom (Italy) filed an appeal to the Supreme Court in September 2018. A decision is not expected for several years.\n\nItaly: Telecom Italia v Vodafone Italy (TeleTu)\nTelecom Italia brought civil claims against Vodafone Italy in relation to TeleTu\u2019s alleged anti-competitive retention of customers. Telecom Italia seeks damages in the amount of \u20ac101 million. The Court decided on 9 June 2015 to appoint an expert to verify whether TeleTu has put in place anticompetitive retention activities. The expert prepared a draft report with a range of damages from \u20acnil - \u20ac9 million. Vodafone filed its defences in December 2019 and a decision is expected during 2020.\n\nItaly: Iliad v Vodafone Italy\nIn August 2019, Iliad filed a claim for \u20ac500 million against Vodafone Italy in the Civil Court of Milan. The claim alleges anti-competitive behaviour in relation to portability and certain advertising campaigns by Vodafone Italy. Two preliminary hearings have taken place, with two more scheduled for April but now postponed to May 2020.\n\nItalian competition regulator\nOn 15 February 2018, the Italian competition regulator (AGCM) started proceedings against TIM, Fastweb, Wind/3 and the national telecom industry association (Asstel) as well as Vodafone Italy, alleging that the Italian telecoms operators shared competitively sensitive information and coordinated their initiatives in relation to their responses to a legislative change requiring them to switch from 28-day to monthly billing cycles. The telecom operators submitted their written responses to the AGCM\u2019s Statement of Objections, denying all allegations. On 31 January 2020 the AGCM issued its decision, imposing fines totalling \u20ac229 million against the operators, including \u20ac60 million against Vodafone Italy. Vodafone Italy is appealing this decision.\n\nGreece: Papistas Holdings SA, Mobile Trade Stores (formerly Papistas SA) and Athanasios and Loukia Papistas v Vodafone Greece, Vodafone Group Plc and certain Directors and Officers of Vodafone\nIn December 2013, Mr. and Mrs. Papistas, and companies owned or controlled by them, brought three claims in the Greek court in Athens against Vodafone Greece, Vodafone Group Plc and certain Directors and officers of Vodafone Greece and Vodafone Group Plc for purported damage caused by the alleged abuse of dominance and wrongful termination of a franchise arrangement with a Papistas company. Approximately \u20ac1.0 billion of the claim was directed exclusively at two former Directors of Vodafone. The balance of the claim (approximately \u20ac285.5 million) was sought from Vodafone Greece and Vodafone Group Plc on a joint and several basis. Both cases were adjourned to a hearing in September 2018, at which the plaintiffs withdrew all of their claims against Vodafone and its Directors. On 31 December 2018, the plaintiff filed a new, much lower value claim against Vodafone Greece, dropping the individual Directors and Vodafone Group Plc as defendants. On 5 April 2019, Mr Papistas withdrew this latest lawsuit, but in October 2019 filed several new cases against Vodafone Greece with a total value of approximately \u20ac330 million. Vodafone filed a counter claim and all claims were heard in February 2020, although Mr Papistas did not make the stamp duty payments required by the Court to have his case considered.\n\nNetherlands: Consumer credit/handset case\nIn February 2016, the Dutch Supreme Court ruled on the Dutch implementation of the EU Consumer Credit Directive and \u201cinstallment sales agreements\u201d (a Dutch law concept), holding that bundled \u201call-in\u201d mobile subscription agreements (i.e. device along with mobile services) are considered consumer credit agreements. As a result, VodafoneZiggo, together with the industry, has been working with the Ministry of Finance and the Competition Authority on compliance requirements going forward for such offers. The ruling also has retrospective effect.\nA number of small claims were submitted by individual customers in the small claims courts. On 15 February 2018, Consumentenbond (a claims agency) initiated collective claim proceedings against VodafoneZiggo, Tele2, T-Mobile and now KPN. A preliminary understanding has been reached with the claims agency and the Dutch Consumer Federation, to be finalised during 2020. As a result, the collective claim proceedings against VodafoneZiggo have been withdrawn.\n\n**UK: Phones 4U in Administration v Vodafone Limited and Vodafone Group Plc and Others**\n\nIn December 2018 the administrators of former UK indirect seller Phones 4U sued the three main UK mobile network operators (MNOs), including Vodafone, and their parent companies. The administrators allege a conspiracy between the MNOs to pull their business from Phones 4U thereby causing its collapse. The value of the claim is not pleaded but we understand it to be the total value of the business, possibly around \u00a31 billion. Vodafone\u2019s alleged share of the liability is also not pleaded. Vodafone filed its defence on 18 April 2019, along with several other defendants, and the Administrators filed their Replies in October 2019. A case management hearing took place in March 2020, with another one scheduled for June 2020.\n\n### 30. Related party transactions\n\nThe Group has a number of related parties including joint arrangements and associates, pension schemes and Directors and Executive Committee members (see note 12 \u201cInvestments in associates and joint arrangements\u201d, note 25 \u201cPost employment benefits\u201d and note 23 \u201cDirectors and key management compensation\u201d).\n\n#### Transactions with joint arrangements and associates\n\nRelated party transactions with the Group\u2019s joint arrangements and associates primarily comprise fees for the use of products and services including network airtime and access charges, fees for the provision of network infrastructure and cash pooling arrangements. No related party transactions have been entered into during the year which might reasonably affect any decisions made by the users of these consolidated financial statements except as disclosed below.\n\n| Description | 2020 \u20acm | 2019 \u20acm | 2018 \u20acm |\n|-------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Sales of goods and services to associates | 32 | 27 | 19 |\n| Purchase of goods and services from associates | 4 | 3 | 1 |\n| Sales of goods and services to joint arrangements | 305 | 242 | 194 |\n| Purchase of goods and services from joint arrangements | 97 | 192 | 199 |\n| Net interest income receivable from joint arrangements | 71 | 96 | 120 |\n\n**Trade balances owed:**\n\n- by associates: 4 | 1 | 4\n- to associates: 4 | 3 | 2\n- by joint arrangements: 157 | 193 | 107\n- to joint arrangements: 37 | 25 | 28\n- Other balances owed by joint arrangements: 1,083 | 997 | 1,328\n- Other balances owed to joint arrangements: 2,017 | 169 | 150\n\n**Notes:**\n\n1. Amounts arise primarily through VodafoneZiggo, Vodafone Hutchison Australia and Inwit S.p.A. Interest is paid in line with market rates.\n2. Amounts for the year ended 31 March 2020 are primarily in relation to leases of tower space from INWIT S.p.A.\n\nDividends received from associates and joint ventures are disclosed in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\n#### Transactions with Directors other than compensation\n\nDuring the three years ended 31 March 2020, and as of 28 May 2020, no Director nor any other executive officer, nor any associate of any Director or any other executive officer, was indebted to the Company. During the three years ended 31 March 2020 and as of 28 May 2020, the Company has not been a party to any other material transaction, or proposed transactions, in which any member of the key management personnel (including Directors, any other executive officer, senior manager, any spouse or relative of any of the foregoing or any relative of such spouse) had or was to have a direct or indirect material interest.\n\n### 31. Subsequent events\n\n#### Accelerated payment to Vodafone Idea\n\nOn 22 April 2020, the Group announced that it had accelerated a payment of US $200 million to Vodafone Idea, which was due in September 2020 under the terms of the contingent liability mechanism (CLM) with Vodafone Idea. See note 29 \u201cContingent liabilities and legal proceedings\u201d for further details.\n\n#### INWIT - Sale of shares\n\nOn 27 April 2020, the Group completed the sale of equity shares in Infrastrutture Wireless Italiane S.p.A. (INWIT), equivalent to 4.3% of INWIT\u2019s share capital, for \u20ac400 million. The Group continues to hold 33.2% of INWIT\u2019s equity shares and INWIT continues to be a joint venture of the Group.\n32. IAS 18 basis primary statements\n\nThe Group did not restate comparative periods on adoption of IFRS 15 on 1 April 2018; therefore, this note provides information about the Group\u2019s revenue accounting policy under the previous accounting rules as applied in the year ended 31 March 2018.\n\nRevenue accounting policy under IAS 18\n\nRevenue is recognised to the extent the Group has delivered goods or rendered services under an agreement, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable, exclusive of sales taxes and discounts.\n\nThe Group principally obtains revenue from providing mobile and fixed telecommunication services including: access charges, voice and video calls, messaging, interconnect fees, fixed and mobile broadband and related services such as providing televsional and music content, connection fees and equipment sales. Products and services may be sold separately or in bundled packages.\n\nRevenue for access charges, voice and video calls, messaging and fixed and mobile broadband provided to contract customers is recognised as services are performed, with unbilled revenue resulting from services already provided accrued at the end of each period and unearned revenue from services to be provided in future periods deferred. Revenue from the sale of prepaid credit is deferred until such time as the customer uses the airtime, or the credit expires.\n\nRevenue from interconnect fees is recognised at the time the services are performed.\n\nRevenue for the provision of televsional and music content is recognised when or as the Group performs the related service and, depending on the nature of the service, is recognised either at the gross amount billed to the customer or the amount receivable by the Group as commission for facilitating the service.\n\nCustomer connection revenue is recognised together with the related equipment revenue to the extent that the aggregate equipment and connection revenue does not exceed the fair value of the equipment delivered to the customer. Any customer connection revenue not recognised, together with any related excess equipment revenue, is deferred and recognised over the period in which services are expected to be provided to the customer.\n\nRevenue for device sales is recognised when the device is delivered to the end customer and the significant risks and rewards of ownership have transferred. For device sales made to intermediaries, revenue is recognised if the significant risks associated with the device are transferred to the intermediary and the intermediary has no general right to return the device to receive a refund. If the significant risks are not transferred, revenue recognition is deferred until sale of the device to an end customer by the intermediary or the expiry of any right of return.\n\nIn revenue arrangements including more than one deliverable, the arrangements are divided into separate units of accounting. Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting if the following two conditions are met: (i) the deliverable has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis and (ii) there is evidence of the fair value of the item. The arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting based on its relative fair value. The Group generally determines the fair value of individual elements based on prices at which the deliverable is regularly sold on a stand-alone basis after considering any appropriate volume discounts. Revenue allocated to deliverables is restricted to the amount that is receivable without the delivery of additional goods or services. This restriction typically applies to revenue recognised for devices provided to customers, including handsets.\n\nContract-related costs\n\nIntermediaries are given cash incentives by the Group to connect new customers and upgrade existing customers.\n\nFor intermediaries who do not purchase products and services from the Group, such cash incentives are accounted for as an expense. Such cash incentives to other intermediaries are also accounted for as an expense if:\n\n- the Group receives an identifiable benefit in exchange for the cash incentive that is separable from sales transactions to that intermediary, and\n- the Group can reliably estimate the fair value of that benefit.\n\nCash incentives that do not meet these criteria are recognised as a reduction of the related revenue.\n\nCritical accounting judgements applied in the recognition of revenue under IAS 18\n\nGross versus net presentation\n\nWhen the Group sells goods or services as a principal, income and payments to suppliers are reported on a gross basis in revenue and operating costs. If the Group sells goods or services as an agent, revenue and payments to suppliers are recorded in revenue on a net basis, representing the margin earned. Whether the Group is considered to be the principal or an agent in the transaction depends on analysis by management of both the legal form and substance of the agreement between the Group and its business partners; such judgements impact the amount of reported revenue and operating expenses but do not impact reported assets, liabilities or cash flows.\n33. Related undertakings\n\nA full list of all of our subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associated undertakings is detailed below.\n\nA full list of subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associated undertakings (as defined in the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008) as at 31 March 2020 is detailed below. No subsidiaries are excluded from the Group consolidation. Unless otherwise stated the Company\u2019s subsidiaries all have share capital consisting solely of ordinary shares and are indirectly held. The percentage held by Group companies reflect both the proportion of nominal capital and voting rights unless otherwise stated.\n\nSubsidiaries\n\nAccounting policies\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Company. Control is achieved where the Company has existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the activities that affect the Company\u2019s returns and exposure or rights to variable returns from the entity. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by the Group. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group\u2019s equity therein. Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the non-controlling shareholder\u2019s share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.\n\n| Company name | % of share class held by Group | Companies | Share class |\n|--------------|-------------------------------|-----------|-------------|\n| Albania      |                               |           |             |\n| Autostrada Tirane-Durre, Rruga: \u201cPavaresia\u201d, Nr 61, Kashar, Tirana, Albania | Vodafone Albania S.A. | 99.94 | Ordinary shares |\n| Angola       |                               |           |             |\n| Rua Fernao de Sousa, Condominio do Benga, 10A, Vila Alce, Luanda, Angola | Vodafone Business Angola Limited | 59.89 | Ordinary shares |\n| Argentina    |                               |           |             |\n| Cerrito 348, 5 to B, C1030AAH, Buenos Aires, Argentina | OYKON S.A. | 100.00 | Ordinary shares |\n| Australia    |                               |           |             |\n| Level 1, 177 Pacific Highway, North Sydney NSW 2060, Australia | Telkaid Australia Pty Limited | 100.00 | Ordinary shares |\n| Mills Oakley, Level 7, 151 Clarence Street, Sydney NSW 2000, Australia | Vodafone Enterprise Australia Pty Limited | 100.00 | Ordinary shares |\n| Austria      |                               |           |             |\n| c/o Stolltola & Partner Rechtsanw\u00e4lte OG, K\u00e4mmerer Ring 12, 3, Stock, 1030, Wien, Austria | Vodafone Enterprise Austria GmbH | 100.00 | Ordinary shares |\n| Bahrain      |                               |           |             |\n| RSM Bahrain, 3rd floor Falcon Tower, Diplomatic Area, Manama, PO BOX 11816, Bahrain | Vodafone Enterprise Bahrain WLL | 100.00 | Ordinary shares |\n| Belgium      |                               |           |             |\n| Malza House, rue Archim\u00e8de 25, 1000 Bruxelles, Belgium | Vodafone Belgium SA/NV | 100.00 | Ordinary shares |\n| Brazil       |                               |           |             |\n| Avenida Cidade Jardim, 400, 7th and 20th Floors, Jardim Paulistano, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, 01454-000 | Vodafone Servi\u00e7os Empresariais Brasil | 100.00 | Ordinary shares |\n| Av Jos\u00e9 Rocha Bonfim, 234, Cond Pra\u00e7a Capital \u2013 Edificio Toronto, s/n 228/229 13080-900 Jardim Santa Genebra \u2013 Campinas, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil | Cola do Brasil Servi\u00e7os de Telefonia Ltda (in process of dissolution) | 70.00 | Ordinary shares |\n| Bulgaria     |                               |           |             |\n| 10 Tsar Osloboditel Blvd., 3rd Floor, Spredets Region, Sofia, 1000, Bulgaria | Vodafone Enterprise Bulgaria EOOD | 100.00 | Ordinary shares |\n| Cameroon     |                               |           |             |\n| Porta 2014 Jema Etage Entree C, Immeuble SOCAR, Boulevard de la Libert\u00e9, Alkma, Douala, Cameroon | Vodafone Cameroon SA | 62.50 | Ordinary shares |\n| Canada       |                               |           |             |\n| 3280 Bloor Street West, Suite 1140, 11 Floor, Centre Tower, Toronto ON M8X 2X3, Canada | Vodafone Canada Inc | 100.00 | Common shares |\n| Cayman Islands |                             |           |             |\n| 150 Elgin Avenue, George Town, Grand Cayman, KY1-9005, Cayman Islands | CEP Investments (Kolding) Limited | 100.00 | Ordinary shares |\n| Chile        |                               |           |             |\n| 222 Miraflores, P. 28, Santiago, Metrop, 97-763, Chile | Vodafone Enterprise Chile S.A. | 100.00 | Ordinary shares |\n| China        |                               |           |             |\n| Building 21, 11, Kangding St., BDA, Beijing, 100176 \u2013 China, China | Vodafone Automotive Technologies (Beijing) Co., Ltd | 100.00 | Ordinary shares |\n| Level 9, Tower 2, China Central Place, Room 940, No.79 Jianguo Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100025, China | Vodafone China Limited (China) (in process of dissolution) | 100.00 | Equity interest shares |\n| Congo, The Democratic Republic of the |                             |           |             |\n| 292 Avenue de La Justice, Commune de la Gombe, Kinshasa, Congo | Vodafone Congo (ROC)SA | 30.85 | Ordinary shares |\n| Cyprus       |                               |           |             |\n| All Rza Efendi Caddei No:33/A Ortak\u00f6y, Lefkosa, Cyprus | Vodafone Mobile Operations Limited | 100.00 | Ordinary shares |\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\nCzech Republic\n\nn\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed Jankovich 2, Prague 5, Czech Republic, 155 00, Czech Republic\n\nOcelar Metal S.R.O. 100.00 Ordinary shares\nNadace Vodafone \u010cesk\u00e1 Republika 100.00 Trustee\nVodafone Czech Republic AS 100.00 Ordinary shares\nVodafone Enterprise Europe UK Limited - Czech Branch 1\n\nPrague 4, Nuslic, Z\u00e1v\u011btov\u00e1 502/5, 14000, Czech Republic\n\nUPC \u010cesk\u00e1 republika, s.r.o.

These reserves are not distributable.\n2. Own shares relate to treasury shares which are purchased out of distributable profits and therefore reduce reserves available for distribution.\n3. The Company has determined what is realised and unrealised in accordance with the guidance provided by ICAEW TECH 02/17BL and the requirements of UK law. In accordance with UK Companies Act 2006 s831(2), a public company may make a distribution only if, after giving effect to such distribution, the amount of its net assets is not less than the aggregate of its called up share capital and non-distributable reserves.\n4. Includes the reissue of 799.1 million (\u20ac1,742 million) in February 2019 in order to satisfy the second tranche of the mandatory convertible bond.\n5. Includes the equity component of the mandatory convertible bonds which are compound instruments issued in the year.\n6. Includes \u20acnil tax credit (2019: \u20ac4 million credit).\n7. This represents the irrevocable and non-discretionary share buyback programme announced on 28 January 2019.\n8. Includes the impact of the Company\u2019s cash flow hedges with \u20ac4,113 million net gain deferred to other comprehensive income during the year (2019: \u20ac1,555 million net gain; 2018: \u20ac1,811 million net loss) and \u20ac408 million net gain (2019: \u20ac1,279 million net gain; 2018: \u20ac1,460 million net loss) recycled to the income statement. These hedges primarily relate to foreign exchange exposure on fixed borrowings, with interest cash flows unwinding to the income statement over the life of the hedges and any foreign exchange on nominal balances impacting income statement at maturity (up to 2059). See note 22 \u201cCapital and financial risk management\u201d for further details.\nNotes to the Company financial statements\n\n1. Basis of preparation\n\nThe separate financial statements of the Company are drawn up in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and Financial Reporting Standard 101 \u201cReduced disclosure framework\u201d. (FRS 101). The Company will continue to prepare its financial statements in accordance with FRS 101 on an ongoing basis until such time as it notifies shareholders of any change to its chosen accounting framework.\n\nThe Company financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and financial liabilities and in accordance with the UK Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.\n\nThe following exemptions available under FRS 101 have been applied:\n\n- Paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2, \u201cShared-based payment\u201d (details of the number and weighted-average exercise prices of share options, and how the fair value of goods or services received was determined);\n- IFRS 7 \u201cFinancial Instruments: Disclosures\u201d;\n- Paragraph 91 to 99 of IFRS 13, \u201cFair value measurement\u201d (disclosure of valuation techniques and inputs used for fair value measurement of assets and liabilities);\n- Paragraph 38 of IAS 1 \u201cPresentation of financial statements\u201d comparative information requirements in respect of paragraph 79(a)(iv) of IAS 1;\n- The following paragraphs of IAS 1 \u201cPresentation of financial statements\u201d:\n  - 10(d) (statement of cash flows);\n  - 16 (statement of compliance with all IFRS);\n  - 38A (requirement for minimum of two primary statements, including cash flow statements);\n  - 38B-D (additional comparative information);\n  - 40A-D (requirements for a third statement of financial position);\n  - 111 (cash flow statement information); and\n  - 134-136 (capital management disclosures).\n- IAS 7 \u201cStatement of cash flows\u201d;\n- Paragraph 30 and 31 of IAS 8 \u201cAccounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors\u201d (requirement for the disclosure of information when an entity has not applied a new IFRS that has been issued but is not yet effective);\n- The requirements in IAS 24 \u201cRelated party disclosures\u201d to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group;\n- The requirements in IAS 36 to disclose valuation technique and assumptions used in determining recoverable amount.\n\nAs permitted by section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006, the income statement of the Company is not presented in this Annual Report. These separate financial statements are not intended to give a true and fair view of the profit or loss or cash flows of the Company. The Company has not published its individual cash flow statement as its liquidity, solvency and financial adaptability are dependent on the Group rather than its own cash flows.\n\nCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nThe preparation of Company financial statements in conformity with FRS 101 requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Company financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. The key area of judgement that has the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is the review for impairment of investment carrying values.\n\nSignificant accounting policies applied in the current reporting period that relate to the financial statements as a whole\n\nForeign currencies\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional rate of currency prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the Company\u2019s functional currency at the rates prevailing on the reporting period date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the initial transaction dates. Non-monetary items measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in the income statement for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in the income statement for the period.\n\nBorrowing costs\n\nAll borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.\nNotes to the Company financial statements (continued)\n\n1. Basis of preparation (continued)\n\nTaxation\nCurrent tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date.\n\nDeferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences that exist at the reporting period date and that result in an obligation to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax in the future. The deferred tax is measured at the rate expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse, based on the tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting period date. Temporary differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the Company financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.\n\nFinancial instruments\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities, in respect of financial instruments, are recognised on the Company statement of financial position when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities and includes no obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets. The accounting policies adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.\n\nDerivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\nThe Company\u2019s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates which it manages using derivative financial instruments.\n\nThe use of derivative financial instruments is governed by the Group\u2019s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of derivative financial instruments consistent with the Group\u2019s risk management strategy. Changes in values of all derivative financial instruments are included within the income statement unless designated in an effective cash flow hedge relationship when changes in value are deferred to other comprehensive income or equity respectively. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. The Company designates certain derivatives as hedges of the change of fair value of recognised assets and liabilities (\u2018fair value hedges\u2019) or hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or hedges of foreign currency or interest rate risks of firm commitments (\u2018cash flow hedges\u2019). Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.\n\nFair value hedges\nThe Company\u2019s policy is to use derivative financial instruments (primarily interest rate swaps) to convert a proportion of its fixed rate debt to floating rates in order to hedge the interest rate risk arising, principally, from capital market borrowings. The Company designates these as fair value hedges of interest rate risk with changes in fair value of the hedging instrument recognised in the income statement for the period together with the changes in the fair value of the hedged item due to the hedged risk, to the extent the hedge is effective. Gains and losses relating to any ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nCash flow hedges\nCash flow hedging is used by the Company to hedge certain exposures to variability in future cash flows. The portion of gains or losses relating to changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as effective cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income; gains or losses relating to any ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the income statement. However, when the hedged transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability. When the hedged item is recognised in the income statement, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity for the hedging instrument are reclassified to the income statement. When hedge accounting is discontinued, any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income at that time remains in equity and is recognised in the income statement when the hedged transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nPensions\nThe Company is the sponsoring employer of the Vodafone Group UK Pension Scheme, a defined benefit pension scheme. There is insufficient information available to enable the scheme to be accounted for as a defined benefit scheme because the Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis. Therefore, the Company has applied the guidance within IAS 19 to account for defined benefit schemes as if they were defined contribution schemes and recognise only the contribution payable each year. The Company had no contributions payable for the years ended 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2019. The defined benefit scheme is recognised in the financial statements of the participating employers, Vodafone UK Limited and Vodafone Group Services Limited.\n\nNew accounting pronouncements\nTo the extent applicable the Company will adopt new accounting policies as set out in note 1 \u201cBasis of preparation\u201d in the consolidated financial statements.\n2. Fixed assets\n\nAccounting policies\n\nShares in Group undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for impairment and capital related to share-based payments. Contributions in respect of share-based payments are recognised in line with the policy set out in note 7 \u201cShare-based payments\u201d.\n\nThe Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable. If any such indication of impairment exists, the Company makes an estimate of the recoverable amount. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the value of the investment, the investment is considered to be impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nWhere there has been a change in the estimates used to determine recoverable amount and an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, not to exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the cash-generating unit in prior years and an impairment loss reversal is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has developed rapidly in early 2020. Many countries have required businesses to limit or suspend operations and implemented travel restrictions and quarantine measures. The measures taken to contain the virus have adversely affected economic activity and disrupted many businesses. As the outbreak continues to progress and evolve, it is extremely challenging to predict the full extent and duration of its impact on Vodafone\u2019s businesses and the countries where Vodafone operates. Based on information available as at 31 March 2020, management has made additional adjustments to the five-year business plans used in the Group\u2019s impairment testing in order to reflect the estimated impact. This has not resulted in a significant impairment at a Vodafone Group plc level for the investments it holds directly.\n\n| Shares in Group undertakings | 2020 | Restated 2019 |\n|------------------------------|------|--------------|\n| **Cost:**                    |      |              |\n| 1 April                      | 84,812 | 84,767       |\n| Disposals                    | (616) | \u2013            |\n| Capital contributions arising from share-based payments | 136 | 137 |\n| Contributions received in relation to share-based payments | (68) | (92) |\n| **31 March**                 | 84,264 | 84,812       |\n\n**Amounts provided for:**\n\n| 1 April | 1,039 | 1,039 |\n| Eliminated on disposals | (144) | \u2013 |\n| Impairment losses | 15 | \u2013 |\n| Impairment reversals | (112) | \u2013 |\n| **31 March** | 798 | 1,039 |\n\n**Net book value:**\n\n| 31 March | 83,466 | 83,773 |\n\nNote:\n\n1.

Debtors\n\nAccounting policies\nAmounts owed by subsidiaries are classified and recorded at amortised cost and reduced by allowances for expected credit losses. Estimated future credit losses are first recorded on initial recognition of a receivable and are based on estimated probability of default. Individual balances are written off when management deems them not to be collectible. Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value through profit and loss.\n\n| Amounts falling due within one year: | 2020 \u20acm | 2019 \u20acm |\n|-------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Amounts owed by subsidiaries\u00b9      | 224,799 | 242,976 |\n| Taxation recoverable               | 268     | 233     |\n| Other debtors                      | 71      | 32      |\n| Derivative financial instruments   | 681     | 183     |\n| **Total**                          | **225,819** | **243,424** |\n\n| Amounts falling due after more than one year: | 2020 \u20acm | 2019 \u20acm |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Derivative financial instruments             | 8,424   | 3,439   |\n\nNote:\n\u00b9 Amounts owned by subsidiaries are unsecured, have no fixed date of repayment and are repayable on demand with sufficient liquidity in the group to flow funds if required. Therefore expected credit losses are considered to be immaterial.\n\n4.

Creditors\n\nAccounting policies\nCapital market and bank borrowings\nInterest-bearing loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair value (which is equal to cost at inception) and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, except where they are identified as a hedged item in a designated fair value hedge relationship. Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the amount due on settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowing.\n\n| Amounts falling due within one year: | 2020 \u20acm | 2019 \u20acm |\n|-------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Bonds and other loans               | 8,315   | 4,835   |\n| Amounts owed to subsidiaries\u00b9      | 208,258 | 232,896 |\n| Derivative financial instruments   | 559     | 463     |\n| Other creditors                     | 101     | 945     |\n| Accruals and deferred income        | 89      | 66      |\n| **Total**                           | **217,322** | **239,205** |\n\n| Amounts falling due after more than one year: | 2020 \u20acm | 2019 \u20acm |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Deferred tax                                  | 722     | 17      |\n| Bonds                                         | 47,432  | 44,439  |\n| Other loans                                   | 2,297   | 1,769   |\n| Derivative financial instruments              | 4,177   | 1,924   |\n| **Total**                                     | **54,628** | **48,149** |\n\nNote:\n\u00b9 Amounts owed to subsidiaries are unsecured, have no fixed date of repayment and are repayable on demand.\n\nIncluded in amounts falling due after more than one year are bonds of \u20ac33,738 million which are due in more than five years from 1 April 2020 and are payable otherwise than by instalments.

At 31 March 2020 there were 50,000 (2019: 50,000) 7% cumulative fixed rate shares of \u00a31 each in issue.\n2. At 31 March 2020 the Group held 2,043,750,454 (2019: 1,584,882,610) treasury shares with a nominal value of \u20ac340 million (2019: \u20ac264 million). The market value of shares held was \u20ac2,610 million (2019: \u20ac2,566 million). During the year, 49,629,851 (2019: 45,657,750) treasury shares were reissued under Group share schemes. On 25 February 2019, 799,067,749 treasury shares were issued in settlement of tranche 2 of the maturing subordinated mandatory convertible bond. On 5 March 2019 the Group announced the placing of subordinated mandatory convertible bonds totalling \u20ac1.72 billion with a 2 year maturity date in 2021 and \u20ac1.72 billion with a 3 year maturity date due in 2022. The bonds are convertible into a total of 2,684,563,759 ordinary shares with a conversion price of \u20ac1.2814 per share. For further details see note 21 \u201cBorrowings\u201d in the consolidated financial statements.\n3. Represents US share awards and option scheme awards.\n\n7. Share-based payments\n\nAccounting policies\n\nThe Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment plans for the employees of subsidiaries using the Company\u2019s equity instruments. The fair value of the compensation given in respect of these share-based payment plans is recognised as a capital contribution to the Company\u2019s subsidiaries over the vesting period. The capital contribution is reduced by any payments received from subsidiaries in respect of these share-based payments.\n\nThe Company currently uses a number of equity-settled share plans to grant options and shares to the Directors and employees of its subsidiaries.\n\nAt 31 March 2020, the Company had 53 million ordinary share options outstanding (2019: 46 million).\n\nThe Company has made capital contributions to its subsidiaries in relation to share-based payments. At 31 March 2020, the cumulative capital contribution net of payments received from subsidiaries was \u20ac169 million (2019: \u20ac101 million). During the year ended 31 March 2020, the total capital contribution arising from share-based payments was \u20ac136 million (2019: \u20ac137 million), with payments of \u20ac68 million (2019: \u20ac92 million) received from subsidiaries.\n\nFull details of share-based payments, share option schemes and share plans are disclosed in note 26 \u201cShare-based payments\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n8. Reserves\n\nThe Board is responsible for the Group\u2019s capital management including the approval of dividends. This includes an assessment of both the level of reserves legally available for distribution and consideration as to whether the Company would be solvent and retain sufficient liquidity following any proposed distribution.\n\nAs Vodafone Group Plc is a Group holding company with no direct operations, its ability to make shareholder distributions is dependent on its ability to receive funds for such purposes from its subsidiaries in a manner which creates profits available for distribution for the Company. The major factors that impact the ability of the Company to access profits held in subsidiary companies at an appropriate level to fulfil its needs for distributable reserves on an ongoing basis include:\n\n- the absolute size of the profit pools either currently available for distribution or capable of realisation into distributable reserves in the relevant entities;\n- the location of these entities in the Group\u2019s corporate structure;\n- profit and cash flow generation in those entities; and\n- the risk of adverse changes in business valuations giving rise to investment impairment charges, reducing profits available for distribution.\n\nThe Group\u2019s consolidated reserves set out on page 143 do not reflect the profits available for distribution in the Group.\n9. Equity dividends\n\nAccounting policies\nDividends paid and received are included in the Company financial statements in the period in which the related dividends are actually paid or received or, in respect of the Company\u2019s final dividend for the year, approved by shareholders.\n\n|                          | 2020 (\u20acm) | 2019 (\u20acm) |\n|--------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Declared during the financial year: |           |           |\n| Final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2019: 4.16 eurocents per share (2018: 10.23 eurocents per share, 2017: 10.03 eurocents per share) | 1,112 | 2,729 |\n| Interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2020: 4.50 eurocents per share (2019: 4.84 eurocents per share, 2018: 4.84 eurocents per share) | 1,205 | 1,293 |\n| **Total** | **2,317** | **4,022** |\n\nProposed after the balance sheet date and not recognised as a liability:\n\n|                          | 2020 (\u20acm) | 2019 (\u20acm) |\n|--------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2020: 4.50 eurocents per share (2019: 4.16 eurocents per share, 2018: 10.23 eurocents per share) | 1,205 | 1,112 |\n\n10. Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings\n\nOther guarantees and contingent liabilities\nOther guarantees principally comprise the Company\u2019s guarantee of the Group\u2019s 50% share of an AUD1.7 billion loan facility and a US$3.5 billion loan facility of its joint venture, Vodafone Hutchison Australia Pty Limited, and the guarantee of \u20ac1.9 billion of subsidiary spectrum payments.\n\nThe Company will guarantee the debts and liabilities of certain of its UK subsidiaries at the balance sheet date in accordance with section 479C of the Companies Act 2006. The Company has assessed the probability of loss under these guarantees as remote.\n\nAs detailed in note 25 \u201cPost employment benefits\u201d to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is the sponsor of the Group\u2019s main defined benefit scheme in the UK, being the Vodafone Group UK Pension Scheme (\u2018Vodafone UK plan\u2019). The results, assets and liabilities associated with the Vodafone UK plan are recognised in the financial statements of Vodafone UK Limited and Vodafone Group Services Limited.\n\nAs detailed in note 29 \u201cContingent liabilities and legal proceedings\u201d to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has covenanted to provide security on the Group\u2019s performance bonds and also in favour of the trustee of the Vodafone Group UK Pension Scheme and the Trustees of THUS Plc Group Scheme.\n\nLegal proceedings\nDetails regarding certain legal actions which involve the Company are set out in note 29 \u201cContingent liabilities and legal proceedings\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n11. Other matters\n\nThe auditor\u2019s remuneration for the current year in respect of audit and audit-related services was \u20ac3.6 million (2019: \u20ac2.4 million) and for non-audit services was \u20ac1.0 million (2019: \u20ac0.4 million).\n\nThe Directors are remunerated by the Company for their services to the Group as a whole. No remuneration was paid to them specifically in respect of their services to Vodafone Group Plc for either year. Full details of the Directors\u2019 remuneration are disclosed in the \u201cAnnual Report on Remuneration\u201d on pages 96 to 120.\n\nThe Company had two (2019: two) employees throughout the year.\n\nVodafone Group Plc is incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales (registration number 1833679). The registered address of the Company is Vodafone House, The Connection, Newbury, Berkshire, RG14 2FN, England.\nAlternative performance measures\n\nIn the discussion of the Group\u2019s reported operating results, alternative performance measures are presented to provide readers with additional financial information that is regularly reviewed by management. However, this additional information presented is not uniformly defined by all companies including those in the Group\u2019s industry. Accordingly, it may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures by other companies. Additionally, certain information presented is derived from amounts calculated in accordance with IFRS but is not itself an expressly permitted GAAP measure. Such measures should not be viewed in isolation or as an alternative to the equivalent GAAP measure.\n\nService revenue\n\nService revenue comprises all revenue related to the provision of ongoing services including, but not limited to, monthly access charges, airtime usage, roaming, incoming and outgoing network usage by non-Vodafone customers and interconnect charges for incoming calls. We believe that it is both useful and necessary to report this measure for the following reasons:\n\n- It is used for internal performance reporting;\n- It is used in setting Director and management remuneration; and\n- It is useful in connection with discussion with the investment community.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\nWe use adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with other GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted EBIT, adjusted operating profit, operating profit and net profit, to assess our operating performance. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is an operating performance measure, not a liquidity measure, as it includes non-cash changes in working capital and is reviewed by the Chief Executive to assess internal performance in conjunction with adjusted EBITDA margin, which is an alternative sales margin figure. We believe it is both useful and necessary to report adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure as it enhances the comparability of profit across segments.\n\nBecause adjusted EBITDA does not take into account certain items that affect operations and performance, adjusted EBITDA has inherent limitations as a performance measure. To compensate for these limitations, we analyse adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with other GAAP and non-GAAP operating performance measures. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a GAAP measure of operating performance.\n\nRevised definition of adjusted EBITDA\n\nFor the year ended 31 March 2020, a revised definition for adjusted EBITDA has been applied, as follows: operating profit after depreciation on lease-related right of use assets and interest on leases but excluding depreciation, amortisation and gains/losses on disposal for owned fixed assets and excluding share of results in associates and joint ventures, impairment losses, restructuring costs arising from discrete restructuring plans, other operating income and expense and significant items that are not considered by management to be reflective of the underlying performance of the Group.\n\nFor the year ended 31 March 2019, adjusted EBITDA is operating profit excluding share of results in associates and joint ventures, depreciation and amortisation, gains/losses on the disposal of fixed assets, impairment losses, restructuring costs arising from discrete restructuring plans, other operating income and expense and significant items that are not considered by management to be reflective of the underlying performance of the Group.\n\nGroup adjusted EBIT, adjusted operating profit, adjusted net financing costs and adjusted earnings per share\n\nGroup adjusted EBIT and adjusted operating profit exclude impairment losses, restructuring costs arising from discrete restructuring plans, amortisation of customer bases and brand intangible assets, other operating income and expense and other significant one-off items. Adjusted EBIT also excludes the share of results in associates and joint ventures. Adjusted net financing costs exclude mark to market and foreign exchange gains/losses and interest on lease liabilities. Adjusted earnings per share reflects the exclusions of adjusted EBIT and adjusted net financing costs, together with related tax effects.\n\nWe believe that it is both useful and necessary to report these measures for the following reasons:\n\n- These measures are used for internal performance reporting;\n- These measures are used in setting Director and management remuneration; and\n- They are useful in connection with discussion with the investment community and debt rating agencies.\nAlternative performance measures (continued)\n\nCash flow measures\n\nIn presenting and discussing our reported results, free cash flow (pre-spectrum), free cash flow and operating free cash flow are calculated and presented even though these measures are not recognised within IFRS. We believe that it is both useful and necessary to communicate free cash flow to investors and other interested parties, for the following reasons:\n\n- Free cash flow (pre-spectrum) and free cash flow allows us and external parties to evaluate our liquidity and the cash generated by our operations. Free cash flow (pre-spectrum) and capital additions do not include payments for licences and spectrum included within intangible assets, items determined independently of the ongoing business, such as the level of dividends, and items which are deemed discretionary, such as cash flows relating to acquisitions and disposals or financing activities. In addition, it does not necessarily reflect the amounts which we have an obligation to incur. However, it does reflect the cash available for such discretionary activities, to strengthen the consolidated statement of financial position or to provide returns to shareholders in the form of dividends or share purchases;\n\n- Free cash flow facilitates comparability of results with other companies, although our measure of free cash flow may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies;\n\n- These measures are used by management for planning, reporting and incentive purposes; and\n\nThese measures are useful in connection with discussion with the investment community and debt rating agencies.\n\nA reconciliation of cash generated by operations, the closest equivalent GAAP measure, to operating free cash flow, free cash flow (pre-spectrum) and free cash flow, is provided below.\n\n|                                | 2020  | 2019  | 2018  |\n|--------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Cash generated by operations (refer to note 18) | 18,309 | 14,182 | 13,860 |\n| Capital additions              | (7,411) | (7,227) | (7,321) |\n| Working capital movement in respect of capital additions | (11) | (89) | 171 |\n| Disposal of property, plant and equipment | 41 | 45 | 41 |\n| Restructuring payments         | 570 | 195 | 250 |\n| Other                          | (3,777) | (35) | \u2014     |\n| **Operating free cash flow**   | 7,721 | 7,071 | 7,001 |\n| Taxation                       | (930) | (1,040) | (1,010) |\n| Dividends received from associates and investments | 417 | 498 | 489 |\n| Dividends paid to non-controlling shareholders in subsidiaries | (348) | (584) | (310) |\n| Interest received and paid     | (1,160) | (502) | (753) |\n| **Free cash flow (pre-spectrum)** | 5,700 | 5,443 | 5,417 |\n| Licence and spectrum payments  | (181) | (837) | (1,123) |\n| Restructuring payments         | (570) | (195) | (250) |\n| **Free cash flow**             | 4,949 | 4,411 | 4,044 |\n\nOther\n\nCertain of the statements within the Strategic Report contains forward-looking alternative performance measures for which at this time there is no comparable GAAP measure and which at this time cannot be quantitatively reconciled to comparable GAAP financial information. Certain of the statements within the section titled \u201cOutlook\u201d on page 29 contain forward-looking non-GAAP financial information which at this time cannot be quantitatively reconciled to comparable GAAP financial information.\n**Organic growth**\n\nAll amounts in this document marked with an \"*\" represent \u201corganic growth\u201d, which presents performance on a comparable basis in terms of merger and acquisition activity (notably by excluding the disposal of Vodafone New Zealand and the acquired European Liberty Global assets), movements in foreign exchange rates and the impact of the implementation of IFRS 16 \u2018Leases\u2019.\n\nWhilst this measure is not intended to be a substitute for reported growth, nor is it superior to reported growth, we believe that the measure provides useful and necessary information to investors and other interested parties for the following reasons:\n\n- It provides additional information on underlying growth of the business without the effect of certain factors unrelated to its operating performance;\n- It is used for internal performance analysis; and\n- It facilitates comparability of underlying growth with other companies (although the term \u201corganic\u201d is not a defined term under IFRS and may not, therefore, be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies).\n\nWe have not provided a comparative in respect of organic growth rates as the current rates describe the change between the beginning and end of the current period, with such changes being explained by the commentary in this news release. If comparatives were provided, significant sections of the commentary from the news release for prior periods would also need to be included, reducing the usefulness and transparency of this document.\n\nReconciliations of organic growth to reported growth are shown where used or in the tables overleaf.\n\n**Reconciliation between alternative performance measures and closest equivalent

share.\n\nEuro dividends\n\nDividends are declared in euros and paid in euros and pounds sterling according to where the shareholder is resident. Cash dividends to ADS holders are paid by the ADS depositary bank in US dollars. This aligns the Group\u2019s shareholder returns with the primary currency in which we generate free cash flow. The foreign exchange rates at which dividends declared in euros are converted into pounds sterling and US dollars are calculated based on the average exchange rate of the five business days during the week prior to the payment of the dividend.\n\nPayment of dividends by direct credit\n\nWe pay cash dividends directly to shareholders\u2019 bank or building society accounts. This ensures secure delivery and means dividend payments are credited to shareholders\u2019 designated accounts on the same day as payment. A dividend confirmation covering both the interim and final dividends paid during the financial year is sent to shareholders at the time of the interim dividend in February. ADS holders may choose to have their cash dividends paid by cheque from our ADS depositary bank, Deutsche Bank.\n\nDividend reinvestment plan\n\nWe offer a dividend reinvestment plan which allows holders of ordinary shares who choose to participate to use their cash dividends to acquire additional shares in the Company. These are purchased on their behalf by the plan administrator, Computershare Investor Services PLC (Computershare), through a low-cost dealing arrangement. For ADS holders, Deutsche Bank, through its transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC (AST) maintains the DB Global Direct Investor Services Program which is a direct purchase and sale plan for depositary receipts with a dividend reinvestment facility.\n\nSee vodafone.com/dividends for further information about dividend payments or, alternatively please contact our registrar, Computershare or AST for ADS holders as applicable. See page 249 for their contact information.\n\nTaxation of dividends\n\nSee page 253 for details on dividend taxation.\n\nManaging your shares via Investor Centre\n\nOur share Registrar, Computershare, operates a portfolio service, Investor Centre, for investors in ordinary shares. This provides our shareholders with online access to information about their investments as well as a facility to help manage their holdings online, such as being able to:\n\n- update dividend bank mandate instructions and review dividend payment history;\n- update personal details and address changes; and\n- register to receive Company communications electronically.\n\nComputershare also offers an internet and telephone share dealing service to existing shareholders. The service can be obtained at www.investorcentre.co.uk.\n\nShareholders with any queries regarding their holding should contact Computershare. See page 249 for their contact details.\n\nShareholders may also find the investors section of our corporate website, vodafone.com/investor, useful for general queries and information about the Company.\n\nShareholder communications\n\nA growing number of our shareholders have opted to receive communications from us electronically. The use of electronic communications, rather than printed paper documents, means information about the Company can be accessed through emails or the Company\u2019s website, thus reducing our impact on the environment.

Given this uncertainty and the Company\u2019s desire to protect the health and safety of shareholders and employees, the AGM this year will be run as a closed meeting and shareholders will not be able to attend in person. The Company will make arrangements such that the legal requirements to hold the meeting can be satisfied through the attendance of a minimum number of shareholders and the format of the meeting will be purely functional.\nShareGift\nWe support ShareGift, the charity share donation scheme (registered charity number 1052686). Through ShareGift, shareholders who have only a very small number of shares, which might be considered uneconomic to sell, are able to donate them to charity. Donated shares are aggregated and sold by ShareGift with the proceeds being passed on to a wide range of UK charities.\nSee sharegift.org or call +44 (0)20 7930 3737 for further details.\n\nLandmark Financial Asset Search\nWe participate in an online service which provides a search facility for solicitors and probate professionals to quickly and easily trace UK shareholdings relating to deceased estates.

These callers typically make claims of highly profitable investment opportunities which turn out to be worthless or simply do not exist. These approaches are usually made by unauthorised companies and individuals and are commonly known as \u201cboiler room\u201d scams. Investors are advised to be wary of any unsolicited advice or offers to buy shares. If it sounds too good to be true, it often is.\nSee the FCA website at fca.org.uk/scamsmart for more detailed information about this or similar activities.\n\nContact details for Computershare and AST\nThe Registrar\nComputershare Investor Services PLC\nThe Pavilions\nBridgwater Road, Bristol BS99 6ZZ, United Kingdom\nTelephone: +44 (0)370 702 0198\nwww.investorcentre.co.uk/contactus\n\nHolders of ordinary shares resident in Ireland\nComputershare Investor Services (Ireland) Ltd\nPO Box 13042\nTallaght\nDublin 24, Ireland\nTelephone: +353 (0)818 300 999\nwww.investorcentre.co.uk/contactus\n\nADS holders\nAST\nOperations Center\n6201 15th Avenue\nBrooklyn\nNY 11219\nUnited States of America\nTelephone: +1 800 233 5601 (toll free) or, for calls outside the United States: +1 201 806 4103\nwww.astfinancial.com\nEmail: db@astfinancial.com\n\nMarkets\nOrdinary shares of Vodafone Group Plc are traded on the London Stock Exchange and in the form of ADSs on NASDAQ.\nADSs, each representing ten ordinary shares, are traded on NASDAQ under the symbol \u201cVOD\u201d.

At this date, the total number of ADRs outstanding was 387,368,700 and 1,475 holders of ordinary shares had registered addresses in the United States and held a total of approximately 0.008% of the ordinary shares of the Company.\n\nAt 31 March 2020, the following percentage interests in the ordinary share capital of the Company, disclosable under the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules, (DTR 5), have been notified to the Directors.\n\n| Shareholder | Shareholding |\n|-------------|--------------|\n| BlackRock, Inc. | 6.90% |\n| Norges Bank | 3.0004% |\n\nNotes:\n1 The percentage of voting rights detailed above was calculated at the time of the relevant disclosures made in accordance with Rule 5 of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\n2 On 6 February 2020, BlackRock, Inc. disclosed by way of a Schedule 13G filed with the SEC, beneficial ownership of 0.138,593,085 ordinary shares of the Company as of 31 December 2019, representing 8.0% of that class of shares at that date.\n\nThe Company is not aware of any changes in the interests disclosed under DTR 5 between 31 March 2020 and 26 May 2020.\n\nAs far as the Company is aware, between 1 April 2016 and 26 May 2020, no shareholder, other than described above, held 3% or more of the voting rights attributable to the ordinary shares of the Company other than (i) Deutsche Bank, as custodian of our ADR programme, (ii) BlackRock, Inc and Norges Bank (as described above) and (iii) Morgan Stanley, which owned 3.6% of the Company\u2019s ordinary shares at 13 February 2018.\n\nThe rights attaching to the ordinary shares of the Company held by these shareholders are identical in all respects to the rights attaching to all the ordinary shares of the Company. As at 26 May 2020 the Directors are not aware of any other interest of 3% or more in the ordinary share capital of the Company. The Company is not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by any foreign government or any other legal entity. There are no arrangements known to the Company that could result in a change of control of the Company.\nArticles of Association and applicable English law\n\nThe following description summarises certain provisions of the Company\u2019s Articles of Association and applicable English law. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Companies Act 2006 and the Company\u2019s Articles of Association. See \u201cDocuments on display\u201d on page 251 for information on where copies of the Articles of Association can be obtained. The Company is a public limited company under the laws of England and Wales. The Company is registered in England and Wales under the name Vodafone Group Public Limited Company with the registration number 1833679.\n\nAll of the Company\u2019s ordinary shares are fully paid. Accordingly, no further contribution of capital may be required by the Company from the holders of such shares.\n\nEnglish law specifies that any alteration to the Articles of Association must be approved by a special resolution of the Company\u2019s shareholders.\n\nArticles of Association\n\nThe Company\u2019s Articles of Association do not specifically restrict the objects of the Company.\n\nDirectors\n\nThe Directors are empowered under the Articles of Association to exercise all the powers of the Company subject to any restrictions in the Articles of Association, the Companies Act 2006 (as defined in the Articles of Association) and any special resolution.\n\nUnder the Company\u2019s Articles of Association a Director cannot vote in respect of any proposal in which the Director, or any person connected with the Director, has a material interest other than by virtue of the Director\u2019s interest in the Company\u2019s shares or other securities. However, this restriction on voting does not apply in certain circumstances as set out in the Articles of Association.\n\nThe Directors are empowered to exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money, subject to the limitation that the aggregate amount of all liabilities and obligations of the Group outstanding at any time shall not exceed an amount equal to 1.5 times the aggregate of the Group\u2019s share capital and reserves calculated in the manner prescribed in the Articles of Association unless sanctioned by an ordinary resolution of the Company\u2019s shareholders.\n\nAt each AGM all Directors shall offer themselves for re-election in accordance with the Company\u2019s Articles of Association and in the interests of good corporate governance.\n\nDirectors are not required under the Company\u2019s Articles of Association to hold any shares of the Company as a qualification to act as a Director, although the Executive Directors are required to under the Company\u2019s Remuneration Policy. Further details are set out on pages 102 to 107.\n\nRights attaching to the Company\u2019s shares\n\nAt 31 March 2020, the issued share capital of the Company was comprised of 50,000 7% cumulative fixed rate shares of \u00a31.00 each and 26,772,164,544 ordinary shares (excluding treasury shares) of 20 20/21 US cents each. As at 31 March 2020, 2,043,750,434 ordinary shares were held in Treasury.\n\nDividend rights\n\nHolders of 7% cumulative fixed rate shares are entitled to be paid in respect of each financial year, or other accounting period of the Company, a fixed cumulative preferential dividend of 7% p.a. on the nominal value of the fixed rate shares. A fixed cumulative preferential dividend may only be paid out of available distributable profits which the Directors have resolved should be distributed.\n\nThe fixed rate shares do not have any other right to share in the Company\u2019s profits.\n\nHolders of the Company\u2019s ordinary shares may, by ordinary resolution, declare dividends but may not declare dividends in excess of the amount recommended by the Directors. The Board of Directors may also pay interim dividends. No dividend may be paid other than out of profits available for distribution. Dividends on ordinary shares can be paid to shareholders in whatever currency the Directors decide, using an appropriate exchange rate for any currency conversions which are required.\n\nIf a dividend has not been claimed for one year after the date of the resolution passed at a general meeting declaring that dividend or the resolution of the Directors providing for payment of that dividend, the Directors may invest the dividend or use it in some other way for the benefit of the Company until the dividend is claimed. If the dividend remains unclaimed for 12 years after the relevant resolution either declaring that dividend or providing for payment of that dividend, it will be forfeited and belong to the Company.\n\nVoting rights\n\nAt a general meeting of the Company, when voting on substantive resolutions (i.e. any resolution which is not a procedural resolution) each shareholder who is entitled to vote and is present in person or by proxy has one vote for every share held (a poll vote). Procedural resolutions (such as a resolution to adjourn a general meeting or a resolution on the choice of Chairman of a general meeting) shall be decided on a show of hands, where each shareholder who is present at the meeting has one vote regardless of the number of shares held, unless a poll is demanded. Shareholders entitled to vote at general meetings may appoint proxies who are entitled to vote, attend and speak at general meetings.\n\nTwo shareholders present in person or by proxy constitute a quorum for purposes of a general meeting of the Company.\n\nUnder English law, shareholders of a public company such as the Company are not permitted to pass resolutions by written consent. Record holders of the Company\u2019s ADSs are entitled to attend, speak and vote on a poll or a show of hands at any general meeting of the Company\u2019s shareholders by the depositary\u2019s appointment of them as corporate representatives or proxies with respect to the underlying ordinary shares represented by their ADSs. Alternatively, holders of ADSs are entitled to vote by supplying their voting instructions to the depositary or its nominee who will vote the ordinary shares underlying their ADSs in accordance with their instructions.\n\nHolders of the Company\u2019s ADSs are entitled to receive notices of shareholders\u2019 meetings under the terms of the deposit agreement relating to the ADSs.\n\nEmployees who hold shares in a vested nominee share account are able to vote through the respective plan\u2019s trustees. Note there is now a vested share account with Computershare (in respect of shares arising from a SAYE exercise) and EquateX (MyShareBank).\n\nHolders of the Company\u2019s 7% cumulative fixed rate shares are only entitled to vote on any resolution to vary or abrogate the rights attached to the fixed rate shares. Holders have one vote for every fully paid 7% cumulative fixed rate share.\n\nLiquidation rights\n\nIn the event of the liquidation of the Company, after payment of all liabilities and deductions in accordance with English law, the holders of the Company\u2019s 7% cumulative fixed rate shares would be entitled to a sum equal to the capital paid up on such shares, together with certain dividend payments, in priority to holders of the Company\u2019s ordinary shares. The holders of the fixed rate shares do not have any other right to share in the Company\u2019s surplus assets.\nPre-emptive rights and new issues of shares\nUnder section 549 of the Companies Act 2006 Directors are, with certain exceptions, unable to allot the Company\u2019s ordinary shares or securities convertible into the Company\u2019s ordinary shares without the authority of the shareholders in a general meeting. In addition, section 561 of the Companies Act 2006 imposes further restrictions on the issue of equity securities (as defined in the Companies Act 2006 which include the Company\u2019s ordinary shares and securities convertible into ordinary shares) which are, or are to be, paid up wholly in cash and not first offered to existing shareholders. The Company\u2019s Articles of Association allow shareholders to authorise Directors for a period specified in the relevant resolution to allot (i) relevant securities generally up to an amount fixed by the shareholders; and (ii) equity securities for cash other than in connection with a pre-emptive offer up to an amount specified by the shareholders and free of the pre-emption restriction in section 561. At the 2019 AGM the amount of relevant securities fixed by shareholders under (i) above and the amount of equity securities specified by shareholders under (ii) above were in line with the Pre-Eemption Group\u2019s Statement of Principles. Further details of such proposals are provided in the 2020 Notice of AGM.\n\nDisclosure of interests in the Company\u2019s shares\nThere are no provisions in the Articles of Association whereby persons acquiring, holding or disposing of a certain percentage of the Company\u2019s shares are required to make disclosure of their ownership percentage although such requirements exist under the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\n\nGeneral meetings and notices\nSubject to the Articles of Association, AGMs are held at such times and place as determined by the Directors of the Company. The Directors may also, when they think fit, convene other general meetings of the Company. General meetings may also be convened on requisition as provided by the Companies Act 2006.\n\nAn AGM is required to be called on not less than 21 days\u2019 notice in writing. Subject to obtaining shareholder approval on an annual basis, the Company may call other general meetings on 14 days\u2019 notice. The Directors may determine that persons entitled to receive notices of meetings are those persons entered on the register at the close of business on a day determined by the Directors but not later than 21 days before the date the relevant notice is sent. The notice may also specify the record date, the time of which shall be determined in accordance with the Articles of Association and the Companies Act 2006.\n\nUnder section 336 of the Companies Act 2006 the AGM must be held each calendar year and within six months of the Company\u2019s year end.\n\nVariation of rights\nIf at any time the Company\u2019s share capital is divided into different classes of shares, the rights attached to any class may be varied, subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, either with the consent in writing of the holders of three quarters in nominal value of the shares of that class or at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class.\n\nAt every such separate meeting all of the provisions of the Articles of Association relating to proceedings at a general meeting apply, except that (i) the quorum is to be the number of persons (which must be at least two) who hold or represent by proxy not less than one third in nominal value of the issued shares of the class or, if such quorum is not present on an adjourned meeting, one person who holds shares of the class regardless of the number of shares he holds; (ii) any person present in person or by proxy may demand a poll; and (iii) each shareholder will have one vote per share held in that particular class in the event a poll is taken. Class rights are deemed not to have been varied by the creation or issue of new shares ranking equally with or subsequent to that class of shares in sharing in profits or assets of the Company or by a redemption or repurchase of the shares by the Company.\n\nLimitations on transfer, voting and shareholding\nAs far as the Company is aware there are no limitations imposed on the transfer, holding or voting of the Company\u2019s ordinary shares other than those limitations that would generally apply to all of the shareholders, those that apply by law (e.g. due to insider dealing rules) or those that apply as a result of failure to comply with a notice under section 793 of the Companies Act 2006. No shareholder has any securities carrying special rights with regard to control of the Company. The Company is not aware of any agreements between holders of securities that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities.\n\nDocuments on display\nThe Company is subject to the information requirements of the Exchange Act applicable to foreign private issuers. In accordance with these requirements the Company files its Annual Report on Form 20-F and other related documents with the SEC. These documents may be inspected at the SEC\u2019s public reference rooms located at 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549. Information on the operation of the public reference room can be obtained in the United States by calling the SEC on +1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s SEC filings, including all those filed on or after 4 November 2002, are available on the SEC\u2019s website at sec.gov. Shareholders can also obtain copies of the Company\u2019s Articles of Association from our website at vodafone.com/governance or from the Company\u2019s registered office.\nShareholder information (continued)\n\nMaterial contracts\nAt the date of this Annual Report the Group is not party to any contracts that are considered material to its results or operations except for:\n\n- its \u20ac3,860,000,000 and US$ 3,935,000,000 revolving credit facilities which are discussed in note 21 \u201cBorrowings\u201d to the consolidated statements;\n- Contribution and Transfer Agreement dated 31 December 2016, as amended, relating to the contribution and/or transfer of shares in Ziggo Group Holding B.V. and Vodafone Libertel B.V. to Lynx Global Europe II B.V. and the formation of the Netherlands joint venture;\n- the Implementation Agreement dated 20 March 2017, as amended, relating to the combination of the Indian mobile telecommunications businesses of Vodafone Group and Idea Group as detailed in note 27 \u201cAcquisitions and disposals\u201d to the consolidated financial statements;\n- the Implementation Agreement dated 25 April 2018 relating to the combination of the businesses of Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel;\n- the Sale and Purchase Agreement dated 9 May 2018 relating to the purchase of Liberty Global plc\u2019s businesses in Germany, Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic;\n- the Transitional Services Agreement dated 31 July 2019 relating to services and cooperation relating to the sale of Liberty Global plc\u2019s businesses in Germany, Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic;\n- the Sale and Purchase Agreement dated 31 July 2019 relating to the sale of Vodafone New Zealand;\n- the Scheme Implementation Deed dated 30 August 2018 relating to the proposed merger between Vodafone Hutchison Australia Pty Limited and TPG Telecom Limited; and\n- the Deed of Merger dated 31 March 2020 relating to the combination of Vodafone Italy\u2019s towers with INWIT\u2019s passive network infrastructure.\n\nExchange controls\nThere are no UK Government laws, decrees or regulations that restrict or affect the export or import of capital including, but not limited to, foreign exchange controls on remittance of dividends on the ordinary shares or on the conduct of the Group\u2019s operations.\n\nTaxation\nAs this is a complex area investors should consult their own tax advisor regarding the US federal, state and local, the UK and other tax consequences of owning and disposing of shares and ADSs in their particular circumstances.\n\nThis section describes, primarily for a US holder (as defined below), in general terms, the principal US federal income tax and UK tax consequences of owning or disposing of shares or ADSs in the Company held as capital assets (for US and UK tax purposes). This section does not, however, cover the tax consequences for members of certain classes of holders subject to special rules including, for example, US expatriates and former long-term residents of the United States; officers and employees of the Company; holders that, directly, indirectly or by attribution, hold 5% or more of the Company\u2019s stock (by vote or value); financial institutions; insurance companies; individual retirement accounts and other tax-deferred accounts; tax-exempt organisations; dealers in securities or currencies; investors that will hold shares or ADSs as part of straddles, hedging transactions or conversion transactions for US federal income tax purposes; investors holding shares or ADSs in connection with a trade or business conducted outside of the US; or US holders whose functional currency is not the US dollar.\n\nA US holder is a beneficial owner of shares or ADSs that is for US federal income tax purposes:\n- an individual citizen or resident of the United States;\n- US domestic corporation;\n- an estate, the income of which is subject to US federal income tax regardless of its source; or\n- a trust, if a US court can exercise primary supervision over the trust\u2019s administration and one or more US persons are authorised to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or the trust has validly elected to be treated as a domestic trust for US federal income tax purposes.\n\nIf an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes holds the shares or ADSs, the US federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the tax treatment of the partnership. Holders that are entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for US federal income tax purposes should consult their tax advisors concerning the US federal income tax consequences to them and their partners of the ownership and disposition of shares or ADSs by the partnership.\n\nThis section is based on the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations thereunder, published rulings and court decisions, and on the tax laws of the UK, the Double Taxation Convention between the United States and the UK (the \u2018treaty\u2019) and current HM Revenue and Customs (\u2018HMRC\u2019) published practice, all as of the date hereof. These laws and such practice are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis.\n\nThis section is further based in part upon the representations of the depositary and assumes that each obligation in the deposit agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms.\n\nFor the purposes of the treaty and the US-UK double taxation convention relating to estate and gift taxes (the \u2018Estate Tax Convention\u2019), and for US federal income tax and UK tax purposes, this section is based on the assumption that a holder of ADRs evidencing ADSs will generally be treated as the owner of the shares in the Company represented by those ADRs. Investors should note that a ruling by the first-tier tax tribunal in the UK has cast doubt on this view, but HMRC have stated that they will continue to apply their long-standing practice of regarding the holder of such ADRs as holding the beneficial interest in the underlying shares. Similarly, the US Treasury has expressed concern that US holders of depositary receipts (such as holders of ADRs representing our ADSs) may be claiming foreign tax credits in situations where an intermediary in the chain of ownership between such holders and the issuer of the security underlying the depositary receipts, or a party to whom depositary receipts or deposited shares are delivered by the depositary prior to the receipt by the depositary of the corresponding securities, has taken actions inconsistent with the ownership of the underlying security by the person claiming the credit, such as a disposition of such security. Such actions may also be inconsistent with the claiming of the reduced tax rates that may be applicable to certain dividends received by certain non-corporate holders, as described below. Accordingly, (i) the creditability of any UK taxes and (ii) the availability of the reduced tax rates for any dividends received by certain non-corporate US holders, each as described below, could be affected by actions taken by such parties or intermediaries. Generally exchanges of shares for ADRs and ADRs for shares will not be subject to US federal income tax or to UK tax other than stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax (see the section on these taxes on page 219).\nTaxation of dividends\n\nUK taxation\nUnder current UK law, there is no requirement to withhold tax from the dividends that we pay. Shareholders who are within the charge to UK corporation tax will be subject to corporation tax on the dividends we pay unless the dividends fall within an exempt class and certain other conditions are met. It is expected that the dividends we pay would generally be exempt.\n\nIndividual shareholders in the Company who are resident in the UK will be subject to the income tax on the dividends we pay. Dividends will be taxable in the UK at the dividend rates applicable where the income received is above the dividend allowance (currently \u00a32,000 per tax year) which is taxed at a nil rate. Dividend income is treated as the highest part of an individual shareholder\u2019s income and the dividend allowance will count towards the basic or higher rate limits (as applicable) which may affect the rate of tax due on any dividend income in excess of the allowance.\n\nUS federal income taxation\nSubject to the passive foreign investment company (PFIC) rules described below, a US holder is subject to US federal income taxation on the gross amount of any dividend we pay out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for US federal income tax purposes). Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the U.S. holder\u2019s basis in the shares or ADSs and thereafter as capital gain. However, the Company does not maintain calculations of its earnings and profits in accordance with US federal income tax accounting principles. US holders should therefore assume that any distribution by the Company with respect to shares will be reported as ordinary dividend income. Dividends paid to a non-corporate US holder will be taxable to the holder at the reduced rate normally applicable to long-term capital gains provided that certain requirements are met.\n\nDividends must be included in income when the US holder, in the case of shares, or the depositary, in the case of ADSs, actually or constructively receives the dividend and will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to US corporations in respect of dividends received from other US corporations.\n\nThe amount of the dividend distribution to be included in income will be the US dollar value of the pound sterling or euro payments made determined at the spot pound sterling/US dollar rate or the spot euro/US dollar rate, as applicable, on the date the dividends are received by the US holder, in the case of shares, or the depositary, in the case of ADSs, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into US dollars at that time. If dividends received in pounds sterling or euros are converted into US dollars on the day they are received, the US holder generally will not be required to recognise any foreign currency gain or loss in respect of the dividend income.\n\nWhere UK tax is payable on any dividends received, a US holder may be entitled, subject to certain limitations, to a foreign tax credit in respect of such taxes.\n\nTaxation of capital gains\n\nUK taxation\nA US holder that is not resident in the UK will generally not be liable for UK tax in respect of any capital gain realised on a disposal of our shares or ADSs.\n\nHowever, a US holder may be liable for both UK and US tax in respect of a gain on the disposal of our shares or ADSs if the US holder:\n\n- is a citizen of the United States and is resident in the UK;\n- is an individual who realises such a gain during a period of \u201ctemporary non-residence\u201d (broadly, where the individual becomes resident in the UK, having ceased to be so resident for a period of five years or less, and was resident in the UK for at least four out of the seven tax years immediately preceding the year of departure from the UK);\n- is a US domestic corporation resident in the UK by reason of being centrally managed and controlled in the UK; or\n- is a citizen or a resident of the United States, or a US domestic corporation, that has used, held or acquired the shares or ADSs in connection with a branch, agency or permanent establishment in the UK through which it carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the UK.\n\nIn such circumstances, relief from double taxation may be available under the treaty. Holders who may fall within one of the above categories should consult their professional advisers.\n\nUS federal income taxation\nSubject to the PFIC rules described below, a US holder that sells or otherwise disposes of our shares or ADSs generally will recognise a capital gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes equal to the difference, if any, between the US dollar value of the amount realised and the holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis, determined in US dollars, in the shares or ADSs. This capital gain or loss will be a long-term capital gain or loss if the US holder\u2019s holding period in the shares or ADSs exceeds one year.\n\nThe gain or loss will generally be income or loss from sources within the US for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. The deductibility of losses is subject to limitations.\nAdditional tax considerations\n\nUK inheritance tax\nAn individual who is domiciled in the United States (for the purposes of the Estate Tax Convention) and is not a UK national will not be subject to UK inheritance tax in respect of our shares or ADSs on the individual\u2019s death or on a transfer of the shares or ADSs during the individual\u2019s lifetime, provided that any applicable US federal gift or estate tax is paid, unless the shares or ADSs are part of the business property of a UK permanent establishment or pertain to a UK fixed base used for the performance of independent personal services. Where the shares or ADSs have been placed in trust by a settlor they may be subject to UK inheritance tax unless, when the trust was created, the settlor was domiciled in the United States and was not a UK national. Where the shares or ADSs are subject to both UK inheritance tax and to US federal gift or estate tax, the estate tax convention generally provides a credit against US federal tax liabilities for UK inheritance tax paid.\n\nUK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax\nStamp duty will, subject to certain exceptions, be payable on any instrument transferring our shares to the custodian of the depositary at the rate of 1.5% on the amount or value of the consideration if on sale or on the value of such shares if not on sale. Stamp duty reserve tax (SDRT), at the rate of 1.5% of the amount or value of the consideration or the value of the shares, could also be payable in these circumstances but no SDRT will be payable if stamp duty equal to such SDRT liability is paid.\n\nFollowing rulings of the European Court of Justice and the first-tier tax tribunal in the UK, HMRC have confirmed that the 1.5% SDRT charge will not be levied on an issue of shares to a depositary receipt system on the basis that such a charge is contrary to EU law.\n\nNo stamp duty should in practice be required to be paid on any transfer of our ADSs provided that the ADSs and any separate instrument of transfer are executed and retained at all times outside the UK.\n\nA transfer of our shares in registered form will attract ad valorem stamp duty generally at the rate of 0.5% of the purchase price of the shares. There is no charge to ad valorem stamp duty on gifts.\n\nSDRT is generally payable on an unconditional agreement to transfer our shares in registered form at 0.5% of the amount or value of the consideration for the transfer, but if, within six years of the date of the agreement, an instrument transferring the shares is executed and stamped, any SDRT which has been paid would be repayable or, if the SDRT has not been paid, the liability to pay the tax (but not necessarily interest and penalties) would be cancelled. However, an agreement to transfer our ADSs will not give rise to SDRT.\n\nPFIC rules\nWe do not believe that our shares or ADSs will be stock of a PFIC for US federal income tax purposes for our current taxable year or the foreseeable future. This conclusion is a factual determination that is made annually and thus is subject to change. If we are a PFIC, US holders of shares would be required (i) to pay a special US addition to tax on certain distributions and (ii) any gain realised on the sale or other disposition of the shares or ADSs would in general not be treated as a capital gain unless a US holder elects to be taxed annually on a mark-to-market basis with respect to the shares or ADSs.\n\nOtherwise a US holder would be treated as if he or she has realised such gain and certain \u201cexcess distributions\u201d rateably over the holding period for the shares or ADSs and would be taxed at the highest tax rate in effect for each such year to which the gain was allocated.\n\nAn interest charge in respect of the tax attributable to each such preceding year beginning with the first such year in which our shares or ADSs were treated as stock in a PFIC would also apply. In addition, dividends received from us would not be eligible for the reduced rate of tax described above under \u201cTaxation of Dividends \u2013 US federal income taxation\u201d.\n\nBack-up withholding and information reporting\nPayments of dividends and other proceeds to a US holder with respect to shares or ADSs, by a US paying agent or other US intermediary will be reported to the Internal Revenue Service and to the US holder as may be required under applicable regulations. Back-up withholding may apply to these payments if the US holder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number or certification of exempt status or fails to comply with applicable certification requirements.\n\nCertain US holders are not subject to back-up withholding. US holders should consult their tax advisors about these rules and any other reporting obligations that may apply to the ownership or disposition of shares or ADSs, including requirements related to the holding of certain foreign financial assets.\nHistory and development\n\nThe Company was incorporated under English law in 1984 as Racal Strategic Radio Limited (registered number 1833679).

Such regulation typically takes the form of industry specific law and regulation covering telecommunications services and general competition (antitrust) law applicable to all activities. The following section describes the regulatory frameworks and the key regulatory developments at national and regional level and in the European Union (\u2018EU\u2019), in which we had significant interests during the year ended 31 March 2020. Many of the regulatory developments reported in the following section involve ongoing proceedings or consideration of potential proceedings that have not reached a conclusion. Accordingly, we are unable to attach a specific level of financial risk to our performance from such matters.\n\nEuropean Union (\u2018EU\u2019)\n\nIn June 2018, the European Parliament and the Council reached an overall political agreement on the European Electronic Communications Code (\u2018EECC\u2019) and BEREC Regulation, with formal adoption finalised in December 2018. Member States must complete transposition into national law by the end of 2020. Rules capping prices on intra-EU international calls came into force in May 2019 and BEREC issued further Guidelines on implementation. In July 2019, the European Commission launched a public consultation on voice call termination rates in the EU to feed into the implementation of the European Commission\u2019s policy on the Eurorates.\n\nIn February 2019, The Commission launched a targeted consultation on the review of the Recommendation on relevant markets in the electronic communications sector adopted in 2014 (2014/710/EU). The aim is to gather information on the state of play and developments of wholesale markets and assess current and potential markets susceptible to ex ante regulation in the sector. The results of the targeted consultation will support the Commission\u2019s preparations of the new Recommendation to be adopted by December 2020.\n\nIn April 2019, the Digital Content and Sales of Goods Directives was adopted, introducing new consumer rights when buying digital and smart products.\n\nIn May 2019, the EU Regulation on the free flow of non-personal data became applicable, removing obstacles to the free movement of non-personal data across Member States in the EU.\n\nIn May 2019, the Cybersecurity Act entered into force. This includes a permanent mandate, expanded responsibilities and more resources for the EU Cybersecurity Agency and promotion of security by design and by default by implementing a framework for the voluntary cybersecurity certification of information and communications (ICT) products, services and processes, obtainable in any Member State with validity across the EU.\n\nIn May 2019, the EU adopted a revised version of the Cable and Satellite Directive, covering the rights clearance of content retransmitted over the internet, and particularly fixed and mobile broadband.\n\nIn July 2019, the first EU regulation specifically addressing the platform economy was adopted, imposing transparency and redress obligations for online platforms operating in the B2C market.\n\nIn July 2019, draft legislation proposed by the EC on vehicle connectivity standards was struck down by the EU Council of Ministers.\n\nThe EC\u2019s legislative proposal for an e-Privacy Regulation, which will update the existing e-Privacy Directive with specific rules applicable to the electronic communications sector, and a proposal for a regulation on the removal of terrorist content online are still in the process of being negotiated. Similarly, the Directive on Collective Redress and the proposals for cross-border access by law enforcement authorities to electronic evidence are also still in discussions. Finally, we expect further discussions on the proposed EU Cybersecurity Competence Centre Regulation.\n\nIn February 2020, the EC President von der Leyen presented the EU digital package, under the banner A Europe Fit for the Digital Age. The package is one of the flagship policy initiatives of the new Commission, alongside the Green Deal and Industrial Strategy. A key feature of the digital package is a white paper on Artificial Intelligence, which announces future regulation for high-risk AI applications. The consultation on the white paper is open until May 2020.\n\nEurope region\n\nGermany\n\nIn May 2017, the national regulatory authority (\u2018BNetzA\u2019) initiated the market review process for wholesale access at fixed locations currently covering both unbundled local loop (\u2018ULL\u2019) and virtual unbundled local access (\u2018VULA\u2019) as well as bitstream wholesale products. Meanwhile, BNetzA has started market-wide discussions on possible remedies and the future of fibre access regulation in advance of the draft regulatory order, expected in Q2 2020.\n\nIn June 2019, Vodafone Germany acquired 2x20MHz of the expiring 2.1GHz spectrum and 1x90MHz of 3.6GHz spectrum in the recent auction for \u20ac1.88 billion. The amount due is payable in instalments until 2030. The allocation is valid till end of 2040.\n\nIn September 2019, BNetzA\u2019s draft decision regarding fixed access market review (Market 3a) indicated Deutsche Telekom has significant market power across all speeds, technologies and regions. Cable operators are not defined as being dominant, taking into account the merger between Vodafone and Unitymedia.\n\nIn November 2019, BNetzA published a decision to lower mobile termination rates (\u2018MTRs\u2019) in Germany from 0.96\u20acct/min down to 0.90\u20acct/min effective December 2019 onwards. The glide path reduces the MTR to 0.78\u20acct/min in December 2020, and to 0.70\u20acct/min in December 2021 until December 2022.\n\nItaly\n\nIn March 2017, the national regulatory authority (\u2018AGCOM\u2019) imposed a minimum billing period of one month for fixed and convergent offers, effective by the end of June 2017. The operators appealed AGCOM\u2019s resolution before the Administrative Court, which was rejected in February 2018. Vodafone Italy filed an appeal before the Council of State which is pending.\n\nIn January 2019, AGCOM opened a national consultation on the wholesale local and central fixed access market review. The draft proposal modifies the criteria for defining competitive areas and lowers wholesale prices in non-competitive areas. In August 2019, AGCOM issued its final decision, which defined the regulatory framework applicable for access to Telecom Italia (\u2018TIM\u2019) fixed network from 2018 to 2021.\nIn July 2019, TIM and Vodafone Italy reached an agreement for: (i) the creation of an active network sharing partnership for 4G and 5G; and (ii) the expansion of their existing passive sharing agreement. Vodafone Italy has also agreed to merge its passive tower infrastructure in Italy into INWIT SpA, which already holds TIM\u2019s towers (the \u2018Combination\u2019). Vodafone Italy and TIM intend to retain joint control of INWIT, but over time will consider jointly reducing their respective ownership levels from 37.5% to a minimum of 25.0%. In March 2020, the EC cleared this merger. Vodafone Italy and TIM have offered commitments to support access to INWIT\u2019s passive infrastructure to all market participants. Under the commitments, INWIT will make space available to third parties in more urbanised areas while committing to preserving existing tenancies.\n\nIn August 2019, AGCOM started a sanctioning proceeding against Vodafone Italy based on the non-compliance of AGCOM\u2019s order to provide customers with automatic reimbursement/restitutions. In March 2020, AGCOM closed the proceeding, issuing a sanction of \u20ac2.5 million.\n\nIn January 2020, the NCA ruled that Vodafone Italy, TIM, Fastweb and WindTre would coordinate their commercial strategies relating to the transition from four week billing (28 days) to monthly billing. AGCOM adopted a decision to impose reimbursements/restitutions for fixed and convergent customers from June 2017 and April 2018. In July 2019, the Council of State rejected Vodafone Italy\u2019s appeal of the Administrative Tribunal statement and Vodafone Italy started the reimbursement to their customers, full decision published in February 2020.\n\n**United Kingdom**\n\nThe national regulatory authority (\u2018Ofcom\u2019) has paused its consultation on the Fixed Wholesale Telecoms Market Review covering consumer and business connectivity services, a new deadline for responses pending. The new regime is intended to commence in FY22 and run for five years.\n\nIn July 2019, the new Ofcom rules on Mobile switching took effect, introducing a text to switch option for consumers to change provider. In February 2020, best Tariff Advice was introduced for consumers.\n\nIn March 2020, the Court of Appeal upheld the May 2019 High Court decision which ruled that Ofcom must repay certain spectrum licence fees. These fees had been previously collected under regulations which were subsequently ruled as null and void.\n\nIn March 2020, Ofcom confirmed the rules for the forthcoming auction of 700MHz and 3.6GHz spectrum. At the time of publication, it was expected the auction would occur before the end of June 2020.\n\nVodafone UK has entered into a partnership with Government and other mobile operators to provide a shared rural network solution to deliver connectivity to deep rural communities. The Shared Rural Network sees Vodafone UK and its partners investing in a network of new and existing phone masts (overseen by a jointly owned company).\n\n**Spain**\n\nFollowing the dismissal of Vodafone Spain\u2019s Supreme Court appeal on the so-called \u201cTV Tax\u201d, the National Audience court presented its preliminary ruling before the European Court of Justice (ECJ) on the compatibility of the TV Tax with the Authorisation Directive in February 2018. In March 2019, ECJ concluded the TV Tax is compatible with the Authorisation Directive. However, in February 2020 the National Audience referred the case to the Constitutional Court to resolve on the constitutionality of the tax.\n\nVodafone Spain has requested the extension and modification of the commitments in relation to the Movistar\u2013DTS merger in 2015. The commitment period will end in April 2020 but is subject to a three year extension period. Vodafone Spain responded in February 2020 to a request for information by the national regulatory authority (CNMC), requesting an extension of the commitments on series and movies, and a modification of the economic model of premium sport channels.\n\nIn April 2019, Orange and Vodafone Spain reached two agreements to strengthen their existing mobile and fixed network partnership in Spain: (i) a RAN Sharing Agreement that will bring network sharing to municipalities and established conditions to expand current sharing for 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G technologies; (ii) a Fixed broadband network agreement expanding previous FTTH co-investment agreements through new wholesale access or co-investment agreements. CNMC is assessing the compatibility of the Agreements with Competition Law.\n\nIn May 2019, the Ministry of Economy and Enterprise (\u2018Ministry\u2019) launched a 5G public consultation on 700MHz, 1.5GHz and 26GHz spectrum bands. The 26GHz auction may be delayed and detached from 700MHz auction. In December 2019, the Ministry launched a public consultation to modify the Spanish National Frequencies Plan relative to 700MHz auction: (i) proposed maximum spectrum cap for this band: 2x10MHz for any operator, that could be increased to 2x20MHz in case of trading, mutualisation or cession; (ii) proposed attribution of guard bands. In March 2020, the Government communicated its intention to delay the auction.\n\nIn March 2020, Vodafone Spain renewed its FTTH Contract with Telef\u00f3nica. The renewal modified the scope of the agreement in order (i) to extend the coverage of the Agreement to include Telef\u00f3nica\u2019s entire FTTH footprint and (ii) to improve the commercial and operational conditions provided by Telef\u00f3nica in exchange for additional purchase commitments, and (iii) to extend the agreement for five additional years, until the end of 2024.\n\n**Netherlands**\n\nIn April 2018, the EC commenced an investigation in relation to the acquisition of sports rights at several media companies in Europe, including VodafoneZiggo\u2019s sports channel, Ziggo Sport. The investigation is ongoing.\n\nIn September 2018, the national regulatory authority (\u2018ACM\u2019) published the final decision on the Wholesale Fixed Access market analysis and it entered into force in October 2018. VodafoneZiggo appealed the ACM decision in the national court and at the EU level. The national court delivered its verdict in March 2020, annuling the ACM decision; therefore, VodafoneZiggo is no longer required to provide regulated access to its cable network.\n\n**Ireland**\n\nIn April 2019, the national regulatory authority (\u2018ComReg\u2019) published its final decision on Universal Service funding applications by eircom Ltd (\u2018eir\u2019) for 2010 to 2015. ComReg found that the net cost of the USO did not represent an unfair burden on eir. Subsequently, eir have challenged this decision and the hearing is set for May 2020. Vodafone Ireland is notice parties to these proceedings.\n\nIn May 2019, ComReg published its final decision on termination rates which moved the MTR rate to \u20ac0.67c. This rate took effect in July 2019 and reduced further to \u20ac0.55c in January 2020.\nRegulation (continued)\n\nUnaudited information\n\nIn October 2019, a settlement agreement was reached in High Court Proceedings between Sky Ireland Limited and ComReg. The appeal challenged aspects of the market review of wholesale broadband services (WLA and WCA). Under the settlement, ComReg confirmed that they would publish a consultation on a revised access network model, a call for input on the market impact of current FTTH pricing and a decision on the review of the WACC.\n\nIn December 2019, ComReg's decision that Non-Geographic Numbers (NGNs) should be included in the customer's bundle of call minutes took effect. Separately, in January 2020 ComReg issued a decision to impose a price control on wholesale origination charges for select NGN numbers which will take effect in May 2020.\n\nPortugal\n\nIn July 2019, Vodafone Portugal signed a MoU with infrastructure operator DST regarding wholesale access to a new fibre network which DST will roll out. NOS has signed a similar MoU with DST. The parties are negotiating the contract terms.\n\nIn July 2019, Vodafone Portugal launched a court action against ANACOM seeking the revocation of Dense Air\u2019s spectrum licence. Vodafone Portugal submitted that Dense Air has breached the conditions attached to its spectrum licence by failing to use its allocation.\n\nIn December 2019 the Portuguese Competition Authority (AdC) carried out an analysis of the telecom sector and identified competition vulnerabilities, such as higher prices relative to the EU average, low consumer mobility and a high level of consumer complaints. The AdC adopted a set of eight recommendations to the legislator and to the sector regulator aimed at mitigating the concerns.\n\nIn February 2020, the Portuguese Government put forward a Resolution setting its 5G Strategy. Following this, ANACOM launched a public consultation on the 5G Auction Regulation, which is currently suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.\n\nIn February 2020, ANACOM confirmed the new mobile termination price cap of \u20ac0.36c will come into force in July 2020 and the new fixed termination price cap of \u20ac0.046c will come into force in October 2020.\n\nIn February 2020, ANACOM reviewed the prices applicable to circuits connecting mainland Portugal with the Azores and Madeira Islands (CAM) and circuits connecting the Azores islands. Ethernet CAM circuits were reduced by 10% and inter-island circuits by 6%, effective retroactively from October 2019.\n\nIn February 2020, Vodafone Portugal signed a Letter of Intent with NOS, which sets the principles guiding the negotiation of a new mobile network sharing agreement.\n\nVodafone Portugal continues to challenge payment notices totalling \u20ac34.8 million issued by ANACOM regarding 2012-2014 extraordinary compensation of Universal Service net costs.\n\nVodafone Portugal has successfully appealed, with retroactive effect, an ANACOM dispute resolution decision dated August 2018 relating to pole access and drop cables. The dispute resolution procedure is suspended until ANACOM adopts additional amendments to the poles reference offer.\n\nRomania\n\nIn July 2019, the national regulatory authority (ANCOM) consulted on the terms and conditions for the 5G spectrum auction, which is delayed until late 2020.\n\nIn November 2019, ANCOM adopted the final decision for MTR decrease to \u20ac0.76c, effective January 2020.\n\nGreece\n\nIn July 2019, the national regulatory authority\u2019s (EETT) issued a decision rejecting the complaint filed by Vodafone Greece\u2019s against Cosmote, arguing abuse by Cosmote of its dominant position in the prepay market. EETT\u2019s decision in relation to Wind\u2019s complaint against Vodafone Greece and Cosmote alleging abuse of dominance in relation to calls to mobile networks in Albania is pending.\n\nEETT ran a public consultation for the development of a BULRIC+ model for wholesale copper and fibre access pricing and the modelling approach & implementation. The EETT reviewed the finalised model and advised further review and requested certain modifications.\n\nVodafone Greece appealed EETT\u2019s decision on the MVNO access dispute resolution between Vodafone and Forthnet; the hearing of the case is pending.\n\nForthnet has filed a complaint with the Administrative Court requesting the annulment of the Vectoring/FTTH allocation decisions. The hearing date has been postponed to September 2020.\n\nIn February 2020, the consultation on the upcoming 5G spectrum auction for 700MHz, 2.1GHz, 3.5GHz and 26GHz was launched, with plans for the auction to take place in late 2020. The 3.5GHz band defragmentation actions are in progress to allow for large blocks of continuous spectrum for the facilitation of 5G deployment.\n\nCzech Republic\n\nIn January 2019, the national regulatory authority (CTU) updated their 5G framework position for the 700MHz spectrum. The auction will now include 3.4-3.5GHz spectrum. In June 2019, the CTU consulted on the draft conditions of the 5G spectrum auction. In March 2020, the CTU consulted on the revised conditions, with the 5G spectrum auction expected to take place in the second half of 2020.\n\nIn July 2019, the EC issued a decision with comments on the three criteria test establishing a new relevant market, the mobile wholesale access & origination market.

GPRS allows mobile devices to access IP based data services such as the internet and email.\n\n3G is a cellular technology based on wide band code division multiple access delivering voice and faster data services.\n\n4G or long-term evolution (\u2018LTE\u2019) technology offers even faster data transfer speeds than 3G/HSPA.\n\n5G is the fifth-generation wireless broadband technology which provides better speeds and coverage than the current 4G.\n\nAdjusted earnings per share\nAdjusted earnings per share reflects the exclusions of adjusted EBIT and adjusted financing costs, together with related tax effects.\n\nAdjusted EBIT\nOperating profit excluding share of results in associates and joint ventures, impairment losses, amortisation of customer bases and brand intangible assets, restructuring costs arising from discrete restructuring plans, lease-related interest and other income and expense. The Group\u2019s definition of adjusted EBIT may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures by other companies.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\nFor the year ended 31 March 2020, adjusted EBITDA is operating profit after depreciation on lease-related right-of-use assets and interest on leases but excluding depreciation, amortisation and gains/losses on disposal for owned fixed assets and excluding share of results in associates and joint ventures, impairment losses, restructuring costs arising from discrete restructuring plans, other operating income and expense and significant items that are not considered by management to be reflective of the underlying performance of the Group.\n\nFor the year ended 31 March 2019, adjusted EBITDA is operating profit excluding share of results in associates and joint ventures, depreciation and amortisation, gains/losses on the disposal of fixed assets, impairment losses, restructuring costs arising from discrete restructuring plans, other operating income and expense and significant items that are not considered by management to be reflective of the underlying performance of the Group.\n\nAdjusted income tax expense\nAdjusted income tax expense excludes the tax effects of items excluded from adjusted earnings per share, including: impairment losses, amortisation of customer bases and brand intangible assets, restructuring costs arising from discrete restructuring plans, lease-related interest, other income and expense and mark-to-market and foreign exchange movements. It also excludes deferred tax movements relating to losses in Luxembourg as well as other significant one-off items. The Group\u2019s definition of adjusted income tax expense may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures by other companies.\n\nAdjusted net financing costs\nAdjusted net financing costs exclude mark-to-market and foreign exchange gains/losses and interest on lease liabilities.\n\nAdjusted operating profit\nGroup adjusted operating profit excludes impairment losses, restructuring costs arising from discrete restructuring plans, amortisation of customer bases and brand intangible assets and other income and expense.\n\nADR\nAmerican depositary receipts is a mechanism designed to facilitate trading in shares of non-US companies in the US stock markets.
