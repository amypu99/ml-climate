This year, we\u2019ve renamed and expanded the report to align with our company\u2019s focus on environmental stewardship, social responsibility and corporate governance, or ESG.\n\nFor us, ESG is not an aspiration. Rather, it\u2019s fundamental to our corporate purpose and our business strategy. Our entire company is focused on achieving our goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, while maintaining affordability and reliability for our customers and delivering returns to our shareholders. We are collaborating with stakeholders and transforming and readying the system to decarbonize our generation fleet.\n\nWe also place great value on social responsibility. We\u2019re creating a diverse and inclusive workforce and investing to provide employees new opportunities to grow, develop and advance. Equitable solutions also remain a top priority as we strengthen our focus on environmental justice and a just transition to cleaner energy. And to bolster governance excellence, we\u2019ve adopted a management approach to ESG that engages all levels of the company to ensure we\u2019re delivering results the right way and with transparency.\n2021 Highlights\n\nThis ESG focus will continue to define our success, and our achievements in 2021 speak to the incredible progress we\u2019ve made:\n\n- Reduced Scope 1 carbon emissions from electricity generation by 44% since 2005 \u2013 the equivalent of taking more than 13 million vehicles off the road. And we recently expanded our net-zero goal to include Scope 2 and certain Scope 3 emissions.\n- Continued to lead the largest planned coal exit in the country. Since 2010, we retired 7,500 megawatts of coal. We\u2019re targeting energy from coal to represent less than 5% of our total generation by 2030 and a full exit by 2035, subject to regulatory approvals.\n- Surpassed more than 10,000 megawatts of owned, operated or purchased renewables and remain on track to reach 16,000 megawatts by 2025 and 24,000 megawatts by 2030.\n- Supported comprehensive energy legislation in North Carolina that prioritizes affordability and reliability and introduces regulatory reforms to align utility investments with customer needs and improve rate certainty.\n- Submitted our first subsequent license renewal application \u2013 for Oconee Nuclear Station, our largest nuclear plant \u2013 and intend to file for all 11 units to keep our assets operating up to 80 years.\n- Brought 225 megawatts of solar online in Florida as part of a combined $2 billion investment to add nearly 1,500 megawatts of solar to our Florida generation portfolio by the end of 2024.\n- Completed our multiyear Park and Plug pilot program, installing over 625 charging stations in Florida. We plan to invest $100 million over the next three years on additional pilot programs that will help decarbonize the transportation sector.\n- Committed more than $44 million from our company and our Foundation to address the greatest needs of our communities, including $6 million for social justice and racial equity efforts and more than $3 million for pandemic relief.\n- Supported vulnerable customers, offering flexible payment arrangements and establishing a dedicated team to partner with nonprofit organizations to help customers receive more than $100 million in financial support.\n- Improved leadership and workforce diversity, expanded training and built awareness around key diversity and inclusion priorities. We were one of few companies in our industry to disclose data from an Employment Information Report (EEO-1) last year.\n- Developed a Sustainable Financing Framework to help fund investments in eligible green and social projects, while providing greater transparency around our investments and priorities.\n- Conducted a review of our political expenditures and lobbying policies and practices, adding additional oversight and releasing the industry\u2019s first Trade Association Climate Review.\n\nAdvancing Our Clean Energy Transformation\n\nWe\u2019re taking aggressive action and are working alongside regulators, policymakers, investors and other stakeholders to make even greater progress in combating climate change, ensuring the best outcomes for our company and communities. We look forward to updating you on our progress at our fall ESG Investor Day.\n\nDuke Energy\u2019s purpose is to power the lives of our customers and the vitality of our communities, and the contents of our 2021 ESG Report show how we\u2019re delivering on this purpose.\n\nLynn J. Good\nChair, President and Chief Executive Officer\nApril 26, 2022\nA MESSAGE FROM OUR CSO\n\nIn 2021, change, adaptation and agility continued to be a part of our \u201cnext normal.\u201d In keeping with that theme, it\u2019s only fitting that after 15 years of publishing a Sustainability Report, we\u2019ve retitled our annual reporting document to reflect our progress more accurately along the dimensions of environmental, social and governance (ESG).\n\nESG is essential to who we are. Our ESG strategy is focused on how we create value while at the same time mitigate the risks associated with our business. We are committed to a future that offers reliable, accessible and affordable clean energy for all customers and areas we serve. Achieving this vision will require us to transition to low- and zero-emissions energy, to invest in our communities, and to develop and prepare a diverse workforce. Taken together, these efforts will deliver long-term value for our customers, employees, suppliers, investors and other stakeholders.\n\nWe undertook an intensive research and stakeholder benchmarking exercise in 2021 to ensure we are focused on the ESG issues that provide our company with the opportunity to make the biggest impact and where we are uniquely positioned to make a positive difference. Keeping stakeholder engagement at the forefront of all we do, our ESG priorities center on the clean energy transition and fall into four themes, each of which have subcomponents and all of which are interconnected:\n\n- Justice, equity and inclusion\n- Climate resiliency\n- Vibrant economies\n- Employee, customers and communities\n\nWe use a data-driven and dynamic process for ESG risk identification and monitoring and will continue to solicit feedback from stakeholders as we make progress on our clean energy transformation and net-zero goals.\nKey highlights in this year\u2019s report include:\n\nOur clean energy transition: We have retired 56 coal units since 2010 and reduced our carbon emissions from electricity generation by 44% from 2005 levels. And we are on pace to achieve our goal of at least 50% reduction by 2030 and net-zero by 2050 from electricity generation and net-zero methane emissions from our natural gas business by 2030. In February 2022, we took additional steps toward action on climate change by targeting energy generated by coal to represent less than 5% of total generation by 2030 and to fully exit coal by 2035, pending regulatory approval, as part of the largest planned coal fleet retirement in the industry. We also expanded our 2050 net-zero goals to include Scope 2 and certain Scope 3 emissions.\n\nEnvironmental justice and the just transition: Our long-term success is deeply intertwined with the health and well-being of the communities we serve. We believe environmental justice is a business imperative, fundamental to our operations and a pillar of meaningful stakeholder engagement. In 2021, we published the principles that guide our work. And, as we navigate the largest planned coal retirement in the industry, we are meaningfully addressing the impacts to employees and communities, building from our past work. Our focus in 2021 was deep research to determine best practices and we are leaning in to better understand what the needs are across a diverse set of stakeholders. We want to create solutions that work for employees, customers and communities.\n\nHuman capital management: We are being intentional as we continue to develop an innovative, talented team of professionals who also represent the diversity of our customers and communities. This is foundational to our success. We launched a talent marketplace for employees to find short-term development opportunities to share their skills and more than 400 gig positions have been filled. We had our most diverse recruiting year ever with 35% female and 34% people of color as new hires. We are actively recruiting from historically Black colleges and universities. Internally, we had nearly 6,000 employees attend 50 sessions of our \u201cLet\u2019s Talk About It\u201d series that continues to help us build a more inclusive workplace.\n\nGovernance: We have adapted a management approach to ESG that engages all levels of the company from the Board of Directors to our employees. Our newly formed ESG Strategy and Disclosures Committee provides additional oversight of ESG strategy, disclosure controls and process, and helps to align the business units with ESG risks and opportunities. And we\u2019ve enhanced our transparency around political involvement.\n\nChange is our constant and the challenges and opportunities facing the energy sector require all of us to come together to take action. We believe business accelerates at the speed of trust. Transparently addressing issues like climate change and human capital management through reporting and disclosure is top of mind not just for our company but increasingly for policymakers, investors and other stakeholders. And we aim to continue to provide our stakeholders with insight into our practices so they can chart our progress and help hold us accountable. Trust begins with transparency. We look forward to working together on a brighter and more equitable energy future!\n\nKatherine Neebe\nChief Sustainability Officer\nVice President, National Engagement and Strategy\nPresident, Duke Energy Foundation\nApril 26, 2022\nDUKE ENERGY AT A GLANCE\n\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure\n\nGeneration Diversity (percent owned capacity)\\(^1,2\\)\n\n- 42% Natural Gas/Fuel Oil\n- 32% Coal\n- 18% Nuclear\n- 8% Hydro and Renewable\n\nGenerated (net output gigawatt-hours (GWh))\\(^2,3\\)\n\n- 39% Natural Gas/Fuel Oil\n- 37% Nuclear\n- 22% Coal\n- 2% Hydro and Renewable\n\nCustomer Diversity (in billed GWh sales)\\(^3\\)\n\n- 35% Residential\n- 30% General Services\n- 19% Industrial\n- 17% Wholesale/Other\n\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure conducts operations primarily through the regulated public utilities of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Indiana, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Kentucky.\n\nElectric Operations\n\n- Owns approximately 50,259 megawatts (MW) of generating capacity\n- Service area covers about 91,000 square miles with an estimated population of 26 million\n- Service to approximately 8.2 million residential, commercial and industrial customers\n- 283,200 miles of distribution lines and a 31,300-mile transmission system\n- 22% of coal generation capacity has dual fuel capability\n\nNatural Gas Customer Diversity\n\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure conducts natural gas distribution operations primarily through the regulated public utilities of Piedmont Natural Gas, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Kentucky.\n\nNatural Gas Operations (throughput)\\(^3\\)\n\n- 53% Power Gen\n- 17% General Services\n- 14% Residential\n- 9% Industrial\n- 7% Other\n\n- Regulated natural gas transmission and distribution services to approximately 1.6 million customers in the Carolinas, Tennessee, southwestern Ohio and Northern Kentucky\n- Maintains more than 34,800 miles of natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines and 27,700 miles of natural gas service pipelines and 4 BCF on-system liquified natural gas (LNG) storage\n\nCommercial Renewables\n\nGeneration Diversity (percent owned capacity)\\(^1,4\\)\n\n- 55% Wind\n- 43% Solar\n- 2% Fuel Cell/Storage\n\nCommercial Renewables primarily acquires, develops, builds and operates wind and solar renewable generation throughout the continental U.S. The portfolio includes nonregulated renewable energy and energy storage businesses.

As one of America\u2019s largest electric and gas utilities, we along with many of our stakeholders share the view that the company can take a leadership role in tackling the greenhouse gas emissions associated with our business and value chain.\n\nThis includes:\n\n- Targeting energy generated from coal to represent less than 5% of total generation by 2030 and to fully exit coal by 2035\\(^1\\) as part of the largest planned coal fleet retirement in the industry.\n- Expanding our 2050 net-zero goals to now include Scope 2 and certain Scope 3 emissions.\n  - In the electric business, our net-zero goal will include greenhouse gas emissions from the power we purchase for resale, from the procurement of fossil fuels used for generation and from the electricity purchased for our own use.\n  - For the natural gas business, it means adding a new net-zero by 2050 goal that includes upstream methane and carbon emissions related to purchased natural gas and downstream carbon emissions from customers\u2019 consumption.\n\nWe are currently working to determine the emissions associated with relevant Scope 3 categories. Then we will prioritize the categories for which we have adopted goals and identify what actions the company can take over time to reduce these emissions.\n\nAlready, we have reduced Scope 1 carbon emissions from electricity generation by 44% from 2005 levels, the equivalent of removing 13 million vehicles from the road. And are on pace to achieve our goals of at least 50% reduction by 2030 and net-zero by 2050 from electricity generation and net-zero methane emissions in the natural gas business by 2030.\n\nActions in our electricity business include:\n\n- Retired 56 coal units, representing approximately 7,500 MW since 2010.\n- Filed integrated resource plans with preferred scenarios that support exiting coal generation by 2035.\n- Submitted an application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a subsequent license renewal for Oconee Nuclear Station to keep this carbon-free energy source running for an additional 20 years. We plan to pursue similar license renewals for each of our nuclear units.\n- Surpassed more than 10,000 MW of owned, operated or purchased renewable energy and remain on track to reach 16,000 MW by 2025 and 24,000 MW by 2030.\n- Partnered with Siemens and Clemson University on a Department of Energy-supported study to evaluate hydrogen integration and utilization at the Duke Energy-owned and operated Clemson University combined heat and power plant. It and other opportunities are continuing to be explored to demonstrate hydrogen for energy generation.\n- Partnered with TerraPower and the Natrium Reactor team to provide consulting and in-kind services for the demonstration of this advanced nuclear reactor with integrated thermal storage.\n- Partnered with Honeywell to test its new flow battery technology, which can store and discharge electricity for up to 12 hours, exceeding the duration of lithium-ion batteries, which can only discharge for up to four hours.\n\n\\(^1\\) Subject to regulatory approvals. Contemplates retiring Edwardsport coal gasifiers by 2035 or adding carbon capture utilization and storage to reduce carbon emissions.\nOur natural gas business continues to decarbonize to meet its climate goals. With the expanded Scope 3 net-zero goal, we have an opportunity to shape the industry through making our own investments, offering customer programs and working with suppliers to reduce methane and carbon emissions. Work underway includes:\n\n- Partnered with Accenture and Microsoft on a unique satellite leak detection platform designed to measure actual baseline methane emissions from natural gas distribution systems.\n- Replaced more than 1,400 miles of cast iron and bare steel pipe, resulting in eliminating more than 95% of the methane emissions previously attributed to the cast iron and bare steel infrastructure.\n- Using new technologies to improve measurement and monitoring of methane emissions, including satellite technology and real-time measurement devices to pinpoint and repair leaks faster.\n- Analyzing the potential procurement of responsibly produced and transported natural gas from suppliers that balance low methane emissions with affordable energy for our customers, whenever possible.\n- Investing in renewable natural gas (RNG) projects and continuing to work with our jurisdictions to expand RNG availability for our customers.\n- Sourcing RNG for our compressed natural gas stations, with a pilot project underway. We plan to extend RNG to our publicly accessible fueling stations, further increasing the environmental benefit of CNG.\n\nWe will achieve our transformative goals by adopting the use of new and existing energy technologies, alternative fuels like RNG and hydrogen, and by collaborating with policymakers, industry peers and external partners on how best to meet this challenge.\nOUR PURPOSE\n\nDuke Energy\u2019s purpose is to power the lives of our customers and the vitality of our communities.

We remain committed to our journey of improving the diversity of our workforce and strengthening the culture that supports it.\n\n  The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent labor market challenges impacted our ability to meet this goal as planned by year-end 2020. As we progress toward achieving the goal, we will reassess labor market availability across our jurisdictions to ensure we continue advancing our workforce representation to reflect the communities we serve. This commitment to diversity and inclusion includes outreach, recruitment, hiring and retention as creating a more diverse and inclusive working environment makes Duke Energy a strong company, and a better place to work.\n\nGOAL STATUS\n\n- Achieved or on track\n- Currently not on track due to pandemic\n- Target not achieved\nESG OVERSIGHT AND MANAGEMENT\n\nLeadership of ESG issues starts with our Chief Executive Officer with oversight from the Board of Directors. The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the company\u2019s ESG performance and long-term success. The Chief Sustainability Officer helps define the ESG strategy and partners with business units to develop ESG goals. Senior business leaders are accountable for applicable ESG priorities and goals and integrating those into respective areas. And, employees help implement departmental initiatives and identify local ESG/sustainability opportunities.\n\nAdditional governance is provided by an employee management committee, the ESG Strategy and Disclosures Committee. It was formed to provide additional oversight of ESG strategy, disclosure controls and processes to help align the business units with ESG.\n\nESG Disclosures\n\nTrust starts with transparency, and we aim to provide our stakeholders with insight into our practices so that they can chart our progress and help hold us accountable. We have published our sustainability progress for 16 years. And were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for North America for the 16th year in 2021.\n\nIn addition to this ESG Report, formerly known as the Sustainability Report, we have prepared:\n\n- 2017 and 2020 Climate Reports, which are aligned with the recommendations of the TCFD\n- Semiannual Corporate Political Expenditures Report\n- Annual Trade Associations Climate Review\n- SASB disclosures\n- EEI/AGA template disclosure\n- GRI disclosures\n\nAlso, we annually submit responses to the CDP Climate and CDP Water as well as the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.\n\nMany of Duke Energy\u2019s ESG disclosures are located on the company\u2019s ESG website at duke-energy.com/our-company/esg.\nENVIRONMENTAL\n\nSeizing the opportunity to deliver cleaner energy.\nDuke Energy is leading one of the most ambitious clean energy transformations in our industry. We have a $63 billion five-year capex plan of which 82% ($52 billion) includes investments in our generating fleet\u2019s transition to low- and zero-carbon resources and a modernized grid. We have set goals for achieving at least a 50% carbon reduction from 2005 levels for electricity generation and to reduce our methane emissions from natural gas distribution to net-zero by 2030. We have also set an ambitious goal to reach net-zero carbon emissions from electricity generation by 2050. In February 2022, we broadened our greenhouse gas emission reduction goals by incorporating Scope 2 and certain Scope 3 emissions. For the electric business, this means we will include CO\u2082 emissions from purchased power for our use, greenhouse gas emissions from purchased power for resale, and the upstream emissions related to purchased fossil fuels for generation.\n\nAdditionally, we set an enterprisewide goal of exiting coal generation by 2035 as evidenced by the preferred scenarios of our recent integrated resource plans. And we will file the first Carbon Plan in North Carolina pursuant to House Bill 951 that will recommend several pathways toward meeting the state\u2019s carbon reduction goal of 70% by 2030. We will continue to execute our clean energy plan with rate cases to accelerate coal retirements, call for more renewables and extend the life of the largest regulated nuclear fleet in the country.\n\nWe are increasing our renewable resources and are a top 10 U.S. renewable company by capacity, for our combined regulated and commercial business, with operations in 25 states. We are also expanding our renewable footprint and own, operate or purchased over 10 gigawatts (GW) of renewables (solar and wind) in 2021, targeting 24 GW by 2030.\n\nFor the natural gas business, we recently added a new goal of net-zero methane and carbon emissions by 2050 for upstream emissions related to purchased natural gas and downstream carbon emissions arising from our customers\u2019 consumption.\n\nOur first step will be to take a full inventory of Scope 3 emissions to establish our baseline and identify what steps we may be able to take over time to reduce these emissions. Additionally, we are incorporating advanced methane leak technologies and recently launched a satellite pilot program for methane detection on natural gas infrastructure. This pilot program can identify leaks as small as a leak on a natural gas meter, enabling us to identify and rapidly eliminate leaks on the distribution system. We continue to innovate, test, and deploy other methane detection technologies.\n\nWe look to identify the concrete actions we can take in the short, medium and long term to reduce our emissions as we strive for a cleaner energy future.\nClean Energy Transition\n\nNet-Zero Carbon\n\nClimate change is a critical issue that our employees, customers, communities and other stakeholders are passionate about \u2013 as are we. That is why our climate strategy is our business strategy. And central to this business strategy is delivering increasingly clean energy while maintaining reliability, accessibility and affordability for our customers.\n\nTo address the role of carbon emissions in climate change, Duke Energy is taking bold action, with an ambitious goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Our goal is aligned with the ambitions of the Paris Agreement and, in January 2021, we publicly announced our support of President Biden\u2019s decision to reenter the agreement.\n\nAttaining our goal in the future requires taking strategic action today, which is why we recently announced our commitment to the largest planned coal fleet retirement in the industry. Subject to regulatory approval, we are targeting energy from coal to represent less than 5% of our total generation by 2030 and to fully exit coal by 2035.\n\nWhile this 2035 announcement is new, it reflects a very deliberate, purposeful road map that has been years in the making. Since 2010, we\u2019ve retired 56 coal units representing approximately 7,500 MW. Already, the company has reduced carbon emissions from electricity generation by 44% from 2005 levels \u2013 the equivalent of removing 13 million vehicles from the road. By the end of 2035, we expect to retire almost 16 GW of coal generation \u2013 almost a GW a year.\n\nIn the Carolinas we are going even bolder, targeting 70% carbon reduction in the 2030 time frame \u2013 a goal outlined by North Carolina\u2019s new clean energy legislation, which was signed into law in October 2021 with bipartisan support. After gathering feedback from stakeholders in both North Carolina and South Carolina, we\u2019re incorporating this public input into our proposed Carolinas Carbon Plan \u2013 a road map for modernizing our two-state energy system in a manner that reduces risks for customers while also lowering emissions and balancing affordability and reliability.\n\nMoving Toward a Cleaner Generation Fleet and Increased Fuel Diversity (Represents total company view)\n\nTransforming the way we produce power (Generation (MWh) by fuel type)\n\n| Year | Hydro, wind and solar | Nuclear | Natural gas | Coal/oil |\n|------|-----------------------|---------|-------------|---------|\n| 2005 | 1%                    | 33%     | 6%          | 60%     |\n| 2021 | 7%                    | 35%     | 36%         | 22%     |\n| 2030E| 25%                   | 30%     | 40%         | 5%      |\n\n1 2005 and 2021 data based on Duke Energy\u2019s ownership share of U.S. generation assets as of December 31, 2021.\n2 2021 data excludes 9,088 GWh of purchased renewables, equivalent to ~4% of Duke Energy\u2019s output (PPAs).\n3 2030 estimate will be influenced by customer demand for electricity, weather, fuel and purchased power prices, and other factors.\nWe are well on our way to achieving our systemwide target of at least 50% carbon reduction by 2030. Achieving our net-zero vision requires us to transition to low- and zero-emissions energy, while also making strategic investments in grid modernization to integrate more renewable energy and energy storage. Our road map centers around the following elements:\n\n- Deploying renewables such as solar, wind and energy storage at unprecedented rates, expanding the renewables we own, operate or purchase from 10 GW in 2021 to 24 GW in 2030.\n- Maintaining and optimizing our carbon-free nuclear fleet for peak performance.\n- Leveraging natural gas facilities that are hydrogen-capable, enabling further carbon reductions as hydrogen technology evolves.\n- Capitalizing on emerging technologies such as hydrogen, longer-duration storage, advanced nuclear and carbon capture.\n- Encouraging supportive public policy at both the federal and state levels, as demonstrated by North Carolina\u2019s forward-thinking policymakers.\n\nWe can grow our business while also addressing the greenhouse gas emissions across our value chain, focused on methane and carbon.\n\nWe are committed to bringing our customers and communities affordable, reliable and clean carbon-free energy as quickly as possible. You can read more about Duke Energy\u2019s strategy to address climate risks and deliver a clean energy future on the company\u2019s Global Climate Change page.\n\nRegulated and Commercial Renewable Energy\n\nDuke Energy is a top 10 U.S. renewable company by capacity, with operations in 25 states. By 2050, we project renewables will be the largest source of energy in our regulated utilities.\n\nRenewable Portfolio (Megawatts (MW))\n\nMeeting our goals means the company must work with stakeholders and regulators in our communities to build and connect projects through our regulated and commercial renewables businesses.\n\nWith a total renewables portfolio of over 3,000 MW, Duke Energy\u2019s Sustainable Solutions, our commercial renewable business, brought new wind projects online in Oklahoma and Texas during 2021.\n\nIn Oklahoma, the company expanded its Frontier Windpower project \u2013 its largest with 550 MW of\ncapacity. In Texas, the company began operation at the 182-MW Maryneal Windpower project.\n\nThe company\u2019s DESS solar portfolio also continues to grow \u2013 totaling nearly 180 projects in 16 states.\n\nOne of the nation\u2019s and Duke Energy\u2019s fastest-growing areas for solar power is Florida and in 2021, the company expanded solar through its regulated utility in the Sunshine State with the addition of 225 MW through three new solar power plants. With a combined investment of over $2 billion, by 2024, Duke Energy Florida\u2019s solar generation portfolio will include 25 grid-tied solar power plants, which will benefit all Florida customers and will provide about 1,500 MW of emission-free generation with approximately 5 million solar panels installed.\n\nIn both North Carolina and South Carolina, we have more than 4,500 MW of solar capacity connected to its grid \u2013 including company-owned and independent projects. We continue to grow our solar portfolio in the regulated and commercial businesses as we continue on our clean energy transition.\n\nEnergy Storage\n\nThere are many facets to energy storage \u2013 from traditional hydroelectric pump storage to new technologies around battery storage. We are projecting more than 13,000 MW of energy storage on our system by 2050.\n\nOur approach is to enhance our long-serving hydroelectric assets while actively deploying the advancement of battery storage. We plan to invest more than $600 million in battery energy storage by 2025, which will help to support our renewables portfolio.\n\nCommercial\n\nThe company has almost a decade of experience with large-scale battery storage. In 2013, our commercial business, DESS, installed one of the largest batteries in the nation at its Notrees Wind facility in Texas. DESS has about 40 MW of total capacity, with additional battery storage sites in Ohio.\n\nRegulated\n\nThe company has over 60 MW of battery energy storage in service. By the end of 2022, we will have at least 50 MW of battery energy storage in Florida, including a battery on Cape San Blas on the Gulf of Mexico. In North Carolina, the Hot Springs Microgrid was placed in service, which combines a 2-MW solar array with a 4.4 MW of battery. This will be the company\u2019s largest microgrid \u2013 supporting reliable power to a small town.\n\nWe are testing long duration energy storage technologies at our Duke Energy Emerging Technology and Innovation Center in Mount Holly, North Carolina. Multiple new battery chemistries will be tested in the 2022-2023 time frame that will influence our future deployments at scale.\nNuclear\n\nDuke Energy\u2019s 11 nuclear stations provide the company\u2019s largest source of carbon-free generation as well as baseload, dependable capacity. Continual investment in new technologies means our plants remain reliable and efficient:\n\n- Our nuclear fleet matched its record capacity factor of 95.72% in 2021, marking the 23rd consecutive year with a fleet capacity factor greater than 90%.\n- In 2021, approximately 83% of Duke Energy\u2019s carbon-free generation was from nuclear energy, and about 37% of our total generation was from nuclear energy.\n- The Duke Energy nuclear fleet generated more than 75 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity and avoided the release of over 50 million tons of carbon dioxide, which equates to about 10 million cars no longer on the road.\n\nMarking a significant milestone, we submitted the subsequent license renewal application to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for Oconee Nuclear Station in June 2021. Oconee is the company\u2019s largest nuclear station with three generating units that produce more than 2,500 MW and can provide electricity for 1.9 million homes. We plan to pursue subsequent license renewals for the entire fleet, so these plants can safely and reliably continue providing carbon-free electricity to customers for decades to come.\n\nIn addition, we are supporting and actively involved with industry groups and companies researching the deployment of advanced nuclear technologies. For example, we have partnered with TerraPower and the Natrium Reactor team to provide consulting and in-kind advisory services for demonstration of the Natrium technology, which will provide zero-carbon electricity with integrated thermal storage. This project is targeting to be operational by 2028.\n\nNatural Gas\n\nAs we transition our fleet, we continue to see the need for dispatchable resources to ensure that the lights come on when our customers flip the switch. This is where natural gas plays an important role and will enable the acceleration of our coal fleet retirement.\n\nWith our net-zero methane emissions goal for our natural gas business by 2030 and our net-zero Scope 3 upstream and downstream emissions goal by 2050 set in early 2022, we have an opportunity to lead the industry through our own investments, customer programs and relationships with suppliers to make meaningful reductions in methane and carbon emissions.\n\nThis work is essential and consistent with our business model to supply reliable, affordable, accessible and increasingly clean energy to our communities. We can grow our business while also addressing greenhouse gas emissions across our value chain, while embracing technology and innovation to meet our environmental goals.\n\nAnd, our investments in renewable natural gas production facilities provide sought-after renewable natural gas supplies to the market, taking advantage of the benefits of removing methane from the agriculture and waste sectors, and repurposing it for use by end users through the existing natural gas pipeline network.\nMethane Detection and Reduction of Emissions\n\nOur approach to reduce methane is to first identify and measure where methane may be emitted within our own natural gas operations and eliminate leaks on our system. Meanwhile, we are working upstream and downstream with suppliers and customers to reduce methane and carbon emissions.\n\nMethane Detection\n\nDuke Energy announced a new partnership with Microsoft and Accenture on the development of a technology platform designed to measure actual baseline methane emissions from natural gas distribution systems. The platform was featured at Accenture\u2019s COP26 pavilion in Glasgow, Scotland.\n\nThis unique platform provides near-real-time data collection, allowing Duke Energy\u2019s field response teams to more rapidly identify and repair methane leaks. It also tracks and prioritizes data associated with leaks using advanced detection methods such as satellites, fixed-wing aircraft and ground-level sensing technology. Ongoing satellite captures have proved successful, and the company plans on expanding this technology into other service territories.\n\nWe also have a pilot underway utilizing natural gas-cloud imaging cameras to continuously monitor and measure methane leaks at a Liquefied Natural Gas facility and a compressor station. This technology can provide immediate alerts and measurement of methane leaks if they occur, so that we can take action.\n\nMethane Reduction\n\nWe\u2019ve eliminated cast iron and bare steel pipe from our system. These pipeline replacements have resulted in eliminating more than 95% of the methane emissions previously attributed to cast iron and bare steel pipe infrastructure.\n\nWe\u2019ve also increased the cadence of our leak surveys, moving from a requirement for leak surveys every five years to performing surveys every three years. We are identifying leaks faster and repairing them faster \u2013 eliminating emissions much more rapidly.\n\nCross-compression technology is being used in certain operational activities such as decommissioning a pipe or in-line inspections to eliminate the release of natural gas to the atmosphere or flaring the natural gas. This technology moves natural gas from a pipeline being depressurized into another section of the natural gas system and has reduced methane emissions through these activities by nearly 99% and saved 2.4 million cubic feet of natural gas thus far.\n\nAs part of our expanded net-zero emissions efforts, we continue to work with ONE Future, a coalition of natural gas companies across the natural gas supply chain, to find solutions to make meaningful methane emission reductions.\n## Coal Plant Retirements\n\n(Plans as of date of publication, subject to change due to regulatory actions.)\n\n### Retirements of Coal Capacity (2010-2021)\n\n| Location          | Unit Number(s) | Total Capacity (megawatts) | Coal Capacity Retirement Date |\n|-------------------|----------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Edwardsport Station | IN 6, 7, 8     | 160                         | 2010                         |\n| Cliffside Steam Station | NC 1, 2, 3, 4 | 198                         | 2011                         |\n| Buck Steam Station | NC 3, 4        | 113                         | 2011                         |\n| Weatherspoon Plant | NC 1, 2, 3     | 170                         | 2011                         |\n| Gallagher Station | IN 1, 3        | 280                         | 2012                         |\n| Cape Fear Plant   | NC 5, 6        | 316                         | 2012                         |\n| Beckjord Station  | OH 1           | 94                          | 2012                         |\n| Dan River Plant   | NC 1, 2, 3     | 276                         | 2012                         |\n| H.F.

Contemplates retiring Edwardsport coal gasifiers by 2035 or adding carbon capture utilization and storage to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nAll capacity ratings (megawatts) are summer net.\nCoal Ash Management\n\nDuke Energy continued to meet the federal and state requirements for its coal ash basins and landfills, including the EPA\u2019s Coal Combustion Residuals Rule, the North Carolina Coal Ash Management Act, as well as other state and local agreements and orders.\n\nWith all its ash basins removed from service, the company has excavated over 38 million tons of coal ash in the Carolinas and Midwest, and safely placed it into approved facilities. This includes 500,000 tons of ash for the concrete market from three newly constructed ash reprocessing units required by North Carolina House Bill 630. In addition to coal ash, Duke Energy recycled over 1,300,000 tons of gypsum to the wallboard industry.\n\nIn North Carolina, the Department of Environmental Quality has approved all permits required at this time to meet our closure plan schedule at sites not utilizing beneficiation or reprocessing facilities. These permits support the settlement agreement reached with the North Carolina Attorney General, the Public Staff and Sierra Club. This agreement continues to provide benefits to customers and long-term certainty for the company and its investors. All Indiana ash basin closure plans have been approved by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, and closure activities are currently in progress on five basins, complete or nearing completion on eight other basins, with nine basins remaining to be closed. In South Carolina, half the basin ash has been excavated from the two retired coal sites, and the single ash pond in Kentucky has been excavated.\n\nClean Energy Technologies and Zero-Emitting Load-Following Resources (ZELFRs)\n\nWe are taking our clean energy transformation to the next level through innovative partnerships and technologies. We need zero-emitting load-following resources (ZELFRs) that are low carbon or carbon-free and can respond to dynamic changes in both customer demand and renewable generation.\n\nWhile existing clean energy resources like solar, wind and nuclear, continue to play an important role in our electric generation energy mix, we\u2019re engaged with others who are developing new technologies to be used at scale by the mid-2030s to achieve our net-zero carbon goals while maintaining reliable, affordable and accessible energy for the communities we serve. We are also actively incorporating advanced new methane leak technologies in our natural gas business.\n\nIn 2021, Duke Energy partnered with businesses, universities, government agencies and industry groups to advance new resources capable of following electric load over long durations like advanced nuclear, hydrogen and long-duration storage. With greater integration of variable renewables into the grid, these technologies will become increasingly important to reliably meet energy needs. For example:\n\n- **Advanced nuclear** \u2013 we have partnered with TerraPower and the Natrium Reactor team to provide consulting and in-kind advisory services for demonstration of the Natrium technology, which will provide zero-carbon electricity with integrated thermal storage.\n\n- **Hydrogen** \u2013 Duke Energy, Siemens and Clemson University began examining how to produce and use hydrogen for energy storage and as a low- or no-carbon fuel source. In addition, Duke Energy sponsored a hydrogen study that included a multisector workshop to explore the potential for green hydrogen as a decarbonization technology in the Carolinas.\n\n- **Long-duration storage** \u2013 a partnership with Honeywell and EOS Energy Storage to test new flow and zinc-based batteries in the Duke Energy Emerging Technology and Innovation Center in Mount Holly, North Carolina. In addition, we teamed up with Malta to begin studying converting coal units into clean energy storage systems.\nAdditionally, federal infrastructure legislation passed at the end of 2021 complements our emerging clean energy technology investments by funding additional research, development and demonstration projects and critical enabling infrastructure. The bipartisan effort represents the type of robust and sustained support essential to rapidly commercializing and deploying needed new technology at scale.\n\n**Grid Modernization**\n\nOur generation transition relies upon modernizing and enhancing our energy grid \u2013 the largest in the nation.\n\nThat modernization will be a major form of investment in the future. We have underway a 10-year storm protection plan in Florida and a three-year grid improvement plan in North Carolina. This is in addition to infrastructure plans in our South Carolina, Ohio and Kentucky service territories. In Indiana, the company is also in the final year of a seven-year, $1.4 billion transmission and distribution modernization plan, and has recently filed for a new six-year, $2 billion modernization plan.\n\nThe investment will better prepare the company for extreme weather caused by climate change. Recent installations of flood protections around substations in North Carolina and South Carolina that have experienced historic flooding in recent years will help protect vulnerable communities from extended outages like they experienced during hurricanes Matthew and Florence. When aligned with vegetation management, pole and line upgrades, targeted undergrounding of outage-prone lines and self-healing technology installation in many of the same areas, we can significantly increase resiliency and help better protect the local community and economy during extreme weather.\n\nWe are also leveraging data analytics and technology to achieve improvements in energy reliability and resiliency, while also supporting our clean energy goals.\n\nFor example, we are installing smart, self-healing technology that can automatically detect power outages, isolate the problem and then quickly reroute service to other available lines to restore power faster. In 2021, self-healing technology avoided more than 700,000 extended outages and saved customers nearly 1.2 million hours of total outage time.\n\nThis same technology also helps enable the two-way power flow needed to support growth of renewables and distributed technologies like battery storage and electric vehicles. When layered with improved system control technologies and voltage optimization capabilities, the improvements help increase not only resiliency, but also improve monitoring and protection against physical and cyber risks, enable the growth of company-owned and third-party renewables, and provide a foundation to help us achieve net-zero carbon by 2050.\nLow-Emission Vehicles\n\nAccording to the Edison Electric Institute, as many as 18 million electric vehicles (EVs) may be on the road by 2030. This gives us an opportunity to grow our clean energy portfolio \u2013 with part of that new generation helping lower emissions in the transportation sector.\n\nWe are a strong supporter of utility involvement in emission-free vehicles and are promoting greater access to EV charging for all. It\u2019s a major reason we introduced comprehensive initiatives to embrace and encourage the transition to greater transportation electrification.\n\nStarting inside the company, we committed to electrifying our own fleet. We have pledged to convert 100% of our nearly 4,000 light-duty vehicles and 50% of about 6,000 combined fleet of medium-duty, heavy-duty and off-road vehicles to EVs, plug-in hybrids or other zero-carbon alternatives by 2030.\n\nIn Florida, the company\u2019s Park and Plug pilot has installed more than 600 EV public charging stations throughout the state. To date, drivers have used the Park & Plug network for almost 130,000 charging sessions, displacing more than 215,000 gallons of gasoline and installations are in easily accessible locations across Florida:\n\n- 182 public Level 2 chargers at local businesses.\n- 52 DC fast chargers in public locations.\n- 220 Level 2 chargers in multiunit dwellings.\n- 173 Level 2 chargers in workplaces.\n\nThe DC fast chargers are in strategic locations connecting major and key secondary corridors and evacuation routes in Florida. This creates critical infrastructure needed for EV adoption and helps reduce range anxiety.\n\nIn the Carolinas, regulatory action in 2020 led to EV pilot programs being approved. We are now working on an expanded suite of EV programs, making it more affordable and convenient for customers to access EV charging infrastructure.\n\nAn additional pilot program is waiting regulatory action in North Carolina; pilot programs are under consideration by regulators in Ohio and Indiana.\n\nThe company is evaluating \u201cMake Ready Credit\u201d programs to provide credits to reduce the upfront cost of upgrading electrical systems to install charging infrastructure for homeowners and businesses. In addition, we aim to make sure future charging is equitable to rural and low- to middle-income areas.\n\nWe are a member of the National Electric Highway Coalition \u2013 a collaboration among electric companies committed to enabling installation of EV fast charging stations that will allow the public to drive with confidence along major U.S. travel corridors by the end of 2023.\n\nElsewhere, the company\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary, eTransEnergy, helps large businesses and municipalities with all the planning, financing, acquisition and deployment services to electrify their fleets. eTransEnergy provides unregulated services to assist school districts, transit agencies and companies across the country achieve their economic and sustainability goals as they transition to clean energy transportation options.\nWe are also promoting compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles, which help lower overall transportation emissions. Around 50% of the fleet at Piedmont Natural Gas runs on CNG \u2013 a total of almost 700 trucks and vehicles. The company owns and operates public CNG fueling stations across its three-state territory. We started offering RNG at some CNG stations and are working on expanding this offering.\n\n**Natural Capital**\n\nDuke Energy\u2019s approach to protecting and enhancing biodiversity and natural capital benefits is guided by our corporate commitment to Biodiversity, Natural Resource Conservation Vision Statement, Corporate Environmental and Health & Safety (EHS) Management System. We believe we have an obligation to manage the natural assets where we operate, including associated procedures, mitigation hierarchy process, stewardship and conservation projects and Avian Protection Plan. We are committed to continue supporting biodiversity through the additional development and implementation of protective corporate policies, investment in conservation projects, environmental initiatives and research, and through relationships that will conserve biodiversity and important local, regional and national ecosystems and habitats.\n\n**Water**\n\nThe water supply in our communities is a public resource with multiple stakeholders responsible for its protection. We share that commitment with water users in the river basins where we operate power plants to ensure a resilient water supply is available to communities. This shared responsibility is particularly important during drought conditions.\n\nAs part of the relicensing process for many of Duke Energy\u2019s hydroelectric projects, partnerships were created to protect water supplies for all users. These groups, called drought management advisory groups, developed and use low inflow protocols to establish objective criteria and actions for reductions in water use, as well as communications pathways during periods of low inflow into the basins.\n\nThe goal is to take the actions needed in the basins to delay the point at which the available water storage inventory is fully depleted. This allows more time for rainfall to restore inflows to the lake system. We perform a monthly evaluation of different indicators and then issue a report to all large water users along each river basin. When certain conditions are reached, a drought stage is declared, and the users and stakeholders of the water supply take certain agreed-upon actions. There are five separate drought stages of increasing severity.\nIn the final four months of 2021, the Duke Energy rain gauges show several regions received less than half the long-term average rainfall for the same period. Due to this dry weather, the Low Inflow Protocol in the Catawba-Wateree River Basin was implemented. It helps major water users in the basin conserve water supplies during droughts. This proactive and forward-thinking approach to managing the shared water supply helps mitigate drought risks, and in the Catawba-Wateree case, risks that affect 26% of Duke Energy\u2019s generation operations that depend on that supply.\n\n**Biodiversity**\n\nThe company\u2019s [Corporate Commitment to Biodiversity](#) \u2013 published in 2021 \u2013 offers an outline of how we conduct business with respect to biodiversity. Under it, Duke Energy uses best management practices, procedures, and the mitigation hierarchy process (i.e., avoid, minimize, restore/rehabilitate) as an integral part of its project planning, siting, construction, operational and maintenance decisions.\n\nDuke Energy also seeks to foster constructive working relationships and partnerships with stakeholders with respect to biodiversity. Putting that philosophy into action, Duke Energy developed the Catawba-Wateree (CW) and the Keowee-Toxaway (KT) Habitat Enhancement Programs (HEP) \u2013 cooperative initiatives by Duke Energy, the North Carolina Wildlife Resource Commission and the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources.\n\nThe programs aim to deliver an effective means of allowing continued private recreational access while providing meaningful habitat creation, enhancement and protection activities for fish and wildlife along the shores of both the Keowee-Toxaway and the Catawba-Wateree Hydroelectric Project reservoirs.\n\nSince its inception, the programs have provided over $3 million in funding to support 108 environmental projects.\n\nIn 2021, the CW HEP funded land conservation efforts to remove invasive plants and establish native plants on Lake Norman, Mountain Island Lake and Lake Wylie. Avian nesting boxes were installed on Lake Cedar Creek, Great Falls Lake, Rocky Creek Reservoir and Fishing Creek Reservoir.\n\nThe KT HEP funded land acquisitions to permanently conserve valuable fish and wildlife habitat and place artificial fish habitat structures in Lake Keowee.\n\nThis collaborative program ensures the sustainability of water and natural resources and recreational opportunities for our growing population while also meeting energy production needs.\n2021 Electricity Generated and Generation Capacity\n\n|                      | Electricity Generated (net megawatt-hours) | Generation Capacity (megawatts) |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n|                      | MWh (thousands) | Percent | MW | Percent |\n| Total Carbon-Free    | 89,910          | 41.7%    | 15,206 | 28.2% |\n| Nuclear              | 75,328          | 34.9%    | 8,907 | 16.5% |\n| Wind                 | 7,387           | 3.4%     | 2,987 | 5.5%  |\n| Conventional Hydro   | 2,870           | 1.3%     | 1,339 | 2.5%  |\n| Solar                | 4,325           | 2.0%     | 1,973 | 3.7%  |\n| Total Lower-Carbon   | 78,053          | 36.2%    | 19,832 | 36.7% |\n| Natural Gas          | 77,679          | 36.0%    | 19,788 | 36.7% |\n| Fuel Cell            | 374             | 0.2%     | 44   | 0.1%  |\n| Total Higher-Carbon  | 48,395          | 22.4%    | 16,647 | 30.8% |\n| Coal                 | 48,181          | 22.3%    | 15,652 | 29.0% |\n| Oil                  | 214             | 0.1%     | 995   | 1.8%  |\n| Pumped-Storage Hydro | (614)           | -0.3%    | 2,300 | 4.3%  |\n| Total                | 215,745         | 100%     | 53,985 | 100%  |\n\nPurchased Carbon-free Generation (Includes PPAs)\n\n|                      | Equivalent to 4% | Equivalent to 8% |\n|----------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                      | 9,088            | 4,212            |\n\n1 All regulated data is based on the firm summer capacity of Duke Energy\u2019s ownership share of generating plants as of December 31, 2021.

Over 40% of the electricity we generated in 2021 was from carbon-free sources, including nuclear, wind, hydro and solar. Thirty six percent was from lower-carbon natural gas, which emits about half as much carbon dioxide as coal. And about 22% was from higher-carbon coal and oil. Taken together, owned and purchased renewables are equivalent to almost 11% of our electricity generation.\n\nFuels consumed for electric generation\n\nSince 2008, the use of coal and oil as generation fuels has significantly decreased. These fuels are being replaced by cleaner natural gas and renewables.\nENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE METRICS\nCONTINUED\n\nWater Withdrawn and Consumed for Electric Generation\n(billion gallons)\n\n|          | 2011 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|----------|------|------|------|------|\n| Withdrawn| 5,900| 4,657| 4,696| 4,924|\n| Consumed | 105  | 73   | 125  | 111  |\n| Consumption intensity (gallons per MWh generated) | 456  | 337  | 594  | 516  |\n\nData for 2020 and 2021 were developed using processes aligned with the CDP Water methodology.

Totals may not add up exactly due to rounding.\n\nSulfur Dioxide and Nitrogen Oxides Emissions (metric tons) and Electricity Generation (thousand net megawatt-hours)\n\nWater withdrawn and consumed for electric generation\n\nWater withdrawn is the total volume removed from a water source, such as a lake or a river. Because of the once-through cooling systems on many of our coal-fired and nuclear plants, almost 98% of this water is returned to the source and available for other uses. Water consumed is the amount of water removed for use and not returned to the source.\n\nEmissions from electric generation\n\nMany factors influence emissions levels and intensities, including demand for electricity, generation diversity and efficiency, weather, fuel and purchased power prices, and emissions controls deployed. Since 2005, our carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) emissions decreased by 44%, sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082) emissions decreased by 98% and nitrogen oxides (NO\u2093) emissions decreased by over 83%. These decreases are primarily due to the addition of pollution control equipment for SO\u2082 and NO\u2093 in previous years, replacement of coal generation with natural gas and renewables and increased dispatch of cleaner, more efficient plants. In 2021, CO\u2082 emissions were somewhat higher than in 2020 due to increased generation as the economy began to rebound, though the long-term reduction trend continued.\n\n1 SO\u2082 and NO\u2093 reported from Duke Energy\u2019s electric generation based on ownership share of generating assets.\nENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE METRICS\nCONTINUED\n\nMethane Emissions from Natural Gas Distribution\n(thousand metric/short tons)\\(^1\\)\n\n| Year | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|\n| CH\\(_4\\) emissions (CO\\(_2\\) equivalent) | 160/176 | 168/185 | 178/196 | 245/270 |\n\n\\(^1\\) Methane emissions are calculated by applying EPA emission factors to facility counts such as miles of pipeline, and the number of meters/services and adding component leaks based on survey data.\n\nSulfur Hexafluoride Emissions from Electric Transmission and Distribution\n(thousand metric/short tons)\\(^1\\)\n\n| Year | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|\n| SF\\(_6\\) emissions (CO\\(_2\\) equivalent) | 305/336 | 477/526 | 384/423 | 363/400 |\n\n\\(^1\\) SF\\(_6\\) emissions vary year to year due to maintenance, replacement and storm repair needs.\n\nScope 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n(thousand metric/short tons)\n\n| Year | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|------|------|------|------|\n| Power purchases | 5.3/5.8 | 3.7/4.1 | 2.1/2.3 |\n\nPower purchases: Estimated from power purchases for Duke Energy facilities that are not served by Duke Energy itself (CO\\(_2\\) equivalent).\n\nScope 3 Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n(thousand metric/short tons)\n\n| Year | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|------|------|------|------|\n| Fuel and energy-related activities (not reported in Scope 1 or 2) | 12.200/13,400 | 13,300/14,600 | 13,300/14,600 |\n| Use of sold products | 17,600/19,400 | 16,600/18,300 | 17,500/19,300 |\n| Employee travel | 16.4/18.1 | 4.9/5.4 | 4.2/4.7 |\n\nMethane emissions from natural gas distribution\nMethane (CH\\(_4\\)) is the primary component of natural gas and is a greenhouse gas. We work to minimize methane emissions, but some is released during pipeline operations and maintenance. Duke Energy announced in October 2020 its goal of reducing methane emissions in its natural gas distribution companies to net-zero by 2030. The emissions reported here are estimates pursuant to EPA methodology. The EPA methodology applies emissions factors to facility counts such as miles of pipe, customer meters, numbers of services, and other equipment. As our distribution system expands due to customer growth, the emissions estimates increase because additional facilities are added.\n\nSulfur hexafluoride emissions\nSulfur hexafluoride (SF\\(_6\\)) is a greenhouse gas that is used as an insulating gas in high-voltage electric transmission and distribution switchgear. We work to minimize SF\\(_6\\) emissions, but some is released during operations and maintenance.\n\nScope 3 greenhouse gas emissions\nWe are currently working to determine the emissions associated with relevant Scope 3 categories. Then we will prioritize the categories for which we have adopted goals and identify what actions the company can take over time to reduce these emissions.\nToxic Release Inventory (TRI)\n\nDuke Energy\u2019s TRI releases for 2020 were down 91% from 2007, primarily due to the significant investments we\u2019ve made in environmental controls for our power plants, and decreased coal generation. Variations in releases were largely due to coal ash basins and their closure operations. These releases are expected to decrease significantly as coal ash basins are closed. (Data for 2021 will be available in August 2022.)\n\n|                      | 2007  | 2018  | 2019  | 2020  |\n|----------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Releases to air      | 97,969| 5,110 | 4,259 | 3,210 |\n| Releases to water    | 257   | 520   | 162   | 159   |\n| Releases to land     | 22,052| 10,148| 8,290 | 7,000 |\n| Off-site transfers   | 155   | 3,469 | 3,122 | 508   |\n| Total                | 120,434| 19,246| 15,832| 10,876|\n\n1 Data pertain to electric generation facilities Duke Energy owns or operates and where Duke Energy is the responsible reporting party.

We are working on strategies to minimize landfilled waste and continually improve performance on this goal. These strategies include planning to avoid waste generation, reuse and repurposing of generated materials, identifying reuse and recycling technologies and partners, and benchmarking with other companies to identify best practices. (This goal excludes DESS, which has a relatively small waste stream.)\n\n|                      | 2018  | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  |\n|----------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Solid waste          |       |       |       |       |\n| Total generated      | 104   | 118   | 108   | 110   |\n| Percent recycled     | 79%   | 77%   | 80%   | 79%   |\n| Hazardous waste      | 281   | 232   | 2,536 | 709   |\n| Low-level radioactive| 126,123| 140,331| 128,739| \u2014     |\n\n1 Weights are estimated based on volumes where necessary.

Our long-term success is deeply intertwined with the health and well-being of our employees and the communities we serve. We provide tens of thousands of good jobs, invest millions locally, and contribute time and resources to public initiatives and nonprofit programs. Through strategic actions, we seek to protect the local environment and ensure the safety of our people and our customers.\n\nOur efforts include providing well-paying jobs, offering opportunities for employees to grow and advance in their careers, and increasing the diversity of our teams across the company. These actions help us better reflect the communities we serve and ultimately, be a better employer and local partner. They also help ensure that we have the talent and the skills we need to continue thriving in a constantly evolving industry.\n\nIn addition, understanding and addressing energy equity challenges will allow us to better assist our underserved communities and customers, while also supporting business objectives.\n\nFor our communities we are leaning in on issues that matter to them and to the company. Topics like environmental justice, just transition, how we work together to create vibrant economies and climate resiliency, are where we focused in 2021 and will continue to make an impact in 2022.\n\nSupporting, engaging and listening to our customers, employees and communities through the energy transition while also providing reliable, accessible and affordable energy acts as our North Star. We look forward to listening, learning and adjusting along our journey to create a cleaner energy future for the millions of Americans we are proud to serve.\nCUSTOMERS\n\nEnergy Equity\n\nWe recognize energy bills can be a burden for many of our economically vulnerable households.\n\nIn 2021, Duke Energy founded its vulnerable customer team to better aid underserved and low-income customers. One example of this is a new centralized agency team that works directly with assistance agencies across our service territories to make it as easy as possible for them to help our customers. More than $100 million was applied to the energy bills of customers in need. Employee donations, customer donations, state and federal dollars, hundreds of local agencies, Duke Energy Foundation grants, and countless others helped answer the call for assistance.\n\nIn North Carolina, Duke Energy and the state government implemented the North Carolina moratorium in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, protecting more than 100,000 customers from disconnection, extending time to apply for assistance funds, and extending payment arrangements past-due balances.\n\nIn South Carolina and Florida, we are working with the Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP) to pilot streamlined application processes to reduce documentation and expedite approvals for eligible customers.\n\nIn North Carolina and Indiana, we are teaming up with other utilities and state government on low-income collaboratives to define a strategic framework of rates, programs, and regulatory parameters that can further energy equity in each state.\n\nIn November, we launched our Share the Light Fund designed to provide increased financial assistance and make it easier for customers to give and get help with energy bills. The fund raised $1 million more in its inaugural year than we raised the previous year. And the Duke Energy Foundation matches every dollar donated up to $500,000.\n\nFollowing Hurricane Ida, we sent nearly 500 resources \u2013 lineworkers, vegetation management crews and damage assessors \u2013 and donated nearly $1 million worth of\n\nDuke Energy\u2019s Electric Rates\n\nIn effect as of summer 2021\n(cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh))\n\nResidential\n\n| Utility                  | Rate  |\n|-------------------------|-------|\n| Duke Energy Kentucky    | 10.61 |\n| Duke Energy Carolinas-NC| 10.63 |\n| Duke Energy Carolinas-SC| 11.82 |\n| Duke Energy Ohio        | 11.76 |\n| Duke Energy Progress-SC | 12.00 |\n| Duke Energy Progress-NC | 12.30 |\n| Duke Energy Florida     | 12.74 |\n| Duke Energy Indiana     | 12.95 |\n| U.S. AVERAGE            | 14.16 |\n\nCommercial\n\n| Utility                  | Rate  |\n|-------------------------|-------|\n| Duke Energy Ohio        | 8.34  |\n| Duke Energy Progress-NC | 8.84  |\n| Duke Energy Carolinas-NC| 8.91  |\n| Duke Energy Carolinas-SC| 9.30  |\n| Duke Energy Kentucky    | 9.52  |\n| Duke Energy Progress-SC | 9.52  |\n| Duke Energy Florida     | 9.97  |\n| Duke Energy Indiana     | 10.24 |\n| U.S. AVERAGE            | 11.95 |\n\nIndustrial\n\n| Utility                  | Rate  |\n|-------------------------|-------|\n| Duke Energy Carolinas-NC| 6.84  |\n| Duke Energy Carolinas-SC| 7.09  |\n| Duke Energy Ohio        | 7.43  |\n| Duke Energy Progress-SC | 8.06  |\n| Duke Energy Progress-NC | 8.28  |\n| Duke Energy Kentucky    | 8.67  |\n| Duke Energy Florida     | 8.76  |\n| Duke Energy Indiana     | 9.09  |\n| U.S. AVERAGE            | 10.04 |\n\nSource: Edison Electric Institute Typical Bills and Average Rates Reports, Summer 2021 (latest available).\n\nNotes: Rates are based on the following typical bill assumptions.

We also reduced cumulative peak demand by 6,929 MW.\n\nAs the pandemic continued to impact lives in 2021, we helped customers manage energy costs while improving access to their homes\u2019 specific energy profiles, including:\n\n- **Home Energy Reports (MyHER) reports** \u2013 individual reports for over 2.6 million residential customers each month. With the information, customers can make meaningful decisions about their own energy use.\n- **New, modernized billing and technology system** \u2013 for customers in the Carolinas and Florida, new billing and payment options, improved digital experience with more self-service choices, and insights into energy use and spending. In December, 71% of enrollments in payment assistance programs and 70% of billing program enrollments were completed via the new self-service methods.\n- **Direct outreach** \u2013 through grassroots awareness campaigns, the company used a wide variety of communications tactics to deliver important messages about higher bills. We provided customers with tools to help them manage their bills, reduce energy use, and save money.\n- **Program and engagement options** \u2013 to simplify next steps for customers that want to take action to save energy and money, the company\u2019s Online Marketplace, retailer discount and in-home assessments continue to be cost-effective choices for customers.\n- **Piedmont Natural Gas** has provided funding for low-income weatherization assistance programs that provide a more energy-efficient and comfortable home environment for the customers served.\n- **Duke Energy Ohio and Kentucky** employee volunteers assembled hundreds of winter weatherization kits that were handed out to customers. The weatherization kits were distributed in partnership with community organizations across Ohio and Kentucky, and included items such as draft stoppers, window insulation, outlet covers, weatherstripping, etc. to help customers prepare for the cold winter months and make their homes more energy efficient to cut down on their energy costs.\n\nAs we look to 2022 and beyond, contemporary options such as time-based rate options, program bundles, and education and tools around electric vehicle charging will provide even more value for customers.\nCustomer Experience\n\nCustomer satisfaction (CSAT) continues to improve. The company not only maintained higher than targeted CSAT performance throughout the year as measured by proprietary studies, but also improved satisfaction as measured by J.D. Power, which provides a benchmark of our performance compared to other utilities.\n\nFour of our utilities ranked as top quartile performers among large utilities nationally in 2021 \u2013 outgaining the industry and delivering increasingly consistent performance across jurisdictions.\n\nIn 2021, we implemented a new, modernized billing and technology system for customers in the Carolinas and Florida that introduced new billing and payment options, delivered an improved digital experience with more self-service choices, and provides more insights into energy use and spending.\n\nThese changes are part of our commitment to offer more convenience and flexible options that make it easier for customers to do business with us. So far, our customers are taking advantage of these new options. In December, 71% of enrollments in payment assistance programs and 70% of billing program enrollments were completed via the new self-service methods.\n\nThrough grassroots awareness campaigns, the company used a wide variety of communications tactics to deliver important messages about higher bills. Designated webpages, video, social and traditional media, direct-to-consumer communications, fact sheets and more armed customers with tools to help them manage their bills, reduce energy use, and save money.\nEconomic Development\n\nOur communities depend on economic growth, and we play an important role.\n\nIn 2021, the company\u2019s economic development team helped attract approximately 12,500 new jobs and $6.2 billion in capital investment to six states served by the company\u2019s electric utilities: North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky.\n\nThe 26-person team focused on several key business sectors \u2013 aerospace, data centers, advanced manufacturing, automotive, life sciences and food/beverage processing.\n\nIn addition, the team evaluated 20 properties for potential business and industrial development through Duke Energy\u2019s Site Readiness Program. The program \u2013 in partnership with local economic development agencies \u2013 identifies potential industrial sites, assesses the sites\u2019 strengths and weaknesses, facilitates improvements at the sites, and markets the sites to future businesses.\n\nSince 2005, the program has evaluated 327 sites \u2013 with 81 \u201cproject wins,\u201d generating $12.5 billion in capital investment and 17,073 jobs.\n\nSite Selection magazine named Duke Energy to its \u201cTop Utilities in Economic Development\u201d list for the 17th consecutive year.\n\nEconomic Development\n\nWe work with state and local authorities to promote economic growth in our communities, helping attract business investment and jobs. The company helped attract approximately 12,500 jobs and $6.2 billion of investment in 2021.

Our long-term success is deeply intertwined with the health and well-being of the communities we serve.\n\nWe have a couple of opportunities to engage with our communities through this transition: environmental justice and just transition.\n\nEnvironmental Justice\n\nWe believe environmental justice is a business imperative, fundamental to our operations and a pillar of meaningful stakeholder engagement. We continually look for new ways to identify, communicate and engage with those potentially affected by infrastructure projects. Over the past year, we have worked with both internal and external stakeholders to build upon the principles that guide our work.\n\nWe recognize and understand the importance of both the impact of our work on communities as well as the importance of early engagement. We believe in being transparent on what we are trying to accomplish, seeking feedback and input, and adjusting and aligning where possible to bring about the best outcomes for the communities we serve. As we have talked to subject matter experts in the environmental justice field, we have learned there is an opportunity to create access to opportunities like jobs and economic development to help communities benefit from the clean energy transition. Our communities care about these issues and want to be included in the discussion.\n\nInternally, our teams are purposeful in asking critical questions about projects and their associated impacts. We\u2019re building a process that includes early development, analysis and assessment. In fact, we\u2019ve taken significant steps forward to internalize our environmental justice principles.\n\nA few examples include:\n\n- Improving the quality and rigor of our screening process by incorporating the latest EPA screening tools and industry best practices as well as accounting for environmental justice inputs as we plan projects.\n- Working with our community relations managers to help identify disadvantaged communities early in project development to engage in more meaningful and authentic stakeholder engagement.\n- Improving the way we communicate environmental justice analysis to permitting agencies, policymakers and community members. This will help ensure we\u2019re identifying the most critical community concerns earlier in the process and working toward constructive solutions.\n\nWe are mindful that our principles may evolve as we continue to engage stakeholders on environmental justice concerns.\n\nJust Transition\n\nAs we navigate the largest planned coal retirement in the industry, we are being intentional in how we approach a fair, equitable and just transition for our employees, customers and communities. We are building from our past work, as we have already learned a great deal in previous coal retirements where we\u2019ve meaningfully addressed impacts to workers and communities.\n\nIn 2021, we conducted a benchmarking exercise to determine best practices guided by groups who are experts in this space. We are also leaning in to better understand what the needs are across a diverse set of stakeholders including local governments and\nnonprofits. The results of the benchmarking and this important dialogue will inform our next steps in developing our long-term strategy.\n\nDuke Energy, our customers and our local communities all benefit from us retaining and refocusing our workforce, and we have a proven record of successfully placing employees impacted by plant retirements in other positions with the company. In April 2021, we initiated a multiskilled training pilot program for 500 coal plant employees in North Carolina. The program includes about 100 hours of traditional classroom, computer-based and on-the-job training. The additional training provides employees with the skills needed to generate reliable power for our customers during the transition and prepare to operate and maintain cleaner technologies, including natural gas, solar and battery storage.\n\nAs we retire our coal fleet, we will continue to serve those communities. Our employees have deep roots in the communities where they live and work, often making financial contributions and volunteering their time and talent to advance the mission of local organizations.\n\nWe are determined to meet the energy needs of customers today and into the future and we are meeting with community leaders to gain input into the coal plant retirement plans. We want to create solutions that work for customers, communities and employees. This will continue to be an important conversation as we \u2013 along with our stakeholders \u2013 strive for a cleaner energy future for all.\n\nNew opportunity\n\nBeyond traditional means of development, we are focused on building a more flexible workforce to execute our clean energy transition. A key component of our development strategy includes leveraging temporary assignments or \u201cgigs\u201d outside of an employee\u2019s current role. This helps employees learn new skills and expand their network of relationships.\n\nAllison Hampton has been with Duke Energy for 34 years. She joined the company as a technician in 1987 after earning a two-year degree in electronics and electro-mechanical technology. Allison had the opportunity to participate in a digital transformation gig assignment. She saw this as a chance to broaden her horizons, bring her diverse skill set to other areas of the company, and expand her network. This ultimately led to a new role for Allison as Product Analyst.\n\n\u201cThis is the best job of my 34 years,\u201d Allison said. \u201cIt uses all of my talents, everything I have learned through the years as a craft worker, and my computer skills. It makes me feel that I\u2019m able to leverage all of my skills and knowledge to help make a better work environment. It\u2019s like being brand new again. Like your first job. It has really invigorated me.\u201d\nCharitable Giving\n\nOur purpose to \u201cpower the lives of our customers and the vitality of our communities\u201d underpins how we support employees, customers and communities through one of the largest clean energy transformations in our industry.\n\nThe Duke Energy Foundation spent the past year listening, learning and adjusting to stakeholder feedback on a variety of topics from pandemic impacts to environmental justice. These conversations led to deepening our focus on root causes and system challenges.\n\nWe believe by focusing the Duke Energy Foundation on the topics we are best positioned to address, leveraging the unique capabilities of both our company and our Foundation, we can deliver the best outcome for our communities. Through this holistic approach, we are prioritizing three pillars, each of which includes a broad suite of adjacent topics:\n\n- Vibrant economies\n- Climate resiliency\n- Justice, equity and inclusion\n\nIn addition, our process for grantmaking and community engagement opportunities is evolving to be more customizable and community based. Beginning in the Carolinas, we are prioritizing our efforts on the community challenges that intersect with the clean energy transformation. Our approach will help ensure our business responds to community needs while also being intentional about supporting work where we\n\n2021 Charitable Giving\n\n$55 MILLION\nTotal Charitable Giving\n\n$27.9 MILLION\nDuke Energy Foundation\n\n$16.9 MILLION\nOther company cash contributions and in-kind gifts and services\n\n$8.2 MILLION\nCash contributions from employees and retirees\n\n$2.0 MILLION\nEstimated value of volunteers\u2019 time\n\n1 Charitable Giving by Duke Energy and its Foundation was $44.8 million.\n2 Includes charitable giving associated with regulatory settlements.\n3 Payment made in the form of goods and services instead of money.\ncan have the most positive impact. In addition, we are aligning our employee volunteerism to reflect our strategic direction. In 2021, over 70,000 hours were donated to local projects. Pandemic-related limitations required us to suspend many in-person volunteer events, and look forward to supporting our communities through volunteerism in 2022.\n\nWe have seen this approach work effectively over the past two years in our COVID-19 relief efforts and our commitment to social justice and racial equity. We have also focused on the diversity of the organizations we support. Last year 53% of our grantee organizations were led by women or people of color.\n\nOur refreshed strategy is already delivering results for the communities where we operate. In November 2021, the Foundation team in South Carolina directed $250,000 toward a month-long hunger relief campaign across the state, prioritizing food insecurity and inequity. Part of the program included nearly $150,000 in microgrants including a food share program delivering boxes to those who may not have access to fresh food.\n\nWe believe this strategy will deliver more meaningful community engagement and outcomes, shifting us to more collaborative relationships to solve the challenges associated with the clean energy transition together.\n\n### EMPLOYEES\n\n#### Safety\n\nOur commitment to safety helps us attract the best workers possible as we continue our clean energy transformation.\n\nFor the seventh consecutive year, we expect to be an industry leader for safety as measured by Total Incident Case Rate (TICR). TICR is a measure of how the company uses its safety programs to protect employees from injuries. The company\u2019s TICR rose slightly in 2021 to 0.36 (the lower the number, the better), but performance remains better than in 2018 and 2019.\n\nThough company leaders are pleased with this performance and recordable injuries have steadily declined during the last decade, serious injuries or fatalities (SIFs) have plateaued. In 2021, the company recorded one employee work-related fatality and 15 SIFs. In addition, there were two contractor work-related fatalities. We aim for no work-related fatalities each year.\n\nTo reduce SIFs, we worked with the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) and industry leaders to design and implement a new high-energy hazard detection\n\n---\n\n**Safety Performance Metrics**\n\n|                                | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|--------------------------------|------|------|------|------|\n| Employee and contractor work-related fatalities | 3    | 3    | 1    | 3    |\n| Employee total incident case rate (TICR) | 0.43 | 0.38 | 0.33 | 0.36 |\n| Employee lost workday case rate (LWCR) | 0.15 | 0.14 | 0.18 | 0.16 |\n\n1. 2018 is the first year that Piedmont Natural Gas results are included.\n2.

Our historical injury data showed that over 50% of our SIFs result from high-energy hazards.\n\nThe program identifies 13 high-energy hazards that are most likely to cause serious injuries or fatalities, such as falls from elevation, electrical energy, and motor vehicle or equipment accidents. It helps employees prioritize their actions to reduce or eliminate these hazards and includes a platform for consistently sharing best practices and lessons learned from events across the utility industry.\n\n**COVID-19 Response**\n\nEmployee safety remains paramount for us, which includes our response to COVID-19.\n\nDue to the essential nature of generating energy 24/7, nearly half of the company's employees have remained in the workplace since the start of the pandemic in 2020. The other half, who had been working remotely, started returning to the workplace in 2021.\n\nThe company has managed COVID-19 through its Incident Support team, rigorous case management program and continued to follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. We instituted wearing face coverings, social distancing and maintaining office buildings at 50% capacity. In addition, we have consistently monitored both internal and external COVID-19 trends and our exemplary response resulted in internal testing rates less than 10% of the community CDC positive case rates.\n\nWe also made home test kits available to employees and continue to keep employees informed on ways to stay safe and healthy.\n\n**Human Capital Management**\n\nThe energy industry is in the midst of a massive transformation, and we must have an innovative, talented team of professionals who represent the diversity of the customers we serve as a foundation for success. We are being very intentional about our actions.\n\n**Creating opportunities for employees to learn and develop**\n\nWe are focused on identifying talent in the organization and providing coaching and development to build a strong pipeline of leaders. We are also providing learning solutions for upskilling and reskilling employees to support business transformation and are leveraging technology and innovation more than ever before.\n\nAs part of the company's clean energy transition, we are providing additional training to coal plant workers to support this transformation and continue our track record of successfully placing employees impacted by plant retirements in other positions within the company.\n\nIn 2021, we launched a talent marketplace across our company, where employees can find short-term development opportunities (\u201cgigs\u201d) to expand and broaden their network of relationships. Already, over 400 gig positions have been filled. Not only does this grow our workforce\u2019s capabilities, but it also helps employees identify and follow new career paths throughout the company, supporting retention and bringing new insights to support our transformation efforts.\nEnsuring our employees feel heard, included and enabled\n\nWe believe when employees are engaged, they are motivated to show up to work every day to contribute to our purpose of powering the lives of our customers and the vitality of our communities. Building a culture of transparency by engaging in continuous dialogue with our employees is important, so last year we transitioned to an ongoing survey strategy.\n\n\u201cThe Voice\u201d survey is the primary tool we use to measure employee engagement, motivation and to get feedback. The survey uses Net Promoter Score \u2013 a well-known customer loyalty metric \u2013 to gauge employees\u2019 likelihood to recommend Duke Energy or Piedmont Natural Gas as a place to work to a friend or colleague.\n\nWe are showing good progress. We had a survey response rate of 40% and our overall employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS), or how likely teammates are to recommend our company as a place to work, increased to 30 (up five points over 2020 results).\n\nReal-time listening also allows us to better understand employee trends to guide our actions. In 2020, employees told us they needed more information about the company\u2019s clean energy strategy and direction. We developed a plan to increase communication about our strategy from our most senior leaders down to our front-line workers, and as a result, we saw a five-point increase in employees indicating they had a better understanding and optimism about our future.\n\nThe survey also shows that employees feel proud to work at Duke Energy and are motivated to help the company reach its goals. The highest performing dimensions are teamwork and ethics and safety (both 89% favorable). Of particular note, 92% of employees said their immediate manager supports diversity and inclusion in the workplace and 93% of employees agree that their teams collaborate and are committed to delivering high-quality work.\n\nEvolving the way employees work\n\nIn 2021, we introduced a new hybrid workplace model \u2013 WorkSmart \u2013 providing employees an opportunity to maintain the flexibility they desire, while also allowing us to reignite some of the most important aspects of our collaborative culture. Approximately 80% of our office-based workforce will participate in the new hybrid workplace model.\n\nIn 2021, as employees who were working remotely began to transition back into the workplace, the company continued to maintain safety protocols that were proven effective at preventing the spread of the virus within the workplace \u2013 including social distancing, wearing face coverings, limiting space occupancy and making testing available for those who want an extra level of confidence. COVID-19 may never fully go away \u2013 fortunately, our safety protocols and flexible workplace model enable us to continue serving our customers and communities with confidence.\n\nSupport for Employee Well-Being\n\nWe support our employees physically and emotionally through our wellness and mental health programs and provide webinars and coaching focused on improving financial wellness. As we entered the second year of a global pandemic, we launched a new, inclusive and flexible well-being program, Duke Energy WellPower Rewards. This program helps employees take care of themselves and their families and rewards employees for participation in over 50 activities.\n\nWe continue to support employees who experience financial hardships through our Relief4Employees program and provided pandemic assistance to more than 450 employees.\n\nBuilding a diverse and inclusive culture\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion is a business imperative that is wired in how we power communities and run our business. The accountability and support for diversity\nand inclusion starts at the top with our leadership team. Our executive team leaders take ownership for driving diversity and inclusion goals forward.\n\nWe are guided by our vision of an inclusive environment where all people are valued, respected and encouraged to reach their full potential. And we pursue a strategy that integrates diversity and inclusion into everything we do. This goes beyond race and gender. It includes diversity of thought, work and life experiences, perspectives and cultures. We work hard to help ensure all employees feel that they have an equitable and inclusive experience, leveraging our employee resource groups as well as diversity and inclusion councils. In 2021, we launched a new employee resource group to represent Native American employees.\n\nIn addition, we\u2019ve developed a portfolio of training for all employees to build our knowledge and understanding of diversity, equity and inclusion, and build skills and capabilities for creating a more inclusive workplace.\n\n**Fair and Equitable Compensation**\n\nWe are committed to providing market competitive, fair, and equitable compensation by regularly reviewing employee pay, and conducting internal pay equity reviews and benchmarking against peer companies to ensure our pay is competitive.\n\n**Attracting Diverse Talent**\n\nWe are intentional about our actions to attract diverse talent.\n\nWe continuously evaluate our practices across the hiring life cycle to attract a talented and diverse workforce to deliver on our commitments to customers. We have a dedicated team focused on building relationships with four-year colleges and technical schools, as well as community organizations to strengthen diversity in our future pipeline of talent.\n\nIn 2021, we partnered to create a historically Black colleges and universities (HBCU) Energy Leadership Pathway pilot program with four HBCUs located in North Carolina and South Carolina. This program will provide students of color with mentoring, internships, and access to the rapidly evolving clean energy workforce. Also in 2021, we hosted a couple of virtual diverse HBCU campus recruiting events and moving forward are expanding our active recruitment at several HBCUs in our service territories.\n\n**Courageous Conversations**\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s Talk About It\u201d is a series of organized events held around possibly difficult, but necessary and thought-provoking topics, that help build understanding and awareness and support an inclusive workplace. In 2021, we had 50 sessions with nearly 6,000 employees attending.\n\nAn empowered, diverse workforce and inclusive workplace makes us a stronger company and provides a competitive advantage for connecting with the ever-changing needs of our customers and communities.\nA Multigenerational Workforce\n\nGen X, millennial and Gen Z workers collectively represent about 76% of Duke Energy\u2019s workforce. Traditionalists and baby boomers comprise about 24%. The company highly values every employee from every generation, every background and every way of life. Duke Energy workers\u2019 diverse skills, deep knowledge and broad experience ensure that customers\u2019 energy needs are reliably met, around the clock.\n\nFive Generations of Duke Energy Employees*\n\n- <1% Traditionalists (born before 1946)\n- 24% Baby boomers (born 1946-1964)\n- 41% Generation X (born 1965-1981)\n- 32% Millennials (born 1982-1995)\n- 3% Generation Z (born after

with transparency and accountability.\nGOVERNANCE\n\nWe have adopted a management approach to ESG that engages all levels of the company from the Board of Directors to our employees. We also strive to embed sustainable business practices throughout the company.\n\nThe Board of Directors oversees all ESG strategies and issues. This places an emphasis on the oversight of ESG only because our Board of Directors understands the importance of those issues to the long-term success and vitality of the company, our customers and communities. Some of the key ESG risks that the Board of Directors focuses on are climate and environmental operations and regulations; human capital management; diversity, equity and inclusion; cybersecurity, including our information technology and operational technology systems; political expenditures; and ESG disclosures.\n\nOn environmental and climate matters, the Board of Directors reviewed issues related to our climate strategy opportunities and risks at every regularly scheduled meeting in 2021 and invited outside speakers to discuss these issues on several occasions. The topics included discussions of emerging technologies, carbon emissions reduction goals, generation fleet transition, customer needs related to low-carbon energy, and federal and state policy.\n\nThe Compensation and People Development Committee also reviews issues regarding employee engagement trends, diversity and inclusion goals, and progress on those goals, and pandemic-related workforce issues. This committee incorporated a qualitative climate goal into our short-term incentive plan in 2021. The goal focuses on demonstrating leadership to advance our climate strategy to achieve our net-zero goals, advocating for public policy that supports our climate strategy, and investing in clean energy, including renewables, to support higher levels of carbon-free generation. In 2022, a quantitative goal was incorporated into the short-term incentive plan for our senior executives.\n\nSeveral other committees on the Board of Directors cover areas of ESG oversight. The Corporate Governance Committee regularly discusses charitable contributions and priority areas, including contributions for diversity initiatives in the communities that our utilities serve. The Operations and Nuclear Oversight Committee is responsible for the oversight of our carbon-free nuclear fleet as well as environmental operations and safety. The Finance and Risk Management Committee is responsible for the oversight of our enterprise risk assessment, including ESG risks, and also responsible for the review and approval of major capital projects, such as large renewable projects or the construction of new generation assets. And the Audit Committee is responsible for the review of any ESG matters that are included in the periodic reports filed with the SEC.\n\nBoard of Director refreshment continued in 2021. We announced Michael Browning, who has served as Duke Energy\u2019s independent lead director since 2016, would retire from the Board at the end of his current one-year term. Upon Browning\u2019s retirement, Ted Craver will succeed Browning as the Board\u2019s independent lead director. In recent years, the Board has focused on refreshment with respect to diversity, and is 50% diverse in terms of gender, racial and ethnic diversity. In 2021, four new directors were added. Most recently, Idalene Kesner, dean of Indiana University\u2019s Kelley School of Business, joined as a new director, and in 2022, Derrick Burks, a former managing partner at global professional services company EY also joined.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance Highlights\n\nFebruary 2021\n- Incorporated qualitative climate goal into STI plan\n\nMarch 2021\n- Published the Trade Association Climate Review, which discusses the alignment of our climate position with the trade associations included in our Corporate Political Expenditures Report\n\nApril 2021\n- Released 15th annual Sustainability Report, which included EEO-1 data for the first time publicly\n\nOctober 2021\n- Launched Sustainable Finance Framework to establish how we will fund projects related to renewable energy, energy efficiency, advanced technology, clean transportation, and expanded opportunity for diverse suppliers\n\nAugust 2021\n- Partnered with Accenture and Microsoft to develop first-of-its-kind methane emissions monitoring platform\n\nJuly 2021\n- Reached milestone of 10,000 MW renewable energy in our regulated and commercial generation fleets\n\nNovember 2021\n- Revised the Political Expenditures Policy to include additional disclosures beginning with the report for the first half of 2022\n\nNovember 2021\n- Appointed Idalene Kesner to the Board of Directors and announced that Ted Craver would be appointed as Independent Lead Director immediately after the 2022 Annual Meeting\n\nFebruary 2022\n- Announced an expansion of the company\u2019s net-zero by 2050 goal to include Scope 2 emissions and certain Scope 3 emissions, and the goal to exit coal generation by 2035, subject to regulatory approvals. Announced the appointment of Derrick Burks to the Board of Directors\nBoard Governance\n\nEffective corporate governance continues to be a critical component to the success of our business strategy. Our Board of Directors, led by our Chair, President and CEO Lynn Good, provides the leadership and guidance that drives sustainable, long-term value for our stakeholders, employees, customers and the communities we serve.\n\nOur Board is responsible for overseeing the company\u2019s long-term strategy to provide clean, reliable and affordable energy to our customers. As part of this oversight, the Board focuses on ESG matters, goals and strategies, as well as how our company\u2019s performance metrics and incentives align with those goals.\n\nThe Board regularly reviews its composition to ensure that its collective membership has the skills to meet the needs of the business and reflects a diversity of perspectives and experiences.\n\nThe Board is structured with a strong independent lead director role that assists the chair and CEO in setting agendas, approves meeting schedules, and leads the independent members of the Board in executive committee sessions at each meeting, among other responsibilities.\n\nAll members of the Board, except Lynn Good, are independent and comprise the five committees: Audit, Compensation and People Development, Corporate Governance, Finance and Risk Management, and Operations and Nuclear Oversight. The committees oversee all operational, financial, strategic and reputational risks as set forth in their respective committee charters.\n\nFor more information about our Board of Directors, see the proxy statement for the 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and the corporate governance section of our website.\nDiversity of Skills, Qualifications and Experience\n\nOur Board exhibits a diverse range of skills and experience that collectively creates a well-rounded perspective suitable to protecting the interests of shareholders. The table below denotes the areas of expertise we value and the number of directors with that expertise or experience.\n\n| Area                                      | Number of Directors |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| **Customer Service** experience is important as Duke Energy focuses on meeting customer expectations and transforming the customer experience. | 9                   |\n| **Cybersecurity/Technology** experience is important in overseeing the security of Duke Energy\u2019s business and operational technical systems, including customer experience, financial systems, and internal and grid operations. | 9                   |\n| **Environmental Compliance/Clean Energy** experience is important in assessing Duke Energy\u2019s environmental compliance risks, obligations, and operations, as well as the company\u2019s investments in and opportunities related to clean energy. | 11                  |\n| ESG experience is important in analyzing and responding to Duke Energy\u2019s risks from climate change. |                     |\n| **Human Capital Management** experience is important in overseeing the needs of our workforce \u2013 Duke Energy\u2019s most critical resource. | 6                   |\n| **Industry** experience is important in understanding the unique technical, regulatory, and financial aspects of the utility industry. | 9                   |\n| **Legal** experience is important in understanding Duke Energy\u2019s legal risks and obligations. | 2                   |\n| **Regulatory/Government** experience is important in understanding the regulated nature of the utility industry. | 12                  |\n| **Risk Management** experience is important in overseeing a myriad of risks, including operational, financial, strategic, and reputational risks that affect our business. | 13                  |\nExecutive Compensation\n\nWe maintain a market-based, metrics-driven executive compensation program, designed to:\n\n- Attract and retain talented executives and other key employees.\n- Align executives\u2019 interests with those of stakeholders, including shareholders, employees and customers.\n- Link pay to performance.\n- Emphasize performance-based compensation to motivate executives and other key employees.\n- Reward individual performance.\n- Encourage long-term commitment to Duke Energy.\n\nThe company meets these objectives through a mix of compensation that includes base salary, short-term incentives, and long-term incentives consisting of performance shares and restricted stock units.\n\nTo support clean energy initiatives, we measure the performance of our nuclear and renewable generation assets through a reliability index under the company\u2019s short-term incentive (STI) plan.\n\nThe Board of Directors\u2019 Compensation and People Development Committee added a qualitative climate goal to the STI plan in 2021, further bolstering the company\u2019s commitment to decarbonization. For 2022, a quantitative metric based on non-emitting MW capacity growth was added to the STI plan for senior executives.\n\nOther key components of the company\u2019s compensation program include:\n\n- **Safety metric** \u2013 to ensure safety remains the company\u2019s top priority, with the goal of an injury-free workplace; based on the \u201ctotal incident case rate\u201d among employees (defined as the number of recordable safety incidents per 100 workers, using U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration criteria).\n\n- **Environmental events metric** \u2013 to ensure the company\u2019s commitment to the environment; based on the number of reportable environmental events.\n\n- **Customer satisfaction metric** \u2013 to prioritize the customer experience and customers\u2019 growing demand for cleaner energy; based on a composite of customer satisfaction survey results for each business area.\n\nWe regularly review our compensation program and performance metrics with the Board\u2019s Compensation and People Development Committee, revising as needed. For more information about our compensation practices, see the proxy statement for the 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.\nFinancial Results\n\nWe operate in constructive regulatory environments with attractive growth profiles. Our robust capital plan and proven ability to deploy capital efficiently position the company to deliver strong, consistent, and enduring benefits to our customers, communities and investors.\n\nThe company benefited from growth in our core businesses, constructive rate case outcomes and continued cost management execution. As a result, we announced 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $5.24, above the midpoint of the company\u2019s updated earnings guidance range.\n\nBased on the momentum we generated in 2021, we are accelerating our clean energy transformation and plan to deploy over $130 billion in capital investments over the next decade, with $63 billion of investments occurring over the next five years. This represents a $4 billion increase over our previous five-year plan.\n\nOver 80% of our capital plan through 2026 will fund investments in our fleet transition and grid modernization. This will improve reliability and resiliency as we add more renewables to the system and extend the life of our carbon-free nuclear fleet to better meet the needs of the growing number of customers we serve.\n\nAs part of our strategy, in 2021, we implemented a Sustainable Financing Framework to define the categories of investments that are aligned with our ESG priorities. Since 2018, Duke Energy has issued $5.5 billion in green and sustainability bonds.\nOur sizable capital plan, high-growth service territories, proven capability to control costs, and constructive regulatory frameworks give us confidence in our ability to achieve our 2022 earnings guidance range of $5.30 \u2013 $5.60, with a midpoint of $5.45. Through 2026, we expect annualized earnings growth of 5% to 7% off the $5.15 midpoint of our original 2021 earnings guidance range.\n\nOur ability to execute our robust capital program is underpinned by a healthy balance sheet and we remain committed to maintaining our current credit ratings, and the long-term value proposition we offer shareholders.\n\nIn 2021, for the 95th consecutive year, the company paid a dividend to its investors. We remain committed to continued growth of the dividend, targeting a payout ratio of between 65% to 75%.\n\n**Sustainable Financing Framework**\n\nDriving a clean energy transition, we launched a new framework to attract billions of dollars of investments in eligible green and social projects. Our Sustainable Financing Framework defines the investment areas aligned to our clean energy strategy, further enabling us to issue green and sustainability bonds, loans or other financing instruments. We have a $63 billion capex plan over the next five years, over 80% of which represents investments toward our clean energy transition and grid modernization.\n\nOur long-term investment strategy will provide sustainable environmental, social and customer benefits as we work to achieve our net-zero goals.\n\nEligible project categories include, but are not limited to investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency, advanced grid technology, climate change adaptation, and expanded opportunities for diverse suppliers and small businesses.\n\nSince 2018, we have issued $5.5 billion in green and sustainability bonds. The framework strengthens our commitment to sustainable financing and broadens the scope of eligible projects to align with our ESG priorities. Green and sustainability bonds can make an economic difference in what we will have to pay for debt through bond sales, which translates into long-term customer savings.\n\n**Enterprise Risk Management**\n\nAs interest around climate change and the company\u2019s clean energy transition continues to grow, we are leveraging our enterprise-wide risk management philosophy to ensure that risks associated with climate change are identified, assessed and managed.\n\nWe are peering into the next decade and beyond to identify, assess and manage climate-related risks, including risks to physical infrastructure, risks associated with our transition to clean energy sources, risks related to the development of the new technologies needed for that transition, and the risks and impacts of federal and state energy policies.\n\nTo manage these risks effectively, we include climate change considerations in our annual Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process. The ERM process is used to identify potential risks to corporate profitability and value and provides a framework to respond in an integrated and informed fashion.\n\nBusiness unit leaders across the company analyze risks and determine how we can best address near-term and long-term risks. The Finance and Risk Management Committee of the Board is also integral in reviewing the annual enterprise risk assessment, and the Board routinely discusses climate risk governance.\n\nWe incorporate climate, technology, and economic risks into our long-term planning through integrated resource plans for each of our regulated electric utility companies. These 10-, 15- and 20-year plans, depending on the state where we serve customers, provide options for how the company can continue to serve customers and communities.\n\nThe filings consider forecasts of potential future climate policies, future electricity demand, fuel prices, transmission improvements, new generating capacity and technologies, integration of renewables, energy storage, energy efficiency and demand response initiatives.\nWe are also taking a closer look at climate-related physical risks and the potential vulnerability of the company\u2019s assets to future climate change impacts.\n\nIn the Carolinas, as part of a settlement agreement approved by the North Carolina Utilities Commission, the company has engaged world-class experts to develop a robust set of utility-relevant climate change projections to better understand the range of potential climate change impacts on the company\u2019s transmission and distribution system.\n\nThe company is also working with more than 35 stakeholder groups in this Carolinas process to create meaningful opportunities for stakeholder input and to gather consensus around future steps.\n\n**Supply Chain Governance**\n\nOur supply chain sustainability strategy enables us to reduce carbon emissions in our supply chain, promote economic development and build diversity among our supply base. As we chart the path toward net-zero carbon emissions, our supply chain environmental programs help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and preserve natural resources.\n\nIn 2021, we diverted more than 87,700 tons of solid waste through recycling and beneficial reuse. This includes over 90% of old power poles, pallets, reels and other wood. The company also remanufactured and repaired 22% of its scrap transformers, significantly reducing the need to purchase new equipment and the use of oil and metals such as copper, aluminum and steel.\n\nWe also created more efficiencies in trucking and logistics. During 2021, the company coordinated 129 backhaul pickups, saving over 12,000 miles traveled. And by using telematics, we reduced the amount of time our trucks operated in idle mode by 8%, preventing 90 tons of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWe promote economic development and support our communities through various aspects of our operations, including investment with suppliers, vendors and contractors. In 2021, we spent approximately $11.5 billion purchasing goods and services to provide electricity and natural gas to our customers.\n\nAdherence to our Supplier Code of Conduct is a condition of doing business with the company and describes in detail our expectations of suppliers. We have a strong Human Rights Policy, and we expect our suppliers to adhere to these same principles and support fair labor practices for all workers involved in supply chains. These policy principles are reflected in contractual requirements to our suppliers through the Supplier Code of Conduct and suppliers are to report any violations by any party to Duke Energy. In addition, we closely monitor our supply chain and have begun to ask manufacturers to demonstrate their products do not contain materials from areas using forced labor.\n\nAnother way we are helping support economic development is through Hire North Carolina, an innovative program that aligns with our supply chain sustainability strategy. Through the program, which is directed and overseen by the North Carolinas Utilities Commission, we added 136 suppliers to our Hire North Carolina list of qualified resident contractors, expanding the local contracting source pool for high\n\n### Diverse and Local Supplier Spending\n\n| (in millions) | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|---------------|------|------|------|------|\n| Spending with Tier I diverse suppliers\u00b9 | $850 | $1,153 | $895 | $930 |\n| Spending with Tier II diverse suppliers\u00b2 | $492 | $467 | $387 | $613 |\n| Total diverse supplier spending | $1,342 | $1,620 | $1,282 | $1,543 |\n| Spending with Tier I local suppliers\u00b3 | $4,180 | $4,940 | $4,094 | $4,039 |\n\n\u00b9 Tier I represents direct purchases from diverse or local suppliers.\n\u00b2 Tier II consists of spend by Duke Energy suppliers with diverse suppliers/subcontractors.\nvalue work taking place within the state. During 2021, Duke Energy awarded $224 million with resident contractors through 23 contracts, nine of which were awarded to diverse businesses.\n\nWe improve the vitality of our communities by consistently considering local economic impact, diversity and environmental stewardship in our sourcing selection process. In 2021, Duke Energy spent more than $4 billion with local suppliers. Spending with diverse suppliers exceeded $1.5 billion, with nearly 40% of the spending from subcontracting by our prime contractors.\n\nThrough the collaborative efforts of internal customers, prime contractors and our supply chain department, we have spent more than $1 billion annually with diverse suppliers for seven consecutive years.\n\nLocal, regional and national outreach efforts with educational institutions, trade associations, community economic development organizations and others raise awareness of opportunities to work with Duke Energy.\n\nIn 2021, the company introduced an inaugural Supplier Diversity University, a two-day educational event focused on enhancing existing diverse supplier relationships and developing new ones.\n\nAs a testament to our commitment to local and diverse suppliers, we earned two Supplier Diversity Advocate of the Year Awards, one from the Florida State Minority Supplier Development Council and the other by the National Association of Women Business Owners Orlando Chapter. These honors acknowledge our dedication to the continued growth of our supplier diversity program.\n\nDiversity in Clean Energy (DiCE)\n\nDiCE is a coalition sponsored by Duke Energy's Sustainable Solutions team working collaboratively with T-Mobile, Microsoft, Kroger and three diverse suppliers. The collaborative has partnered with the American Association of Blacks in Energy to create a first-of-its-kind diverse supplier platform.\n\nDiCE\u2019s goal is to advance the voice of diverse suppliers by using existing relationships, influence and advocacy to raise awareness, open doors and amplify the voices of diverse supplies.\n\nTo make it easier to locate diverse suppliers in the clean energy industry, the DiCE\u2019s platform will go live in the third quarter of 2022. In addition, the coalition is working to form other partnerships with energy-based entities.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to have diverse suppliers in clean energy incorporated into mainstream corporate supply chains and to destroy systemic barriers, which exclude them from competing with larger, non-diverse counterparts.\n\n**DiCE is good for business** \u2013 it can enable companies to meet diverse supplier goals and promote diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\n**DiCE is good for society** \u2013 it helps to create vibrant economies by supporting diverse suppliers in local communities.\n\nWe look forward to creating a diverse and equitable future for our customers, suppliers and communities.\nPolitical Involvement\n\nA necessary component of our clean energy transformation will be to partner with stakeholders and champion durable public policies at the local, state and federal levels that enable us to transition our generating fleet, expand and adapt our electric grid, and adopt new carbon-free technologies that will reduce emissions while keeping energy affordable and reliable. It is essential for us to engage in public policy discussions to advocate for the interests of our stakeholders.\n\nPolicy Engagement\n\n2021 was a momentous year for policy issues affiliated with climate and sustainability. We engaged in discussions at international, national and regional levels. A few examples include:\n\n- Participated in events affiliated with COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, to share our perspective on the clean energy transition and our net zero ambition.\n- Signed a letter organized by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES) and sent to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to encourage them to enact the climate and clean energy provisions of the Build Back Better framework.\n- Supported the direct regulation of methane emissions under the Clean Air Act.\n- Worked to advance clean energy tax credits in the Clean Energy for America Act and the Build Back Better Act.\n- Participated in a utility roundtable at the White House, led by Edison Electric Institute (EEI) President Tom Kuhn and several top energy company leaders voicing support for clean energy tax provisions that are crafted to provide accelerated customer benefits like lower power bills and cleaner energy.\n- Elevated policies to benefit underserved customers, specifically supporting Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) action day.\n- Participated in a White House Cybersecurity Summit and strengthened our security partnerships to provide resilient service for our customers and communities.\n- Added our voice to a video series produced by the Business Roundtable to address climate change and call for policies to support the rapid development and deployment of cleaner technologies.\n\nPolitical Giving\n\nThe Corporate Governance Committee regularly reviews the company\u2019s political expenditures, as well the processes and priorities related to those political expenditures. Additionally, the Corporate Governance Committee also reviews the feedback from shareholders regarding our political expenditures and the alignment of our lobbying practices with our climate goals. In response to this feedback, in 2021, we:\n\n- Updated our Political Expenditures Policy to provide additional disclosures, beginning with the Corporate Political Expenditures Report for the first half of 2022 regarding certain contributions and dues to 501(c)(4)s and 501(c)(6)s, as described in the Political Expenditures Policy.\n- Published our first Trade Association Climate Review, which was one of the first such disclosures in our industry and discusses the alignment of our climate position with major federal trade associations. We updated the report in April 2022.\n\n2021 Political Expenditures\n\n| Entity       | Summary                                                                 | 2021 Political Expenditure |\n|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| DukePAC      | Voluntary, nonpartisan political action committee, which leverages the collective contributions of eligible employees to support political organizations and candidates relevant to our business | $648,100                   |\n| Duke Energy  | Reported federal lobbying expenses                                      | $3,760,000                 |\n| Duke Energy  | Contributions to political candidates, parties, committees and Section 527 organizations created to support the nomination, election, appointment or defeat of a candidate | $4,232,666                 |\n\nFor additional details, see Duke Energy\u2019s Corporate Political Expenditure Reports.\n\n1 This amount includes the $937,075 federal lobbying portion of trade association dues (includes dues in excess of $50,000 during the half-year periods in which they were reported) to support policy research and advocacy.\nEthics and Compliance\n\nDuke Energy\u2019s Ethics and Compliance Program is designed to foster a culture of ethical and compliant behavior. This includes adhering to our ethics codes for directors, employees and suppliers, and living our values of safety, integrity and service. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors exercises important oversight for the effectiveness of the program.\n\nNew employees are required to complete ethics and compliance training in their first 30 days on the job and refresher training is required annually for all employees. All employees also are required to acknowledge annually their responsibility to comply with company ethics policies and confirm their obligation to report violations of laws, rules, or company policies.\n\nIn 2021, we also revamped our Supplier Code training, so suppliers better understand their ethical obligations when engaging with Duke Energy. We also put an upgraded data analytics program in place to explore the effectiveness of training and assess the learner\u2019s knowledge retention.\n\nIn addition to training, we continuously review policies and strengthen controls and oversight to improve performance and accountability. For example, we implemented enhanced due diligence in 2021 for political contributions and engagement of external political consultants and lobbyists.\n\nWe continue to be vigilant to address the varying ethical and security risks associated with a work-from-home environment for many of our employees. Among other steps, our Chief Executive Officer frequently communicated to the workforce through videos and fireside chats the company\u2019s expectations to adhere to the CDC guidelines to keep our workforce and customers healthy and safe.\n\nWorkers are encouraged to report suspected wrongdoing and may do so anonymously without fear of reprisal through an independent third party, which provides a 24-hour telephone line and an online reporting option. All allegations are investigated to ensure fair and consistent treatment, and retaliation is strictly prohibited. We expect company leadership to frequently discuss ethical issues with employees.\n\nIn 2021, we received 1.92 reports per 100 employees of breaches of our ethics codes compared to our benchmark median of 1.7. Of those, 34% were substantiated resulting in corrective action. Corrective action includes but is not limited to discipline up to and including termination of employment, process and internal control reviews, policy improvements, and communication to reinforce expectations.\nCybersecurity\n\nAs one of the nation\u2019s largest grid operators and operators of designated critical natural gas pipelines, we know assets and information are critical to deliver the essential service customers and communities rely on. Maintaining a steadfast and sophisticated cybersecurity operation is a vital part of that responsibility.\n\nCybersecurity remains a critical issue for our industry and nation. And in 2021, international tensions put a spotlight on the need for a strong cybersecurity posture for critical infrastructure. Threat actors continue to develop more frequent and sophisticated attacks, even exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWe have a highly skilled, cross-functional team of cybersecurity and physical security professionals devoted to identifying and mitigating these threats 24 hours a day. The cybersecurity team collects millions of data points every day and distills the threat data into actionable alerts. In 2021 alone, cybersecurity analysts at Duke Energy conducted hands-on investigations of nearly 33,000 alerts.\n\nTo stay ahead of threats, we use a proactive strategy focused on robust cybersecurity standards, a multilayered defense, and partnerships and information sharing. The electric, nuclear power, and natural gas sectors are subject to a range of mandatory regulations and security directives, as well as cybersecurity standards and voluntary guidelines. And as we further modernize our grid and accelerate digital transformation across the company, we continue to implement advanced security measures for operational technology at our substations, power plants, and new grid mechanisms.\n\nWe regularly communicate and coordinate with peer utilities, industry partners, security organizations, and government agencies \u2013 including the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI \u2013 to share intelligence and best practices. In preparation to respond to threats, we hold drills several times a year to test incident response plans and ensure employees understand their roles in an event. We also participate in external drills that include members of management and, at times, our Board of Directors, that help coordinate with other critical infrastructure.\n\nThe company also maintains a team dedicated to educating employees and building their awareness around threats \u2013 employing annual cyber responsibility trainings, sending routine phishing emails and creating seminars and video resources that can be used by every level and division of the company.\n\nThe Audit Committee receives updates on cybersecurity and reviews metrics and trends at every regularly scheduled meeting and discusses ESG disclosures, processes, and disclosure frameworks.\n\nFor more information on Duke Energy\u2019s ESG strategies and disclosures, see our ESG website at duke-energy.com/our-company/esg.\nSTATEMENT REGARDING RENEWABLE ENERGY CERTIFICATES\n\nDuke Energy\u2019s subsidiary electric utilities generate power from solar, hydroelectric and biomass (including waste to energy) resources, but do not always retain the Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) related to such generation. The RECs associated with such generation may be used to meet statutory or regulatory compliance obligations (on behalf of the respective electric utility and certain wholesale customers), assigned to customers pursuant to retail programs or sold/traded via bilateral commercial agreements. Duke Energy\u2019s electric utilities also buy power through purchased power agreements (PPAs) from solar, wind, hydroelectric and biomass (including waste to energy) resources. Under certain PPAs for energy from such resources, the electric utilities purchase both the energy and the associated RECs. Under other PPAs, including some of those entered into pursuant to the electric utilities\u2019 respective obligations under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA), Duke Energy does not purchase any RECs associated with the energy. Under PPAs entered into by Duke Energy\u2019s electric utilities pursuant to certain retail customer programs, such utilities purchase RECs associated with the energy, but conveys the RECs to participating customers, or retires such RECs on the customers\u2019 behalf. Duke Energy\u2019s subsidiary Duke Energy Renewables sells the electricity and/or RECs it generates to its customers.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\n\nThis document includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and Duke Energy expressly disclaims an obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nNon-GAAP Measures\n\nAdjusted Earnings per Share (EPS)\n\nDuke Energy\u2019s 2021 ESG Report references adjusted EPS for the year-to-date periods ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 of $5.24, $5.12 and $5.06, respectively.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measure, adjusted EPS, represents basic EPS available to Duke Energy Corporation common stockholders (GAAP reported EPS), adjusted for the per share impact of special items. As discussed below, special items represent certain charges and credits, which management believes are not indicative of Duke Energy\u2019s ongoing performance. Management believes the presentation of adjusted EPS provides useful information to investors, as it provides them with an additional relevant comparison of Duke Energy\u2019s performance across periods. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure for planning and forecasting and for reporting financial results to the Duke Energy Board of Directors, employees, stockholders, analysts and investors. Adjusted EPS is also used as a basis for employee incentive bonuses. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted EPS is reported basic EPS available to Duke Energy Corporation common stockholders.\n\nSpecial items included in the periods presented include the following items, which management believes do not reflect ongoing costs:\n\n1. Workplace and Workforce Realignment represents costs attributable to business transformation, including long-term real estate strategy changes and workforce realignment.\n2. Regulatory Settlements represents an impairment charge related to the South Carolina Supreme Court decision on coal ash, insurance proceeds and Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress coal ash settlement and the partial settlements in the 2019 North Carolina rate cases.\n3. Gas Pipeline Investments represents costs related to the cancellation of the ACP investment and additional exit obligations.\n4. Severance represents the reversal of 2018 Severance charges, which were deferred as a result of a partial settlement in the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress 2019 North Carolina rate cases.\n5. Impairment Charges represents a reduction of a prior year impairment at Citrus County CC and an other-than-temporary impairment on the remaining investment in Constitution.\n\nDuke Energy\u2019s adjusted EPS may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of another company because other entities may not calculate the measure in the same manner.\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of reported EPS to adjusted EPS for 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n\n| Years Ended December 31, | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|--------------------------|------|------|------|\n| GAAP Reported Earnings/EPS | $4.94 | $1.72 | $5.06 |\n| Adjustments to Reported: |      |      |      |\n| Workplace and Workforce realignment | 0.20 | \u2013 | \u2013 |\n| Gas Pipeline Investments | 0.02 | 2.32 | \u2013 |\n| Regulatory Settlements | 0.09 | 1.19 | \u2013 |\n| Severance | \u2013 | (0.10) | \u2013 |\n| Impairment Charges | \u2013 | \u2013 | (0.01) |\n| Discontinued Operations | (0.01) | (0.01) | 0.01 |\n| Adjusted Diluted EPS | $5.24 | $5.12 | $5.06 |\n\nAdjusted EPS Guidance\n\nDuke Energy\u2019s 2021 ESG Report references Duke Energy\u2019s forecasted 2022 adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.30 to $5.60 per share. The materials also reference the forecasted 2022 adjusted EPS midpoint of approximately $5.45. In addition, the materials reference the long-term range of annual growth of 5% to 7% through 2026 off the midpoint of original 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.15. The forecasted adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure as it represents basic EPS available to Duke Energy Corporation common stockholders (GAAP reported EPS), adjusted for the per share impact of special items (as discussed under Adjusted EPS). Due to the forward-looking nature of this non-GAAP financial measure for future periods, information to reconcile it to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is not available at this time, as management is unable to project all special items for future periods, such as legal settlements, the impact of regulatory orders or asset impairments.\n\nDividend Payout Ratio\n\nThe materials for Duke Energy\u2019s ESG Report include a discussion of Duke Energy\u2019s long-term target dividend payout ratio of 65% to 75% based upon adjusted EPS. This payout ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure as it is based upon forecasted basic EPS from continuing operations available to Duke Energy Corporation stockholders, adjusted for the per share impact of special items, as discussed above under Adjusted EPS. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted EPS is reported basic EPS available to Duke Energy Corporation common stockholders. Due to the forward-looking nature of this non-GAAP financial measure for future periods, information to reconcile it to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is not available at this time, as management is unable to project all special items, as discussed above under Adjusted EPS Guidance.\n", "source": "duke_energy_2021", "added": "2025-04-26", "created": "2025-04-26", "metadata": {"Source-File": "climate_reports/additional_reports/duke_energy_2021.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.1.59", "pdf-total-pages": 70, "total-input-tokens": 161072, "total-output-tokens": 41642, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 43, 1], [43, 634, 2], [634, 2010, 3], [2010, 3671, 4], [3671, 7030, 5], [7030, 8790, 6], [8790, 12305, 7], [12305, 15554, 8], [15554, 15665, 9], [15665, 16074, 10], [16074, 19454, 11], [19454, 21149, 12], [21149, 24259, 13], [24259, 25293, 14], [25293, 26195, 15], [26195, 27756, 16], [27756, 29786, 17], [29786, 32512, 18], [32512, 37625, 19], [37625, 41396, 20], [41396, 43167, 21], [43167, 43233, 22], [43233, 46055, 23], [46055, 49027, 24], [49027, 51201, 25], [51201, 53754, 26], [53754, 56779, 27], [56779, 59386, 28], [59386, 64699, 29], [64699, 68475, 30], [68475, 71228, 31], [71228, 74225, 32], [74225, 76785, 33], [76785, 79264, 34], [79264, 83214, 35], [83214, 86307, 36], [86307, 89144, 37], [89144, 92705, 38], [92705, 92816, 39], [92816, 94563, 40], [94563, 98214, 41], [98214, 101236, 42], [101236, 102780, 43], [102780, 104674, 44], [104674, 107904, 45], [107904, 110613, 46], [110613, 112450, 47], [112450, 115518, 48], [115518, 118445, 49], [118445, 122127, 50], [122127, 124870, 51], [124870, 125578, 52], [125578, 132100, 53], [132100, 132169, 54], [132169, 135718, 55], [135718, 137232, 56], [137232, 138899, 57], [138899, 140960, 58], [140960, 143176, 59], [143176, 144630, 60], [144630, 148607, 61], [148607, 152330, 62], [152330, 155216, 63], [155216, 159461, 64], [159461, 161993, 65], [161993, 164811, 66], [164811, 166298, 67], [166298, 174085, 68], [174085, 179066, 69], [179066, 179066, 70]]}}
