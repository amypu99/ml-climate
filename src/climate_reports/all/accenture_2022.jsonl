With their smarts and hearts, they are truly redefining value with our clients and all our stakeholders, and we are grateful for all that they do.\n\nWe invite you to join us on this journey. Together, we can continue to turn our commitments into action that brings value\u2014and makes change\u2014in every direction.\n\nJulie Sweet\nChair and Chief Executive Officer\nOur approach to 360\u00b0 value reporting\n\nWe believe that transparency builds trust.\n\nTo underscore our commitment to delivering and reporting on 360\u00b0 value, we are publishing this first full 360\u00b0 Value Report in tandem with our online 360\u00b0 Value Reporting Experience. This approach will serve as our core annual reporting vehicle going forward.\n\nOur reporting captures how we deliver unique value across six vital dimensions\u2014Sustainability, Talent, Inclusion & Diversity, Client, Experience, and Financial\u2014and offers a comprehensive view of our financial and environmental, social and governance (ESG) measures, and our goals, progress and performance for each.\n\nWe continue to build on our long-standing partnership with the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and our commitment to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. In addition, we report against three ESG reporting frameworks\u2014the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) and the World Economic Forum International Business Council (WEF IBC) metrics\u2014while continuing to align with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, the Ten Principles of the UNGC and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP).\n\nAs reporting standards continue to evolve, we are well-positioned to report against standards issued by the International Sustainability Standards Board of the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation.\n\nTo measure 360\u00b0 value, we have developed the 360\u00b0 Value Meter, a framework across six dimensions: Financial, Experience, Sustainability, Talent, Inclusion & Diversity and Client (Accenture\u2019s Custom dimension is referred to as Client).\nOur goals & progress\n\nPath to net-zero\n\nUNGC Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0 Pledge\n\nIn alignment with the Paris Climate Agreement, we joined other leading companies and pledged to do our part to keep global warming below 1.5\u00b0 Celsius.\n\nMeet our science-based target by the end of 2025\n\nAchieved 68% reduction in total emissions from our 2016 baseline, surpassing our 2025 target to reduce absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 11%.\n\nScope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reduced by 91%, surpassing our goal of a 65% absolute reduction against our 2016 baseline.\n\nTotal emissions per unit of revenue reduced by 82%, surpassing our goal of reducing Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions per unit of revenue intensity by 40% against our 2016 baseline.\n\nNet-zero emissions by the end of 2025\n\nFocus first on actual reductions across our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions:\n\nAchieved 97% renewable electricity toward our goal of 100% by the end of 2023.\n\n68% of our key suppliers* disclosed targets and 75% disclosed actions toward our requirement that 90% of our key suppliers disclose their environmental targets and actions to reduce emissions by the end of 2025.\n\nInvested in nature-based carbon removals expected to remove an estimated 13 million+ metric tons of carbon over the next 20 years to address remaining emissions.\n\nMove to zero waste\n\n99% of our electronic waste from computers and workstations was reused or recycled toward our goal to reuse or recycle 100% of our e-waste, as well as all our office furniture, by the end of 2025.\n\nEthics & compliance\n\n98% of our people completed Ethics & Compliance training, achieving our annual goal to maintain 90%+ completion rates.\n\nSkills to Succeed\n\n1.6 million+ people worldwide equipped with the skills to make substantive improvements to their lives, for a total of 7.5 million+ since 2009.\n\nSupplier diversity\n\n217 graduates of our Diverse Supplier Development Program toward our goal of 250 graduates by end of fiscal 2023.\n\n*Key suppliers are defined as vendors that represent a significant portion of our 2019 Scope 3 emissions.\nOur goals & progress\n\nGender equality\n\nWomen now represent 47% of our workforce, closing the gap toward our goal to achieve gender parity\u2014for those whose gender is binary\u2014by 2025.\n\n29% of our managing directors are women, approaching our goal to grow the percentage of women managing directors to 30% by 2025.\n\nRace and ethnicity\n\nIncrease our race and ethnicity representation by 2025*\n\nUnited States\nAfrican American and Black colleagues represent 12.1% of our workforce, achieving our goal to increase African American and Black colleagues from 9% to 12%, ahead of schedule.\n\nAfrican American and Black colleagues represent 4.2% of our managing directors, approaching our goal to increase managing directors from 2.8% to 4.4%.\n\nHispanic American and Latinx colleagues represent 11.1% of our workforce and 4.5% of our managing directors, on the path to our goal to increase Hispanic American and Latinx colleagues from 9.5% to 13% and managing directors from 3.5% to 4.7%.\n\nUnited Kingdom\nBlack** colleagues represent 5.1% of our workforce and 12 of our managing directors, on the path to our goal to increase Black colleagues from 4% to 7% and more than double the number of our Black managing directors to 16 or more.\n\nSouth Africa\nAfrican Black colleagues represent 44.4% of our workforce.

In addition to advancing our own net-zero emissions and other environmental goals, we help our clients embed sustainability across their businesses, and innovate with our people and partners to support communities in crisis, including providing aid and opportunities to refugees.\n\n**FY2022 Highlights**\n- 97% renewable electricity in our locations\n- Our total carbon emissions decreased by 68% from our baseline\n- 99% of our e-waste relating to computers and workstations was reused or recycled\n- 98% of our people completed Ethics & Compliance training\n- 1.6M+ people worldwide equipped with the skills to make substantive improvements to their lives\nEnvironment\n\nAccenture is committed to environmental sustainability in how we operate our business, and we hold ourselves accountable to clear and measurable objectives. Our ambitious environmental goals address climate, waste and water.\n\nSince beginning our environmental journey in 2007, we have continually set challenging goals in alignment with climate science, but we cannot do it alone. We are dedicated to enabling global cooperation among our people, our clients, our suppliers and our partners to achieve a low-carbon future. Together, we can help to transform our global economy into a more sustainable marketplace.\n\nOur external commitments\n\nOur commitments to the leading standard-setting bodies on climate issues provide external validation for our carbon targets and guide the continuing evolution of our environmental commitments to reflect the latest climate science.\n\nScience-based target\n\nIn 2018, we set a target approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), a collaboration among CDP, the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), World Resources Institute and the World Wide Fund for Nature.\n\n- Our goal is to reduce our absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 11%. In fiscal 2022, our total emissions reduced by 68% from our 2016 baseline, surpassing one aspect of our 2025 target.\n- Our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reduced by 91%, surpassing our goal of a 65% absolute reduction against our 2016 baseline.\n- Our total emissions per unit of revenue reduced by 82%, surpassing our goal of reducing Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions per unit of revenue intensity by 40% from our baseline in 2016.\n\nBuilding on our long-standing commitment to reduce our emissions\u2014and reflecting our progress and increased ambitions\u2014we are setting a new science-based target aligned to 2030, with a base year of 2019. This new target has been submitted to the Science Based Targets initiative for approval.\n\nUNGC Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0 Pledge\n\nIn 2020, we signed the UNGC Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0 Pledge and joined leading companies in pledging to do our part to keep global warming below 1.5\u00b0 Celsius.\n\nMeet our science-based target by the end of 2025\n\nAchieved 68% reduction in total emissions from our 2016 baseline, surpassing our 2025 target to reduce absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 11%.\n\nScope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reduced by 91%, surpassing our goal of a 65% absolute reduction against our 2016 baseline.\n\nTotal emissions per unit of revenue reduced by 82%, surpassing our goal of reducing Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions per unit of revenue intensity by 40% against our 2016 baseline.\n\nNet-zero emissions by the end of 2025\n\nFocus first on actual reductions across our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.\n\nAchieved 97% renewable electricity toward our goal of 100% renewable electricity by the end of 2023.\n\n68% of our key suppliers* disclosed targets and 75% disclosed actions toward our requirement that 90% of our key suppliers disclose their environmental targets and actions to reduce emissions by the end of 2025.\n\nInvested in nature-based carbon removals expected to remove an estimated 13 million+ metric tons of carbon over the next 20 years to address remaining emissions.\n\n*Key suppliers are defined as vendors that represent a significant portion of our 2019 Scope 3 emissions.\nAchieve net-zero emissions by 2025\n\nWe have set a goal to achieve net-zero emissions by the end of 2025. Our approach is:\n\nCarbon reduction\n\nWe are focusing first on actual reductions across our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.\n\nOur environmental sustainability management is particularly focused on addressing climate change. Our most significant aspects relate to indirect emissions from Scope 2 electricity usage and Scope 3 emissions from business travel and purchased goods and services. Through continuous innovation, we are scaling solutions to make real, lasting change.\n\nRenewable electricity\n\nWe are committed to achieving 100% renewable electricity in our offices globally by the end of 2023. At the end of fiscal 2022, our mix of renewable electricity reached 97%, an improvement over 53% in fiscal 2021.\n\nBecause we do not own our office buildings and procure most of our energy from the grid, we increase our renewable electricity through contracts purchased from the grid or local renewable energy markets\u2014in line with the guidelines set by RE100, the global initiative bringing together hundreds of large and ambitious businesses committed to 100% renewable electricity.\n\nWe strive to purchase renewable electricity equivalent to the amount of electricity we use to power our global operations annually, which reduces our reported carbon emissions from electricity usage.\n\nAs we purchase more renewable electricity, we also support the generation of more renewable sources of electricity.\n\nWe also continue to drive energy efficiency. In fiscal 2022, we expanded our use of smart meters, which allows us to collect energy data at the source and quickly upload to our global environmental reporting system to inform our energy management decisions.\n\nResponsible travel\n\nAs a digital-first business, we use collaboration technology with agility and at scale to deliver for our clients. We are one of the largest enterprise users of Microsoft Teams in the world, using more than 18 billion minutes of audio and more than 18 billion minutes of video calls in fiscal 2022, hosted on Microsoft Azure Cloud powered with renewable energy. Our increased reliance on digital collaboration and ability to meet client needs without travel has led to more cost-efficient client delivery and reduced carbon emissions.\n\nWhen travel is necessary, we are equipping our people to make climate-smart travel decisions. For example:\n\n- Analytics and reporting help travelers and business runners identify opportunities to reduce travel or to use less carbon-intensive modes of travel.\n- We encourage the use of more carbon-efficient alternatives, such as rail, which is often much less carbon-intensive than air travel.\n- An aviation carbon calculator highlights actual emissions differences between flights to inform booking decisions.\n\nWe continue to use technology to facilitate more cost- and carbon-efficient delivery for our clients and our business, and we have implemented an internal carbon price on travel to encourage climate-smart travel decisions.\n\nOur industry partners are a key resource in reducing the carbon associated with travel. We are working with our air, hotel and ground transport providers to increase the availability of lower carbon choices for our travelers.\n\nResponsible buying\n\nJust as the emissions we generate in the service of our clients impact their emissions, our own suppliers contribute to our emissions.\n\nWe are working with our suppliers to reduce our Scope 3 emissions. Our goal is that 90% of our key suppliers* disclose their environmental targets and actions being taken to reduce emissions by 2025. We are making progress\u201468% of our key suppliers have disclosed targets and 75% have disclosed actions to reduce their emissions.\n\nOur industry partners are a key resource in reducing the carbon associated with travel. We are working with our air, hotel and ground transport providers to increase the availability of lower carbon choices for our travelers.\n\n*Key suppliers are defined as vendors that represent a significant portion of our 2019 Scope 3 emissions.\nCarbon removal\nTo address remaining emissions, we are investing in nature-based carbon removal solutions.\n\nNature-based carbon removal\nOur nature-based carbon removal solutions are generally expected to reforest land, rebuild biodiversity, make agriculture more sustainable, help create green jobs and allow natural ecosystems to rebound and thrive\u2014all while removing CO\u2082 from the atmosphere.\n\nOver the next 20 years, this program is expected to physically remove more than 13 million metric tons of carbon from the atmosphere. At the end of fiscal 2022, our nature-based carbon removal portfolio included projects in Indonesia, the Philippines, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nOur nature-based carbon removal projects will support and respect the universal principles of the UNGC in the relevant areas of human rights, labor, environment, anticorruption and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We have established reporting procedures to provide oversight of activities on the ground, quality control and alignment to the universal principles of the UNGC. Where technically feasible, our projects will be registered under the Sustainable Development Verified Impact Standard, verifying SDG outcomes along with the carbon removals.\n\nMove to zero waste\nTo move toward zero waste, we have committed to:\n\nReuse or recycle 100% of our e-waste, such as computers and servers, as well as all our office furniture, by the end of 2025.\n\n- During fiscal 2022, we reused or recycled 99% of our e-waste relating to computers and workstations. We continue our efforts to reuse or recycle other e-waste such as monitors and servers. While we already responsibly manage other forms of e-waste, we will expand our digital asset tracking of additional categories to include monitors, servers and uninterruptible power supply devices in fiscal 2023.\n\n- We extended our asset tracking system to include our furniture assets\u2014this allows more comprehensive management, including refurbishment and reuse to extend the life cycle of our furniture assets. The data also allows us a more comprehensive view of the global furniture marketplace to optimize our partnerships with vendors offering Cradle to Cradle certification\u2014the global standard for products that are safe, circular and responsibly made\u2014and other zero-waste credentials.\n\nEliminate single-use plastics in our locations. We continue to advance our programs in this area, pivoting to purchasing reusable and plastic-free items in our locations around the world.\nPlan for water risk\nTo promote business continuity and resilience due to climate change-related risks, we are planning to mitigate the potential impacts of water risk by the end of 2025.\n\nWe proactively analyze our water risk using the World Resources Institute Aqueduct tool.\n\nTo safeguard our people and operations, we are developing plans to reduce the impact of flooding, drought and water scarcity on our business and our people in high-risk areas. In addition to developing water resiliency plans, we now measure and report water use in these locations.\n\nAlthough Accenture is not a water-intensive company, we minimize our use of water wherever feasible, including responsible use, reuse, management and discharge across our office portfolio. We are particularly conscious of our locations in water-stressed areas.\n\nInvesting in a low-carbon future\nTo unlock shared value for both business and society, we are committed to investing in a low-carbon future.\n\nSustainable aviation fuel\nAs a signatory of the World Economic Forum\u2019s Clean Skies for Tomorrow sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) pledge, which includes an aviation industry goal of flying on 10% SAF by 2030, we are committed to purchasing SAF with our partners and only doing so from socially and ethically beneficial sources.\n\nNature and biodiversity\nWe are taking action for nature through our goals on climate, waste and water, including supporting biodiversity through initiatives such as our nature-based carbon removals, as well as engaging our people to act for nature and biodiversity through our Eco Action initiative.\n\nAlthough our direct impact on nature is low, due to our location footprint being comprised largely of leased office space in urban areas, other examples of our commitment to nature and biodiversity include:\n\n- **Pledges**: We are a member of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures Forum, and we have signed pledges from Get Nature Positive, Terra Carta and Business for Nature\u2014acknowledging that we cannot decouple nature loss and climate change.\n- **Collaborating for action**: In a collaboration between Accenture, the U.K. Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Council for Sustainable Business (CSB), we launched the Get Nature Positive (GNP) handbook, which aims to support businesses on their journey to protecting, restoring and sustainably using nature, and to position nature-positive actions as key to reaching net-zero targets.\n  - We are now partnering with, and supporting, global NGO Business for Nature, alongside their 75+ partners including the World Economic Forum (WEF), We Mean Business, World Business Council for Sustainable Development, International Chamber of Commerce, Capitals Coalition, World Wide Fund for Nature and many others to bring GNP to a global audience as part of broader efforts to scale and speed up business action to address nature loss.\n\n- **Community investment**: Our investments in this area include projects such as helping Conservation International build a tool that will allow Indigenous communities to process and manage wildlife insights data collected on their lands. The tool will enable communities to produce reports to validate and demonstrate their current wildlife management practices and provide insights on wildlife species they depend on for their livelihoods.\n\nPlanting trees to celebrate our people\nIn support of our overall commitment to sustainability, and to recognize the importance of each of our people around the world, we are planting 674,000 trees\u2014one to represent each person at Accenture at the time of our announcement in December 2021. So far, more than 350,000 of our trees have been planted in Canada, Denmark, India, Ireland, Malawi, New Zealand, South Africa and Thailand.\n\nImpact from these projects includes:\n\n- **In Denmark**, improving conditions for key species, with the aim of long-term improvement in biodiversity.\n- **In India**, small farmers planting fruit trees to create sustainable livelihoods. The project also employs a local workforce consisting of widowed and elderly women, who face many inequalities in already marginalized communities.\n- **In Thailand**, working with small farmers to increase forest coverage and organizing tree-planting events with local primary and secondary schools to raise awareness for environmental literacy.\n\nThe trees will eventually be planted in 14 countries across six continents in regions where our people live and work.\nEnvironmental Responsibility Policy\n\nReducing our environmental impact is built into our Code of Business Ethics (COBE) and our core values, specifically Stewardship. These inform our Environmental Responsibility Policy, which was established in 2007 and is reviewed annually. In addition, industry-wide external certifications, such as ISO\u00ae 14001, demonstrate our commitment to running our business responsibly and sustainably, and to integrating environmental practices into our operations. Accenture\u2019s Environment Management System is ISO\u00ae 14001-certified globally.\nEthics & governance\n\nOur commitment to ethics, human rights and strong corporate governance is a key driver of our business strategy and is essential to safeguarding our people, clients, brand and financial performance. It is the foundation on which we build trust.\n\nOur clear corporate governance structure and Ethics & Compliance program\u2014grounded in our core values and Code of Business Ethics (COBE)\u2014guide our strategic business decisions and actions as we strive to foster a culture of integrity, transparency, inclusivity and respect for all people.\n\nWe believe a shared ethical culture is critical to our growth in a competitive marketplace. Our clients involve us in some of the most sensitive areas of their business, in part because of our integrity and commitment to the highest ethical standards, as evidenced by our long-term client relationships around the world. Of our top 100 clients, 99 have been our partners for more than 10 years.\n\nOversight of ESG\n\nThe core of our growth strategy is delivering 360\u00b0 value to our clients, people, shareholders, partners and communities. To drive change for our clients, and for our business, we work across a spectrum of environmental, social and governance (ESG) priorities\u2014and help our stakeholders do the same\u2014contributing to the creation of a more sustainable world for all.\n\nAt Accenture, responsibility for ESG matters starts at the top, with our Board actively overseeing our ESG strategies and progress in meeting our ESG-related commitments, and cascades throughout the business. As part of this, we have implemented a clear and comprehensive governance structure designed to help us achieve our goals and reflect our objectives throughout the organization while guiding our strategic approach.\n\nThe Nominating, Governance & Sustainability Committee is responsible for overseeing our overall ESG performance, disclosure, strategies, goals and objectives, and monitoring evolving ESG risks. In carrying out its responsibilities, the Nominating, Governance & Sustainability Committee receives periodic reports throughout the year from management on key ESG matters, including the Sustainability Services we provide to clients, our actions around being a responsible company and citizen, our progress in meeting our ESG-related commitments, and our integrated reporting, which demonstrates our commitment to transparency and accountability of our goals and progress.\n\nIn addition, the Compensation, Culture & People Committee is responsible for overseeing our strategies related to our people, including matters such as pay equity, inclusion and diversity, leadership succession and culture; and the Audit Committee oversees our approach to the quality of ESG-related data and controls.\n\nOur Global Management Committee (GMC) sponsors our responsible company strategies. These senior leaders, spanning multiple corporate functions, industries, services and geographies, engage on these topics and are responsible for implementing strategies, goals and policies. Together, they make strategic recommendations and decisions on our ESG initiatives, including sponsorship of our non-financial goals.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we formed a newly structured ESG Executive Committee, made up of a subset of the GMC, accountable for approving strategic global decisions aligned to Accenture\u2019s corporate environmental sustainability commitments and growth objectives. Our ESG Executive Committee and steering committee (which is comprised of leaders across Accenture) meet regularly to monitor our environmental performance, identify improvement areas and elevate matters to the Board as appropriate through the GMC.\nBuilding a strong ethical culture\n\nWe rely on our core values and COBE to not only inform our behavior but also help all our people make ethical choices and consider the full impact of their decisions. Accenture has been recognized on Ethisphere\u2019s 2022 World\u2019s Most Ethical Companies list, our 15th consecutive year on the list and a testament to our dedication to ethical leadership, compliance practices and sustainability.\n\nWe offer a broad range of resources to help our people better understand and fully engage with our COBE, including annual required Ethics & Compliance training, a Making Good Decisions tool, our COBE toolkit with downloadable job aids, and internal and external platforms for raising concerns, including anonymously.\n\nOur core values\n\nOur values shape our culture and define our character. We live our core values through individual behaviors that guide how we act and make decisions.\n\nClient value creation\n\nEnabling clients to become high-performance businesses and creating long-term relationships by being responsive and relevant and by consistently delivering value.\n\nOne global network\n\nLeveraging the power of global insight, relationships, collaboration and learning to deliver exceptional service to clients wherever they do business.\n\nRespect for the individual\n\nValuing diversity and unique contributions, fostering a trusting, open and inclusive environment and treating each person in a manner that reflects Accenture\u2019s values.\n\nBest people\n\nAttracting, developing and retaining the best talent for our business, challenging our people, demonstrating a \u201ccan-do\u201d attitude and fostering a collaborative and supportive environment.\n\nIntegrity\n\nBeing ethically unyielding and honest and inspiring trust by saying what we mean, matching our behaviors to our words and taking responsibility for our actions.\n\nStewardship\n\nFulfilling our obligation of building a better, stronger and more durable company for future generations, protecting the Accenture brand, meeting our commitment to stakeholders, acting with an owner mentality, developing our people and helping improve communities and the global environment.\nEthics & Compliance training\n\nWe continue to evolve our required Ethics & Compliance training with shorter, interactive and visually engaging courses. Our people (including part-time employees) must complete all required Ethics & Compliance training by July 31 each year to be fully eligible for year-end rewards (as permitted by law). In fiscal 2022, we achieved completion rates of 98% for Accenture people, including managing directors and our GMC. As part of our Ethics & Compliance training, we offer a module on anticorruption, which is required for all executives (managers and above) and people at all levels in certain corporate functions. We had a 99% completion rate for this module.\n\nOur training curriculum includes courses to build our people\u2019s knowledge and support for inclusion and diversity. There is a mandatory training on identifying, speaking up and reporting racism in the United States, Canada, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and all of Europe, including the United Kingdom and Ireland.\n\nWe continually assess and refine our Ethics & Compliance program, including how we train our people. Our approach provides a baseline of training to all Accenture people, including part-time employees and contractors. Contractors with access to systems are also required to complete assigned Ethics & Compliance training within 60 days of onboarding in our Sustainable Procurement Hub, and may face revocation of access to systems or even termination if they fail to do so.\n\nOur goal is to maintain our high completion rates for training globally and to continue to evaluate our training (including through user feedback) to make sure it remains relevant and effective. Individuals in higher-risk roles and markets receive additional anticorruption and other compliance training, including training led by our local Legal teams in high-risk markets.\n\nAnticorruption policies and compliance\n\nOur COBE and related anticorruption policies, which are both part of our global Ethics & Compliance program and human rights efforts, require our people, business partners and business intermediaries (and suppliers through our Supplier Standards of Conduct) to comply with anticorruption laws everywhere we do business, including:\n\n- U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)\n- Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions\n- United Nations Convention against Corruption\n- U.K. Bribery Act\n- Other applicable anticorruption laws\n\nWe are a member\u2014and our Chair and CEO is the co-chair\u2014of the World Economic Forum Partnering Against Corruption Initiative, a cross-industry collaborative effort that unites companies that have a zero-tolerance policy toward bribery and corruption in any form.\n\nIn the past year, we again worked with outside counsel\u2014including the former head of the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s FCPA division\u2014to conduct a compliance review to evaluate the risk of our Anticorruption program. The assessment confirmed that our Anticorruption program continues to be among the most advanced and forward-thinking programs in the world.\nReporting concerns and transparency\n\nWe encourage and empower our people to speak up safely and confidently if they experience, see or become aware of any inappropriate behavior, including any form of disrespect, harassment, racism, discrimination or retaliation\u2014or have any concerns about unethical or illegal behavior. And we have zero tolerance for retaliation.\n\nWe offer our people many ways to raise a concern\u2014through our leaders, through anyone in Human Resources or Legal, and anonymously through our Accenture Business Ethics Helpline\u2014and once they do, we make it clear what to expect.\n\nWe also encourage our people to escalate a concern without fear of retaliation if they do not receive an acceptable response from their first point of contact. We take all concerns raised seriously, including allegations of retaliation.\n\nWe investigate 100% of concerns reported to HR, Legal or the Accenture Business Ethics Helpline, and seek to confirm the facts in a professional, methodical, thoughtful and balanced manner. Once we get to the facts, we determine appropriate outcomes and endeavor to apply them fairly and consistently on a global basis\u2014regardless of seniority, position or contribution to Accenture.\n\nGreater transparency\u2014from what happens after our people raise a concern to the resulting outcomes\u2014is an important element in helping our people speak up. We promote greater transparency through a dedicated internal site where our people can find out:\n\n- How to raise a concern.\n- How to find support once they raise a concern.\n- How the investigation process works.\n- How we protect reporting parties.\n- How we have zero tolerance for any form of retaliation against anyone who raises a concern.\n\nThis site also reports aggregated internal data on a global percentage basis about the types of conduct-based matters that were investigated in the previous fiscal year and their outcomes.\n\nFurther increasing transparency, we make public our policy on Speaking Up and Zero Tolerance for Retaliation, which outlines how employees can raise a concern (including formal grievances if required) and reporting and escalation procedures.\n\nGuiding our people\u2019s behaviors\n\nThe first fundamental behavior in our COBE is \u201cMake Your Conduct Count.\u201d It articulates five locally relevant yet globally applicable standards to guide how our people think and act across our unique and diverse culture:\n\n- We speak up about concerns, knowing Accenture never tolerates retaliation.\n- We treat each other with respect.\n- We are proud to be ambassadors of Accenture, and we act accordingly.\n- We apply our principle of meritocracy when we make decisions about our people.\n- We ensure our personal interests and relationships do not create conflicts for Accenture.\n\nThis framework creates a foundation for a positive, respectful and inclusive work environment that can inspire our people; reflects who we are and who we want to be as a company; and guides how we work with clients, our partners and each other.\n\nWe believe these ethical behaviors are critical to the success of our business and continue to include them in our required Ethics & Compliance training. We monitor our ethical environment through anonymous surveys of our people at regular intervals.\nData privacy and information security\n\nSafeguarding data is one of our most important responsibilities in building and maintaining trust, not only with our people, but also with our clients and others. Beyond specific regional legal requirements, we apply strict data privacy and security standards to all information, everywhere. All our people have a personal responsibility to practice effective and responsible data management in accordance with our policies, including our Data Privacy Policy and procedures, our Binding Corporate Rules, as well as new and changing global regulations and jurisprudence.\n\nThis responsibility serves as a cornerstone of all we do. The Audit Committee of our Board continues to have oversight of our information technology risk exposures, including cybersecurity, data privacy and data security.\n\nWhile many of our people have returned to office spaces, others continue to work in remote and hybrid work environments. This complex work model, partnered with potential business risks associated with ongoing geopolitical tensions, reinforces the need for a proactive, cyber-resilient approach to keep data safe across our business, our people and our clients.\n\nFor example:\n\n- We adhere to the highest and strictest information protection and privacy standards for handling and protecting personal data, as evidenced by our global certifications for Information Security (ISO\u00ae 27001:2013) and Data Privacy (ISO\u00ae 27701:2019). These certifications acknowledge that Accenture complies with the highest, strictest standards for handling and protecting personal data everywhere, and demonstrates accountability. We were the first global organization to be ISO\u00ae 27701-certified by the British Standards Institution (BSI) globally, across both our Enterprise and Client Service Business.\n\n- We work hard to uphold global data protection and privacy requirements, including the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and other data privacy laws in countries where we do business.\n\n- Our Enterprise and Client Data Protection programs define the stewardship of Accenture and client information. They define our management processes and controls, in accordance with relevant information protection and privacy laws. BSI has rated Accenture as highest for all U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) at the Adaptive (Tier 4) implementation-level maturity for our Global Enterprise Services and Client Data Protection Program. Periodic independent assessments by BSI continue for maintenance and re-certification purposes.\n\n- We take security seriously, with extensive training and learning assets. All Accenture people regularly participate in required and targeted data privacy training. Further, our global awareness campaign, Protecting Accenture: Live Smart to Stay Safe, equips our people with the latest best practice learnings and behaviors necessary to maintain safe data security hygiene. Beyond completing our required data security training, our people participate in our Information Security Advocate program, a self-paced training program designed to strengthen awareness and adoption of secure behaviors.\n\nIn addition to keeping Accenture, our people and our clients protected through advanced internal security practices, technologies and controls, we serve as a global provider of managed security services, helping our clients with comprehensive security solutions that span strategy development, risk management, cyber defense, digital identity, application and managed security services.\nResponsible AI\n\nResponsible artificial intelligence (AI) is the practice of designing, developing and deploying AI with good intention to empower employees and businesses, and fairly impact customers and society.\n\nAt Accenture, we are acutely sensitive to our role in innovating responsibly and consider AI and related technologies one of our highest ESG priorities. As AI decisions increasingly influence and impact people\u2019s lives, the responsibility of enterprises to manage the potential ethical and sociotechnical implications of AI adoption also grows.\n\nWhen we think about these implications, issues such as bias/fairness and transparency/explainability become paramount. Businesses cannot expect to scale data and AI effectively within their organizations\u2014and thus ultimately realize the business value of the technology\u2014without embedding Responsible AI into their approach from the beginning.\n\nTo create trust and build confidence in AI, we work with our clients to translate ethical principles and academic research into practical, measurable metrics and methodologies that can be embedded into everyday processes. We take a cross-functional, multidisciplinary approach and provide our clients with strategic leadership and technical tools across the spectrum of AI governance, risk management, accountability, explainability and cultural adoption.\n\nWe have defined four pillars of Responsible AI based on what we\u2019ve learned from implementing our solutions with clients:\n\n- **Principles and governance**: Define and articulate a Responsible AI mission and principles while establishing a transparent governance structure across the organization that builds confidence and trust in AI technologies.\n- **Risk, policy and control**: Strengthen compliance with current laws and regulations while monitoring future ones, develop policies to mitigate risk, and operationalize those policies through a risk management framework with regular reporting and monitoring.\n- **Technology and enablers**: Develop tools and techniques to support principles such as fairness, explainability, robustness, traceability and privacy, and build them into AI systems and platforms.\n- **Culture and training**: Empower leadership to elevate Responsible AI as a critical business imperative and provide training to enable all employees to have a clear understanding of Responsible AI principles and criteria for success.\n\nBusiness continuity\n\nOur approach to managing disruptions is based on years of experience, preparation and adapting the way we manage and deliver services. Our business resilience strategy supports how we operate as a company, starting with our global client base, underpinned by internal functions and technology, and supported by the collaborations of our third-party ecosystem. Accenture\u2019s business resilience program is aligned to industry standards (ISO\u00ae 22301, ISO\u00ae 20000, ISO\u00ae 27001 and ISO\u00ae 27701). For more information, see our business continuity case study. As society continues moving to a digital-first reality, promoting human rights and setting industry standards are top of mind as we adapt our offerings to reflect this new collective consciousness.\nCorporate governance: practices and policies\n\nWe have a history of strong corporate governance and believe that good governance is critical to achieving long-term shareholder value. We are committed to governance practices and policies that serve the long-term interests of Accenture and our stakeholders.\n\nAccenture\u2019s corporate governance matters are described in our 2022 Proxy Statement, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on December 13, 2022, as well as our Corporate Governance Guidelines and committee charters, which are all found on our corporate website.\n\nThese documents outline the role of our Board and its committees and our key governance practices, as well as the experience, qualifications, attributes and skills of our directors. We are especially proud that this mix contributes to our 9 director nominees being 56% racially and ethnically diverse* and 56% women.\n\n*For the purposes of this report, racial and ethnic diversity of our directors is based on self-reported EEO-1 categories. Please see our 2022 Proxy Statement for further information.\n\nOur practices and policies\n\nThe following summarizes some highlights of our corporate governance practices and policies:\n\n- Annual election of directors\n- 100% independent Board committees\n- Shareholders holding 10% or more of our outstanding share capital have the right to convene a special meeting\n- 8 of 9 director nominees are independent\n- Strong independent Lead Director, elected by the independent directors\n- Annual Board, committee and individual director evaluations and self-assessments\n- Active shareholder engagement\n- Proxy access right\n- Regular executive sessions, where independent directors meet without management present\n- Robust director selection process resulting in a diverse and international Board in terms of gender, race, ethnicity, experience, perspectives, skills and tenure\n- Policy on political contributions and lobbying\n\n- Board takes active role in Board succession planning and is committed to Board refreshment\n- Active Board oversight of strategy, risk management and environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters\n- Committee oversight of ESG performance, disclosure, strategies, goals, objectives, risks and opportunities, as well as strategies related to our people, including pay equity, inclusion and diversity, leadership succession and risks\n- Board diversity policy to actively seek out women and underrepresented candidates\n- Director policy limiting service to three other public company boards or two other public company boards if the director is a public company chief executive officer\n- Formalized committee oversight to cover political, lobbying and other grassroots advocacy activities and related policies and practices\nBoard diversity\nof our nine director nominees:\n\nGender\n- 56% Women\n- 44% Men\n\nEthnicity\n- 56% Racially and ethnically diverse*\n- 22% Hispanic or Latino\n- 11% Black or African American\n- 11% Asian\n\nBoard committees chaired by women\n- 50% of committees\n\nBoard committees chaired by racially and ethnically diverse directors*\n- 75% of committees\n\nSignificant board refreshment\n- 3 New directors over past 5 years\n\nAge distribution\n- 63 Average age of director nominees\n  Age range: 55-68\n\nBoard tenure\n- 6.4 years average tenure\n\n- <2 years: 1\n- 2-6 years: 3\n- >6 years: 5\n\nNumber of directors\n\n*Racial and ethnic diversity is based on self-reported EEO-1 categories.\nHuman rights\n\nAccenture Global Human Rights Statement\n\nOur commitment\n\nAccenture has been a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) since 2008.\n\nAs stated in our Code of Business Ethics (COBE), we seek to align to the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We therefore focus our human rights efforts on those areas that are most relevant to our business and operations in terms of potential human rights impacts. We also recognize that our clients and other stakeholders increasingly seek visibility into our human rights practices and policies.\n\nWe continue to review our human rights efforts, as well as best practices in the marketplace, to assess how we can further strengthen our commitments. In cases where it is unclear how to apply the law in a way that is consistent with our human rights principles, we are guided by our core values and COBE to support and respect the principles of internationally recognized human rights.\n\nWe also adhere to relevant international instruments and documents, including the International Labour Organization\u2019s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, in addition to the UN Guiding Principles.\n\nOur human rights governance\n\nWe recognize that support and respect for human rights is an integral part of our sustainability commitments. The ESG steering committee has responsibility across all operational sustainability topics, including human rights governance and strategic decision making. This committee is chaired by our Senior Managing Director and Executive Director \u2013 Corporate Services & Sustainability and Business Operations.\n\nOur human rights priorities\n\nWe focus our human rights efforts on areas most relevant to our business and operations in terms of potential human rights impacts:\n\n- Diversity and equal opportunity\n- Health, safety and security\n- Employment conditions and working practices\n- Supply chain\n- Data privacy\n- Anticorruption\n\nWe also adhere to relevant international instruments and documents, including the International Labour Organization\u2019s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, in addition to the UN Guiding Principles.\n\nHuman rights and our supply chain\n\nBecause of the global scale and diversity of our business, we prioritize our supply chain due diligence efforts by focusing on areas that align with our priorities; areas where we can appropriately make the most impact; and areas of heightened concern or in higher-risk geographies.\n\nWe recognize the importance of assessing potential risks to rightsholders. We continually review, adapt and incorporate human rights due diligence across our enterprise risk management systems and legal compliance processes, in addition to across our supply chain.\n\nOur relationships with our suppliers help us amplify our human rights commitment. Our Supplier Standards of Conduct (SSoC), which supplements our COBE, sets out the standards and practices that Accenture suppliers are required to uphold or make an equivalent commitment. In turn, Accenture expects our suppliers to apply our SSoC to their own suppliers.\nWe work to be thoughtful and targeted in how we select and engage our suppliers, particularly in relation to higher-risk sectors and countries, and as our business evolves. For example, we worked with a third-party specialist to help prepare our first Conflict Minerals Report by reviewing our supply chain for products that contain 3TG minerals (tin, tungsten, tantalum or gold).\n\nWe are committed to doing business ethically and legally, and we seek to leverage our global buying power to advance human rights.\n\nWe continue to invest in new technology and processes to help us have greater visibility into the ESG performance of our suppliers. We are proud of the launch of our Sustainable Procurement Hub (The Hub), which we are rolling out globally. This new technology platform will enhance and provide greater transparency from our direct suppliers about their own human rights policies, due diligence and inclusive practices.\n\nThe Hub supports how we make ethical purchasing decisions, onboard our suppliers and assess their ESG progress. It is also a vital part of our compliance with supply chain due diligence requirements, including Germany\u2019s Supply Chain Act and Norway\u2019s Transparency Act.\nRaising concerns\nWe encourage our people, suppliers and subcontractors to raise ethical and legal concerns, including potential human rights issues, and we provide a range of secure channels for them to do so confidentially, and anonymously where allowed by law.\n\nWe provide a mechanism to enable our suppliers\u2019 employees to speak up about legal or ethical concerns, including slavery and human trafficking. Employees of Accenture suppliers may report concerns or violations (anonymously, where permitted by local law) through the Accenture Business Ethics Helpline.\n\nAnyone with an ethical or human rights concern about Accenture\u2019s supply chains or organization can contact the helpline by phone or online:\n\n- A free phone number\u2014+1 312 737 8262 (or in India, +1 888 276 6226; access code 000-117)\u2014is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n- Online inquiries can be submitted to our Business Ethics Helpline website.\n- All queries are handled by an independent team confidentially\u2014and, where allowed by law, anonymously.\n\nWhether internal or external, we treat all concerns seriously and in strict confidence. We protect anyone who raises, in good faith, a concern about a human rights issue or who assists us, or a law enforcement authority, by providing information to address such a concern.\n\nLiving wage\nAccenture continues to drive the adoption of a living wage with our suppliers around the world. Our Supplier Standards of Conduct strongly encourages our suppliers to pay a living wage (or higher) to people who provide services directly to our company and/or our clients.\n\nModern slavery, child labor and human trafficking\nOur long-standing commitment to human rights includes eliminating modern slavery, child labor and human trafficking in our supply chains. Given the nature of our business and supply chains, and the risk assessments we have undertaken to date, we believe the risk of modern slavery, child labor and human trafficking in our supply chains is low.\n\nHowever, we are not complacent and frequently review how we can improve and evolve in response to changing circumstances and our evolving business.\n\nOur Modern Slavery Transparency Statement provides more information about our efforts. While this statement is required by law in the United Kingdom and Australia, it also covers our commitment beyond these jurisdictions.\n\nConflict minerals\nAccenture\u2019s Supplier Inclusion & Sustainability team has a dedicated focus on conflict minerals in our supply chain. Given the recent evolution of our Industry X business into hardware manufacturing, this work is a vital part of how we address modern slavery across our global supply chain. For more information, see our Conflict Minerals Report.\nSupply chain\n\nThe size and scale of our supply chain affords us the opportunity to drive a culture of responsible buying. As we continue to grow as a company, we recognize our responsibility to deliver long-term value to society through our clients, suppliers and communities.\n\nProcurement Plus\n\nOur overarching approach shapes how we work with suppliers to promote sustainability. Beyond transactional procurement, Procurement Plus addresses four thematic pillars to advance responsible buying: the environment, human rights, supplier inclusion and diversity, and the future of work. This approach informs every aspect of our supply chain, building stronger partnerships based on ethical behaviors, transparency, agility and inclusivity.\n\nResponsible procurement\n\nOur Procurement Plus buying program influences key initiatives such as our award-winning Supplier Inclusion & Sustainability Program. We are committed to driving responsible buying practices for ourselves and for the wider marketplace. We have shared insights into our approach on sustainability during business reviews with select suppliers. We continue to focus on priority areas such as environment, human rights, supplier inclusion and diversity, and our Supplier Standards of Conduct (SSoC).\n\nOur ethical procurement strategy\n\nAs we continue to build supply chains that are more sustainable and inclusive, we recognize the need for an ethical procurement strategy that is reflective of our core values and our Code of Business Ethics (COBE). Our ethical procurement strategy is an underlying component of our business practice and influences applicable training for Accenture people, selection criteria for suppliers and the development of our standards for conducting business with our suppliers.\n\nTo encourage broader transparency within our supply chains, we require our suppliers to adhere to our SSoC, which supplement our COBE, or to make an equivalent commitment. We communicate the standards through a range of mechanisms, including contractual terms and conditions, the Supplier\u2019s Guide to Doing Business with Accenture, as well as our purchase order process. We continue to reiterate our commitment to our standards through communication to 100% of suppliers that are included in our supplier management program.* We have invested in further developing and strengthening our governance framework (for suppliers who agree to an equivalent) in line with our new Sustainable Procurement Hub operating model.\n\nOur SSoC reflects our support of the Ten Principles of the UNGC\u2014and we have continued to lead by example in upholding these principles since we signed the UNGC in 2008. These standards are published in 20 languages and set out the labor standards, human rights principles, and other legal and ethical standards we require our SSoC to uphold when conducting business.\n\nWe also expect our suppliers to apply these standards to their own suppliers, thereby continuing the impact of our ethical procurement strategy. We continue to evolve our global SSoC in line with our commitment to responsible business. For example, in fiscal 2022, we updated our trade control requirements.\n\nAdditionally, we review our supply chain strategy annually through the lens of our COBE and the UNGC Ten Principles as part of our efforts to set industry standards for maintaining an ethical supply chain. This is particularly important as part of our continuing efforts to encourage our suppliers to pay a living wage.\n\nPayment certainty\n\nWe realize the economic certainty that prompt payments can provide a supplier, whether a FORTUNE 500 company or a SME. In the United Kingdom, we are a signatory to the voluntary Prompt Payment Code, which requires a continual focus on ensuring that we pay our suppliers on time, within the payment terms agreed. We consistently make more than 95% of our U.K. payments within 60 days, as required by the code. Our Payment on Time Centre of Excellence and technology investment drives continuous improvements in this area. We are proud to be leaders in shifting the payment culture to be more efficient and fairer.\n\n*Our supplier management program includes third party suppliers with whom Accenture has a direct and enduring contractual relationship.\nDriving supplier sustainability\n\nIn our drive for responsible buying excellence, we work continuously through relevant networks with our industry peers and clients to adopt sustainable practices and are continually improving our supplier and contractor management processes. We encourage a responsible buying culture by advocating for supply chains that are more sustainable and inclusive, both inside and outside our company.\n\nPromoting supplier engagement\n\nWe actively work toward increasing the number of suppliers reporting their sustainability performance\u2014for example, the percentage of suppliers that report emissions reduction targets and actions or regularly assess their own supply chains.\n\nSustainable Procurement Hub\n\nWe continue to invest in new technology and processes to help us have greater visibility into environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance of our suppliers. The Hub (introduced on p. 24) which launched in fiscal 2021 and continues to roll out globally, is providing greater transparency from our suppliers about their own human rights policies and sustainability practices. The tool also allows us to perform due diligence processes to inform our buyer selection decisions, onboarding and ad hoc ESG assessments. The Hub is currently operational in over 30 countries with further deployments and program enhancements planned in fiscal 2023. We have utilized The Hub to conduct more than 3,000 sustainability assessments to better understand our suppliers\u2019 ESG performance.\n\nCarbon disclosure\n\nWe expect our suppliers to prioritize sustainability and provide updates on their environmental initiatives, goals and impact. As a corporate member of CDP\u2019s Supply Chain Program, we use CDP tools as well as The Hub to promote engagement, transparency and sustainable practices with our suppliers.\n\nFor example, since 2010 we have invited select suppliers to respond to CDP\u2019s supply chain self-assessment questionnaire. As of December 1, 2022, 68% of key suppliers disclosed their targets and 75% disclosed the actions they are taking, up from 58% and 60% as of December 1, 2021, respectively.\n\nWe know that addressing this area of emissions is a priority to drive action toward responsible business decisions. Increasingly, our suppliers are collectively using more emission-reducing energy sources, minimizing the footprint of their goods and services, and adapting to customer preferences in their reporting.\n\nAs part of our goal to reach net-zero by the end of 2025, we set an ambitious target requiring 90% of our key suppliers* to disclose their environmental targets and actions being taken to reduce emissions.\n\n*Key suppliers are defined as vendors that represent a significant portion of our 2019 Scope 3 emissions.\n\nWorking with our clients\n\nWe continue to support our clients who seek value delivered by including supplier inclusion and diversity in sourcing. For example, leveraging our global Supplier Inclusion & Sustainability model and experience, we helped develop a responsible sourcing strategy and operating model for a global bank. The strategy leveraged ESG Book analytics, set a comprehensive direction for the bank\u2019s procurement function to deliver on its net-zero and diversity and inclusion priorities, and provided a suite of toolkits and training for procurement, business and supplier engagement.\n\nTo further advance awareness of the positive impact procurement has on sustainability, Accenture has joined forces with The Sustainable Procurement Pledge (SPP). The SPP is a global, nonprofit community of procurement professionals that aims to embed sustainability in their daily activities. SPP empowers and equips procurement professionals with access to the right knowledge, tools and behavior. Accenture is supporting these efforts and participating in the leadership and advisory panels.\nSustainability Services and partnerships\n\nSustainability Services\n\nEvery business must be a sustainable business\n\nAccenture has identified sustainability as one of the five key forces of change that companies must harness to lead in the next decade. As consumers, employees, business partners, regulators and investors demand that companies move from commitment to action, we believe every business must be a sustainable business\u2014a growth engine for new markets, new products and new services.\n\nSustainability is a priority in what we do for our clients\u2014and how we operate our own business. We continue to expand and evolve our portfolio of Sustainability Services to meet the changing needs of our clients and support the imperative to act on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. We are meeting that demand in three ways:\n\nCreate: Our comprehensive suite of sustainability-focused services helps our clients not only set goals but also shape and deliver on their transformation roadmap. We continue to develop new offerings, evolve our existing offerings and co-create with our ecosystem partners to deliver measurable business value and sustainable impact for our clients.\n\nEmbed: We embed ESG capabilities into our offerings across our core business, and this will continue to increase in scope and scale over the coming years. This is what we believe is required to address both the sustainability challenges facing the world, as well as the demands of our clients\u2019 stakeholders to demonstrate action beyond ambition.\n\nInnovate: We engage our partners to innovate with us by embedding sustainability in core business tools and processes our clients use to make decisions daily. This includes co-developing sustainability-focused products and services that open new growth opportunities, enhance their business and translate technology into solutions.\n\nTogether with our partners, we are helping the world\u2019s leading organizations simultaneously become more sustainable and competitive, and build the resilience of their business to address climate change and achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\n\u201cSustainability is going to be the next digital and every business will be a sustainable business. This is why we are working toward embedding sustainability into everything we do, and with everyone we work with.\u201d\n\nJulie Sweet\nChair & Chief Executive Officer\nCreating and evolving Sustainability Services\n\nDrawing across all parts of our business, and collaborating with our partners, we help our clients reinvent their businesses at scale, creating business value and sustainable impact for all stakeholders. To advance our clients toward their sustainability goals, we offer a full suite of Sustainability Services:\n\nSustainability Strategy\n\nSustainability Strategy underpins all our Sustainability Services as we guide clients to define their sustainability ambitions, build the business case, and develop sustainability and technology roadmaps to deliver compressed transformation at scale. We lead C-suite conversations and architect solutions that enable system-level transformations and deliver untapped value and impact to clients and society.\n\nNet Zero Transitions\n\nWe help our clients develop their full ESG agenda, making sustainability the driver of the enterprise, industry, value chain and systems change that is necessary to be competitive and deliver measurable shareholder and stakeholder value.\n\nTransitioning to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 is a priority for businesses and governments. We help our clients build the future net-zero emissions electricity, energy and production systems. We also help our clients accelerate decarbonization and progress toward their net-zero goals with an innovation and technology-led integrated approach, spanning decarbonization of sectors, the transport and the energy systems, reinvention of demand and behaviors, carbon recovery and removals, all enabled by carbon and ESG intelligence.\n\nWorking closely with our ecosystem partners, we help companies set and implement net-zero strategies and programs including:\n\n- Scaling low-carbon and renewable energy-generation, self-consumption, and procurement\n- Building the supporting grids, networks, charging infrastructure and industrial clusters\n- Setting science-based targets, decarbonization goals and programs, and roadmaps to emissions reduction, net zero and neutralization\n- Developing and deploying carbon intelligence capabilities to enable integrated, carbon-informed decision making across business functions\n- Designing strategies and developing and implementing new business models for e-mobility, hydrogen and ammonia, bioenergies and synthetic fuels, carbon capture, utilization and storage, batteries and energy storage, and nature based solutions\n- Developing products and services to enable a future net-zero energy system\n- Developing new capabilities and skills for the net-zero transition, spanning operating models, process design, incentives like internal carbon pricing, and training programs\n- Shaping sustainability-informed consumer choices and behaviors\n\nSustainable Value Chain\n\nWe help our clients build more sustainable value chains by embedding sustainability into each supply chain function and through data-led transformation of the entire value chain.\n\nWe enable organizations to deliver more trusted, circular and net-zero value chains by providing the insights, tools and expertise to:\n\n- Define and deliver a holistic sustainable value chain strategy\n- Realize end-to-end visibility and transparency of ESG performance across the value chain\n- Enable responsible sourcing and operations, informed by human rights, anticorruption and greenhouse gas emission factors\n- Embed and innovate for circularity across product development, production and end-of-use through new business models\n- Decarbonize energy, logistics and other emissions-heavy components of the value chain\n- Reimagine customer experiences to be more sustainable and responsible\nSustainable Technology\nWe understand first-hand the vast promise of technology as well as the need to decouple emissions from growing technology adoption. Our goal is to help organizations not only use technology more sustainably, but also use it as a vehicle for being more sustainable.\n\nWe support companies to use and scale technology to drive sustainability across the business, including their operations, supply chains and ecosystem, while making sure that it is deployed and used in the most sustainable way. We help clients to:\n\n- Decarbonize and enable circular IT infrastructure.\n- Design and implement green cloud migration and operations\n- Embed sustainability in software development\n- Build and operate software in a carbon efficient and carbon aware way\n- Enable sustainable machine learning, data and AI\n- Develop new sustainability use cases through technology\n\nSustainability Measurement, Analytics and Performance\nBusiness leaders today are increasingly devoting the same resources and attention to ESG/climate risk issues as they do to their financials. That means weighing risks and opportunities while staying on top of emerging disclosure requirements.

Our people in the United Kingdom worked with British food manufacturers, supply chain partners and the Ukrainian embassy in London to enable this essential aid to reach people in need.\n\nSupporting long-term economic inclusion of refugees\n\u2022 We quickly mobilized to partner with job marketplace The Adecco Group to support Ukrainian refugees looking to start a new career and to open a recruiting channel for new talent. To support this effort, we adapted our Skills to Succeed Academy to provide basic employment and digital skills to Ukrainian refugees, with additional follow-up to help connect graduates to job opportunities.\n\u2022 In Poland, we rapidly transformed our Carrots Academy for Women initiative into an upskilling program to provide cybersecurity training to Ukrainian women refugees. On completion, participants may receive job offers from Accenture or another established employer in Poland.\n\u2022 We are an anchor partner in the Sunflower Project\u2014a Tent Partnership for Refugees initiative to accelerate economic inclusion of Ukrainian refugee women across Europe through direct hiring, training and upskilling programs, mentoring and additional support.\n\u2022 We are helping YMCA Europe establish community hubs in Ukraine, Romania, Moldova and Slovakia to help internally displaced people and refugees connect with local communities and resources, including access to safe and secure skill development and support. The program is expected to provide more than 10,000 participants with holistic support and to be a replicable offering that will encourage other organizations to co-fund and replicate this approach across Europe.\n\u2022 In Poland, we are working with Upwardly Global to create a private sector coalition which aims to develop new support systems and career advancement initiatives for Ukrainian women refugee job seekers aligned to their skills and experiences.\n\nIn addition, as part of our immediate response, Accenture donated $5 million to nonprofit relief organizations working to help people in Ukraine and those who are being displaced into Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic. We matched 100% of the $1.75 million in donations from our people.\nAccenture Development Partnerships\n\nAccenture Development Partnerships (ADP) helps our clients\u2014including leading NGOs, private foundations, public donor agencies and the private sector\u2014address society\u2019s most critical challenges. Specifically, through its Inclusive Business offering, ADP collaborates with private sector clients to drive sustainable impact at scale to support their environmental, social and governance goals.\n\nCelebrating two decades of impact\n\nFor 20 years, ADP has led diverse work fostering partnerships, collective impact and social equity to progress the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) improving lives around the world. Key focus areas include agriculture, climate and environment; energy; gender, inclusion and diversity; health and nutrition; humanitarian aid and refugees; inclusive financial services and products; and access to quality education and sustainable livelihoods.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, ADP led more than 270 engagements in approximately 80 countries. Recent work includes:\n\n- We are working with Uganda-based Mandulis Energy, which is now developing the largest grid-tied biogas facility in Africa, on a digital transformation journey to optimize and expand its circular bioenergy model. The company converts agricultural waste purchased from refugee and emerging farmers into clean electricity and biogas, while the byproduct is turned into green charcoal briquettes for use in cement or fertilizer production.\n\n- In partnership with Novartis, WHO and the Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development\u2019s Working Group on Virtual Health and Care, we are exploring how virtual technologies can help make health care accessible through inclusive policy making and data-driven digitalization.\n\n- Together with the H&M Foundation, we designed and launched a bespoke metaverse experience to educate and change the narrative on planet-positive fashion and inspire consumers to adopt a sustainability-first mindset.\n\n- We helped The Human Safety Net, the philanthropic arm of Generali Group, a global insurance and asset management company based in Italy, better serve young families and migrants by developing new ways to think about inclusive insurance strategies that aim to solve for the \u201cprotection gap\u201d\u2014the difference between economic and insured losses\u2014which hinders people from building economic resilience.\n\n- We collaborated with a major consumer packaged goods company, financial services organizations (fintechs and payment services providers), and NGOs focused on skills development to design a multi-stakeholder program that has the potential to support the needs of more than 1 million small retailers across Mexico with training, access to loans, digital payments and energy efficiency assets to drive entrepreneurial success.\nTalent\nTalent\n\nIn this dimension\n\nInvesting in our people\nCaring for our people\nCollaborating to create innovative career pathways\n\nAccenture is a talent and innovation led organization of more than 738,000 exceptional people working together across the world to deliver on the promise of technology and human ingenuity\u2014including nearly 100,000 people we added to our global workforce in fiscal 2022. Creating 360\u00b0 value across our business not only improves our competitiveness and drives returns for shareholders\u2014it also helps us attract, inspire and retain the best people. We invest in our people and support them with care, compassion and continuous opportunities to learn, grow their skills and advance their careers.\n\nFY2022 Highlights\n\n- **Named one** of the World\u2019s Best Workplaces\u2122 by FORTUNE and Great Place to Work\u00ae\n- **157,000** promotions and added nearly **100,000** people to our global workforce\n- **$1.1 billion** invested in continuous learning and professional development\n- **40+ million** training hours, a 27% year-over-year increase\n- **100%** dollar-for-dollar pay equity for men and women*\n- **20%+** of our entry-level hires in North America were apprentices\n\n*Certain subsidiaries, including recent acquisitions, countries with de minimis headcount, temporary employees and interns were excluded from the analysis.\nInvesting in our people\n\nAccenture\u2019s vibrant career paths are flexible by design, so that our people are encouraged to develop their skills, bring new ideas, suggest creative solutions and lend their bold, authentic voices to their work.\n\nAccenture\u2019s total rewards consist of cash compensation, equity and benefits. Our total rewards program is designed to recognize our people\u2019s skills, contributions and career progression, and to care for our people\u2019s needs. Base salary, bonus and equity are tailored to the market where our people work and live. Certain rewards, like equity and bonuses, are opportunities for our people to share in the overall success of our company. As our people advance in their careers, they have greater opportunities to be rewarded. Accenture\u2019s equitable rewards go beyond financial rewards, and include health and well-being programs that care for our people and their families.\n\nContinuous learning\n\nTo help our people discover their best opportunities and expand their skill sets, we invested $11 billion during fiscal 2022 in learning and professional development. With our digital learning platform, we delivered over 40 million training hours, an increase of 27% from fiscal 2021, with an average of approximately 61 hours of training per person.\n\nOur award-winning programs include job-specific, digital and industry skills training through 24/7 learning created by Accenture experts and informed by neuroscience-based principles; leading providers of digital learning content; key industry certifications; and partnerships with leading universities around the globe. Across Accenture, people at all levels have opportunities to build leadership capabilities and grow their careers.\n\nTechnology Quotient\n\nOur \u201cTechnology Quotient\u201d (TQ) experience\u2014an ongoing technology skills curriculum and learning program\u2014supports our belief that everyone working to solve the world\u2019s biggest problems must be comfortable with the emerging technology needs of our digital world. As of August 31, 2022, more than 469,000 of our people had demonstrated knowledge in at least eight of the 12 current TQ topics, which range from cloud and AI to extended reality and quantum computing. In total, 597,000 of our people have participated in this program as of August 31, 2022.\nEqual pay for equal work\n\nWe are firmly committed to pay equity and have processes in place to help ensure that our people\u2014across gender, race and ethnicity\u2014are compensated fairly. Pay equity at Accenture means that our people receive pay that is fair and consistent when considering similarity of work, location and tenure at career level.\n\nWe conduct an annual pay equity review. As of our last review, which reflected annual pay changes effective December 1, 2022, we have dollar-for-dollar, 100% pay equity for women compared to men in every country where we operate (certain subsidiaries, including recent acquisitions, and countries with de minimis headcount, temporary employees and interns were excluded from the analysis). By race and ethnicity, we likewise have dollar-for-dollar, 100% pay equity in the United States, the United Kingdom and South Africa, which are the locations where we currently have the data available to use for this purpose.\n\nAdditionally, we have a regular review process to validate living wages in the local country context and help ensure we pay 100% of our people a living wage or more, which is above the legally required minimum wage in those countries. Accenture in the United Kingdom is an accredited \u201creal Living Wage\u201d employer.\n\nSkilling\n\nWe continue to help our people identify and grow their unique skills. We use algorithms to assess projects and the career opportunities we offer, assisting with staffing needs, job opportunities, tailored learning recommendations and helping our people connect with each other. There are over 8,000 skills in our library that our people can acquire, based on their work experience and through certifications and learning opportunities.\n\nWe have skills data for our people, enabling us to flexibly respond to shifting client needs while also recommending skill-specific training and opportunities that align with an individual\u2019s interests.\n\nContinuous recognition\n\nWe recognize our people throughout the year for who they are, what makes them unique and the valuable contributions they make through their work. In fiscal 2022, we promoted approximately 157,000 people\u2014a record.\n\nTo help make recognition a daily opportunity, we introduced a new social recognition tool that our people can use to recognize and express gratitude to their colleagues\u2014for a job well done, a collaboration or simply displaying grace under pressure. This new solution has led to four recognition moments given every minute since the system went live.\nCaring for our people\n\nOne of our Leadership Essentials is that we care deeply for all our people\u2014which was reflected in October 2022 when we were named one of the World\u2019s Best Workplaces\u2122 by FORTUNE and Great Place to Work\u00ae. This recognition is truly a tribute to every one of the over 738,000 incredibly talented people of Accenture because when a company ranks highly on Great Place to Work, it is because of what its own people say. When asked, thousands of our people said Accenture is a great place to work.\n\nCare and compassion\n\nAs part of our commitment to creating a place where people can achieve their aspirations both professionally and personally, we take a holistic view of well-being, which includes physical, mental, emotional and financial well-being.\n\nWe offer programs and curate experiences, programs and practices to meet our people\u2019s fundamental human needs. For example, in fiscal 2022, we have continued to elevate our support for the well-being of our people, led by our Chief Health Officer and with digital tools and initiatives.\n\nOur ability to care for our people starts with our sophisticated listening framework that helps us understand what matters most to them. We listen intently to what our people feel and need, and we make decisions based on their input to ensure what we do matches what we say. This builds trust, the most important currency we have with our people, and strengthens our culture.\n\nUkraine crisis response\n\nOur commitment includes how we care for our people. In response to the Ukraine crisis, we introduced a range of support services for our people and their impacted families, along with their extended families who are located in Ukraine. This support included in-language:\n\n- Crisis helpline for emotional support.\n- Telehealth support with access to physicians.\n- Employee assistance helpline to help with settlement assistance and other needs.\n\nFor our people in countries bordering Ukraine, as well as for our people and their extended families who have been impacted by the Ukraine conflict, we provided virtual support sessions focused on coping with trauma.\n\nHealth, safety and well-being first\n\nThe health, safety and well-being of our people is our top priority. We provide our people and their dependents with a comprehensive range of health benefits, from medical, dental and drug coverage to supplemental programs tailored to individual countries.\n\nFor example, in the United States we offer a medical travel benefit that covers any medical services that may not be offered within 100 miles of where an Accenture person lives, including a full range of reproductive health care that includes abortion. This medical travel benefit was in place for many years for transplants and gender-affirming care and, in the wake of the Supreme Court of the United States decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, we expanded that benefit to include all eligible medical services. As an organization, we believe that our people should have equitable access to health care provided under our programs, policies and plans.\n\nIn India, a Virtual Parental Benefit, launched to support our caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic, is continuing due to its popularity. This suite of online learning opportunities for children, available to all of our people in India, includes access to online summer camps, activities and events plus an online child-minder and parental coaching.\nAcross Accenture, all our people have access to employee assistance programs, public health systems, company-sponsored health programs and mental health and wellness programs, where relevant.\n\nOur Occupational Health and Safety policy defines the responsibilities of all our people and contractors to keep our work environment healthy and safe, wherever they work; drives compliance with applicable laws and regulations; and fosters adoption of health and safety management standards across our company. We have received ISO\u00ae 45001 certification\u2014a globally recognized standard for occupational health and safety\u2014in countries including Australia, Brazil, India, Ireland, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. In fiscal 2022, we launched our Health and Safety program, which includes a global governance model with health and safety professionals covering every country. Our goal is to bring all our countries to a baseline standard equal to ISO\u00ae 45001.\n\nOur Global Assistance and Protection team provides crisis management and security advice and assistance to our people. The team maintains a 24/7 Global Watch program to assist our people with security risks, health advice and local security alerts covering where they live, work and travel.\n\nWe continue working to meet our goal that all our locations are physically accessible. Our Accessibility Centers also offer enablement and advisory services, collaborative technology research, recruiting and other support for our people with disabilities.\n\nMental health and wellness\n\nWe strive to create an environment and provide the tools, programs and practices for mental well-being. We continue working to help break the stigma surrounding mental health by fostering a workplace environment where people feel comfortable engaging in open, honest dialogue. We also continue to elevate our support for the well-being of our people, particularly with the compounding stresses of the COVID-19 pandemic, macro-economic challenges and the humanitarian crisis caused by the war in Europe, through enhanced digital tools and initiatives.\n\nOur corporate partnership with Thrive Global, a behavior change platform offering science-based solutions to lower stress and enhance well-being and productivity, has enabled us to deliver customized workshops to help our people achieve a sense of belonging and purpose. The Thrive Global programs\u2014\u201cThriving Mind\u201d (skills to support mental resilience), \u201cThriving Together\u201d (learning to build resilience and belonging) and \u201cNourish to Thrive\u201d (nutritional strategies for cognitive health)\u2014have collectively been completed by approximately 225,000 of our people since fiscal 2020.\n\nThrough our Mental Health Ally network, thousands of our people serve as ambassadors and advocates who help their colleagues facing mental health challenges find the support they may need. We offer training to help our people understand the signs that a colleague needs help, how to have a conversation about mental health and the steps to take to support someone in need. Additionally, we offer a variety of digital tools to support mental health and wellness, including Thrive Global, Talkspace, Calm, Wysa, RethinkCare and Virgin Pulse.\n\nWe also launched a comprehensive hub that provides all Accenture people\u2014and their dependents\u2014with a central resource for all of our mental health and wellness offerings. The site includes a chatbot that helps individuals identify which offering best serves their specific needs.\nFoundational benefits standards\n\nWe are on a journey to offer a foundational set of benefits to all our people, regardless of where they live and work. We are fostering an environment to help our people be their best selves\u2014professionally and personally. And we believe that by caring deeply for all our people, we will help them achieve their aspirations.\n\nWe offer a suite of benefits that allows our people to optimize their health and know they are truly cared for through each stage of life. We also demonstrate how inclusion and diversity is a business priority by offering benefits that are relevant to our people, ensuring everyone has equal access and opportunity to thrive. One of our goals is to provide the following level of benefits coverage\u2014at a minimum\u2014for all our people.*\n\n**LGBTIQ+ medical plans**\n\nAs a means of fostering an inclusive environment for our lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer (LGBTIQ+) people\u2014and all other sexual orientations, gender identities or gender expressions\u2014around the world, we offer:\n\n- Equal access to medical plans for our LGBTIQ+ people and their partners through Accenture-sponsored medical plans is offered to 100% of our people where legally allowed or available in the market.\n- Coverage for transgender-inclusive health care benefits is accessible to 95% of our people through Accenture-sponsored medical plans or government-provided plans, where legally allowed or available in the market.\n\n**Vacation**\n\nTo give our people space to refresh, re-energize and enjoy time away from the working environment, we offer all our people a minimum of 15 days of paid vacation, inclusive of vacation, non-statutory holidays and additional paid time off.\n\n**Maternity leave**\n\nWe strive to provide a minimum of 16 weeks paid maternity leave, or the equivalent paid time away, to all birth parents inclusive of dual parental benefits and social subsidies, where available. This benefit is offered to more than 95% of our people.\n\n**Bereavement leave for miscarriage**\n\nWe strive to provide a minimum of three days paid bereavement leave to our people who experience a miscarriage or have a partner who experiences a miscarriage. This benefit is offered to more than 85% of our people, inclusive of statutory requirements.\n\n*Excludes Avanade, a joint venture between Accenture and Microsoft that is majority-owned by Accenture, and recent acquisitions.\n\nShaping the future of work\n\nWe have built on what we learned during the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014from our people, clients and partners\u2014to embrace new ways of working at Accenture.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we brought to life what we call omni-connected experiences\u2014which level the playing field so everyone can participate fully, regardless of their physical location. Through these experiences, people are able to forge relationships, create both personal and business value and grow their careers. We strengthen human connection through our behaviors, digital tools, collaborations in our offices and the culture we create.\n\nOur people and teams have embraced omni-connected ways of working. According to a survey, 85% of our global respondents feel empowered to work flexibly within their teams.\n\nAs people returned to working in person, they were welcomed back into safe, connected and collaborative office spaces.\nAccenture Leadership Essentials\n\nOur Leadership Essentials set the standard for what we expect from our people and enable us to successfully create 360\u00b0 value, and include:\n\n- Always do the right thing, in every decision and action.\n- Lead with excellence, confidence and humility, as demonstrated by being a learner, building great teams and being naturally collaborative.\n- Exemplify client-centricity and a commitment to client value creation.\n- Act as a true partner, to each other, our clients, our ecosystem partners and our communities\u2014committed to shared success.\n- Care deeply for all of our people to help them achieve their aspirations, professionally and personally.\n- Live our unwavering commitment to inclusion, diversity and equality, as demonstrated by personal impact and overall results.\n- Have the courage to change and the ability to bring our people along the journey.\n- Actively innovate\u2014looking across Accenture at what we are doing for clients and externally to partners, competitors, startups, clients, academia and analysts\u2014to learn, respectfully challenge our assumptions and apply the innovation, and cultivate and reward our people for doing the same.\nCollaborating to create innovative career pathways\n\nWe continually innovate to find new ways of creating and building more inclusive career pathways so everyone has access to vibrant careers. We are investing in our communities to reach and empower previously untapped pools of talent. By making this investment, we are widening Accenture\u2019s diversity of thought and experience, and expanding opportunities for all while delivering tremendous value to our people and our clients. To do so, we partner with governments, nonprofits, community colleges and others to educate, train and support the workforce through apprenticeships and other roles at Accenture.\n\nExamples of apprenticeship programs around the globe include:\n\n- In Latin America, START is a technology training program that since fiscal 2014 has focused on employability for low-income individuals in the communities where we operate. After a three-to-four-month course, participants are hired into technology roles with Accenture and other employers. In fiscal 2022, over 900 people were skilled through START, and 113 were employed by Accenture.\n\n- In the Philippines, we are working with Passerelles Numeriques to train disadvantaged young people in our communities through a three-year program that helps them prepare for technology jobs. In fiscal 2022, there were 193 graduates\u2014all of whom are now employed, nine of them by Accenture.\n\n- Through our North America Apprenticeship Program, since 2016 we have hired, trained, coached and provided career opportunities for untapped talent and people who are reskilling because their jobs are at risk of disruption by technology. In fiscal 2022, we exceeded our goal for apprenticeship hires to make up 20% of our entry-level hiring in North America.\n\n- Our apprenticeship program in the United Kingdom provides career opportunities to entry-level talent with little or no experience across technology, consulting and human resources. We also offer an M.Sc. Digital and Technology Solutions Degree Apprenticeship for individuals without a technical background who are looking to gain the skills needed for a career in technology. In fiscal 2022, we had nearly 200 apprentices in the program, a 93% increase in participation over the prior year. Our apprenticeship program remains pivotal to boosting our diversity by widening our talent pool to include underrepresented groups. To date, we have achieved great success. At our London cohorts over the last three years, over 30% of the participants were Black, nearly 60% were women and nearly 70% were from low socio-economic backgrounds.\nInclusion & Diversity\nInclusion & Diversity\n\nIn this dimension\n\nEmbedding I&D in everything we do\n\nAchieving gender equality\n\nTaking a stand against racism\n\nFostering disability inclusion\n\nAdvancing LGBTIQ+ inclusion\n\nCultivating cross-cultural diversity\n\nSupplier inclusion & diversity\n\nInclusion and diversity is embedded in everything we do\u2014in the decisions we make and actions we take\u2014and is a key enabler of our business results.

We are well on our way to our goal to achieve gender parity\u2014for those whose gender is binary\u2014by 2025.\n\nWe celebrated our 18th annual International Women\u2019s Day across our business with 114 virtual and face-to-face events in 33 countries, engaging our people, clients and partners. Building on our \u201cBetter to Belong\u201d research, we examined women\u2019s workplace experiences and how to unlock human potential using our Net Better Off Framework. Our International Men\u2019s Day celebrations also reinforced our commitment to accelerating gender equality and drove awareness of men\u2019s role in gender equality.\n\n*Please see our 2022 Proxy Statement for further information.\n\nInclusive pipeline\n\nWe act on our commitment to gender equality by proactively helping to build a more inclusive talent pipeline. We continue to develop and roll out upskilling programs to accelerate the participation of women in society and the economy by building high-demand tech skills.\n\nFor example, the fourth edition of our Starter Academy in Poland, a reskilling program for people wanting to start IT careers, was dedicated to female Ukrainian refugees in the Silesia region. The Accenture Technology Center in Poland provided support to people who had fled the war and needed to further their careers in a new country. Women could join the program regardless of whether they already had IT experience. We provided them with new coding skills and support so they could restart their careers in a positive environment.\n\nLeadership development\n\nOur global Women\u2019s Executive Leadership program is a two-year program tailored to participants\u2019 needs and goals. Our current cohort includes 165 high-performing women who receive individual coaching, strategic networking and professional development opportunities along with additional support and tools to help them advance in their careers. Since the beginning of the program, 73 program participants were promoted and more than 1,200 individual coaching sessions were held.\nTaking a stand against racism\n\nOur Chair and CEO and Global Management Committee stand against racism and are committed to equality for all\u2014with zero tolerance for discrimination, bigotry or hate of any kind.\n\nWe continue to support the actions we announced in September 2020 to advance racial and ethnic inclusion and diversity:\n\n- Set goals to increase race and ethnicity representation by 2025 in our workforce overall and among managing directors in the United States, the United Kingdom and South Africa.\n- Provide training to combat racism globally.\n- Increase our community investments to support economic inclusion.\n\nIn 2022, we expanded our efforts for racial and ethnic inclusion across our organization, with a specific focus on increasing awareness in Latin America and Europe.\n\nAcross our business, we continue our progress toward our goals by increasing our pool of qualified candidates to reflect the diversity of talent in the marketplace. For example, our Inclusive Slate program in the United States helps ensure interviews for all roles include diverse candidates and candidates from underrepresented groups.\n\nIn addition to expanding our pool of candidates, we offer engaging leadership journeys to support career success. For example, in the United Kingdom, we created Engage!, a leadership journey for Black employees, their direct managers and sponsors that focuses on culture change and inclusive behaviors across the employee ecosystem. Engage! has expanded to the United States for African American, Black, Hispanic American and Latinx employees, with plans for additional markets.\n\nColor Brave\u2014Celebrating Ethnicity in Latin America\n\nColor Brave is our racial diversity program and employee network in Brazil, which aims to recruit, retain, develop and promote Black talent by creating a sense of belonging throughout our people\u2019s careers with Accenture. The program addresses racism inside and outside Accenture through focused interactions with the Black and non-Black population. In recruitment, the program attracts talent through impact hiring with two internship programs, Adventures2Go and MaraTon, which embrace technology, innovation and diversity to unlock unexplored and potential markets. To advance inclusive development and retention, Color Brave conducts learning and listening sessions, focus groups, one-on-one conversations and anonymous surveys to understand the perceptions and needs of Black and Brown employees. Additional engagement activities seek to create and celebrate racial awareness.\n\nBrazilian employees have participated in activities to advance their understanding on structural racism, racial literacy, microaggressions and intersectionality. In addition, Color Brave works with Black Connection, a local effort to connect partners, customers and other organizations to discuss challenges and exchange opportunities for the Black/Brown community in Brazil.\nCollaborating with communities\n\nWe are committed to identify a portfolio of specific opportunities to collaborate with our communities and other partners to promote equality, fight racism and bigotry, and create more opportunities for employment and advancement.\n\nIn our communities, we are making investments that leverage our unique strengths. For example:\n\n**United States**\n- Our Chair and CEO Julie Sweet is Board Co-Chair of the New York Jobs CEO Council, a nonprofit membership intermediary, working to scale sustainable, market-driven workforce development solutions that benefit both job seekers and businesses in New York. The Jobs Council\u2019s goal is to place 100,000 low-income and diverse New Yorkers into high-paying, family-sustaining wage jobs, including 25,000 City University of New York students, by 2030.\n- In 2021, we launched the Black Founders Development Program (BFD), an initiative to support Black entrepreneurs. In fiscal 2022, we deployed capital to our first BFD Founder; engaged more than 20 Founders for investment, partnership exploration, mentorship and pilot projects; and hosted more than 10 events to elevate Black Founders inside and beyond Accenture.\n- We are a founding partner of OneTen, a coalition of leaders working to connect Black talent with career opportunities that do not require a four-year degree.\n\n**Europe**\n- We are a partner with Business for Inclusive Growth, a global CEO-led coalition of major companies fighting against inequalities of income and opportunity, with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development as its strategic partner, and co-created recommendations to drive racial and ethnic inclusion.\n\n**United Kingdom**\n- In fiscal 2022, through our Empowering Black Futures learning series, we continued to engage, inspire and motivate students of Black heritage to develop their employability and skills via a series of workshops.\n- We co-created Mobolise, a digital recruitment platform to connect Black talent with career opportunities in the United Kingdom\u2019s creative and technology fields by enabling access to job opportunities, upskilling, mentoring and networking.\n\n**South Africa**\n- We are a partner with Quirky 30, a nonprofit focused on bringing in-demand tech skills and careers support to impoverished communities.\n- We are a funding partner of Mentec Foundation, which funds industry-specific skilling and job creation programs.\n\nTraining to combat racism\n\nWe are steadily making progress by increasing our representation; continuing mandatory training on identifying, speaking up and reporting racism; and collaborating with communities and other partners to promote equality, fight racism and create more opportunities for employment and advancement. Training has been completed by 98% of our people in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Europe, with more locations to come.\n\nWe continue to hold sessions to share the lived experiences of people from underrepresented racial and ethnic backgrounds and develop allyship. During fiscal 2022, in the face of additional tragedies experienced across diverse communities, we held listening sessions and heard from communities across the intersections of race and ethnicity, gender, interfaith and our Pride employee networks. We denounced hate and affirmed our commitment to join together against hate and violence.\n\nIn addition, we matched donations by our people to community-serving organizations including The Asian American Foundation, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Hispanic-Serving Institutions in the United States.\nFostering disability inclusion\n\nWe strive to ensure that our people with disabilities have access to the latest technology, tools and training to succeed in a barrier-free workplace. Our global Disability & Neurodiversity Inclusion Council defines our priorities, measures progress and helps advance our disability inclusion agenda.\n\nOur Accommodation Support Tool enables our people with disabilities to easily access assistive technology, flexible work arrangements, sign language interpreters, screen readers and more. This innovative tool, designed to make the request process easy, private and personalized, is available in 43 countries.\n\nOur award-winning Abilities Unleashed disability inclusion leadership development program provides opportunities for our people with disabilities to feel empowered, plan their career journeys, build their network and collaborate across the company.\n\nWe continue to create a safe environment for our people with disabilities to self-identify and, as of December 1, 2022, more than 11,500 of our people have done so.\n\nAccessibility Centers\n\nOur global network of Accessibility Centers offers persons with disabilities and their teams the unique tools, support and technology they need to thrive in their roles. The centers include a wide range of assistive technology solutions for diverse needs, including hearing, vision, mobility and cognitive solutions, and disability prevention technology such as ergonomic keyboards. Importantly, they also offer a space to collaborate and exchange ideas about how we can support our people so that everyone, regardless of disability, is able to access opportunities to learn, grow and thrive. Currently, we have built 34 Accessibility Centers around the world with more to come.\n\nApplication accessibility\n\nWe are working to build accessibility practices into everything we do and to help provide our clients with the tools and the knowledge they need to implement those practices themselves. We have been on a journey to make interactions with our most heavily used, internally developed enterprise applications as accessible as possible for our people. Our journey will continue to focus on embedding accessibility requirements into every stage of the enterprise IT life cycle.\n\nExpanding impact with clients\n\nOur Accessibility Activation Centers at our Advanced Technology Centers in India help us work with our clients to embed accessibility into their solutions through inclusive and accessible design. They offer a wide range of specialized services to help clients strategize, design and build inclusive applications; conduct audits on existing applications; and remediate for compliance with A, AA and AAA level Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. The Centers enable our clients to offer sustainable and inclusive digital channels to their consumers, employees, partners and communities, helping them increase the reach and revenue of client products and services by addressing the digital accessibility needs of more than 1 billion people globally living with some form of disability.\n\nDisability Inclusion Champion Network\n\nOur Disability Inclusion Champion Network of approximately 35,000 advocates worldwide brings our people together regularly to collaborate, network and support the community. We partnered with PurpleSpace\u2019s global Purple Light Up initiative to celebrate the contributions of our people with disabilities, lighting up 29 of our locations.\n\nNeurodiversity inclusion\n\nOur neurodiversity employee network grew to over 900 members globally as of October 2022. Our employee network is partnering with our Global Inclusion & Diversity team to drive new, employee-led efforts to increase neurodiversity awareness and education.\nAdvancing LGBTIQ+ inclusion\n\nOur Pride at Accenture community has more than 90 employee networks and over 119,000 lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer (LGBTIQ+) Allies in all countries in which we operate. The networks are instrumental in driving progress toward our talent strategy goals, supporting recruitment initiatives and talent development activities, as well as collaborating externally with our ecosystem partners.\n\nWe provide specialized training, networking support and mentoring for our LGBTIQ+ people and help promote a workplace where everyone feels they belong and can thrive. Since 2018, more than 650 people have participated in LGBTIQ+ Leaders Learning, which provides high-potential LGBTIQ+ people and Allies with the information, tools and support to continue to build their careers and develop into LGBTIQ+ role models and leaders.\n\nSame-sex and transgender health benefits\n\nTo be inclusive of LGBTIQ+ people\u2014and all other sexual orientations, gender identities or gender expressions\u2014around the world:\n\n- Equal access to medical plans for LGBTIQ+ employees and their partners through Accenture-sponsored medical plans is offered to 100% of our people where legally allowed or available in the market.*\n- We offer coverage for transgender-inclusive health care to 95% of our people through Accenture-sponsored medical plans or government-provided plans, where legally allowed or available in the market.*\n\nOur self-ID programs, where legally permitted, provide our people with the option to voluntarily share information about themselves\u2014such as their gender identity and sexual orientation. Additionally, our people can share their pronouns in their internal online company profile.\n\nAdvocating for equality\n\nWe are proud to be recognized as a corporate leader that supports LGBTIQ+ people and the broader community. Accenture is a founding member of the Partnership for Global LGBTI Equality, a coalition of 22 leading multinational companies and six nonprofit organizations in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The UN Standards of Conduct provides a platform to accelerate LGBTIQ+ workplace inclusion globally by driving the adoption of the UN Standards of Conduct for Business: Tackling Discrimination against Lesbian, Gay, Bi, Trans, & Intersex People. We have been recognized among the Stonewall Top Global Employers for seven years, and our Pride at Accenture employee network was named 2022 Network of the Year.\n\nCultivating cross-cultural diversity\n\nOur people are given the resources and training they need to collaborate and work effectively across cultures. This year, we recognized our more than 20,000 champions and trainers for their work and passion in this space.\n\nWe promote cross-cultural diversity throughout the year by profiling stories of our champions and trainers and local activities\u2014including observing World Day for Cultural Diversity for Dialogue and Development on May 21 and celebrating of #NewYearsAcrossAccenture traditions from our people\u2019s cultures and countries around the globe.\n\n*Excludes recently acquired entities.\nSupplier inclusion & diversity\n\nThrough our responsible buying approach, we set an example by advancing inclusive procurement practices. We help our clients, partners and suppliers learn and improve how to design and implement inclusion and diversity in their own supply chain. Leveraging purchasing power for change empowers businesses throughout the ecosystem, including suppliers and buyers, and can also breed innovation.\n\nSupplier Inclusion & Sustainability Program\n\nOur buying approach influences key initiatives such as our award-winning Supplier Inclusion & Sustainability Program, dedicated to promoting the inclusion of people who may be excluded from the labor market for physical, social or cultural reasons. The program scope includes minority-, ethnic- and women-owned businesses; the LGBTIQ+ community; persons with disabilities; veterans; refugees; and people living away from economic centers. We categorize diverse suppliers as minority; women; small- and medium-sized (SME); service-disabled veteran; veteran; historically underutilized; people with disabilities; and LGBTIQ+ enterprises.\n\nWe support broader inclusion through direct recruitment, agreements with vendors and in collaboration with other organizations.\n\nSupplier inclusion & sustainability in action\n\nOur Supplier Inclusion & Sustainability Program is in 22 countries in fiscal 2022, with additional countries to follow in the year ahead. We continue to evolve this program with digitalization efforts, leveraging technology tools such as our Sustainable Procurement Hub (The Hub) to streamline activities such as supplier environmental, social and governance assessments.\n\nGlobal Diverse Supplier Development Program\n\nSince 2006, we have brought our commitment to supplier inclusion and diversity to life through our Global Diverse Supplier Development Program (DSDP). DSDP mentees gain a diversity-informed understanding of their business and demonstrate their progress as a diverse supplier by completing business health assessments and quarterly progress reports throughout the 18-month program.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we set a new DSDP goal to graduate 250 diverse suppliers by the end of fiscal 2023. By the end of fiscal 2022, a total of 217 had graduated. In fiscal 2022, we also launched DSDP in Australia.\n\nSpotlight on South Africa\n\nOur goal is to create a culture of shared knowledge, experiences and resources to drive collaborative successes. Each year, we continue to evolve our DSDP program and lead by example.\n\nFor instance, in fiscal 2022, we applied the Small Medium Enterprise Digital Ecosystem Platform, a digital tool co-developed with a DSDP graduate in South Africa, to a pro bono partnership with the National Council for People with Disability, enabling the South African NGO to deliver a 12-month entrepreneurship program to businesses owned by people with disabilities.\n\nOur efforts in South Africa also include investing in and cultivating SME suppliers and continuing to engage our DSDP graduates as suppliers.\nUnited States, Canada, South Africa and India\n\nWe monitor our diverse spend with suppliers to understand our progress throughout the year. In fiscal 2022, we began tracking diverse spend in Avanade, a joint venture between Accenture and Microsoft that is majority-owned by Accenture. Our U.S. diverse spend increased from 32% in fiscal 2021 to 47%, and our Canadian spend was 34%, an increase from 25% in fiscal 2021. For the first time since we have reported our diverse spending, we are sharing that Accenture now spends approximately $1 billion with diverse suppliers in North America (U.S. and Canada).\n\nIn South Africa, we continue to lead the way to supplier inclusion, going above and beyond requirements of the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) Act. We understand the importance and see the value of increasing diverse, inclusive procurement spending for its far-reaching impact. In fiscal 2022, we maintained our B-BBEE Level 1 recognition for the fifth consecutive year. In fiscal 2022, our procurement spend with Black-women-owned enterprises in South Africa increased to 57%, again exceeding the B-BBEE target of 12%. Additionally, our spend with Black-owned-SMEs was more than 63%, against a target of 30%. Our procurement spend in South Africa with Black-owned suppliers increased to 61% from 60% in the previous year, surpassing the target of 50%.\n\nFor the first time we are also reporting diverse spend in India. In fiscal 2022, our spend with diverse businesses including small and medium businesses was 23%.\n\nCollaboration with other organizations\n\nOur Supplier Inclusion & Sustainability Program supports inclusive procurement practices through direct recruitment of suppliers and partnerships with vendors and organizations. We are proud to partner with organizations that represent minority-, ethnic- and women-owned businesses; the LGBTIQ+ community; persons with disabilities; veterans; refugees; and people living away from economic centers.\n\nThe breadth of the organizations that we collaborate with reflects our global reach, spanning from the United States to Europe, Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. The depth of our involvement ranges from joining as a corporate member to being nominated for Boards of Directors and serving on Executive Committees, as well as co-founding organizations. For example, we co-founded WEConnect International, which connects buyers with women-owned businesses, enabling them to compete in the global marketplace. Serving on the organization\u2019s Global Board, Global Executive Committee, Membership Development Committee and local Advisory Councils allows us to drive awareness of, and opportunities for, women-owned businesses around the world.\n\nOur work with WEConnect International in 18 countries, including our DSDP countries, Australia, Canada, India, Ireland, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States, provides a local partnership for a diverse set of program applicants. We also co-develop thought leadership on emerging trends in procurement for diverse suppliers.\n\nIn the United States, we also promote our supplier diversity commitment with organizations such as Disability:IN, Women Business Enterprise National Council, the National LGBT Chamber of Commerce, and others where we hold Advisory Board or Board seats. In addition, we are a founding partner of and hold a Board seat on the European LGBTIQ Chamber of Commerce. We continue to support its work to build a pan-European collaboration that unlocks opportunities for the LGBTIQ+ business community and provide connections with potential clients. Furthermore, we support the efforts of the National Minority Supplier Development Council in the United States, as well being founding members of the European Supplier Diversity Program led by Minority Supplier Development UK. Our support includes strategic advice, certification and building a strong corporate member base.\nWe also bring our capabilities to support organizations in building supplier diversity tools and awareness. We partnered with Minority Supplier Development United Kingdom (MSDUK) to develop a benchmarking tool that measures supplier diversity programs in areas such as supplier development, Tier 2 spending and leadership commitment. The analysis informs an annual report on U.K. Supplier Diversity Best Practices to benchmark and shape suppliers\u2019 strategies.\nAccenture helps our clients\u2014including many of the world\u2019s leading companies and governments\u2014navigate change, seize opportunities and transform into thriving organizations. By staying close to them, understanding and anticipating their needs, and investing in solutions to help them, we create tangible value.\n\n**FY2022 Highlights**\n\n- 9,000+ clients\n- 120+ countries around the world where we serve clients\n- 40+ industries\n- More than 75% of the FORTUNE Global 500 are Accenture clients\n- #26 on BrandZ\u2019s Most Valuable Global Brands, a 28% increase to over $82 billion in brand value\nCreating value together\n\nWe define 360\u00b0 value as delivering the financial business case and unique value a client may be seeking, and striving to partner with our clients to achieve greater progress on inclusion and diversity, reskill and upskill our clients\u2019 employees, help our clients achieve their sustainability goals, and create meaningful experiences, both with Accenture and for the customers and employees of our clients.\n\nDelivering 360\u00b0 value helps our clients become the next and best versions of themselves.

We have deep expertise in innovation consulting, including strategy, culture change and building new business models through to long-term technology innovation, which creates the products and markets of the future.\n\nPurpose, strategy and brand\n\nTo better define and communicate how we create value for our clients\u2014as well as for our people, shareholders, partners and communities\u2014we continue to build on the purpose, strategy and brand expression we introduced in fiscal 2021.\n\nPurpose\nOur commitment to 360\u00b0 value is powered by our purpose: \u201cto deliver on the promise of technology and human ingenuity.\u201d This is our unique reason for being that sets us apart and guides us, capturing the energy and inspiring nature of the work we do.\n\nStrategy\nThe core of our growth strategy is delivering 360\u00b0 value to our clients, people, shareholders, partners and communities. Our strategy defines the areas in which we will drive growth, build differentiation via 360\u00b0 value and enable our business to create that value every day.\n\nBrand expression\nWe celebrate and show the world the extraordinary things we do for clients today\u2014and create energy, excitement and momentum for everything we can do together tomorrow.\n\nThe five key forces of change\n\nThe companies that will lead in the next decade need to harness five key forces of change:\n\n- **Total enterprise reinvention** as we believe every part of every business must be transformed by technology, data and AI, with new ways of working and engaging with customers, employees and partners, and new business models, products and services. We are helping clients build their digital core, optimize operations and accelerate growth.\n\n- **Talent** as companies must be able to access great talent, be talent creators not just consumers, and unlock the potential of their people\u2014from the ways they organize and work, to their culture, to their employee value proposition.\n\n- **Sustainability** as consumers, employees, business partners, regulators and investors are demanding companies move from commitment to action\u2014we believe every business must be a sustainable business.\n\n- **The metaverse continuum** moving seamlessly between virtual and physical, which we believe will provide even greater possibilities in the next waves of digital transformation.\n\n- **The ongoing technology revolution** from the rich innovation to come in the powerful technologies being used to transform companies today, to the new fields of the future, from quantum computing to science and space technology.\n\nWe are investing and co-creating with our clients and partners to help businesses thrive across these forces. The strong demand we continue to see across our geographic markets, services and industries is being primarily driven by total enterprise reinvention and talent, as companies are in the early stages of harnessing them. We believe that helping clients navigate all five key forces of change will, in turn, drive our growth and ability to deliver even greater value to all stakeholders.\nExperience\nAccenture harnesses the best of technology, data, creativity and innovation to reimagine experience for our people, clients and partners. From our incredible people, who are passionate about applying their skills to make a difference through their work and in their communities, to our trusted relationships with our clients and ecosystem partners, we strive to deliver on our enduring value proposition while creating 360\u00b0 value for our stakeholders.\n\n**FY2022 Highlights**\n\n- **120,000+** of our people engaged in Eco Actions\n- **15,000** of our people participated in our Social Innovators initiative\n- Our people submitted **1,400+ ideas** for our Sustainability Innovation Challenge, which is expanding to include students in 2023\n- **267** Diamond clients, up from 229 last fiscal year\n- #1 partner for 9 out of our top 10 ecosystem partners\n- **100** clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million\nPeople\n\nAccenture strives to provide our people with a work environment that is positive, respectful and inclusive, with opportunities to use their time and talents to volunteer and innovate.\n\nOur people are passionate about getting involved and applying their skills to make a difference.\n\nIt matters to them that they work for a company that offers meaningful opportunities to give back. We regularly ask for their feedback through surveys and other engagement mechanisms such as our global Social Impact Participation survey.\n\nPurpose and participation\n\nWe offer many ways to get involved, including local and global volunteering opportunities, both virtual and in person, in addition to wider opportunities to act for social and environmental impact.\n\nDuring the second half of 2022, our volunteering program progressively included in-person events in most countries, while continuing to offer virtual volunteering. This allowed our people more options to continue making a positive impact helping our nonprofit partners.\n\nGlobal volunteering\n\nOffered across multiple geographies, our global volunteering efforts give our people the opportunity to make a difference at scale\u2014often working virtually alongside colleagues from around the world.\n\nEvery Name Counts\n\nAs part of the Arolsen Archives\u2019 Every Name Counts initiative, Accenture volunteers built an artificial intelligence (AI)-based solution that uses optical character recognition and other advanced technologies to accelerate the indexing of the world\u2019s largest archives dedicated to the victims of Nazi persecution.\n\nAlmost 2,000 Accenture people from more than 100 cities have participated in the indexing and extraction of documents, further improving our AI-based solution and helping to keep names and stories alive. Our process is estimated to be 40 times faster with AI than without and has organized more than 2.7 million documents into a digital resource for generations to come.\n\nLegal Access\n\nThrough Legal Access, our global pro bono program, Accenture legal professionals respond to urgent needs for pro bono service. To date, volunteers supported nearly 100 Afghan evacuees in the United States and completed more than 700 hours of legal research to support programs helping survivors of domestic violence, children deprived of liberty, and LGBTQ+ individuals seeking asylum. Our volunteers have contributed over 4,800 pro bono hours across 80 pro bono projects since the program began in 2020.\n\nCoderDojo\n\nThrough Coolest Projects, a leading technology showcase for young people, CoderDojo fosters creativity while opening students\u2019 eyes to STEM careers.\n\nAccenture volunteers in seven countries helped participants explore Scratch, web, mobile apps, games and advanced programming to bring their tech-inspired ideas to life.\n\nLocal volunteering\n\nWe also recognize that our people want to contribute close to home and respond to needs in their local communities.\n\nSenior Hackers\n\nOur volunteers helped senior citizens in Spain learn how to use mobile devices and applications through Senior Hackers events, where participants explored using tech to stay connected.\nEmpower Run\n\nIn India, we mobilized teams of more than 8,400 volunteers to participate in the Green Edition of our Empower Run 2022. For every 40,000 steps covered by each team, Accenture planted a mangrove tree, resulting in a total of 31,700 trees planted in the area of the Sundarbans.\n\nWalk for Wenjack\n\nIn October 2022, in the spirit of walking for truth and reconciliation, Accenture people throughout Canada organized their first Walk for Wenjack event in partnership with the Gord Downie & Chanie Wenjack Fund (DWF). Indigenous and non-Indigenous people came together to remember the legacy of residential schools, which forcibly separated Indigenous children from their families and prohibited them from acknowledging their heritage, culture or language. The walk retraced the steps of Chanie Wenjack, an Anishinaabe boy who ran away from a residential school in 1966 and died attempting to walk 600 kilometers to reunite with his family.\n\nWith close to 1,000 participants, the team raised more than $23,000 for the foundation, to continue the conversation that began with Chanie Wenjack\u2019s story and to aid Canada\u2019s collective reconciliation journey through a combination of awareness, education and action. Accenture has also partnered with DWF to launch six Legacy Spaces in our offices throughout Canada by 2024. Legacy Spaces are safe, welcoming places dedicated to providing education and spreading awareness about Indigenous history and our journey of reconciliation.\n\nEco Action\n\nOur ongoing Eco Action initiative helps our people nurture their passion for environmental sustainability. We continue to partner with Count Us In, a global movement that is building the largest and most ambitious citizen-led effort to avert the impacts of climate change. Examples include:\n\n- During COP26 we hosted multiple sessions to raise awareness, including an all-people Eco Action event to inspire our people to act for impact in a variety of ways. We also hosted global volunteering sessions in support of Zooniverse and GLOBE Observer, the app of The GLOBE Program, engaging volunteers across 34 countries.\n- On Earth Day, our people\u2014and our partners at Microsoft and Avanade\u2014collaborated on joint live events with Zooniverse in support of biodiversity, resulting in almost 9,000 classifications to advance understanding of penguins.\n- Local Eco Action events throughout the year included more than 175 of our people in Australia and New Zealand helping nonprofit organizations plant more than 5,500 plants and trees.\n- We offer year-round learning opportunities such as monthly Eco Action Clubs, at which we discuss environmental topics and the corporate and individual actions to address them, hints and tips in Eco Smart Choices postcards, and our Sustainability Quotient courses.\n- More than 120,000 of our people were eco engaged across the globe this year, participating in learning, volunteering, innovating and taking action to reduce their personal environmental footprints.\nOur people as innovators\n\nInnovation is at the heart of how we serve our clients, and how we engage our people on sustainability issues.\n\nWith the belief that anyone can be a social innovator, we work with our clients and ecosystem partners to harness and accelerate innovative ideas with us and nurture the next generation of innovators.\n\nMore than 15,000 Accenture people participated in our Social Innovators initiative, which includes the Sustainability Innovation Challenge, the Social Innovators Accelerator program and Social Innovation Learning opportunities.\n\nSustainability Innovation Challenge\n\nThe Sustainability Innovation Challenge aims to harness and inspire the collective intelligence of our innovators worldwide to design solutions for some of the world\u2019s greatest environmental and social issues. Challenge areas include: the Future of Food, Energy, Climate Action Education, Sustainable Consumers, Sustainable Software, Net-Positive Water and Climate Resilient Communities.\n\nMore than 1,400 ideas were submitted by 2,500 of our people. Participants commit to a six-month program to build sustainability skills and pressure-test their ideas through rapid prototyping, life-centered design, 360\u00b0 value, storytelling and building for scale.\n\nThey receive consistent support to advance their innovations, including mentoring from founders of Accenture acquisitions and investments, our Social Innovators Accelerator coaches and a brain trust of sustainability leaders from our clients and partners\u2014including startups, NGOs and nonprofits, and academia.\n\nA panel of jurors featuring leaders from across Accenture and our clients select the winning innovations with the most potential for implementation and impact.\n\nThis year\u2019s seven winning teams included:\n\n- **CERU**, a flexible learning platform providing educators with resources to monitor students\u2019 eco impact and inspire next-generation sustainable thinkers.\n- **WOTER**, a marketplace for water exchange to extend the life of water by trading recycled wastewater and reallocating unutilized water.\n\nThe winning teams continue to build their solutions as part of our Social Innovators Accelerator, where they receive support from our innovation hubs and participating clients to bring their sustainability innovation ideas to life.\n\nLooking ahead, at the Global Citizen Festival in September 2022, we announced that we will invite students around the world to join us in the 2023 Sustainability Innovation Challenge as we continue to support and invest in the next generation of thinkers and doers.\n\nSocial Innovators Accelerator\n\nFrom connections and coaching to funding and execution, our year-round Social Innovators Accelerator is designed to implement ideas that address four priority areas: disaster response and humanitarian relief, jobs and skills, inclusion and diversity, and environmental challenges. We supported 360 innovators across more than 50 projects.\n\nSocial innovation Learning\n\nMore than 1,000 Accenture people participated in four social innovation learning sessions with global learning provider Hyper Island. We also piloted a Social Innovation Leadership Immersion with Hyper Island as part of our ongoing education partnership to equip our senior managers, associate directors and managing directors with insights and tools to identify opportunities that can generate positive social and environmental outcomes.\nV360 Awards\n\nOur internal V360 Awards celebrate Accenture teams that are innovating to deliver 360\u00b0 value to our clients, company and community, and showcase how we embrace change and deliver on the promise of technology and human ingenuity.\n\nThis year, our people entered more than 1,360 projects across three categories:\n\n- **Client co-innovation**: co-creating with clients to deliver exceptional innovation and value.\n- **Community**: living our Stewardship core value, leveraging innovation and driving value for the communities in which we work and live.\n- **Company and people**: creating better experiences for our people and our organization as a whole, driving 360\u00b0 value and distinguishing Accenture as an innovation leader.\n\nWinning teams and their clients were celebrated in an event broadcast to all of Accenture from our global leadership meeting.\nClients\n\nToday\u2019s world sees the concept of value more broadly than it ever has. We are privileged to serve clients who turn to us as a trusted partner for the multidimensional value we deliver. We call this 360\u00b0 value, which is based on the differentiating experience delivered, with a focus on sustainability goals; and the benefits for people, communities, shareholders and key partners in addition to financial performance.\n\nThis framework fuels our ability to be a trusted partner with strong, enduring relationships with many of the world\u2019s leading companies and governments.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we had 100 clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million compared to 72 last fiscal year. The number of Accenture\u2019s Diamond clients\u2014our largest client relationships\u2014continues to grow significantly, as the value we deliver for leading organizations fosters their ability to thrive and deepens our bond. We concluded fiscal 2022 with 267 Diamond clients, up from 229 last fiscal year\u2014growth that demonstrates the trust and confidence our clients have in us.\n\nOur clients\u2019 experience\u2014including our proven track record for delivering on large, complex programs that drive tangible value\u2014is reflected in our client retention, with 99 of our top 100 clients having been with Accenture for more than a decade. Additionally, 70% of our new bookings are sole-sourced\u2014representing the deep trust our clients have in our work and their satisfaction with the value we deliver.\n\n360\u00b0 Value Meter\n\nAccenture builds powerful partnerships that make a profound impact on our clients\u2019 business, their employees and customers, and the communities they operate within. We do this by being client-first and value-led.\n\nAligning on our purpose, to deliver 360\u00b0 value by embracing change, drives greater impact for our clients and more meaningful work for our people.\n\nWe increasingly understand that our strategy, and the enhanced definition of value, needs to be measured and communicated, so that we can hold ourselves accountable and can mutually benefit from this unique concept with our clients. To do so, we have developed the 360\u00b0 Value Meter.\n\nOur 360\u00b0 Value Meter is helping our clients become the next and best versions of themselves. We use this framework with more than 600 Accenture clients worldwide, up from more than 300 a year ago, to monitor and measure the value we are creating together. The 360\u00b0 Value Meter helps us have more complete and meaningful client conversations on value.\n\nFirst, we listen to our clients, seeking to understand what they value while looking across value dimensions for opportunities to drive more value. We start with the client account team, who will measure the value we are driving for our client\u2019s business across all six dimensions: Sustainability, Talent, Inclusion & Diversity, Custom, Experience and Financial.\n\nWe then commit to measurable outcomes that we drive together and continually assess our progress toward our shared goals.\n\nWe continuously talk about the value we are creating as a team and co-creating with our clients at every opportunity\u2014building a shared narrative of what we are achieving together.\nFinancial\nA focus on delivering financial expectations and outcomes to measure business impact\u2014with relationships to other dimensions within the framework.\n\nExperience\nHelping our clients define experience-led business transformation by rethinking and redesigning customer interactions and measuring across sub-dimensions of employees and partners.\n\nSustainability\nMeasuring across sub-dimensions of environmental, social and governance aligned to a client\u2019s sustainability journey and goals.\n\nTalent\nBetter defining the need for future skills and how to upskill quickly and sustainably.\n\nInclusion & Diversity\nSupporting I&D by addressing Accenture\u2019s team diversity and culture, that of our clients and their I&D agenda, and how we co-create to deliver inclusive and accessible design solutions.\n\nCustom\nThe custom dimension reflects the client specific priorities and/or initiatives that extend beyond the other five dimensions. Accenture\u2019s Custom dimension is referred to as Client.\n\nOur 360\u00b0 Value Meter enables regular, relevant and meaningful conversations with our clients on value, and builds trust and a deeper understanding about what our clients value most.\n\n360\u00b0 value is not a linear model, and neither is the 360\u00b0 value journey of any organization. Expanding awareness of how value is driven and delivered accelerates progress and lasting change.\n\nOur results consider multidimensional value from the beginning to provide the best possible results for our clients and drive the most impact on their business performance, for our shared success.\n\nThe 360\u00b0 value journey evolves over time. For example, at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many clients in the travel space at first focused on the Financial as well as Experience dimensions, and Accenture\u2019s approach helped enable a 360\u00b0 value orientation to consider the other key dimensions. As the industry returned to growth, with this came a renewed focus on Sustainability and Talent & Organization dimensions. All through the process, the Inclusion & Diversity dimension guided the strongest possible strategy and helped teams to drive maximum value.\nWhat our clients are saying\n\n**Astellas**\n\u201cWe were able to move to a full-cloud platform with the help of Accenture, which has extensive experience in implementing core platforms for global operations. The success of the project was due to Accenture\u2019s ability to bring together a wide range of experts from around the world for a truly \u2018one-team\u2019 approach with Astellas. We can centralize data and make the best use of this technology to create a business platform that supports visualization and bold data-driven decision-making. In collaboration with Accenture and other internal and external partners, Astellas will continue to focus on creating innovations that contribute to the health of people around the world.\u201d\n\n**Siam Commercial Bank Public Company Limited**\n\u201cOur efforts to modernize our data & AI platform is yielding great business results.

If you want to go far, go together.\u2019 Together, with Accenture, Discover and Oracle, I\u2019m pleased to say we did both.\u201d\n\n**The Body Shop**\n\u201cThe Body Shop have got some really massive ambitions, and now I really feel like we\u2019ve got a technology platform and a partnership with Accenture to achieve them.\u201d\n\nMichal, Senior Manager \u2013 Technology Delivery\nLondon, United Kingdom\nPartners\n\nEcosystem partners\n\nOur ecosystem partnerships enable us to deliver distinctive business value to our clients, with industry analysts consistently rating us a leader across our technology offerings.\n\nWe are proud to be the No. 1 partner for nine out of our top 10 ecosystem partners, all leaders in the technology industry, and now count 249 partners in our ecosystem.\n\nWe have strong relationships with the world\u2019s leading technology companies, as well as emerging startups, which enable us to enhance our service offerings, augment our capabilities and deliver distinctive business value to our clients.\n\nWe also work together to make a positive social impact in our communities.

Accenture has been involved in the initiative since its launch and signed the CEO \u201cLetter of Commitment\u201d in support of the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics, which was showcased at the Davos Dialogues in January 2021. |\nAssessing our ESG priority issues\n\nWe continually assess our ESG priorities based on their importance to our business and our stakeholders. We considered our expanded ESG targets, our Enterprise Risk Management program and other related impacts on our people and global operations.
