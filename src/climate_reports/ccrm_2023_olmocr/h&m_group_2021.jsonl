It includes a CEO comment and a description of our business, followed by our legal annual report. See our Corporate Governance report on pages 39\u201352, the Administration report including the Statutory Sustainability report on pages 54\u201374, and the Financial reports on pages 75\u2013104.\n\nOur annual and sustainability report complies with the applicable Swedish and EU legislation as well as the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted by the EU. External frameworks in this report include the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), which can be found as a part of the Administration report on pages 72\u201374.\n\nWe complement our annual and sustainability report with the Sustainability Disclosure, which provides additional detailed information on our sustainability strategy, policies, goals, programmes and performance data. The Sustainability Disclosure complies with external reporting frameworks such as the Global Reporting Initiative GRI and the UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework. Read our Sustainability Disclosure here.\nBefore summing up the year 2021, at the time of writing I would like to begin by expressing the company\u2019s deep concern over developments in Ukraine and extending our sympathy to all those affected. We care about all our colleagues and join all those around the world who are calling for peace. At the present time we have temporarily paused all sales in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus.\n\n2021 \u2013 a strong recovery\n\nThe H&M group\u2019s recovery continued in 2021. Although sales were negatively affected by restrictions associated with the pandemic, customers showed clearly that they appreciate our offering. We ended the year with good sales development, greatly improved profits and in a strong financial position.\n\nAt the end of 2021 sales were back at the same level as before the pandemic and profitability was better than for several years, despite supply chain disruption and other geopolitical challenges. The H&M group\u2019s net sales in local currencies increased by 12 percent in the 2021 financial year. Earnings after financial items amounted to SEK 14,300 million.\n\nI would like to thank all colleagues in the group for their efforts over the past year. Our strong culture with our shared values has been important for our ability to manage the challenges during the pandemic, which contributed to the good recovery. Our colleagues everywhere in the organisation have demonstrated great commitment and worked to meet customers\u2019 expectations despite the challenges, restrictions and lockdowns due to the pandemic. The increase in profits also means that we have been able to contribute a further SEK 224 million to the H&M Incentive Program, our incentive scheme for all employees of the H&M group.\nCEO letter\n\nOur customer offering and our stores\nTo meet customers\u2019 ever-increasing expectations, we are continuing to develop the customer offering for all our unique brands by offering customers the best combination of fashion, quality, price and sustainability. Demand for good value and sustainable products is expected to grow and our customer offering is well positioned for this. We develop the customer offering constantly by broadening the assortment and expanding the range of services for a more sustainable lifestyle. Engaging our customers in various ways allows us to build long-term, value-creating relationships and attract even more customers around the world. Among other things, customers can today carry out repairs, rent clothes or buy and sell second-hand.\n\nOur physical and digital sales channels complement and strengthen each other. We are continuing our work to integrate the channels further in order to create a shopping experience that is as smooth and inspiring as possible. Alongside our continued initiatives for digital growth, we are intensifying our work to ensure that the store portfolio is optimised.\n\nProduct flow initiatives\nFor many years we have been working to make the supply chain faster, more efficient and more flexible \u2013 and this has benefited us during the pandemic. The significant investments we have made in tech, AI, advanced analytics and logistics enable us to always have the right product in the right place at the right time and at the right cost.\n\nContinually enhancing our improved accuracy is not just good for the customer offering, but also contributes to a more sustainable use of resources.\n\nIntegrated sustainability\nIn 2021 we took further steps to improve sustainability in all parts of the business. For example, we continued to increase the share of recycled or otherwise more sustainably produced materials in the collections, with the percentage of recycled materials tripling; we further improved product transparency for customers using the Higg Index tool; we launched the \u201cCirculator\u201d circular design tool; and we reduced scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 22 percent and scope 3 emissions by 9 percent in absolute figures compared with 2019.\n\nOur sustainability efforts were recognised on various occasions during the year, including being ranked second in the Fashion Transparency Index of 250 fashion brands. We were also appointed as UN Global Compact Lead for our commitment to responsible business.\n\nThis year is the first year that we at the H&M group are integrating our annual and sustainability reports. This is an important step and a natural development since sustainability is an integral part of our business.\n\nHELENA HELMERSSON, CEO\n\nInvestments in tech and sustainability\nOur financial strength and long-term approach give us the ability to invest in innovations within tech, materials and sustainable initiatives, with an ambition to lead the change in the fashion industry towards becoming circular and renewable. We are constantly evaluating investments and acquisitions that could contribute to our continued sustainable growth. Through our investment arm Co:lab we have around 20 investments in new companies \u2013 such as Renewcell, Ambercycle and Infiniti Fiber, which is developing new techniques within textiles recycling. These companies\u2019 solutions are now being scaled up and by investing early, we have secured access to these innovative sustainable materials.\n\n\u2014 This year is the first year that we at the H&M group are integrating our annual and sustainability reports. This is an important step and a natural development since sustainability is an integral part of our business.\n\nHELENA HELMERSSON, CEO\n\nOutlook\nWe remain focused on developing the customer offering and delivering the best combination of fashion, quality, price and sustainability. We are proud that our strong recovery continued in 2021 with much appreciated collections and products, continued customer focus and strong relations with our partners.\n\nAt the time of writing, however, we are deeply concerned about the course of events in Ukraine and our thoughts go out to all those affected. We are monitoring developments closely and doing all we can to help people as much as possible. The H&M group, the H&M Foundation and the Erling Persson Foundation have donated millions of kronor as well as clothing and other essentials to organisations such as UNHCR, Save the Children, the Red Cross and UNICEF. We join all those around the world who are calling for peace.\n\nHelena Helmersson, CEO\nH & M Hennes & Mauritz AB\n\n1) Scope 1: All direct greenhouse gas emissions from our own operations. Scope 2: Indirect greenhouse gas emissions from the consumption of purchased electricity, heat or steam used in our own operations. Scope 3: Other indirect emissions, such as emissions related to transport-related activities in vehicles not owned or controlled by the reporting entity, electricity-related activities, e.g. T&D losses not covered in scope 2, outsourced activities, waste disposal etc. Includes emissions related to raw materials, fabric production, garment making, manufacture of other products and consumption of electricity by customers. Scope 3: In 2021 we continued the efforts to improve the accuracy of the scope 3 emissions data. This has resulted in certain changes in our reported emissions compared with previous years. Read more about the updated scope 3 emissions data on page 63 of the statutory sustainability report. The customer use phase is not included in the scope 3 element of this target.\n\n2) The baseline for the sales goal is 2021. The H&M group\u2019s goal is to reduce its carbon footprint by 50 percent by 2030 baseline 2019 in accordance with our commitment to COP26. Profitability refers to operating profit in relation to sales. The ambition is to achieve the profitability target no later than 2024. The H&M group\u2019s target to increase sales by 10\u201315 percent per year with continued high profitability remains a long-term target.\nH&M Group at a glance\n\nH&M Group at a glance 2021 ................... 5\nOur overall business idea ...................... 6\nOur culture and values ....................... 7\n### H&M Group at a glance 2021\n\n| Markets | Net sales | Profit after financial items | Change in scope 1 and 2 CO\u2082e emissions |\n|---------|-----------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| 75      | 199 billion SEK in net sales. | 14.3 billion SEK, in profit after financial items. | -22% |\n\n| Employees | Share of online sales | Recycled materials | Change in scope 3 CO\u2082e emissions |\n|-----------|-----------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|\n| 155,000   | 32%                   | 17.9%              | -9%                              |\n\n- The total number of employees amounted to approximately 155,000.\n- Tripled the share of recycled materials used in our garments from 5.8 percent to 17.9 percent towards our goal 30 percent recycled materials by 2025.\n\n| Cash flow | Positions of responsibility | Plastic packaging | Fair partner |\n|-----------|-----------------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| 45 billion SEK in cash flow from operating activities. | 71% of the positions of responsibility within our own organisation are held by women. | -27.8% reduction of plastic packaging. | 98% of suppliers say that H&M Group is a fair business partner. |\nOur overall business idea\n\nThe H&M group\u2019s unique brands meet customers\u2019 demand for the best combination of fashion, quality and sustainability at affordable prices. We give customers unbeatable value and access to a more sustainable lifestyle.\n\nWe are a customer-focused, creative, value-driven, responsible fashion and design company. Our business consists mainly of sales of clothing, accessories, footwear, cosmetics, home textiles and homeware to consumers. Sales take place through digital and physical channels, i.e. online and in retail stores. The sales channels are well integrated to provide a consistent, seamless and inspiring customer experience when, where and how customers choose. In certain markets our products are sold via franchise partners. The H&M group\u2019s brands are H&M, H&M HOME, COS, Weekday, Monki, & Other Stories, ARKET, Afound and Singular Society, along with our B2B initiatives Treadler and Creator Studio. We are also the majority shareholder in Sellpy.\n\nOur value chain includes every step from idea to customer \u2013 the design and development of products and services, the selection and development of raw materials, suppliers of materials products and services, logistics, distribution, sales, and customer use such as garment care, reuse and recycling.\n\nWe grow our business in a responsible and resilient way that will contribute to both positive impact in the world around us and long-term value with financial growth and profitability. Our financial strength and long-term approach give us the ability to continue to invest in further improving the customer offering and experience as well as in innovations within tech development, materials and sustainable initiatives. United by our values, we have an ambition to lead the change towards a circular and climate positive fashion industry, while being a fair and equal company.\n\nEvery customer is unique and therefore local relevance is important. We always strive to have multicultural and diverse teams so that we can be relevant and connect with our customers\u2019 needs and perspectives. Our teams contribute to innovate and to promote diversity and equality through our products, marketing and communications, and to advance inclusion in communities and in wider society where we are present.\nOur culture and values\n\nH&M Group\u2019s shared values define who we are, what we stand for and how we act.\n\n- We are one team\n- We believe in people\n- We are entrepreneurs\n- We are constantly improving\n- We are cost-conscious\n- We keep it simple\n- We are straightforward and open-minded\nOur values have guided us since the day that the company was founded, and they continue to guide the business today. The values influence how we act, grow and contribute to creating workplaces and environments where people and businesses thrive.\n\nA fundamental respect for the individual and for the equal value of all people is at the core of our business. This applies to all aspects \u2014 from fair wages and benefits, through working hours, freedom of association, and safe and secure workplaces free from discrimination, to all our colleagues\u2019 opportunities for growth and development. A solid foundation of fair labour standards combined with social policies further enables good working conditions in safe and healthy environments.\n\nOur customers are at the heart of every decision, enabling us to deliver unbeatable customer value and the best experience. We connect and collaborate within teams and across brands and functions as a way of creating synergies. By striving to be a relevant, fair and equal employer we attract, develop and retain talent. We continually work to develop competences and skills, as well as leadership. This is done in inclusive and diverse environments that promote equality for all regardless of factors such as gender, age or ethnicity. We encourage everyone to be themselves and respect others for who they are. Our diversity makes us strong and creates an inclusive and welcoming workplace where everyone\u2019s individuality is highly valued. We strive to build diverse teams to better understand our customers and promote equality through products, marketing and communications. This helps us advance inclusion in the group\u2019s communities and in wider society.\n\nHaving constructive workplace dialogue built on trust and respect is critical to being a responsible employer. We believe in freedom of association, respecting the rights of our employees to establish or join organisations of their own choice. Consequently, we respect our employees\u2019 right to decide who should represent them in the workplace and if they want to be a member of a union. We strive to have a close, open and constructive dialogue with unions around the world.\n\nWe had approximately 155,000 employees at the end of the financial year. The average number of employees in the group, converted into full-time positions, was 107,375, of which 10,540 were employed in Sweden. Of the average number of employees, around 74 percent were women and 26 percent were men. Of the positions of responsibility within the company, such as store and country managers, women held 71 percent and men held 29 percent.\nHighlights 2021\n\nKey figures ........................................ 10\nSales and stores per segment ............... 11\nHighlights 2021 ................................. 12\n## Key figures\n\n| 1 DECEMBER\u201330 NOVEMBER | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Net sales, SEK m        | 198,967| 187,031| 232,755|\n| Change net sales from previous year in SEK, % | +6     | -20    | +11    |\n| Change net sales previous year in local currencies, % | +12    | -18    | +6     |\n| Operating profit, SEK m | 15,255 | 3,099  | 17,346 |\n| Operating margin, %     | 7.7    | 1.7    | 7.5    |\n| Profit after financial items, SEK m | 14,300 | 2,052  | 17,391 |\n| Profit after tax, SEK m | 11,010 | 1,243  | 13,443 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, SEK m | 27,471 | 16,540 | 12,312 |\n| Stock-in-trade, SEK m   | 37,306 | 38,209 | 37,823 |\n| Number of shares, thousands\u00b9 | 1,655,072 | 1,655,072 | 1,655,072 |\n| Earnings per share, SEK\u00b2 | 6.65   | 0.75   | 8.12   |\n| Cash flow from operating activities, SEK m | 44,619 | 25,900 | 28,896 |\n| Dividend per share, SEK\u00b9\u00b2 | 6.50   | -      | 9.75   |\n| Return on equity, %     | 19.2   | 2.2    | 23.3   |\n| Total number of stores  | 4,801  | 5,018  | 5,076  |\n| Average number of employees | 107,375 | 110,325 | 126,376 |\n\n### 1 DECEMBER\u201330 NOVEMBER\n\n| GOAL | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Climate: % absolute reduction (scope 1, 2 and 3) in CO\u2082e emissions compared with 2019 baseline.\u00b3 | -56% by 2030 | Scope 1 & 2: -22 | Scope 1 & 2: -17 |\n| Climate: % renewable electricity in own operations\u00b3 | 100% by 2030 | 95 | 90 | 96 |\n| Commercial goods: % of recycled or other more sustainably sourced materials used\u00b3 | 100% by 2030 | 80.0 | 64.5 | 57.1 |\n| \u2013 Other more sustainably sourced | - | 62.1 | 58.7 | 54.9 |\n| \u2013 Recycled | 30% by 2025 | 179 | 5.8 | 2.2 |\n\n\u00b9 Before and after dilution.\n\u00b2 Dividend which was decided and paid during the year.\n\u00b3 Explained further on page 66.\nFor definitions and explanations in this report see page 85.\n## Sales and stores per segment\n\n| Segment                  | NET SALES 2021 (SEK M) | NET SALES 2020 (SEK M) | NEW STORES (NET) DURING THE YEAR | NUMBER OF STORES 30 NOV 2021 |\n|--------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Europe & Africa          | 132,434                | 128,440                | -144                             | 2,884                       |\n| Asia & Oceania           | 26,304                 | 28,586                 | -50                              | 1,161                       |\n| North & South America    | 40,229                 | 30,005                 | -23                              | 756                         |\n| **Total**                | **198,967**            | **187,031**            | **-217**                         | **4,801**                   |\nHighlights 2021\n\nSales increased to SEK 199 billion and profit after financial items to SEK 14,300 m\n\nAs in 2020, the pandemic, the consequences of climate change and the increasing digitalisation of society had the greatest impact on 2021.

By offering the best combination of fashion, quality, price and sustainability we give our customers unbeatable value and access to a more sustainable lifestyle. Our ambition is to lead the industry towards a sustainable future. This drives us to think in new ways, bring in new business models, build new partnerships and dare to do things differently.\nOur fashion and design\n\nEach of our brands has a design and buying function creating inspiring and relevant collections. Customer focus, creativity and salesmanship are core to the process of creating what the customers want. Our more than 600 designers create collections based on trend forecasts and analysis of customer preferences. Diverse backgrounds, perspectives and skills within design, materials, craftsmanship, circularity, sustainability within for example material and circularity, customer needs and buying processes are enhanced by technology such as 3D design applications and AI capabilities to get the right product to the right point of sale at the right time. Creating the products our customers want with minimal use of natural resources and the lowest possible impact on people and the planet is well in line with our business idea. It enables our brands to create even more relevant collections and to push the boundaries to further improve ourselves and our industry.\n\nWe use our size and experience to drive positive change, innovation and transparency across our industry and, together with our many partners, aim to maximise positive impacts and minimise negative ones. This also gives us greater leverage in tackling sometimes complex risks and seizing new opportunities across our value chain.\n\nAlways acting ethically, responsibly and with integrity is essential for keeping the trust of our customers, other stakeholders and the world around us. We expect this of ourselves as well as our partners.\n\nLong-term good relationships with carefully chosen suppliers and transparency in supply chains are therefore of strategic importance to us. We publish our supplier list in accordance with the Transparency Pledge. H&M and H&M HOME online continue to offer customers on-product transparency information about product materials, factory locations, garment care and recycling options. ARKET, COS, Monki and Weekday added supplier lists or fact sheets to their websites. And increasingly we are also providing detailed fact sheets about the climate, environmental and social footprint of individual products using the Higg Index Sustainability Profile \u2013 a new tool developed by the multistakeholder Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC). We are also exploring new technologies to further improve traceability of materials through the supply chain.\n\nClose teamwork with our partners enables a flexible supply chain and is part of our work to ensure the best customer offering and experience in all sales channels.\n\nIn parallel, new business models, initiatives and partnerships are being developed to bring a more sustainable lifestyle to more people. These initiatives provide the group with additional revenue streams as well as contribute to more sustainable use of resources.\n\nWe support circular design and production. In late 2021 we launched the innovative circular design tool \u201cCirculator\u201d to underline our ambition to design all our products for circularity by 2025. The tool not only aims to enable our own teams to create products fit for a circular economy but will also in the long-term encourage others to do the same.\nOur brands and business ventures\n\nOur brands and business ventures all have their own unique identities. They share a passion to make great fashion and design available in a sustainable way, and to enable a circular lifestyle.

Wherever, whenever and however customers want to meet us \u2013 in our stores and all digital touchpoints such as our websites, apps, social media and in digital marketplaces \u2013 we want to offer a convenient and inspiring experience in which the channels interact and strengthen each other, facilitating a holistic customer journey.\n\nOur expansion is taking place with a focus on omni-channel growth. Physical and digital channels are therefore being increasingly integrated, and the store portfolio is being further optimised to ensure a relevant presence and format and the best experience for our customers in each market.\n\nWe are building long-term, value-creating relationships that stretch far beyond a single product by engaging our customers more in various ways. We work towards circularity across the entire value chain, with circular products, supply chains and customer journeys. We are continually enhancing the customer experience by for example offering innovative services such as garment rental, second hand, repairs, alterations and climate-smart deliveries \u2013 all to help customers live a more sustainable lifestyle.\n\nDemand for good value, sustainable products and services is expected to further grow in the wake of the pandemic and our customer offering is well positioned for this. Through our work to lead the change towards circular and climate positive fashion, we are increasing the share of recycled and more sustainably sourced materials and we are developing new revenue streams.\nOur circular customer journey\n\nFirst Hand: Our brands offer customers garments that are made from recycled and more sustainably sourced materials and are designed using a circular design and product development process.\n\nSecond Life: If the garment is too worn to repair or resell, customers can take it to the garment collecting point available in our stores. The textiles can then be recycled to create new fibres and garments.\n\nSecond Hand: If a customer does not need the garment anymore, they can give it an extended lifespan by selling it through Sellpy, a digital platform for second-hand fashion and other products. H&M Group has been the majority owner of Sellpy since 2019.\n\nSecond Chance: Customers can repair their garments in the H&M stores that offer repair services.\n\nBy offering a more circular customer journey we support customers with services throughout their garment\u2019s entire lifespan: from first-hand to second-hand, from a second chance to a second life. Our circular services include re-sell, remake, repairs, garment rental, and garment collecting for textile recycling and more.\n\nBy extending the lifecycle of materials and products we increase value for customers and make a sustainable lifestyle accessible to more people, thereby reducing resource dependencies.\nStores\n\nWe continuously develop our store portfolio to ensure that we have the right store with the right format in the right place. Our stores, which are located in the most prominent shopping areas, are a great asset where we meet our customers in real life every day. The stores play a vital role in our relationship with our customers, being a shopping and fashion destination, inspirational as well as brand building, where the customers can physically explore and experience our brands. Customers tell us that they appreciate the stores for proximity, availability and the opportunity to try on clothes, create looks and find their perfect fit. Alongside continued focus on digital growth, we are intensifying our work to ensure a relevant store portfolio that meets customers\u2019 needs in interaction with our digital channels. In addition, the role of the physical stores has evolved to become an important part of the supply chain, especially within last mile options, where customers can combine shopping with services like click and collect, pick-up in store and online returns. Altogether this provides a smooth and flexible shopping experience.\n\nWe build and operate our stores in a sustainable and resource efficient way, and thereby protecting natural resources. Our Circular Built Environment Strategy prioritises resource optimisation, helping to reduce our carbon footprint. It requires us to design and build stores based on circular principles \u2014 reduce, reuse, repair and recycle \u2014 and to use only recycled or other more sustainably sourced materials. In order to achieve our ambitious sustainability goals, we work closely with all our business partners.\n\nWe are growing through an omni perspective, which means combining and integrating digital and physical stores in the best possible way. To always have a healthy and relevant store portfolio we make sure we optimise the space and format, which also involves rebuilds and adjusting the number of stores, to ensure we have the best store portfolio in each market. The group\u2019s contracts allow around a third of leases to be renegotiated or exited each year. In 2021 we opened 104 (129) new stores and closed 321 (187) stores. This resulted in a net closure of around 217 stores. We had 4,801 stores in 75 markets at the end of the financial year. Most of the openings in 2022 will be in growth markets, while the closures will mainly be in established markets.\nOnline\n\nOur well-developed online stores are a great complement to the physical stores where the channels interact and strengthen each other. Our digital integration to offer a seamless experience continues, enabling customers to interact and engage with us where, when and how they choose \u2014 offering a relevant, inspiring and convenient experience. We are continuing our initiatives for digital growth, including constantly updating the online environment for all our brands.\n\nDuring the pandemic when stores were temporarily closed due to restrictions, we redirected and reallocated products between the sales markets and sales channels, thereby strengthening our online channels further so that our customers were able to access our collections continuously.\n\nAll our brands have well-developed online operations. H&M has a presence in 54 online markets. Several of our brands can also be found on various external marketplaces. COS, Weekday, Monki, & Other Stories and ARKET offer global selling, which enables customers in around 70 additional markets to shop online. The exact number of markets per brand that have this service varies.\n\nIn some markets our online customers have the ability to choose from various low carbon options by utilizing a range of wide and flexible delivery options. Moreover, H&M customers in several markets including the Netherlands and parts of Sweden, Italy and France, can choose to receive and return items using a bicycle delivery service, electric vehicles or by foot. This in combination with using biogas, Hydro-treated Vegetable Oil (HVO) and electric vehicles from the logistics centre also help reducing CO\u2082e emissions.\nInitiatives for an improved customer experience\n\nWe work continually on improvements to offer customers the best possible shopping experience. Here are some examples of ongoing initiatives:\n\n\u2014 **H&M\u2019s customer loyalty programme** members can benefit from more personalised offerings and digital services for inspiration and a smooth customer experience. Customers are also rewarded for contributing to a circular lifestyle through H&M\u2019s garment collecting, climate smart delivery options, bringing their own bag and choosing products made from more sustainably sourced materials.\n\n\u2014 **Higg Index Sustainability Profile.** Increasingly, detailed information about the climate, environmental and social footprint of individual products is provided on our products using the Higg Index Sustainability Profile \u2013 a new tool developed by the multistakeholder Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC).\n\n\u2014 **More payment options.** Members of H&M can pay now or later through the H&M app, whether shopping in store or online.\n\n\u2014 **Digital receipts.** Customers can receive digital receipts in the H&M app in most markets.\n\n\u2014 **Visual Search.** Image recognition helps customers by making recommendations and suggesting potential buys based on pictures that customers have taken or been inspired by.\n\n\u2014 **Deliveries.** Next day delivery, express delivery and other climate smart last mile deliveries continue to be rolled out in more markets.\n\n\u2014 **Find in Store.** On seeing an item online, customers can use their mobile devices to find it quickly and easily in the size they want, in a physical store or online.\n\n\u2014 **Scan & Buy.** Customers can scan the QR code on a product in store to find and buy the item online in the size and colour they prefer.\n\n\u2014 **In Store Mode** allows customers to use their mobile devices to see what items are available in the store they are visiting as well as online.\n\n\u2014 **Click & Collect** allows customers to pick up online purchases in store.\n\n\u2014 **Online returns** in store lets customers return their online purchases in selected stores.\n\n\u2014 **#HMxME** enables customers to share their own fashion stories from Instagram while also providing an easy way to buy the items.\n\n\u2014 **Size Guide** helping customers to find right size online, also for external brands, not only H&M Group products. Launched in the US, Germany and Sweden, being rolled out to more markets during 2022.\n\n\u2014 **Rate & Review** lets customers rate and review H&M products.\n\n\u2014 **RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)** allows for increased precision in the supply chain and stores, which leads to improved accuracy and availability.\n\n\u2014 **Self-service checkouts** have been much appreciated by customers as being convenient and easy and are being rolled out to more markets.\n\n\u2014 **Instagram.** In the US, H&M customers can shop directly from inspirational images and videos on Instagram and get notifications on Instagram when H&M releases new collections.\n\n\u2014 **H&M HOME X Augmented Reality.** In this augmented reality pilot, customers can preview selected H&M HOME products by virtually \u201cplacing\u201d them in their own environment using the camera on their smartphone.\nFlexible supply chain\n\nProduction, logistics and distribution ............... 29\n\u2014 Recycled, regenerated and more sustainably sourced materials ............... 30\n\u2014 Renewable energy ......................... 30\n\u2014 Fair jobs and positive social impacts ............. 31\n\u2014 Logistics and distribution ..................... 31\n\u2014 Reusable, plastic-free packaging ............... 31\nProduction, logistics and distribution\n\nWe always listen to our customers, to understand their expectations and needs so that we can offer them the products they want \u2014 always with the best combination of fashion, quality, price, sustainability, speed and flexibility.\n\nOur value chain extends from design and production all the way to the customer. Our buying teams always strive to make the most sustainable choices of materials and processes, such as buying the right product from the right market at the right time, at the right cost and on the right terms. We have set up internal carbon pricing to guide our organisation to minimise carbon emissions when making decisions about which materials, production processes and modes of transport to use. Read more about in our Sustainability Disclosure. Our long-term and close relationships with suppliers mean that we can react quickly to changing customer demands and trends.\n\nOur supply chain is the part of the value chain that covers production, logistics and distribution. Speed, flexibility and differentiated product flows in the supply chain ensure the best customer offering with a high degree of local relevance. This makes it possible to react quickly to trends and demand and produce with short lead times.\n\nOur tech drive involving AI, new distribution systems and highly automated logistics centres is an important part of our work. Combined with more efficient processes, this increases our precision \u2014 i.e. quantification, allocation, pricing and personalisation \u2014 and thereby contributes to leaner production and a more sustainable use of resources. Our demand-driven supply chain always strives to find the optimal flow of goods with the lowest environmental impact and highest customer satisfaction. Speed, availability, cost efficiency and accuracy are decisive key factors for achieving this.\n\nDuring the pandemic we showed that we are responsive and fast. Together with our suppliers and other partners, we have managed challenges in the supply chain. We have been able to quickly adjust volumes, sales channels and markets based on changes in customer demand and unexpected events. It works both ways: we can increase quickly but can also scale back the volumes quickly. Flexibility has been a vital enabler during the pandemic and is expected to be even more important going forward.\n\nIt is important to have a flexible, efficient and fast supply chain. Our supply chain is built on partnership, mutual trust and fair purchasing practices. We have long-term strategic partnerships and maintain a close dialogue with our suppliers through our production offices located across sourcing markets. Together with our suppliers we are addressing environmental and social impacts in our supply chain. Significant parts of our total climate footprint occur in our supply chain, particularly in raw materials production, as well as in fabric manufacturing and processes like dyeing and washing. These are also often water-intensive processes and have an impact on water resources.\n\nTogether with our suppliers and other partners, we can make important contributions to reducing climate and other environmental impacts and can contribute to improved way of living for people and their communities, as we further improve resource efficiency and skill sets and create a flexible, circular and resilient supply chain.\n\nAI, advanced data analytics and demand-driven production improve both efficiency and local relevance.\n\nHaving flexible, efficient and fast logistics and distribution for example last mile solutions are essential to offer the best customer experience. Our flexible range planning and efficient distribution ensure that both the latest trends and timeless classics can always be found in our stores and online at the best price.\nRecycled, regenerated and more sustainably sourced materials\n\nThe fashion industry depends on limited natural resources, with an inevitable impact on the planet. Reducing dependency on such limited resources and instead developing new sources creates business advantages and reduces impacts on the planet.\n\nMoving from virgin materials with a high environmental impact to recycled, regenerated and more sustainably sourced ones is therefore important for our long-term sustainable growth. By investing in and scaling production of innovative materials we are guaranteed access, while having a stake in the pioneering companies that can create new revenue streams. Investments in this area can also mitigate future risks connected to resource scarcity and reduce our carbon footprint.\n\nOur goal is for 100 percent of our materials to come from recycled or other more sustainable sources by 2030. An important step towards achieving 30 percent recycled materials by 2025 is that some of our collections are made of materials using new garment recycling technology\u2014a new ground breaking technology. The material Circulose\u00ae, made from recycled cotton waste, was developed by Renewcell, a textile recycling company. We are one of the shareholders and have a multi-year contract for the supply of Circulose\u00ae material. Another example is the Infinited Fiber Company. In 2021 we led a new investment round in the company and signed a multi-year agreement to secure access to its regenerated textile fibre Infinna\u2122.\n\nRenewable energy\n\nH&M Group\u2019s goal is to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in absolute figures by 56 percent by 2030 (baseline 2019). As one part of this we are working to source 100 percent renewable electricity in our own operations and to increase the use of renewable electricity among our partners and suppliers. Through long-term partnership with renewable energy platform we aim to contribute to continued de-carbonisation.\n\nTo achieve our 100 percent goal we will continue to work towards a balanced portfolio of Energy Attribute Certificates, power purchase agreements on large-scale renewables projects, and rooftop solar photovoltaics.\n\nWe work with suppliers that share our sustainability vision for a more sustainable fashion industry. We require all suppliers and business partners to sign and comply with our Sustainability Commitment and Code of Ethics.\n\n1) Emissions from the customer use phase are not included in the scope 3 part of this goal, to fully align with the target boundary requirements of the SBTi Net Zero Standard.\nFair jobs and positive social impacts\n\nOur tier 1 and 2 production supply chains alone contributes to the employment of around one and a half million people. It\u2019s our responsibility to respect and work to advance the human rights and working conditions of the people working for our suppliers and ensure they know their rights. We collaborate to improve industry wide working conditions, particularly with respect to wages and worker representation. Together with our suppliers and other partners, we can make important contributions to improving the livelihood of millions of people and their communities \u2014 as well as reducing climate and other environmental impacts. At the same time, we can further improve resource efficiency and skill sets and create a flexible, fast and resilient supply chain. These are some of the reasons why our supply chain is a strong focus area in our sustainability strategy.\n\nOur focus is on ensuring fair jobs with fair compensation1 and benefits in safe, secure workplaces free from discrimination, where everyone has the right to freedom of association and equal opportunities to develop. Our approach is informed by the International Labour Organization\u2019s definition of decent work, our Human Rights Policy and the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights, among other things.\n\nWe conduct stringent due diligence of our supply chain. As part of this, we assess not only our salient human rights issues on an annual basis, but also the long-term risks and impacts \u2014 such as what a shift to a more digital, circular and climate positive value chain could mean for future work.\n\nLogistics and distribution\n\nThere is a constant focus on optimising transport by choosing the most optimal equipment and filling transport units to the maximum. This leads to a reduction in shipped transport units, thereby lowering our CO\u2082e emissions.\n\nWe work solely with ocean carriers that are verified according to the Clean Cargo Working Group protocol. Within air freight we are active members of the Sustainable Air Freight Alliance, driving the environmental agenda to reduce CO\u2082e emissions from air freight and promote responsible freight transport. Emissions are tracked on a quarterly basis via upload of shipment data by each transport service provider.\n\nOver the last two years we have purchased eco-fuel for a significant share of our ocean transports, making H&M one of the biggest buyers of ECO Delivery amongst shipping line Maersk\u2019s customers.\n\nAn important part of our omni model is the group\u2019s logistics systems and investments within tech and AI. Several initiatives involving new highly automated logistics centres with a focus on innovation are in progress globally. This creates additional capacity, flexibility and speed between sales channels as well as increasing assortment availability.\n\nIn the US two highly automated logistics centres have been taken into use in the past year. We have a highly automated logistics centre in Perris outside Los Angeles on the West Coast and a further highly automated logistics centre was put into operation in Robbinsville, New Jersey, on the East Coast in the first half of 2021. A new highly automated logistics centre is under construction in Ajax, Canada. The new logistics centre is scheduled for completion in late 2022/early 2023.\n\nYou can read more about our partnerships and our work in our Sustainability Disclosure.\n\nReusable, plastic-free packaging\n\nWe are striving to reduce packaging throughout our supply chain, focusing on reducing plastics. For 2025 one of our goals is to design 100 percent of our packaging to be reusable and/or recyclable. We have a new system of reusable bags made of FSC-certified paper and this will be continuously rolled out to all the brands online deliveries.\n\n1 Read about how we define fair wages at https://hmgroup.com/sustainability/fair-and-equal/wages/\nIntegrating sustainability\n\nSustainability is an integral part of our business and has been part of our business idea for many years. To be able to drive positive change throughout the value chain, it is important that everyone is pulling in the same direction. Each brand, retail market, production market and group function works to drive performance towards our sustainability goals.\n\nSustainable fashion for everyone ............... 33\nOur sustainability strategy ....................... 34\nKey sustainability goals .......................... 35\nCollaboration and innovation are key .......... 36\nSustainable fashion and design for everyone\n\nWe offer customers the best combination of fashion, quality and sustainability at affordable prices and thereby give them unbeatable value and the ability to access a more sustainable lifestyle.\n\nSustainability is business critical and creates business opportunities. We can only tackle the global climate crisis by working together with all stakeholders, including our customers, colleagues, suppliers, other business partners, shareholders and the communities we are a part of. As a responsible company our ambitious sustainability vision, strategy and goals are well integrated into our business and built on collaboration. The more we use our size and influence to make a positive impact, the more we can grow and create value in a sustainable way.\nOur sustainability strategy\n\nOur sustainability vision\nH&M Group wants to lead the change towards a circular and climate positive fashion industry while being a fair and equal company. This means, among other things, maintaining the diversity and inclusion needed to attract, retain and make the most of available talent and also to ensure respect for human rights across our value chain.\n\nWorking towards our sustainability vision is a way of further future-proofing our business. Continued investments in sustainability provide the group with long-term business opportunities in a rapidly changing world.\n\nOur ambition is to enable more people to choose a sustainable lifestyle and the group aims to create a positive correlation between profitable growth and a greater positive impact on customers, colleagues, business partners, their employees and other stakeholders while respecting planetary boundaries.\n\nH&M Group\u2019s sustainability strategy is based on our sustainability vision and contains three key ambitions:\n\nLeading the Change\n- Scale innovation\n- Promote transparency\n- Engage and partner for industrywide progress\n\nBecome a Circular and Climate Positive Business\n- Climate positive approach across our value chain, operating within planetary boundaries\n- Net positive impact on biodiversity\n- Circular ecosystem for our products, supply chains and customer journeys\n\nFair and Equal\n- Fair jobs for all\n- Inclusive and diverse workplaces and communities\n\n1) Our ambition to have a net positive impact on biodiversity is based on the definition of nature positive in the naturepositive.org paper: A Nature Positive World: The Global Goal for Nature.\nKey sustainability goals\n\nTo achieve this vision we have defined a wide range of further detailed strategies, policies and targets. Here are our key sustainability goals.\n\nAll these goals are very ambitious, and we are working hard to achieve them together with our suppliers and partners. We cannot solve this ourselves; the whole industry must contribute. Today there are many good ideas and innovations under development to solve complex environmental issues. However, more innovative ideas and initiatives are needed to achieve change.\n\nRead more about our goals, along with information about performance against these goals, strategic plans and actions for achieving the goals on pages 63\u201371 as well as in our Sustainability Disclosure.\n\nClimate\n\n2022: From January 1, 2022, we will not onboard any new suppliers or supplier factories into our supply chain if they have on-site coal boilers in their factories \u2014 as part of a longer term aim to phase out coal from our supply chain.\n\n2030: Reduce CO\u2082e emissions in scope 1, 2 and 3 in absolute figures by 56 percent (baseline 2019). Achievement 2021: 22 percent within scope 1 and 2 and 9 percent within scope 3.\n\n2030: Use 100 percent renewable electricity in own operations, raising the bar on our energy sourcing criteria. Achievement 2021: 95 percent\n\nMaterials and resources\n\n2025: Source 30 percent recycled materials. Achievement 2021: 17.9 percent\n\n2030: 100 percent of our materials to be either recycled or sourced in a more sustainable way. Achievement 2021: 80 percent\n\nPackaging\n\n2030: Make 100 percent of packaging from recycled or other more sustainably sourced materials, with a preference for post-consumer recycled materials. Achievement 2021: 68 percent\n\n1) Scope 1: All direct GHG emissions from our own operations.\n2) Scope 2: Indirect GHG emissions from consumption of purchased electricity, heat or steam used in our own operations.\n3) Scope 3: Other indirect emissions, such as the extraction and production of purchased materials and fuels, transport-related activities in vehicles not owned or controlled by the reporting entity, electricity-related activities e.g. T&D losses, not covered in scope 2, outsourced activities, and waste disposal. Includes emissions related to raw materials, fabric production, garment manufacturing, non-garment/ non-commercial goods, and customer electricity usage.\n\nOur scope 3 emissions data in 2021 we continued work to improve the accuracy of our scope 3 emissions data. This has led to some changes to our reported emissions compared to previous years. Read more about our updated scope 3 emissions data on page 66 in the statutory sustainability report.\n\n4) The customer use phase is not included in the scope 3 part of this goal.\nCollaboration and innovation are key\n\nIt is only possible for us to achieve our strategic goals by collaborating with our many stakeholders. Maintaining strong relationships with our stakeholders helps us identify innovative ways to create fashion for our customers, drive innovation, and develop more sustainable materials and new business models.\n\nCollaborating with others is also a way of meeting challenges faced by our industry and the planet. In order to solve complex issues like climate change or wages in the supply chain, for example, we collaborate with other businesses, leading experts, civil society, community representatives, NGOs, trade unions, policy makers and more. We welcome an open dialogue and collaboration with others within and outside our industry. Engaging with diverse perspectives challenges us to do better, accelerates innovation and supports our transparency efforts. Partnerships help us progress towards our sustainability ambitions faster than we could alone and have a positive impact beyond our own value chain.\n\n95 percent of electricity sourced for our own operations was renewable (90 percent in 2020). This is due to an increase in our purchase of Energy Attribute Certificates. To achieve our 100 percent goal we will continue to work towards a balanced portfolio of Energy Attribute Certificates, power purchase agreements on large-scale renewables projects, and rooftop solar photovoltaics.\nStatutory annual report\n\nCorporate governance report .................. 39\nAdministration report .......................... 54\n\u2014 Statutory sustainability report ............... 63\n\u2014 TCFD climate risk analysis .................. 72\n\nFinancial reports ............................... 75\n\u2014 Group income statement .................... 75\n\u2014 Consolidated statement of comprehensive income .................. 75\n\u2014 Group balance sheet ......................... 77\n\u2014 Group changes in equity .................... 79\n\u2014 Group cash flow statement ................. 80\n\n\u2014 Parent company income statement ........ 81\n\u2014 Parent company statement of comprehensive income ............... 81\n\u2014 Parent company balance sheet ............ 82\n\u2014 Parent company changes in equity ........ 83\n\u2014 Parent company cash flow statement ....... 84\n\n\u2014 Notes to the financial statements .......... 85\n\nSigning of the annual report .................. 105\nAuditor\u2019s report ............................... 106\nSound corporate governance ensures that companies are managed as sustainably, responsibly and efficiently as possible in the interests of the shareholders.

The code is available at corporategovernanceboard.se.\n\nThis report, which covers the financial year 1 December 2020 to 30 November 2021, hereafter referred to as the 2021 financial year, was prepared in accordance with the Code and the Swedish Annual Accounts Act by the company\u2019s board of directors. It has been reviewed by the company\u2019s auditors.\n\nExternal and internal governance\nH&M is governed by both external regulations and internal control documents.\n\nExamples of external regulations are:\n\u2014 The Swedish Companies Act\n\u2014 Accounting legislation including the Swedish Bookkeeping Act and Annual Accounts Act\n\u2014 MAR \u2014 the EU Market Abuse Regulation\n\u2014 Nasdaq Stockholm Rules for Issuers\n\u2014 The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\n\u2014 Swedish Corporate Governance Code (the Code)\n\nExamples of internal control documents:\n\u2014 Articles of association\n\u2014 The board\u2019s rule of procedure including instructions for the CEO and audit committee\n\u2014 Our Way (previously \u201cThe H&M Way\u201d)\n\u2014 Code of Ethics\n\u2014 Code of Conduct: Sustainability Commitment\n\u2014 Insider Policy\n\u2014 Financial Policy\n\u2014 Communications Policy\n\u2014 Human Rights Policy\n\u2014 Tax Policy\n\u2014 Whistleblowing Policy\n\nH&M\u2019s corporate governance is furthermore based on the company\u2019s seven values, which, in brief, encompass a sound, simple, straightforward, cost-conscious, entrepreneurial corporate culture that focuses on teamwork, belief in people and constant improvement. Sustainability is part of H&M\u2019s business idea and sustainability work is well integrated into all parts of the business. For more information read page 63.\nEthics, transparency and risk management\n\nAs a global company, it is of the utmost importance for H&M to always act ethically, transparently and responsibly in all parts of the business from collaborating with suppliers to meeting with customers. Through good purchasing routines and close cooperation with suppliers, the company\u2019s products should always be produced with the greatest possible consideration for people and the environment. H&M\u2019s risk management and internal control processes ensure purposeful work throughout the organisation. The board of directors and audit committee receive regular feedback from the organisation concerning how the internal control work is being conducted. H&M\u2019s risks are reviewed centrally on a quarterly basis with each brand and every central function. The quarterly meetings are conducted in order to ensure each listed risk has an action plan to minimise impact and is on an acceptable risk level. The risk management work also provides continuous input to the long-term commercial decisions.\n\nResponsibility for management and control is shared between the shareholders, the board, the audit committee and the CEO. The board\u2019s rule of procedure states how the work is to be distributed between the board, the board\u2019s audit committee and the CEO. The board is ultimately responsible for the company\u2019s organisation and administration and the CEO is responsible for ongoing management of the business, with regular feedback to the board.\n\nBoard members and 2021 meetings\n\nThe board of directors has eight members elected by the annual general meeting (AGM) \u2014 four women and four men. In accordance with Swedish law the board also has three employee representatives and three deputies for these. In total, the board has 14 members \u2014 eight women and six men.\n\nThe composition of the board exhibits breadth and diversity, with the board members\u2019 different areas of expertise complementing each other well. Their experience in areas such as retailing, entrepreneurship, fashion, digitalisation, AI, advanced analytics and automation, sustainability and communication forms a good basis for deep and nurturing discussions with the CEO and management.\n\nDuring 2021 the board held 8 board meetings, including a statutory meeting in conjunction with the AGM. All board members have been present at all meetings during 2021. The CEO, CFO and chief accountant also attend all the meetings. Generally, one or two departments or brands are invited to each meeting to give a status presentation concerning what their particular function or brand is working on. These presentations act as a complement to the CEO\u2019s status reports and provide opportunity for more in-depth discussions concerning specific areas of the operations. At each board meeting the chair of the audit committee also gives a summary of the matters addressed by the audit committee at its most recent meeting within areas such as accounting, audit, security, tax, internal control and risk, as well as various new regulations and legislation.\n\nFurther reading\n\nRead more about H&M\u2019s corporate governance at hmgroup.com/corporategovernance.

The information that must be provided under chapter 6 section 6 items 3\u20136 of the Annual Accounts Act is included in the annual and sustainability report on page 59 of the annual and sustainability report for 2021 of H&M Group and is therefore not included in this corporate governance report. In accordance with chapter 6 section 9 of the Annual Accounts Act, the company\u2019s auditors have issued a statement on the corporate governance report that can be found on page 53.\n\nDuring the financial year 2021 H&M did not deviate from the Code.\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE IN SWEDEN\n\nFor listed companies in Sweden it is important to be aware of the following aspects of corporate governance:\n\n\u2014 The nomination committee plays a key role and in contrast to the Anglo-American system, its members are appointed by a company\u2019s largest shareholders. It is the nomination committee\u2019s task to propose the size of the board of directors and who is to be elected to the board at the general meeting of shareholders. Board members are elected by all those who vote at the general meeting, but in practice it is difficult to present alternative proposals to the nomination committee\u2019s proposed board members while the general meeting is in progress. In practice, therefore, the nomination committee has a decisive influence over who is elected to the board. The nomination committee also provides the general meeting with a proposal for board fees and a proposed auditor. Principles for how members of the nomination committee are appointed are decided by the general meeting.\n\n\u2014 The law states that board members are appointed to represent the interests of all shareholders. Hence if a large shareholder group has proposed a new member via the nomination committee\u2019s proposed board members while the general meeting is in progress. In practice, therefore, the nomination committee has a decisive influence over who is elected to the board. The nomination committee also provides the general meeting with a proposal for board fees and a proposed auditor. Principles for how members of the nomination committee are appointed are decided by the general meeting.\n\n\u2014 The law states that board members are appointed to represent the interests of all shareholders. Hence if a large shareholder group has proposed a new member via the nomination committee, that board member represents the interests of all shareholders not only the interests of the shareholder(s) which nominated her/him.\n\n\u2014 For many decades Swedish enterprise in general has held a positive view of board members elected by its general meeting owning shares in the company. This is seen as a guarantee that the interests of the board are aligned with the interests of all shareholders in positive development of the share price and that there is consensus regarding the company\u2019s risks and opportunities.\n\n\u2014 Neither the Swedish Corporate Governance Code nor the Swedish Companies Act impose any restrictions on the age of board members, or how long members may sit on the board, or any time limit for when an independent board member ceases to be independent of the company or its principal owners.\n\n\u2014 It is tradition in Sweden for a company\u2019s chief auditor to attend the general meeting of shareholders. The auditors are deemed to be the general meeting\u2019s control body for the board. As a result, shareholders can pose questions to the auditors at a general meeting irrespective of the size of their shareholding.\n\n\u2014 The option of having different classes of shares, usually known as \u201cclass A\u201d and \u201cclass B\u201d shares, usually with differing voting rights, has been present in the Companies Act in Sweden for a long time and is widely used. It is common for class A shares to carry 10 times the number of votes but otherwise have the same nominal value and the same dividend rights as other shares.\n\n\u2014 By law the employees have the right to appoint employee representatives to the board. All are invited to the same meetings and receive the same information, and the employee-elected members have the same voting rights as members elected by the general meeting. Board fees are paid only to members elected by the general meeting.\n\nH&M\u2019s corporate governance structure\n\nH&M\u2019s corporate governance structure encompasses shareholders, the board of directors, the audit committee, the CEO, the nomination committee, the auditors, the executive management team, business areas organised by brand, employees and employee organisations. The illustration to the right summarises the company\u2019s corporate governance structure. H&M\u2019s shareholders ultimately decide the company\u2019s direction, since the shareholders at the general meeting appoint the board of directors and the chair of the board. Proposals for the composition of the board, board fees and the election of auditors are prepared in advance within the nomination committee. The board in turn appoints a CEO to take care of day-to-day administration. The CEO appoints members of the executive management team within H&M\u2019s matrix organisation. The board includes three employee representatives and three deputies for these, who are appointed by their respective employee organisations. The board appoints an audit committee from among its members, which deals with accounting and auditing matters on an ongoing basis and is the main channel of communication between the board and the auditors. Each year the auditors report to the board and to the annual general meeting on their scrutiny.\n1. SHAREHOLDERS AND ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING\n\nIt is the shareholders of H&M who have the final decision on the company\u2019s governance by voting at the general meeting to adopt the articles of association, which decide what the business will focus on, and to appoint the board of directors and its chair, whose task it is to administer the company\u2019s affairs on behalf of the shareholders. The shareholders at the general meeting also elect auditors, decide on the principles for the nomination committee and select the members of this committee.\n\nThe general meeting is thus the company\u2019s highest decision-making body and is the forum in which shareholders exercise their right to decide on the company\u2019s affairs. H&M\u2019s annual general meeting (AGM) is held once a year, in late April or early May.\n\nThe date and venue are announced in conjunction with H&M\u2019s nine-month report as well as at hmgroup.com. The notice of the meeting is published in full usually five weeks before the meeting as a press release and in the newspaper Post- och Inrikes Tidningar and at hmgroup.com. Publication of the notice is announced by an advertisement in both Swedish and English. Extraordinary general meetings can also be held when there is a particular need to do so.\n\nShareholders wishing to have a particular matter considered by the meeting may submit a written request to the board at least seven weeks before the meeting. H&M\u2019s email address is also given in the press release for the notice of the meeting, for shareholders who wish to submit their questions in advance. All the material belonging to the meeting, including the minutes of the meeting, is available on the website in both Swedish and English. Extraordinary general meetings can also be held when there is a particular need to do so.\n\nShareholders\u2019 decision-making powers\n\nAmong other things, the general meeting makes decisions concerning:\n\n- The election of board members and the chair of the board\n- Board fees including the compensation paid to members for work on the audit committee\n- Discharge of the members of the board and the CEO from liability\n- Amendments to the articles of association\n- The election of the auditor\n- The adoption of the income statement and balance sheet\n- The distribution of the earnings for the past financial year\n- The election of members of the nomination committee and establishment of principles for the nomination committee\n- Guidelines for remuneration to senior executives\n\nArticles of association\n\nAccording to the H&M articles of association, H&M\u2019s board of directors is to consist of at least three and no more than twelve members elected by the general meeting and no more than the same number of deputies. The annual general meeting decides the exact number of board members, and which individuals are to be elected to the board. Board members are elected for the period until the close of the next annual general meeting. The general meeting also decides on amendments to the articles of association.\n\nAnnual general meeting 2021\n\nH&M\u2019s annual general meeting (AGM) 2021 was held on 6 May as a digital meeting in view of the infection risk from Covid-19. Shareholders attended remotely and were allowed to choose between postal voting and voting digitally. A digital tool allowed those attending the meeting remotely to ask questions.\n\nThe company appeared on video from a venue at H&M\u2019s head office.

To register to attend the 2022 AGM, see the notice of the meeting at hmgroup.com/agm.\n\n2. NOMINATION COMMITTEE\nThe nomination committee prepares information that will be used as a basis for decisions at the general meeting concerning election of the board of directors, chair of the board, auditors and chair of the annual general meeting, fees to the board and auditors, as well as principles for the nomination committee. The nomination committee\u2019s proposal for the composition of the board exhibits diversity and breadth as regards expertise, experience, background and gender balance. It also takes into consideration the company\u2019s stage of development and future focus.\n\nBefore each annual general meeting the nomination committee\u2019s report is available to read as a separate document at hmgroup.com/corporategovernance. The composition of the nomination committee is based on the principles for the nomination committee adopted at the 2021 annual general meeting. The nomination committee below is based on the principle that the nomination committee is to consist of the chair of the board plus four others nominated by the four largest shareholders in terms of voting rights, as recorded in the register of shareholders. In autumn 2021 the nomination committee consisted of:\n\u2014 Karl-Johan Persson, chair of the board\n\u2014 Stefan Persson, Ramsbury Invest AB\n\u2014 Lottie Tham\n\u2014 Jan Andersson, Swedbank Robur fonder\n\u2014 Erik Durhan, Nordea fonder\n\nThe nomination committee meets the requirements of the Code regarding the independence of members. Stefan Persson chairs the nomination committee, in accordance with the principles of the nomination committee which state that the chair of the nomination committee shall be the member representing the largest shareholder unless the members of the nomination committee agree otherwise. The nomination committee unanimously decided that in view of H&M\u2019s ownership structure, Stefan Persson in his capacity as principal shareholder is the natural choice to chair H&M\u2019s nomination committee.\n\nWork of the nomination committee in preparation for the 2021 AGM including description of diversity policy for the board of directors\nBefore the 2021 annual general meeting the nomination committee held two meetings at which minutes were taken and was also in contact at other times. As a basis for its work to analyse the composition of the board ahead of the 2021 annual general meeting, the nomination committee studied the report by the chair of the board on the work of the board of directors and also met on one occasion with CEO Helena Helmersson. Its work has functioned well over the course of the year. The information from the chair of the board, along with interviews conducted with board members elected by the general meeting, provided a basis for the nomination committee\u2019s work on its proposal to the 2021 annual general meeting regarding the composition of the board. The members\u2019 competencies complement each other well, forming a good whole. In view of this, as well as the fact that 2020 and the start of 2021 were challenging and unusual because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the nomination committee decided not to propose any changes to the composition of the board.\n\nThe nomination committee\u2019s proposal to the 2021 annual general meeting was therefore the re-election of all the current board members: Stina Bergfors, Anders Dahlvig, Danica Kragic Jensfelt, Lena Patriksson Keller, Karl-Johan Persson, Christian Sievert, Erica Wiking H\u00e4ger and Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m; and the re-election of Karl-Johan Persson as chair of the board.\n\nThe nomination committee judged that the proposed board complied well with section 4.1 of the Code, which the nomination committee applies as its diversity policy. The policy aims to ensure that the proposed board exhibits diversity and breadth of qualifications, experience and\nbackground, as well as gender balance, and H&M\u2019s board has had a good gender balance for many years. The board members proposed, and subsequently elected by the meeting, consisted of four women and four men. The board thus achieves the long-term ambition communicated by the Swedish Corporate Governance Board, which wants owners to speed up developments towards a share of around 40 percent for the less well represented gender on the boards of major listed companies.\n\nThe proposed board was considered to more than satisfy the requirements made of expertise and experience, taking into account the company\u2019s operations and future development. The proposal was also considered to meet the applicable requirements well as regards the independence of board members, their stock market experience and their expertise in accounting and auditing.\n\nIn its proposal to the AGM the nomination committee carefully reviews each board member\u2019s expertise, experience, contribution to the work of the board over the past year, potential conflicts of interest etc. To decide whether a member is independent, an overall assessment is to be made of all circumstances that might cause the member\u2019s independence of the company and its management to be questioned. In rule 4.4 the Code states that at least seven different circumstances that are to be considered here. At least two of the board members who are independent of the company and its management must also be independent of the company\u2019s major shareholders. The chair of H&M\u2019s audit committee, like all the other members of the committee, is independent of the company and its management. Two of the three members are also independent of the company\u2019s major shareholders. There is nothing in the Code stating that the chair of the committee must be independent of major shareholders.\n\nAs a basis for its proposal on a new accounting firm the nomination committee received a report from the chair of the audit committee, Christian Sievert, explaining how the selection process for a new accounting firm took place and setting out the board\u2019s recommendation, which was to propose Deloitte AB (Deloitte).\n\nWork of the nomination committee in preparation for the 2022 AGM\n\nBetween the 2021 AGM and the end of the financial year the nomination committee held one meeting at which minutes were taken and was also in contact at other times. In autumn 2021 the nomination committee began its work, starting with information from the chair of the board concerning how well the work of the board has functioned. During the autumn the nomination committee conducted interviews with the board members elected by the general meeting. It was established that the board and its work is functioning well. In the period up until the proposals to the 2022 AGM are presented the nomination committee will discuss the size and composition of the board based on such factors as expertise, experience and the outlook for the company, the election of a chair of the board and of a chair for the general meeting, fees for board members, instructions for the nomination committee and the election of auditors. The nomination committee\u2019s work in preparation for the AGM in May 2022 is not yet complete; more information will be presented before and at the 2022 AGM.\n\n3. AUDITORS\n\nThe auditors, who are independent and appointed by the shareholders at the AGM, scrutinise H&M\u2019s annual and sustainability report, consolidated financial statements, accounts, and corporate governance report, and examine whether these have been prepared in accordance with current laws and recommendations. The auditors also scrutinise the management of H&M by the board and CEO, and review compliance with the guidelines on remuneration to senior executives adopted by the AGM.\n\nAt the 2021 AGM the accounting firm Deloitte AB (Deloitte) was elected as auditor of H&M for a one-year period of office, i.e. until the close of the 2022 AGM. Authorised public accountant Didrik Roos from Deloitte holds the main responsibility for the audit.\n\nAs previously, the 2021 AGM resolved that the auditors\u2019 fees should be paid based on invoices submitted and approved. The fees invoiced by the auditors over the past two financial years are reported in note 10 of the annual and sustainability report for 2021.\n\nDeloitte is a member of a global network used for auditing assignments for most of the group\u2019s companies and meets H&M\u2019s requirements with respect to competence and geographical coverage. The auditors\u2019 independent status is guaranteed partly by legislation and professional ethics rules, partly by the accounting firm\u2019s internal guidelines and partly by the fact that non-auditing assignments must be approved in advance by the audit committee. Didrik Roos conducts auditing assignments for Tele2 AB and Boozt AB, among others.\n\nThe auditors attend all meetings of the audit committee. During the audit committee meeting in January the auditor Andreas Troberg from Ernst & Young AB (E&Y) who was the auditor for the 2019/2020 financial year attended, as well as the auditor Didrik Roos from Deloitte, in order to facilitate the transition between auditing firms. The board meeting held in January 2021 was also attended by Andreas Troberg from E&Y in order to notify the board of the scope, focus, significant considerations and conclusions of the 2019/2020 audit.\n\nIn addition to this involvement, the auditor meets regularly with the chair of the board, the audit committee\u2019s chair and other members, the executive management and other key individuals. The auditor also takes part in the AGM, reporting the conclusions drawn from the audit.\n\nAlongside its mandate as elected auditor, Deloitte has also carried out related tasks such as verification of the Sustainability Disclosure. In addition, Deloitte has assisted with other consulting\nservices, primarily tax advice. Deloitte has internal processes to ensure its independence before these tasks are begun. The audit committee also has a process for approving non-auditing services in advance, before such assignments are begun. The audit committee evaluates the auditor annually to gain assurance that the auditor\u2019s objectivity and independence cannot be questioned.\n\n4. BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\nThe task of the board of directors is to manage H&M\u2019s affairs in the interests of the company and all its shareholders, and to safeguard and encourage a good corporate culture. This means that the board has the overall responsibility for the company\u2019s administration, taking a long-term, sustainable approach with a focus on the customer offering and growth.\n\nIn addition to laws and recommendations, the work of the board is regulated by the board\u2019s order of procedure which contains rules on the distribution of work between the board, its committees and the CEO as well as on financial reporting, investments and financing. The order of procedure, which also includes the procedure for the audit committee, is updated as needed but is established at least once a year.\n\nComposition of H&M\u2019s board and independence of its members\n\nThe board members are elected by the shareholders at the annual general meeting for the period up to and including the next AGM. Since the 2021 AGM the board has consisted of eight ordinary members, with no deputies, as well as three employee representatives and three deputies for these positions.

This means that the fees related to the period until the next AGM, i.e. for the period 7 May 2020 to 6 May 2021. The amounts were paid out after the 2021 AGM.\n4 Attendance via technology is equated with attendance in person.\n5 There are no outstanding share- or share price-related incentive programmes for the board of directors.\n6 Ramsbury Invest AB owns 194,400,000 class A shares and 604,856,427 class B shares as at 30 November 2021.\n7 8,000 shares held through Stina Bergfors\u2019s company SCEBE Holding AB and 6,000 shares held by spouse.\n8 1,200 shares owned through Lena Patriksson Keller\u2019s private company Verdana Holding AB. 9,450 shares held by spouse and children.\n9 Christian Sievert is not considered independent of Ramsbury Invest AB since Ramsbury Invest AB is a major shareholder in a company of which Christian Sievert is CEO.\n10 Shares held by related parties: 19,000 shares held through Christian Sievert\u2019s company Whitesirs Industri AB and 2,400 shares held by spouse and children.\n11 750 shares owned through Erica Wiking H\u00e4ger\u2019s company Erica Wiking H\u00e4ger Advokatbolag.\n12 Before the AGM on May 6 2021 Tim Gahnstr\u00f6m was appointed employee representative for Akademikerna.\n13 Before the AGM on May 6 2021 Margareta Welinder replaced Alexandra Rosenqvist as employee representative for Unionen.\nrepresentatives and their deputies are employed by the company. Since the 2021 AGM the board has consisted of the following members elected by the general meeting: Karl-Johan Persson (chair), Stina Bergfors, Anders Dahlvig, Danica Kragic Jensfelt, Lena Patriksson Keller, Christian Sievert, Erica Wiking H\u00e4ger and Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m. Tim Gahnstr\u00f6m, Ingrid Godin and Margareta Welinder are the regular employee representatives, with Hampus Glanzelius, Helena Isberg and Louise Wikholm as their deputies. For more facts about H&M\u2019s board members see pages 51\u201352.\n\nThe members are required to devote the time and attention that their position on the board demands. New board members receive introductory training that includes meetings with the heads of the various brands and functions.\n\nThe composition of the board during the year met the independence requirements set out in sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the Code. This means that the majority of the board members elected by the general meeting are independent of the company and its management. The majority of the board members are also independent of the company\u2019s major shareholders.\n\nNumber of board meetings\n\nDuring the financial year H&M normally holds six regular board meetings, one of which is the statutory board meeting. Extraordinary board meetings are held when the need arises. The CEO attends all meetings, except on the occasion of the board meeting when the CEO\u2019s terms of employment are being discussed. The CEO reports to the board on the operational work within the group and ensures that ahead of each board meeting the board is given relevant and objective information on which to base its decisions.\n\nThe CFO and chief accountant also attend the board meetings in order to provide financial information. The board is assisted by a secretary who is not a member of the board.\n\nDuring the year eight board meetings were held. This is more than usual, but at the same time perfectly natural since the Covid-19 pandemic made its mark on a significant portion of 2021, giving rise to more board meetings than in a normal year. As in previous years, attendance levels at the board meetings were very high. For details of meeting attendance by each member see the table on page 45.\n\nWork of the board in 2021\n\nH&M\u2019s board meetings are generally structured as shown below. This is supplemented by one or more business presentations, e.g. by the heads of functions, brands or regions.\n\nThe following are usually reviewed at each board meeting:\n\n\u2014 Minutes of the previous meeting\n\u2014 CEO\u2019s status report and report by CFO\n\u2014 Strategic matters\n\u2014 Feedback from latest audit committee meeting\n\u2014 Financial reporting, such as interim report, full-year report and annual report\n\u2014 Any other business\n\nThe Board of Directors has also met with the auditors of the company without the attendance of the CEO or any other representatives from the company\u2019s management.\n\nAs in 2020, the external factors that had the greatest impact on 2021 were the Covid-19 pandemic and the consequences of climate change as well as the increasing digitalisation of society. During this very unusual time, flexibility, being responsive, rapid decision-making and working closely with our suppliers were important parameters for the company\u2019s recovery. This applied in all parts of the business and particularly within the supply chain, which was affected by various challenges. As always, the customer offering came into focus at the board meetings and during the year there was a review of follow-up and results for the various areas of the business plan and its goals. This included each brand, the store portfolio, continued combination and integration of the store and online sales channels, and the supply chain, with tech and sustainability aspects being considered in all areas. The sustainability work and tech are discussed often within the board since they form an essential foundation for achieving the company\u2019s ambitious targets.\n\nOther examples of subjects discussed during the year were cybersecurity, geopolitical challenges, future ways of working etc.\n\nExamples of the brands/functions of the business that presented their work to the board during the year were: H&M brand, portfolio brands, business ventures, sustainability, business tech, customer insight, supply chain and expansion/store portfolio.\n\nAt each board meeting the chair of the audit committee reports to the board on what the audit committee discussed at its latest meeting. This primarily concerns areas such as accounting, IFRS 16 effects, auditing, tax, customs duties, internal control, risk and various new regulations, legislation and directives. All significant risks are then discussed at the subsequent board meeting. At four of the year\u2019s meetings the board goes through quarterly reports before they are published and at the January meeting the board discusses the annual and sustainability report, with the auditor also reporting on the year\u2019s audit.\n\nAs every year, also in 2021 the board took various decisions such as: issuing a sustainability-linked bond for EUR 500 million in order to contribute to our goal to become net zero; proposals for remuneration guidelines of senior executives that were presented for resolution at the 2021 AGM; the remuneration report that was also presented to the 2021 AGM; a proposed dividend of SEK 6.50 per share and convening an extraordinary general meeting on 28 October 2021 for a resolution on the dividend proposal; decisions concerning the financial statements; an updated finance policy; as well as decisions on the investment plan, growth plan and targets.\n\nAt the board meeting held in January 2021 the board of directors decided that the company\u2019s growth target to increase sales in local currencies by 10\u201315 percent per year with continued high profitability remains a long-term target.\n\nSince H&M does not have a separate review function (internal audit function) for work on internal control, but has instead established its own model for managing the company\u2019s risk and internal control (see pages 49\u201350), once a year the board assesses the need for a separate internal audit function. In 2021 the board again reached\nthe conclusion that the present model for monitoring internal control is satisfactory.\n\nAhead of the AGM the board presented a remuneration report for 2020 in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act and the Remuneration Rules issued by the Swedish Corporate Governance Board. The remuneration report describes how the guidelines for remuneration in H&M adopted at the 2020 AGM were applied in the 2020 financial year. The remuneration report for 2020 can be found on hmgroup.com/annual-general-meeting-2021.\n\nH&M has no remuneration committee since the board of directors deems it more appropriate for the entire board to carry out the tasks of a remuneration committee, as is entirely in accordance with requirement 9.2 of the Code. It is the board that prepares the proposed guidelines for remuneration to senior executives that are presented at the AGM\u2019s, and it is the board that decides on the CEO\u2019s salary in accordance with the guidelines most recently adopted at the general meeting. The board continually assesses the CEO\u2019s work and once a year discusses this matter separately in conjunction with the setting of the CEO\u2019s remuneration for the coming year. No member of executive management is present when this is discussed.\n\nThe board continually evaluates its work, and the chair of the board is in regular contact with the board members between meetings as part of the board\u2019s work and its evaluation process. Among other things this evaluation covers working methods, the working climate, wishes and the main focus of the board\u2019s work. It also focuses on access to and the need for specialist expertise within the board. The evaluation is used as a tool for developing how the board works and also forms a basis for the work of the nomination committee.\n\n5. AUDIT COMMITTEE\nThe audit committee monitors the company\u2019s financial reporting, which among other things involves monitoring the effectiveness of the company\u2019s internal control and risk management. Its work includes handling auditing topics and financial reports published by the company. The auditors attend the meetings of the audit committee to report on their scrutiny of H&M\u2019s annual report and financial statements, including the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe audit committee also reviews and monitors the impartiality and independence of the auditor, and regulates which assignments the accounting firm may conduct for H&M in addition to the audit. The audit committee annually receives a written assurance of independence from the auditor stating which services the accounting firm has provided to H&M during the financial year in addition to the audit. The audit committee also assists the nomination committee with any proposals to the AGM concerning the election of auditors.\n\nThe audit committee is made up of three board members, two of whom have expertise in accounting or auditing while the third has expertise in commercial law. All the members are independent of the company and its management. The majority of the members are also independent of the company\u2019s major shareholders. The audit committee is appointed annually by the board of directors at the statutory board meeting held in conjunction with the AGM. Since the statutory meeting held in conjunction with the 2021 AGM, the audit committee has consisted of chair Christian Sievert and members Anders Dahlvig and Erica Wiking-H\u00e4ger. The committee held four meetings at which minutes were taken during the 2021 financial year.\n\nIn addition the committee participated in meetings with the organisation and potential auditors in the selection process for a new auditing firm from the 2021 financial year.\n\nEY and Deloitte attended the minuted audit committee meetings to provide debriefs on the auditing work. The meetings were also attended by, among others, the CFO, the chief accountant and the head of corporate governance. The committee\u2019s meetings are minuted and the minutes are then distributed to all board members.\n\nDuring the year the audit committee addressed the following matters, among others:\n\u2014 The company\u2019s financial reporting, including interim reports, the corporate governance report and annual report.\n\u2014 Compliance with the group\u2019s internal control and risk management processes and review of the overall risk analysis for the group \u2014 both financial risk and operational risk \u2014 with well-defined action plans to minimise risk.\n\u2014 In addition, the following functions/departments provided information on their work: Security, Expansion/Construction, Accounting/Tax, Logistics, Business Tech and Data Privacy.\n\u2014 The transfer pricing model, tax matters and matters relating to customs. A status update regarding tax matters is given at each meeting, which is partly related to the OECD\u2019s BEPS project that deals with, among other things, how and where profits in multinational companies are to be taxed.\n\u2014 Follow-up of the new IFRS rules was also reviewed in respect of IFRS 16 Leases.\n\u2014 Follow-up of the procurement process for new accounting firm.\n\u2014 Follow-up in the area of privacy (including GDPR).\n\u2014 Follow-up of human rights policy.\n\u2014 Deloitte informed the committee of the audit plan, the scope of the audit and the results of scrutiny carried out.\n\u2014 Review of the auditors\u2019 independence and impartiality. The audit committee finds that it is clear which assignments Deloitte takes on in addition to auditing and sees no reason to question the accounting firm\u2019s impartiality.\n\nA process has been established for non-auditing services to be approved in advance. H&M also uses consulting services from other accounting firms and tax advisors.\n\n6. EMPLOYEE ORGANISATIONS\nUnder Swedish law, the employees have the right to appoint employee representatives with deputies to the company\u2019s board. These are appointed via employee organisations (trade unions). The trade unions appoint three board members and three deputies to the board of H&M.\n\n7. CEO\nThe CEO is appointed by the board of directors and is responsible for the daily management of the company as directed by the board. This means that, among other things, the CEO must focus in particular on recruitment of senior executives,\nbuying and logistics matters, the customer offering, pricing strategy, sales and profitability, sustainability matters, marketing, expansion, development and further integration of the store and online channels, and digital development. The CEO reports to the board on H&M\u2019s development and makes the necessary preparations for taking decisions on investments, expansion etc. The role of CEO includes contact with the financial market, the media and the authorities.\n\nHelena Helmersson, born in 1973, has been CEO since 30 January 2020. In 1997 Helena Helmersson joined H&M as a controller in the buying department, after which she worked in various roles in buying and production. Helena Helmersson was head of sustainability for five years and subsequently head of production based in Hong Kong. For just over a year prior to becoming CEO she worked as COO (chief operating officer) with responsibility for expansion, logistics, production, IT and Advanced Data Analytics/AI, as well as Insights and Analytics.\n\nBy the end of the financial year 2021 Helena Helmersson held 6,570 shares in H&M. She also held 300,000 call options issued by Ramsbury Invest AB, each option providing the right to buy one class B share in H&M during the 12 months following a three-year period from the agreement date of 7 October 2020.\n\n8. 9. ORGANISATION AND MANAGEMENT\nH&M has a multi-brand matrix organisation with the following brands: the H&M brand which includes the H&M HOME brand and the portfolio brands consisting of the brands COS, Weekday, Monki, & Other Stories and ARKET. The group brands also includes the brands under our Business Ventures, which includes among others Afound, Treadler, Singular Society, Creator Studio and majority owned Sellpy. Each brand has its own organisation and managing director, and all the well-established brands have their own local or regional sales organisations. Centrally, there are also a number of group functions that support each brand in order to capitalise on the benefits within these shared areas, so that each brand and country works purposefully according to central policies and guidelines. The CEO is responsible for day-to-day management of H&M and appoints the members of the executive management team. In addition to the CEO, as of 30 November 2021 the executive management comprised 14 individuals, six of whom are women. In addition to the CEO, the executive management team consists of the CFO, the two people with responsibility for the H&M brand, the person with responsibility for Portfolio Brands, the person with responsibility for Business Ventures, the person with responsibility for Business Tech, the CTO and the heads of the following group functions: Expansion, Strategy & Transformation, Human Resources, Sustainability, Supply Chain, Communications and The Laboratory. Those responsible for other group functions are appointed by the CFO.\n\nThe matrix organisation provides a good combination of central and local perspectives on leadership and entrepreneurship.\n\nThe regional and local sales organisations are responsible for daily retail operations in their region and country, giving them a collective responsibility for all the regional and local support functions whose work is based on instructions from the central group functions.\nInternal control\n\nThe board of directors is responsible for the company\u2019s internal control, the overall aim of which is to safeguard the company\u2019s assets and thereby its shareholders\u2019 investment. Internal control and risk management are part of the board\u2019s and the management\u2019s control and follow-up responsibilities, the purpose of which is to ensure that the business is managed in the most appropriate and effective manner possible, to ensure reliable financial reporting and to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. This description of H&M\u2019s internal control and risk management for financial reporting has been prepared in accordance with chapter 6 section 6 of the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and section 7.4 of the Code.\n\nH&M uses the COSO framework as a basis for internal control over financial reporting. The COSO framework, which is issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, is made up of the following five components: control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring.\n\nCONTROL ENVIRONMENT\n\nThe control environment forms the basis of internal control, because it includes the culture that the board and management communicate and by which they work. The control environment is made up primarily of ethical values and integrity, expertise, management philosophy, organisational structure, responsibility and authority, policies and guidelines, as well as routines.\n\nOf particular importance is that management documents such as internal policies, guidelines and manuals exist in significant areas and that these provide the employees with solid guidance. The Code of Ethics, signed by all employees doing business with suppliers, is an ethical policy that permeates the entire company, since it describes the way in which the employees should act within the company and in business relations with suppliers. The document \u201cOur way\u201d has existed for a number of years (previously named \u201cThe H&M Way\u201d). The document summarises how values, policies and guidelines come together to ensure the business is carried out in an ethical, responsible, sustainable, and transparent way. \u201cOur way\u201d is intended for all colleagues within all brands and functions of H&M, as well as external stakeholders. Read more about \u201cOur Way\u201d on hmgroup.com/about-us/our-way/.\n\nH&M\u2019s internal control structure is based on:\n\n\u2014 The division of accountability between the board of directors, the audit committee and the CEO, which is clearly described in the board\u2019s formal rules of procedure. The executive management team and the audit committee report regularly to the board according to established routines.\n\u2014 The company\u2019s organisational structure,\n\u2014 Values and guidelines, as well as policies and manuals,\n\u2014 Control activities, checks and balances, analysis, reporting.\n\nH&M has a matrix organisation (see page 48), which means that those responsible for the joint group functions are responsible for the efficiency of work within their function at each brand. Each brand has its own organisation and managing director, and all the brands have their own local or regional sales organisations.\n\nInternal control is evaluated annually by the relevant group function, which checks that its function in each country is working according to the prescribed policies and guidelines. The stores are in turn checked by internal store auditors.\n\nAll subsidiaries within H&M have the same structure and accounting system with the same chart of accounts. This simplifies the creation of appropriate routines and control systems, which in turn facilitates internal control and comparisons between the various companies. There are detailed instructions for the store staff that control daily work in the stores. Many other guidelines and manuals are also available within the group. In most cases these are drawn up in the central departments at the head office in Stockholm and then communicated to the respective departments in the country offices. Each central department regularly reviews its guidelines and manuals to see which need updating and whether new guidelines need to be developed.\n\nRISK ASSESSMENT\n\nOperational and financial risks are continuously analysed by all brands and group functions. This risk review and assessment identify the systems, methods and controls that are in place to minimise any impact of the risks. The suggested risk acceptance or mitigation is evaluated quarterly in collaboration with the corporate governance function for the most significant risks.\n\nAn updated climate risk analysis according to the guidelines issued by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) was carried out during 2021, see page 72. The first TCFD analysis was conducted in 2019.\n\nAt the end of 2021 the group\u2019s main risks were summarised to the audit committee and was subsequently discussed by the board.\n\nFor a description of H&M\u2019s operational risks, see the administration report on pages 56\u201358. For risks within financial reporting, see also the administration report on pages 58\u201359 and note 2. Financial risks, on pages 86\u201387 of the annual and sustainability report for 2021.\n\nCONTROL ACTIVITIES\n\nThere are a number of control activities built into every process to ensure that the business is efficient and that financial reporting provides a true picture. The control activities, which aim to prevent, find and correct inaccuracies and non-compliance, are at all levels and in all parts\nof the organisation. Within H&M the control activities include effective control and analysis of sales statistics, account reconciliation, monthly accounts and financial reports.\n\nInternal control measures in the Business Tech function also includes internal control on systems relating to financial reporting. These financial systems are also reviewed by an external party in cooperation with H&M.\n\nINFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION\nPolicies and guidelines are of particular importance for accurate accounting, reporting and provision of information, and also define the control activities to be carried out.\n\nH&M has a communications policy providing guidelines for communication with external parties. The purpose of the policy is to ensure that all disclosure obligations are met and that the information provided is accurate and complete. Financial communication is provided via:\n\u2014 Annual and sustainability report\n\u2014 Interim reports, the full-year report and quarterly sales reports\n\u2014 Press releases on events and circumstances that may impact the share price\n\u2014 H&M\u2019s website hmgroup.com\n\nMONITORING\nIn 2021 the central functions assessed internal control within their respective functions in the sales countries based partly on general issues and partly on department-specific issues, using the COSO model. Still during 2021 as during 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic had an impact on internal control: all functions that usually travel to countries to carry out internal control undertook control activities remotely instead.\n\nThe work resulted in a plan of action for each central function working on internal control, defining the areas that ought to be improved in order to further strengthen internal control \u2014 not only in respect of each country, but also for the central function. The central functions also followed up on the assessments made in the previous year. The way in which H&M assesses internal control is considered to be firmly established within the organisation. It is an aid and an instrument that the central functions can use to ensure that their respective departments in the sales countries and regions are working in line with company guidelines. The assessment of internal control also allows each sales country and region to provide valuable and constructive feedback to the central function regarding where there is room for improvement. An important part of the internal control work is the feedback to the regional and country management, which the central function provides.\n\nAdditionally, within the production organisation additional control and monitoring activities are brought together in the internal Routine Handbook for Production. These routines are related to how H&M ensures that the company does business in an ethical and transparent way. Most of these are monitored on a monthly basis at regional level and every other month at global level.\n\nInternal store auditors perform annual checks at the stores aimed at determining the strengths and weaknesses of the stores and how any shortcomings can be corrected.\n\nThe board of directors and the audit committee continuously evaluate the information provided by the executive management team, including information on internal control. The audit committee\u2019s task of monitoring the efficiency of internal control by the management team is of particular interest to the board. This work includes checking that steps are taken with respect to any shortcomings detected and suggestions made during the assessment by the central departments and internal store auditors, as well as by external auditors. The work on internal control maintains awareness of the importance of effective internal control within the group and ensures that continuous improvement is made.\n\nINTERNAL AUDIT\nIn accordance with section 7.4 of the Code, during the year the board assessed the need for a specific internal audit process. The board concluded that H&M\u2019s present model of monitoring internal control is the most appropriate for the company. In the board\u2019s opinion this model, which the central departments such as Accounting, Expansion/Construction, Business Tech, Communications, Security and Supply Chain (including Logistics and Production) apply in the subsidiaries, as well as the work carried out in stores by internal process responsible from the local security departments, are well in line with the work performed in other companies by an internal audit department. It was therefore deemed that there was no need for an internal audit department.\n\nThe issue of a specific internal audit department will be reviewed again in 2022.\n\nStockholm, March 2022\n\nThe Board of Directors\n\nMore information on H&M\u2019s corporate governance work can be found in the section on corporate governance at hmgroup.com/corporate-governance.

Any references made to \u201cH&M\u201d, \u201cH&M Group\u201d and \u201cthe company\u201d in this administration report refers hereinafter to H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ).\n\nBUSINESS\n\nThe H&M group is a customer-focused, creative, value-driven, responsible fashion and design company. All the group\u2019s brands share a passion for fashion and quality at the best price in a sustainable way. The business consists mainly of sales of clothing, accessories, footwear, cosmetics, home textiles and homeware to consumers. Sales take place through digital and physical channels, i.e. online and in retail stores. The sales channels are well integrated to provide a consistent, seamless and inspiring customer experience when, where and how customers choose. In certain markets products are sold via franchise partners.\n\nApart from the group\u2019s main brand H&M which includes H&M HOME, the group also includes the portfolio brands COS, Weekday, Monki, & Other Stories and ARKET. In addition to this the company also has a division named business ventures with a number of initiatives. The group\u2019s business ventures mission is to build scalable businesses based on new business models and partnerships, engage with customers in new ways and create added customer value. This way the ventures will drive new revenue streams, and are an important part of delivering sustainable growth for the H&M group. Examples of business ventures are Afound, Treadler, Singular Society, Creator Studio and majority-owned Sellpy.\n\nEach of the group\u2019s brands has its own unique identity. Together they offer a variety of trends and styles at various price points within fashion, beauty, accessories and homeware.\n\nThe H&M group\u2019s aim is to make fashion and design accessible to everyone in a way that is good for people, the planet and the business. The brands offer various products and services based on circular business models and in the collections the percentage of recycled and other more sustainably sourced materials is increasing.\n\nEach brand has its own design and buying function. Teams consist of people from differing backgrounds and with diverse experiences and skills work together to produce relevant and inspiring collections for their particular customer group. H&M\u2019s design and buying function creates its collections centrally in Stockholm, while COS \u2014 for example \u2014 has its design and buying function in London. Afound departs from this model since it is a marketplace for products from brands\u2019 previous seasons, both external brands and the H&M group\u2019s own, which are discounted to provide a new opportunity to attract customers. Treadler in turn offers services that provide external companies with access to the H&M group\u2019s supply chain, while majority-owned Sellpy is an e-commerce platform for second-hand sales with a business model that makes it easy for customers to buy and sell used items. On top of that, the group\u2019s investment arm CO:LAB invests in start-ups that develop technical innovations that can lead the industry towards a more circular and sustainable future which also includes reaching the group\u2019s sustainability goals. For more information see pages 15\u201336.\n\nEarnings and financial position \u2014 another year marked by the Covid-19 pandemic\n\nDevelopment in 2021 was like the previous year impacted by the negative effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result of the H&M group\u2019s transformation work and many years of investments, the company proved to be well equipped to handle the great challenges that the Covid-19 situation brought and showed great resilience to what can only be described as an unprecedented challenge for the industry. The H&M group acted with the safety of employees and customers as its top priority.\n\nA range of strong measures were implemented to mitigate the severe adverse effects of the\npandemic. These encompassed all parts of the business, including product purchasing, investments, rents, staffing and financing, as well as the receipt of government support. Since the footfall to stores has been negatively impacted by the pandemic, increased focus has been put on the digital sales channels and thus the customer offering remained available to customers. Demand for the group\u2019s collections was high and the rapid online growth partly compensated for the drop in store sales.\n\nAfter a small loss in the beginning of the year due to the pandemic, the company returned to profit in the second quarter of 2021. The gradual recovery continued in the third and fourth quarter. The improvement in earnings was driven by increased full-price sales and by cost reductions, and was also underpinned by the company\u2019s earlier investments for greater flexibility in product flow.\n\nThe H&M group\u2019s online sales increased by 30 percent in local currencies during the year and financial position are given in connection with the income statement and balance sheet on pages 75\u201378.\n\nThe H&M group\u2019s online sales increased by 30 percent in local currencies during the year and accounted for 32 percent of total sales. The H&M group\u2019s net sales and profit after financial items amounted to SEK 198,967 m/187,031 and SEK 14,300 m/2,052 respectively for the financial year. Further comments on the group\u2019s profit for the year and financial position are given in connection with the income statement and balance sheet on pages 75\u201378.\n\nDirection\nIn parallel with managing the Covid-19 situation the company continued to work according to its business plan, which aims to deliver long-term sustainable and profitable growth. The business plan is based on the company\u2019s ongoing transformation work and is illustrated by a number of objectives to which the company\u2019s sustainability work and digital transformation contribute. These objectives are to continue improving the customer offering for all the brands, to build long-term and value-creating customer relationships, to offer an inspiring experience with integrated digital and physical channels, to adapt the supply chain so that it is faster and more flexible based on demand, and to add more revenue streams based on new emerging business models and innovations. Moving successfully towards these objectives is expected to result in long-term and profitable growth while at the same time reducing the company\u2019s climate impact. Together with sound and sustainable finances, in line with the H&M group\u2019s goal of a strong capital structure with good liquidity and financial flexibility, allows continued freedom of action for growth and investments. By 2030 at latest the H&M group is to double sales while at the same time halving its carbon footprint. Profitability is to exceed 10 percent over time.1\n\nGrowth and expansion through integrated channels\nThe H&M group continues to expand with a focus on increased omni-channel sales. The majority of the customers around the world can now shop at H&M in both physical and digital stores. In 2021 H&M opened in Panama via franchise. The roll-out of H&M online continued during the year to Chile and to Qatar via franchise. H&M was also launched on the e-commerce platform Zalora in Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore. Monki was also launched on Zalora in the Philippines. & Other Stories was launched on The Yes and on Nordstrom online in the US. In addition, Weekday was launched on Thread in the UK and AboutYou in 23 markets in Europe, and ARKET at The Hyundai Korea. COS opened its first stores in Estonia, the Philippines and Greece. & Other Stories opened its first store in Mainland of China, and also via franchise in Israel. In addition, ARKET opened the doors of its first stores in South Korea and Mainland of China. The second-hand platform Sellpy was launched in an additional 22 markets and is now available in a total of 24 markets in Europe.\n\nIn the 2021 financial year the H&M group opened 104 (129) stores and closed 321 (187) stores, making a net decrease of 217 (58) stores. The group had a total of 4,801 (5,018) stores as of 30 November 2021, of which 273 (269) were operated by franchise partners. The breakdown of the stores is as follows: 4,242 H&M, 275 COS, 98 Monki, 78 & Other Stories, 57 Weekday, 24 ARKET.\n\nIn 2021 the H&M group renegotiated a large number of leases as part of the company\u2019s intensified store optimisation, which also involves rebuilds and adjustment of the number of stores and of store space to ensure the best store portfolio in each market. The H&M group\u2019s contracts allow around a third of leases to be renegotiated or exited each year.\n\nIn December 2021 ARKET opened its first store in Russia, & Other Stories launched on Yoox.com and COS launched online in Saudi Arabia via franchise. For 2022 the plan is to open around 120 new stores and close around 240 stores, making a net decrease of around 120 stores. Most of the openings will be in growth markets, while the closures will mainly be in established markets. H&M will launch in six new markets in 2022: the first stores will open in Ecuador, Kosovo and North Macedonia, and via franchise in Costa Rica, Guatemala and Cambodia. & Other Stories will launch in Singapore and ARKET will open its first store in France in the second half of 2022. The roll-out of H&M online continues in 2022. Planned markets are Colombia and Peru, among others. In 2022 COS will launch online in Australia, and via Zalora in the Philippines. Monki will be launched on AboutYou, and on Zalora in Singapore and Malaysia.\n\nEmployees\nThe H&M group\u2019s business is characterised by a fundamental respect for the individual. All employees are treated equally with respect and dignity, and they are empowered to be who they want to be. The group offers decent, meaningful jobs with fair compensation and benefits in healthy, safe, fair, and inclusive workplaces free from discrimination, where everyone has the right to freedom of association.\n\nThe H&M group\u2019s values have guided employees since the day that the company was founded, and they continue to support the business today. The values influence how employees act, learn, develop, grow with the company, and contribute to creating workplaces where people and business thrive.\n\nAlong with the values, the group\u2019s culture and empowering leadership are actively and consciously integrated throughout the entire organisation. This supports the minds and\n\n1 The baseline for the sales goal is 2021. The H&M group\u2019s goal is to reduce its carbon footprint in absolute figures by 56 percent by 2030 baseline 2019 in accordance with our commitment at COP26. Profitability refers to operating profit in relation to sales. The ambition is to achieve the profitability target no later than 2024. The group\u2019s target to increase sales by 10\u201315 percent per year with continued high profitability remains a long-term target.\nbehaviours needed to stay ahead and remain relevant in a constantly changing world.\n\nDigitalisation and new customer behaviour continue to change the H&M group\u2019s competitive situation and increase the complexity of the business. In response to this shift in the industry, the company is and has been doing transformation work. This work encompasses all parts of the company and includes, among other things, a competence shift, regionalisation of the organisation, development of new and agile ways of working, and the establishment of cross-functional teams to improve efficiency and make faster decisions closer to the customer.\n\nEmployees at the H&M group connect and collaborate within teams and across brands and functions as a way of creating synergies and increasing customer value. To attract, develop, and retain talent, the company continually works to develop its leadership and employees\u2019 competences and skills. This is done in inclusive and diverse environments that promote equality for all, regardless of factors like gender, age or ethnicity.\n\nAt the end of the financial year, the H&M group had approximately 155,000 employees. The average number of employees in the group, converted into full-time positions, was 107,375 (110,325), of which 10,540 (10,214) were employed in Sweden. Of the average number of employees, around 74 percent were women and 26 percent were men. Of those in positions of responsibility within the company, such as store managers and country managers, 71 percent are women and 29 percent men.\n\nEVENTS AFTER THE CLOSING DATE\nThe H&M group has since 24 February 2022, temporarily closed all stores in Ukraine for the safety of customers and colleagues. As of 30 November 2021 the H&M group had in total 428 employees and 8 stores in Ukraine, and sales amounted to around 0.2 percent of the H&M group\u2019s total sales for the financial year. As communicated on 2 March 2022, the H&M group has temporarily paused all sales in Russia and Belarus. As of 30 November 2021 the H&M group had 168 stores in Russia and 3 stores in Belarus. The total number of employees was 6,910 in Russia and 169 in Belarus. Converted into full-time positions, see note 8. Average number of employees. Sales in Russia amounted to around 4 percent of the H&M group\u2019s total sales for the financial year and in Belarus to around 0.1 percent of total sales for the financial year. There is a continued uncertainty concerning the development and the company is monitoring and evaluating the situation continuously.\n\nRISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nH&M Group has an entrepreneurial approach to business development. Launching new initiatives and business ventures makes it necessary to accept business risks to some degree.\n\nOperational risks are the business risks together with events in the outside world which affect a certain sector or market or a brand in the group. Financial risks are risks related to the use of economic funds and financial resources.\n\nOperational risks and financial risks are continuously analysed and the risk acceptance or mitigation is evaluated quarterly by all brands and group functions for the most significant group risks.\n\nIt is always a business impact evaluation which determine whether an action is to be taken to reduce the likelihood of a risk and if so, to what extent. Business decisions also determine the extent to which the consequences of a risk should be mitigated.\n\nThere are external risks and uncertainties affecting the H&M group that are related to the shift in the industry, fashion, competitors, logistics resources, information security and cybersecurity, sustainability issues, weather, macroeconomics and geopolitical events, pandemics, foreign currencies, taxes, and various regulations and ordinances.\n\nA description of the H&M group\u2019s operational and financial risks is given in the sections below, with more detailed information concerning financial risks being given in note 2, Financial risks.\n\nThe H&M group\u2019s overall approach to risk management and internal control is described on pages 49\u201350 in the corporate governance report. The description includes how the H&M group works according to the COSO and TCFD frameworks and salient human rights risks.\n\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nDuring 2021 there was an increase in the ratio of risks related to external events risk compared to business risks. An example apart from Covid-19 is the challenges for transport networks with for instance port congestions and higher freight rates. For a number of years society has been influenced by the growing digitalisation rapidly changing customers\u2019 both shopping habits and their increased expectations on the shopping experience. More and more purchases are being made online from both mobile and computer platforms, which have become an increasingly important part of the shopping experience. Customers are looking for a smooth, simple and inspiring experience in which stores and online interact and enhance each other. In recent years the H&M group has therefore made substantial investments to provide this. The industry\u2019s shift to being increasingly digital was accelerated in 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic made even more customers start shopping online, and that trend towards a higher percentage of online shopping has continued during 2021. As the competitive landscape is redrawn by new business models and players, profitability in the industry has been impacted by increased competition.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 has made the group\u2019s brands and functions work hard to manage challenges within cost levels, supply chain and the customer experience, while still delivering without compromising on the business idea of the group\u2019s brands: Fashion and quality at the best price in a sustainable way. For the H&M group the importance of having good risk mitigation plans and issue management and crisis management capacity has been accentuated by the pandemic.\n\nReputational risk\nAs one of the world\u2019s leading fashion companies the H&M group\u2019s brands attract great interest and\nare constantly in the spotlight. To safeguard and manage its brands it is important that the H&M group continues to be developed and run according to its strong values, which are characterised by high business ethics.\n\nIt is of the utmost importance that the H&M group live up to the high ambitions set out in its policies and guidelines on business ethics and that anyone involved in the business has good knowledge, insight and procedures with respect to the production of its products. It is also crucial that the H&M group can reach its goals and ambitions which the group has set within the area of sustainability. Should the H&M group not live up to these, there is a risk that the group\u2019s reputation and brands could be damaged. Accurate, transparent and reliable communication can prevent occurrences of reputational risk, and can also help mitigate the consequences of any incidents.\n\nFashion\nOperating in the fashion industry is a risk in itself. Fashion has a limited shelf-life and there is always a risk that some part of the collections will not be sufficiently commercial, i.e. will not be well received by customers. Purchasing decisions are also increasingly influenced by customers\u2019 desire to live more sustainably.\n\nWithin each concept it is crucial to have the right volumes and a correct balance in the mix between fashion basics and the latest trends. In summary, each collection must achieve the best combination of fashion, quality, price and sustainability. An increasing degree of accuracy in purchasing decisions and volumes will help reduce overall resource consumption and create a more sustainable and circular business model.\n\nTo optimise fashion precision, the H&M group works intensively to optimise the extent of ongoing buying during the season in parallel with detailed analysis of day-to-day sales and stock levels in different markets. Today fashion is global, but shopping patterns vary between different markets and sales channels. The start of a season and the season vary from country to country. Delivery dates and product volumes for the various markets and channels are therefore adjusted accordingly. The new capability in the organisation to create regional and local customer offerings has been further developed to meet this demand.\n\nWeather\nThe H&M group\u2019s products are purchased for sale based on assumptions concerning weather patterns. Deviation from these assumptions affects sales. This is particularly true at the transition between two seasons, such as the transition from summer to autumn or from autumn to winter. If the autumn is warmer than usual it may have a negative effect on sales of weather-related garments in particular, such as outerwear and chunky knitwear. The risk analysis has shown that climate change may have further effects on the conditions for producing and distributing products in certain regions and countries. The increasing effects of climate change mean that these variations will likely increase in the future.\n\nNegative macroeconomic changes and geopolitical risks\nOne or more markets may be affected by events that have a negative effect on the macroeconomic situation or geopolitical environment in the country. These changed macroeconomic or geopolitical circumstances, such as political instability and sudden negative events, e.g. virus outbreaks in one or more countries and in the worst case a pandemic, may result in rapid changes in the business environment, such as rising inflation, significant disruption in the supply chain, and in economic downturn which is likely to change consumer purchasing behaviour and thus negatively impact the group\u2019s sales. Future markets where an H&M Group brand become established may have an increased risk of political instability or corruption.\n\nUncertainties also exist concerning how fluctuations in external factors such as the price of raw materials, transport costs and suppliers\u2019 capacity will affect buying costs for the group\u2019s products. There are also risks associated with social tensions in sourcing markets, which may lead to instability for suppliers and in manufacturing and deliveries.\n\nThe group therefore needs to monitor such changes closely and have strategies in place to deal with fluctuations as advantageously as possible for both the company and external stakeholders.\n\nSustainability risks\nThe H&M group has a highly ambitious sustainability strategy which aims to lead the change towards a more sustainable fashion industry, with both new business opportunities and risks. Climate change and its impacts has been identified as one of the company\u2019s most significant risks. Other main risks identified include shortage of natural resources, failure to uphold human rights early in the value chain, corruption, political and social instability in production and sourcing markets and changed consumption patterns and customer attitudes. This last factor could ultimately have major effects on the H&M group\u2019s sales \u2014 both positive and negative. The outcome depends on how successful the company is in its work to implement the sustainability strategy and the H&M group\u2019s ability to develop an even more sustainable customer offering and a sustainable business model.\n\nFor a more detailed description of risks related to sustainability see pages 63\u201374, and particularly pages 72\u201374 for the climate risk analysis according to TCFD.\n\nCompetitors\nThere is great confidence in the H&M group\u2019s ability to create relevant fashion and relevant customer experiences to suit the year\u2019s seasonal shifts in both the northern and southern hemispheres.\n\nThe H&M group is developing its organisation and way of working in all channels with the aim to improve its capability and its capacity to have a more relevant and attractive customer offering than its competitors.\n\nInformation security and cybersecurity\nAll companies are exposed to various types of risk related to information technology. The risks\nto which the H&M group is exposed to in this area are generically applicable to any large company, and especially to large companies that also trade online. These risks include hacking attempts on networks, disruption of system stability, and attempts to access customer accounts or login details from employees by means of phishing. The H&M group manages this type of risk continuously. Continual investments, adjustments and improvements are made to the organisation, systems, procedures and subcontractors in order to dealing with security risks in the best way possible.\n\nData protection and GDPR\nThe H&M group works actively with privacy risks to protect customers\u2019 and employees\u2019 data to safeguard the customer experience and the confidence with all employees.\n\nAs legislation in some jurisdictions could lead to significant administrative fees a central team provides central support and guidance on privacy risks, data protection issues, new privacy legislations across countries relevant to H&M Group. Additionally, a central team in business tech provides central support and guidance on how to use artificial intelligence in an ethical way.\n\nEach regional organisation has coordinators tasked with ensuring that the framework established by the central organisation is implemented. Compliance with the framework is continuously governed by the central team and reported quarterly to an oversight steering committee.\n\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nForeign currencies\nNearly half of the group\u2019s sales are made in euros, while the most significant currencies for the group\u2019s purchasing are the US dollar and the euro. Fluctuation in the US dollar\u2019s exchange rate against the euro is the single largest foreign currency transaction exposure for the group.\n\nLarge and rapid exchange rate fluctuations, particularly as regards the US dollar as a sourcing currency, may also have a significant effect on purchasing costs \u2014 even if this may be regarded as relatively competition-neutral over time. To hedge flows of goods in foreign currencies and thereby reduce the effects of future exchange rate fluctuations, payments for the group\u2019s flows of goods \u2014 i.e. the group\u2019s purchases of goods and in the majority of cases also the corresponding foreign currency inflows from the sales companies are hedged under forward contracts on an ongoing basis to the companies H & M Finance AB and H & M Hennes & Mauritz GBC AB.\n\nIn addition to the effects of transaction exposure, translation effects also impact the group\u2019s results. These effects arise due to changes in exchange rates between the local currencies of the various foreign sales companies and the Swedish krona compared to the same period the previous year. The underlying profit/loss in a market may be unchanged in the local currency, but when converted into SEK may increase if the Swedish krona has weakened or decrease if the Swedish krona has strengthened.\n\nTranslation effects also arise in respect of the group\u2019s net assets on consolidation of the foreign sales companies\u2019 balance sheets. For more information on currency hedging see note 2, Financial risks.\n\nTrade intervention\nPurchasing costs may be affected by decisions at a national level on export/import subsidies, customs duties (see more below), textile quotas, embargoes etc. The effects primarily impact customers and companies in individual markets. Global companies with operations in many countries are affected to a lesser extent, and among global corporations trade interventions may be regarded as largely competition-neutral. In the event of a major trade war between two countries this would affect not just sourcing costs but generally also the entire flow of goods from production to the customer, which the companies would need to mitigate.\n\nCustoms issues: Related party customs valuation continues to attract attention at a global, regional (the European Union) and national level, from both authorities and importers such as the H&M group. It will therefore continue to be important for the H&M group to pro-actively monitor and manage future developments in this area. One challenge is that customs authorities around the world are not taking a consistent approach to the assessment of pricing between related parties, despite the fact that the basis for customs duties is established according to the same global World Trade Organisation (WTO) customs valuation rules.\n\nTaxes\nFor multinational companies today\u2019s global environment involves complex tax risks, such as the risk of double taxation and tax disputes. As a large global company, the H&M group closely monitors developments in the field of tax. The H&M group is present in many countries and through its operations contributes to the community via various taxes and levies such as corporate tax, customs duties, income taxes and indirectly via VAT on the clothes sold to consumers.\n\nThe H&M group complies with national and international tax legislation, and always pays taxes and levies in accordance with local laws and regulations in the countries where the H&M group operates. The H&M group\u2019s tax policy, which can be found at hmgroup.com/about-us/corporate-governance/policies, reflects and supports H&M\u2019s business. The H&M group follows the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, which means that profits are allocated and taxed where the value is created.\n\nThe H&M group works continually to ensure that its tax strategy is designed to limit any distortion arising from differences in tax legislation in different parts of the world.\n\nThe OECD guidelines on transfer pricing can be interpreted in various ways, and consequently tax authorities in different countries may question the outcome of the H&M group\u2019s transfer pricing model even though the model complies with the OECD guidelines. On 18 December 2020 the OECD published its Guidance on the transfer pricing implications of the Covid-19 pandemic, which represents the consensus view of the 137 members of the Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) regarding application of the arm\u2019s length principle and OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines to the situations and challenges associated with the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe unique economic circumstances arising from the Covid-19 pandemic, and the associated measures taken by governments, have caused difficulties with the practical application of the arm\u2019s length principle. This may mean a risk of tax disputes in the group in the event that the H&M group and the local tax authorities interpret either the general guidelines or the specific Covid-19 guidelines differently.\n\nARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION, ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING\nAccording to H&M\u2019s articles of association, the board of H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB is to consist of no less than three but no more than twelve members elected by the general meeting and no more than the same number of deputies. The annual general meeting decides the exact number of board members, and which individuals are to be elected to the board. Board members are elected for the period until the end of the next annual general meeting. The general meeting also decides on amendments to the articles of association.\n\nNUMBER OF SHARES ETC.\nAt the end of the financial year H&M had 246,424 shareholders. The total number of shares in H&M is 1,655,072,000, of which 194,400,000 are class A shares (ten votes per share) and 1,460,672,000 are class B shares (one vote per share).\n\nH&M\u2019s largest shareholder is Stefan Persson and family, who via Ramsbury Invest AB hold all the class A shares, which represent 57.1 percent of the votes, as well as 604,856,427 class B shares, representing 17.8 percent of the votes. In addition, the family privately own 36,400,289 class B shares. This means that as of 30 November 2021, Stefan Persson and family privately and via Ramsbury Invest AB represent 75.9 percent of the votes and 50.5 percent of the total number of shares. Ramsbury Invest AB is thus formally the parent company of H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB. Ramsbury Invest AB is owned by Stefan Persson and family, and primarily by Stefan Persson. Karl-Johan Persson is also a shareholder in Ramsbury Invest AB.\n\nThere are no restrictions on voting rights or authorisations to the board relating to the issue or acquisition of the company\u2019s own shares.\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\nH&M has elected to present its corporate governance report as a separate document to the annual report in accordance with chapter 6 \u00a7 8 of the Swedish Annual Accounts Act. The corporate governance report is available at hmgroup.com/investors/reports/ and on pages 39\u201352 of the annual and sustainability report.\n\nGUIDELINES FOR REMUNERATION OF SENIOR EXECUTIVES\nThe annual general meeting held on 6 May 2021 adopted the following guidelines for remuneration of senior executives.\n\nThe guidelines cover remuneration to the CEO, remuneration to board members (aside from board fees) and remuneration to other senior executives. Other senior executives means members of the executive management team apart from the CEO. The executive management team comprises the individuals who report directly to the CEO.\n\nThe long-term variable remuneration, which applies only to the executive management team including the CEO, will be measured over a five-year period in order to reward long-term value creation for H&M.\n\nHow the guidelines contribute to the company\u2019s business strategy, long-term interests and sustainability\nThe H&M group\u2019s business plan aims to deliver long-term, sustainable and profitable growth. The business plan builds on the company\u2019s ongoing transformation work and is illustrated by a number of objectives to which the company\u2019s sustainability efforts and digital transformation contribute. These objectives are to continue improving the customer offering for all the brands, to build long-term and value-creating customer relationships, to offer an inspiring experience with integrated digital and physical channels, to adapt the supply chain so that it is faster and more flexible based on demand, and to add more revenue streams based on new emerging business models and innovations. Moving successfully towards these objectives is expected to result in finances remaining sound and sustainable, in accordance with the H&M group\u2019s target of a strong capital structure with good liquidity and financial flexibility, allowing continued freedom of action for growth and investments.\n\nThe board considers it important that senior executives are paid competitive remuneration at a market level, as regards both fixed and variable compensation, based on responsibilities and performance. To work successfully according to the company\u2019s business plan and safeguard the company\u2019s long-term interests the company needs to be able to recruit, motivate and retain talented, committed employees. Senior executives shall be compensated at what are considered by the company to be competitive market rates, based partly on industry comparisons. Levels of compensation shall be based partly on the significance of the duties performed, i.e. the ability to affect the overall development of the group, and partly on the employee\u2019s competencies, experience and performance. Together these decide the level of remuneration for the individual concerned. Over time, the largest portion of the remuneration shall consist of the fixed basic salary. The forms of compensation shall motivate senior executives to do their utmost to ensure the good financial and sustainable development of the H&M group.\n\nTypes of remuneration etc.\nThe total remuneration may consist of the following components:\n- fixed basic cash salary\n- short-term variable remuneration\n- long-term variable remuneration\n- pension benefits\n- other benefits\n\nFixed basic salary\nSenior executives shall have a fixed basic cash salary that is at a market level based on each position\u2019s significance for the company as a whole. The fixed basic cash salary shall reflect the individual\u2019s area of responsibility, competencies and experience and requires the individual to work in a committed manner at a high professional level.\n\nVariable remuneration\nThe variable remuneration may consist of a short-term and a long-term portion.\nThe criteria for criteria-related variable remuneration contribute to the company\u2019s strategic focus areas, long-term interests and sustainability in the ways set out on the next page.\n\nThere shall be a clear link between the level of performance-based variable remuneration paid and the H&M group\u2019s financial and sustainable development. Senior executives\u2019 variable remuneration shall therefore depend on the fulfilment of targets. The targets shall aim to promote the H&M group\u2019s development in both the short and the long term.\n\n**Short-term variable remuneration:** Fulfilment of targets shall be measured over a period of one year. The short-term variable remuneration shall be based on fulfilment of targets in the following areas:\n- The H&M group\u2019s total sales\n- The H&M group\u2019s total operating profit\n- Fulfilment of the objectives in the various areas of the business plan, which include sustainability and\n- Assessment of leadership and compliance with values.\n\nFor the last two performance parameters it is the individual\u2019s performance within their own area of responsibility that is assessed. For the financial targets, the assessment is to be based on the most recent financial year. The board of directors is responsible for this assessment in the case of short-term variable remuneration to the CEO. In the case of short-term variable remuneration to other senior executives, the CEO is responsible for the assessment.\n\nEach of these four predetermined performance parameters has equal weighting, i.e. each represents a quarter of the total target fulfilment. However, there is a threshold value for the second parameter, i.e. operating profit, which means that if this value is not reached then no short-term variable remuneration will be paid regardless of target fulfilment for the other three parameters. The short-term variable remuneration, which at individual level is based on the extent to which the person\u2019s duties and position influence the overall development of the group, may amount to 0\u20133 months\u2019 salary, 0\u20136 months\u2019 salary or 0\u201312 months\u2019 salary. Monthly salary refers to fixed basic cash salary. If the target levels set by the board are fulfilled, half of the maximum remuneration in each range shall be paid. To receive a payment in the higher part of the range within the set framework, therefore, the predetermined target levels are required to be exceeded.\n\nHalf of the remuneration payment shall be invested in H&M shares that must be held for at least three years. Each year the board will set target levels for each of the four performance parameters for the coming year.\n\n**Long-term variable remuneration:** The long-term variable remuneration shall be based on target fulfilment measured over five financial years starting from the current 2021 financial year and ending at the close of the 2025 financial year. This period, i.e. 1 December 2020\u201330 November 2025, is known as the measurement period. The long-term variable remuneration \u2014 which shall apply only to the executive management team including the CEO, totalling 15 individuals \u2014 shall be based on fulfilment of targets within the following areas:\n- The H&M group\u2019s total sales\n- The H&M group\u2019s total operating profit\n- Fulfilment of the objectives in the various areas of the business plan in total, which include sustainability, and\n- Assessment of leadership and compliance with values.\n\nEach of these four predetermined performance parameters shall have equal weighting, i.e. each represents a quarter of the total target fulfilment. For the long-term variable remuneration the assessment of the financial targets shall be based on a summing up of the past five financial years, with fulfilment of the annual target levels in the short-term arrangement \u2014 i.e. within sales and profit \u2014 forming the basis for target fulfilment in the long-term arrangement. For the other two performance parameters \u2014 i.e. fulfilment of the business plan and leadership and compliance with values \u2014 an overall assessment is to be made of the total for the H&M group for the entire measurement period. After the measurement period has ended the board is responsible for an overall assessment based on the four performance parameters and for deciding the long-term variable remuneration that will be paid to the CEO. The long-term variable remuneration to be paid to other senior executives will be established by the board in consultation with the CEO.\n\nA precondition for receiving the long-term portion shall be that the participants make an initial investment of their own in H&M shares, amounting to around 10 percent of their fixed basic annual cash salary after tax, close to the 2021 annual general meeting. These shares shall then be held for the entire measurement period. After three years, provided they remain employed by the group, the initial investment will be matched by the receipt of a cash amount after tax equal to two times their own initial outlay. This sum is to be invested in H&M shares as soon as possible. These shares are also to be held for the entire measurement period.\n\nThe aim of the initial investment of their own in H&M shares as well as the investment of the matching sum in H&M shares is to build up their own shareholding in H&M in order thereby to further align the interests of the executive management team with the interests of the shareholders in the good, long-term development of the company.\n\nThe maximum total remuneration within the framework of the long-term variable remuneration arrangement for the entire measurement period, which includes both the matching amount in year three and the remuneration in year five after the measurement period has ended, may vary between SEK 1.75 million net after tax and SEK 7 million net after tax depending on the individual\u2019s duties and the extent to which their position affects the overall development of the group.\n\nThe H&M group\u2019s total cost, including social security costs, for the long-term variable remuneration is expected to amount to a maximum of around SEK 150 million. A provision of SEK 30 million per year is expected to be made for a total of five years.\n\n**Pension benefits**\nIn the case of the CEO, pension benefits \u2014 including sickness insurance \u2014 are to be on a defined\ncontribution basis. Variable cash remuneration shall not be pensionable. The pension premiums for the year must not exceed 30 percent of the CEO\u2019s annual fixed basic salary.\n\nIn the case of other senior executives, pension benefits \u2014 including sickness insurance \u2014 are to be on a defined contribution basis unless the executive is covered by a defined benefit pension plan under the mandatory provisions of collective bargaining agreements. The pension premiums for the year must not exceed 40 percent of the senior executive\u2019s annual fixed basic salary. The cost of the present commitments is partly covered by separate insurance policies.\n\nThe retirement age for the CEO is 65.\n\nThe retirement age for other senior executives varies between 62 and 65 years.\n\nOther benefits\nSenior executives may receive other benefits such as wellness subsidies, car allowances and medical insurance. The total annual costs associated with other benefits must not exceed 20 percent of the individual\u2019s annual fixed basic salary.\n\nTermination of employment\nThe period of notice for senior executives may vary between three and 12 months. Variable remuneration is not to be paid if the individual has given notice to terminate their employment. The CEO is entitled to 12 months\u2019 notice. In the event that the company terminates the CEO\u2019s employment contract, a year\u2019s salary fixed basic cash salary may also be paid to the CEO as severance pay. No other severance pay is payable.\n\nSalary and employment terms for other employees of the company\nWhen preparing the board\u2019s proposed guidelines for remuneration to senior executives consideration was given to the salary and employment terms of the company\u2019s other employees by using information concerning the employees\u2019 total remuneration, the components of the remuneration and the increase in and rate of increase in the remuneration over time as part of the basis on which the board assessed whether the guidelines, and the resulting limitations, are reasonable.\n\nConsultancy fees\nWhere a board member performs work for the company including through a wholly owned company in addition to their board work, a separate fee may be paid for this consultancy fee. Such fee shall not exceed the board fee paid to the member concerned. The fee is to be based on the current market rate and be proportionate to the benefit for the company and the extent to which such work contributes to the good financial and sustainable development of the H&M group.\n\nDecision process for establishment, review and implementation of the guidelines\nThe company has no remuneration committee, since the board of directors deems it more appropriate for the entire board to carry out the tasks of a remuneration committee. The board prepares proposed guidelines for remuneration to senior executives and these proposals are presented at the annual general meetings. The board is to prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every four years and submit the proposal for decision by the annual general meeting. The guidelines shall apply until new guidelines have been adopted by the annual general meeting. The board shall also monitor and evaluate programmes for variable remuneration to the company\u2019s management and the application of the guidelines for remuneration to senior executives, as well as current remuneration structures and levels in the company. The board shall further decide on the CEO\u2019s salary in accordance with the guidelines in effect and shall continually evaluate the work of the CEO. Once a year this matter is to be discussed separately in conjunction with the setting of the CEO\u2019s remuneration for the coming year. To avoid conflicts of interest, no member of the company\u2019s management is to be present when the board discusses remuneration matters.\n\nOther\nSenior executives are also entitled to the benefits accruing under the profit-sharing programme known as the H&M Incentive Program, which is for all employees of the H&M group. The programme was adopted by a previous general meeting and is not covered by these guidelines.\n\nRegarding employment terms falling under rules other than Swedish rules, in the case of pension benefits and other benefits the guidelines are to be adapted as appropriate to comply with any such mandatory rules or established local practice, while fulfilling the general aim of the guidelines as far as possible.\n\nThe board may decide to temporarily deviate from the guidelines in full or in part if there is particular reason to do so in an individual case and this is necessary in order to provide for the company\u2019s long-term interests and sustainability or to ensure the financial viability of the company.\n\nDescription of significant changes to the guidelines and how shareholders\u2019 views have been taken into account\nThe pandemic has speeded up many changes in society and the industry that were already driving the H&M group\u2019s transformation. Digitalisation has accelerated and awareness of the importance of sustainable development has increased. In the H&M group\u2019s ongoing transformation it is important to have a good balance between short-term and long-term decisions. The proposed guidelines therefore include supplementary long-term variable remuneration for the executive management team while also clarifying the performance parameters for the short-term variable remuneration. In addition, the relationship between variable and fixed remuneration has been made clearer, and certain other changes have been made. The changes are in line with views presented by shareholders.\n\nPROPOSAL TO THE 2022 AGM\nThe board is proposing to the 2022 AGM that no changes are made to the guidelines for remuneration of senior executives.\n\nFINANCING AND LIQUIDITY\nThe H&M group aims to secure financial flexibility and freedom of action on the best possible terms. As previously, the efforts focus on continued improvements in working capital, cash flow and more efficient financing.\n\nCash flow and working capital\nCash flow from operating activities in the full-year amounted to SEK 44,619 m (25,900). Excluding IFRS 16 cash flow from operating activities amounted to SEK 32,304 m (11,726).\nThe cash flow is a result of positive development in sales and earnings and of improvements in working capital achieved by decreasing inventories and by streamlining invoice management and payment processes.\n\nLiquidity and debt financing\nThe H&M group\u2019s liquidity remains very good. As at 30 November 2021 cash and cash equivalents amounted to SEK 27,471 m (16,540). In addition, the group has undrawn credit facilities of SEK 15,178 m (30,055). The total liquidity buffer, i.e. cash and cash equivalents plus undrawn credit facilities, amounted to SEK 42,649 m (46,595).\n\nAs at 30 November 2021 the group had interest-bearing liabilities of SEK 9,614 m (16,332) in the form of commercial papers, bonds and loans from credit institutions. The average maturity of interest-bearing liabilities was 5.6 (2.1) years. The financial net cash amounted to SEK 17,857 m (208).\n\nA maturity analysis of outstanding interest-bearing liabilities and undrawn credit facilities is given in the table in note 2.\n\nThe following significant events took place during financial year 2021.\n- The revolving credit facility opened in April 2020 for EUR 980 m was closed.\n- Interest-bearing liabilities decreased by SEK 6,718 m to SEK 9,614 m (16,332).\n\nCAPITAL STRUCTURE\nThe H&M group advocates a conservative leverage ratio, aiming for a strong capital structure with strong liquidity and financial flexibility. It is essential that, as in the past, expansion and investments can proceed with continued freedom of action. The capital structure is defined as net debt in relation to EBITDA. It should not exceed 1.0 x EBITDA over time. Net debt/EBITDA excluding IFRS effects was -0.7 (0.0) as at 30 November 2021.\n\nIFRS 16 Leases, which is being applied from 1 December 2019, has substantial effects on the reporting of liabilities, assets and EBITDA. However, the H&M group will continue to define the capital structure exclusive of IFRS 16 effects. The company considers this to provide a clearer picture of the actual debt/equity ratio, and it is also the measure used in internal monitoring.\n\nDIVIDEND POLICY\nThe board of directors\u2019 intention is for the H&M group to continue to provide shareholders with a good return while ensuring that growth and investments in the business can proceed with a continued strong financial position and freedom of action. Based on this, the board of directors has proposed a dividend policy stating that the ordinary dividend over time is to exceed 50 percent of profit after tax and additionally that identified surplus liquidity \u2013 taking into consideration the capital structure target and investment requirements \u2013 can be distributed to shareholders through an extra dividend or a buyback programme.\n\nIn accordance with the dividend policy the board is proposing an ordinary dividend as well as authorisation for a share buyback programme.\n\nProposed distribution of earnings\nThe funds at the disposal of the parent company are SEK 20,104 m. The board of directors is proposing to the annual general meeting that a dividend of SEK 6.50 per share is paid, totalling SEK 10,758 m, and that the remaining earnings of H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB of SEK 9,346 m are carried forward. The board\u2019s proposed record dates are SEK 3.25 per share on 6 May 2022 and SEK 3.25 per share on 11 November 2022. If the AGM votes in favour of the board\u2019s proposal, dividends are expected to be paid out on 11 May 2022 and 16 November 2022.\n\nProposed share buyback programme\nThe board will also propose to the annual general meeting 2022 that the board is authorised to pass resolutions on the buyback of shares for a total amount of SEK 3 billion in the period up to and including the 2023 annual general meeting. The intention is that the repurchased shares will be withdrawn, thereby reducing the group\u2019s share capital. It is intended that the reduction will be met by a corresponding bonus issue so that the level of share capital is restored.\n\nThe board\u2019s assessment is that the proposed distribution of earnings and the proposed authorisation for a buyback programme is justifiable taking into consideration the full-year result, the good cash flow, the continued strong financial position and the ability to make future investments (capex). The proposals take into consideration the financial position and continued freedom of action of the group and the parent company, the capital structure target and the requirements that the nature and extent of the business, and its risks, expansion and development plans impose on the group\u2019s and the parent company\u2019s equity and liquidity.\n\nThe board is proposing to the 2022 AGM that a cash dividend of SEK 6.50 per share is paid.\n\nThe following funds are at the disposal of the annual general meeting\n\n| Description | Amount |\n|-------------|--------|\n| Total | SEK 20,104,090,638 |\n| The board proposes a dividend to the shareholders of SEK 6.50 per share | SEK 10,757,968,000 |\n| To be carried forward as retained earnings | SEK 9,346,122,638 |\n\nTotal | SEK 20,104,090,638 |\nStatutory Sustainability Report\n\nThis report is prepared in accordance with Chapter 6 \u00a7\u00a7 10\u201314 of the Annual Accounts Act and covers the financial year from 1 December 2020 to 30 November 2021.\n\nThe Statutory Sustainability Report contains the necessary information to provide an understanding of the group\u2019s sustainability performance, position and results and the sustainability impact by and on the company\u2019s operations. This includes disclosures on issues relevant to the company\u2019s value chain, including climate and the environment, working conditions, inclusion and diversity, respect for human rights and anti-corruption measures.\n\nIndicators marked * have been reviewed or partially reviewed by the company\u2019s auditors through a limited assurance process\u2014the scope is confirmed with footnotes in relevant data tables.\n\nSUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY\n\nH&M Group\u2019s sustainability strategy is built on the vision to lead the change towards a circular and climate positive fashion industry while being a fair and equal company. Through our strategy, we support progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals and Agenda 2030. Find further detail on policies, strategies and performance in our Sustainability Disclosure, which supplements this report, and in our Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) index at hmgroup.com/sustainability.\n\nInvestments in sustainability provide H&M Group with long-term business opportunities in a rapidly changing world. See page 6 for detail of our business model and see page 24 for the business opportunities connected to more sustainable and circular fashion and lifestyle.\n\nOur strategy guides our work to uphold human rights. It also guides how we play our part in tackling climate change, natural resource depletion and social inequality\u2014among other risks to our business, the planet and people connected to our value chain. Find details of our operational risks on pages 56\u201358, our climate-related risks in our reporting against Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations on page 72\u201374, and our risks to people in our Salient Human Rights Issues analysis at hmgroup.com/sustainability.\n\nTransparency enables informed decisions by the company and by our stakeholders. Read about H&M Group\u2019s commitment to transparency on page 16.\n\nOUR VALUE CHAIN\n\nThrough our value chain\u2014the full range of activities it takes to design, produce, transport, market, sell, use, reuse and recycle our products\u2014the company is connected to countless people, communities, ecosystems and other businesses around the world. We aim to maximise positive impacts while minimising negative ones, by making business decisions that live our values and contribute to our long-term goals. In particular, we work to secure human rights, promote fair jobs, inclusion and diversity, and reduce resource use and impacts on climate, water and biodiversity.\n\nOur value chain includes the following stages:\n- Design and product development\n- Raw material sourcing\n- Material production and processing\n- Product processing and manufacturing, which includes apparel, footwear, home, furniture, beauty, accessories and packaging\n- Transport and warehouse operations\n- Sales\n- Product use and reuse.\n\nWe work with approximately 600 commercial product suppliers for the H&M brand and Portfolio brands. These suppliers operate 1,209 manufacturing factories and final product processing units/collectively called supplier factories for apparel, footwear, accessories, home interior, furniture and beauty. H&M Group has 16 production offices across major sourcing markets, and we have 4,801 stores in 75 markets and 54 online markets.\n\nSUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE\n\nStructures and accountability\n\nImplementation of the company\u2019s sustainability vision and strategy is the responsibility of the head of sustainability together with the executive management team. The head of sustainability and each function and brand reports directly to the CEO, creating visibility of sustainability key performance indicators (KPIs). Twice yearly, the head of sustainability reports a performance overview to the board of directors. For further detail on our corporate governance, see page 39.\n\nAccountability for implementation and performance against our strategies, policies and goals is integrated into respective business functions and brands, and part of their performance review with our CEO. Business functions and brands are supported by a team of 31 experts and five managers in our global Sustainability Department, in order to achieve the best possible impact. As part of this, we work continuously with external stakeholders to ensure material issues are incorporated into the company\u2019s strategies and procedures. Every quarter, Sustainability Department teams report progress against the sustainability KPIs, key challenges, learnings and activities to facilitate visibility of impacts, achievements and challenges across functions, brands and markets.\n\nIn total, 224 people across the group have sustainability as their core task, and it is increasingly becoming part of everyone\u2019s role as we continue to integrate sustainability into our overall business goals and agenda.\nSupply chain management\nIt is compulsory for all suppliers and business partners supplying or acting on behalf of the company to sign our Sustainability Commitment and Code of Ethics, which state the group\u2019s minimum requirements and our expectation to go beyond these. The Code of Ethics also outlines a zero-tolerance policy on corruption and requires business partners and employees to comply with relevant legislation as well as our own business principles.\n\nOur Sustainable Impact Partnership Programme (SIPP) monitors compliance against our standards, measures performance, supports suppliers\u2019 due diligence procedures, and encourages improvements. As part of SIPP, supplier factories are assessed against tools developed by the Sustainable Apparel Coalition together with the industry, academia, NGOs and others. These tools are the Higg Facility Environmental Module (FEM) and Higg Facility Social and Labor Module (FSLM). Our goal for 100 percent verification of FEM and FSLM assessments by October 2021 has been delayed by Covid-19 preventing onsite verification in most countries.

Many environmental risks are closely connected to risks to people, for example the right to access clean water. Find further detail on our operational risks on pages 56\u201358 and see our TCFD reporting for climate-related risks on pages 72\u201374.\n\nWith growing customer interest and gradually changing behaviour, we see increasing opportunities to further accelerate investment in circular products, supply chains and customer journeys. This enables us to move towards operating in a more resilient, less resource-intensive way \u2013 creating positive impact and more meaningful, long-lasting relationships with customers by offering services throughout products\u2019 life-cycles that increase product value. Piloting and scaling innovative materials and processes, planning accuracy, and new ways to access fashion will further improve the resilience of our business by reducing dependence on limited natural resources. Find further explanation of the company\u2019s focus on resource use and circularity in our Sustainability Disclosure at hmgroup.com.\n\nStrategy and policies\n\nWe seize opportunities and manage risks through our sustainability strategy. Our strategy focuses on:\n\n- Climate positive. We take a climate positive approach across our value chain, supporting our aims to operate within planetary boundaries and have a net positive impact on biodiversity.1 As part of our climate positive approach, we are updating our existing science-based targets to align with the Science Based Targets initiative\u2019s recently launched Net-Zero Standard. H&M Group\u2019s new internal carbon pricing programme will ensure the company considers carbon emissions when making business decisions.\n\n- Circular products, supply chains and customer journeys. We\u2019re accelerating a systemic shift in how we design products, work with suppliers, interact with customers, and optimise resource use across our entire value chain for all our commercial and non-commercial goods.2 This supports the Ellen MacArthur Foundation\u2019s vision for a circular fashion industry3 and is crucial to achieve our climate and biodiversity ambitions.\n\nFind detail on our Circular & Climate Positive strategy in our Sustainability Disclosure at hmgroup.com/sustainability. For detail on related policies and standards, visit hmgroup.com.\n\n1) Our ambition to have a net positive impact on biodiversity is based on the definition of nature-positive in the naturepositive.org paper: A Nature Positive World: The Global Goal for Nature.\n2) Non-commercial goods include the packaging and items used in our store interiors, offices and distribution centres.\n3) https://ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/topics/fashion/overview\n\nFEM1 scores \u2013 participating tier 1 and 2 supplier factories\n\n|                      | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|----------------------|------|------|------|\n| Overall score (out of 100)2 | 57   | 52   | 47   |\n| Based on the combined average for: |      |      |      |\n| Energy               | 87   | 82   | 75   |\n| Water use            | 76   | 73   | 62   |\n| Emissions            | 70   | 59   | 52   |\n| Waste water          | 67   | 59   | 51   |\n| Waste management     | 37   | 34   | 31   |\n| Air emissions        | 29   | 29   | 30   |\n| Chemicals            | 32   | 29   | 27   |\n\n1) Higg Facility Environmental Module.\n2) Average of all active, approved tier 1 and tier 2 factories that have either a verified score or a self-reported score.

The limited assurance process includes: all scope 1 and 2 emissions; scope 3 emissions for transportation and garment production; renewable electricity; all cotton data (apart from in-conversion cotton); and data for our top three recycled materials.\n\n1) In 2021, the company updated the selection of KPIs reported in this statutory report to provide a more meaningful overview of our key environmental focus areas. In future years, we will expand this list to include new KPIs related to our focus on circularity and resource use reductions. We continue to report KPIs and data on chemicals, cotton and packaging in our Sustainability Report and our Corporate Sustainability Disclosure at hmgroup.com/sustainability.\n\n2) Scope 1 emissions are all direct emissions from our own operations; Scope 2 represents indirect GHG emissions from consumption of purchased electricity, heat or steam used in our own operations; scope 3 includes other indirect emissions, such as the extraction and production of purchased materials and fuels, transport related activities in vehicles not owned or controlled by the reporting entity, electricity related activities not covered in scope 2, outsourced activities, and waste disposal. Includes emissions related to raw materials, fabric production, garment manufacturing, non-garment non-commercial goods, and customer electricity usage. Scope 1 and 2 limitations and comments: only stores open for the full quarter are included; company cars and refrigerant leakage are not included; electricity consumption includes both actuals and estimations, where estimations are made if store actuals not received within the reporting deadline; estimates are based on previous consumption, opening hours and store area; includes electricity consumption from 3rd party contractors and facilities; includes emissions from Scope 3 limits and comments: emissions from Scope 3 are calculated based on electricity intensity from comparable market; capital goods, upstream leased assets, downstream leased assets, and processing of sold products are not included; upstream transportation is included in emission factors for materials. Scope 1 and 2 emissions factors: electricity - based on IEA data from CO\u2082e Emissions from Fuel Combustion \u00a9 OECD/IEA 2020, www.iea.org/statistics, licence www.iea.org/t&c; as modified by UL E&S; fuels \u2013 Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS), 2021 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/greenhouse-gas-reporting-conversion-factors-2021; Scope 3 emissions factors: raw material and fabric production \u2013 Higg-MI, garment production \u2013 electricity based on IEA data from CO\u2082e Emissions from Fuel Combustion \u00a9 OECD IEA 2020, www.iea.org/statistics, licence www.iea.org/t&c; as modified by UL E&S; fuels \u2013 2018 update https://www.iea.org/statistics; ghp emission factors hub; other expenditures \u2013 Delta 4, 2014, Indirect emissions from the supply chain; transport by rail, air, shipping, truck \u2013 emissions factors provided by Conlogic and NTM 2019.\n\n3) Scope 1 and 2 emissions data for 2020 and earlier did not historically include district heating in scope 2 and natural gas in scope 1 for stores in Germany. We have therefore restated scope 1 and 2 figures this year to include these additional emissions. For the years 2020 and earlier, the additional data for stores in Germany cover the calendar year January to December rather than the financial year. For 2021, all emissions including the additional data from Germany cover the reporting period September 2020 to August 2021. Read more about changes to our scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions reporting at hmgroup.com/sustainability/sustainability-reporting/how-we-report.\n\n4) New KPIs introduced in 2021. See footnotes.\n\n5) We use a shifted reporting year for energy and GHG emissions, covering the period September-August.\n\n6) Q4 2021 data are not confirmed at the time of reporting. This figure is based on Q1-Q3 2021 data.\n\n7) Includes manufacturing, fabric dyeing and printing supplies in both the 1st and 2nd with water intensive wet production, based on performance data, reported by facility and calculated using weighted averages for litre per kg of dyed knitted fabric, litre per metre of woven denim fabric, and litre per unit of product washed. We have updated our weighted average calculation by factoring in the weight of each product produced, and the water consumed by facility, country and region globally. This gives us a more accurate picture of water efficiency improvement and has led to changes in our historic performance data.\n\n8) Based on season 3 and season 4 data for 2021, includes all shell materials \u2013 does not include materials used as filling, lining or trims on garments. Read about how we define sustainably sourced for different raw materials in our material categorisation at hmgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HM-Group-Material-Categorisation-2021.pdf.\n\n9) This year\u2019s reduction in transportation or other sustainably sourced packaging is based on improvements in our data collection process.\n\n10) To align with the Science Based Targets initiative\u2019s requirements, the customer use phase is not included in the scope 3 part of this goal. We will set a separate goal for the customer use phase.\n\nPerformance\n\nThe Circular & Climate Positive KPI table (left) features indicators selected to offer an overview of our performance. Here, we share additional detail:\n\n- The company continued to work with a climate positive approach:\n  - Our scope 1 and 2 emissions decreased by 22 percent, compared to our 2019 baseline (a decrease of 34 percent compared to last year) and our scope 3 emissions decreased by 9 percent, compared to our 2019 baseline (an increase of 6 percent compared to last year). The scope 1 and 2 decrease is driven by purchase of renewable electricity certificates. Decreases in our scope 3 emissions over time are led by a continued shift to more sustainable and recycled materials and reduction in air transport, as well as being influenced by Covid-related issues such as fluctuations in order volumes. The increase in scope 3 emissions compared to last year was largely due to a rebound in production and sales and related increases in product transportation, following the significant impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.\n  - Use of renewable electricity in our own operations grew to 95 percent (from 90 percent in 2020) due to an increase in our purchase of Energy Attribute Certificates.\n  - After 1 January 2022, H&M Group will not onboard any new suppliers or supplier factories if they have on-site coal boilers in their facilities \u2013 as part of a longer term aim to phase out coal from our supply chain.\n  - The company issued a EUR 500 million sustainability-linked bond to provide external finance for carbon reduction and circularity activities, while offering investors an opportunity to contribute to positively transforming the fashion industry. Read more about our sustainability-linked bond at hmgroup.com.\n\n- For commercial goods, our use of materials from recycled sources tripled mainly due to growth in our volumes of recycled cotton and recycled polyester \u2013 showing strong progress towards our goal of 30 percent recycled materials by 2025, as a step towards 100 percent recycled or other more sustainably sourced materials by 2030.\n\n- Our overall packaging volume increased by 4 percent compared to last year. This is primarily due to an increase in online sales, which require more packaging per product than in-store sales, as well as the shift from plastic packaging to paper packaging. We have reduced plastic packaging by 27.8 percent compared to our baseline year 2018. We are updating our processes and our packaging data collection system to improve traceability of certified Forest Stewardship Council and recycled materials. This has led to a reduction in the reported total share of recycled or other more sustainably sourced materials in our packaging from 89 percent in 2020 to 68 percent in 2021. We will continue to improve the consistency and efficiency of our packaging systems and data collection for future years.\n\n- The company took steps to become a more circular business that optimises resource use:\n  - We set a new ambition to have all our products designed for circularity by 2025, and launched our circular design guide and tool Circulator \u2013 see circulator.hmgroup.com.\nSecond-hand platform Sellpy expanded into 22 new markets, reaching a total of 24 markets. H&M Group is a majority shareholder in Sellpy and the platform will work with H&M Group\u2019s global supply chain, helping to grow Sellpy\u2019s circular services. ARKET continued offering rental of kids\u2019 clothes in 19 markets, in collaboration with Circos.\n\nWe continued to make it easier for customers to reuse and recycle old clothes and textiles, and to demonstrate that these resources have value, through our in-store garment collecting initiative. Following disruption due to the Covid-19 pandemic across the whole year, H&M Group collected 15,944 tonnes of material in 2021 (18,800 tonnes in 2020; 29,005 tonnes in 2019).\n\nOur use of water per unit of product was 10.3 percent lower than our 2017 baseline and 6.6 percent lower than last year. Although this is a reduction, suppliers have had to run machines at very low production capacity because of reduced orders during the Covid-19 pandemic. This impacted progress toward our water consumption reduction goal, making it unlikely we will achieve minus 25 percent by 2022.\n\nFor detail on these KPIs as well as performance against other areas of the company\u2019s environmental strategy, see our Sustainability Disclosure at hmgroup.com/sustainability.\n\nREPORTING IN LINE WITH ARTICLE 8 OF THE EU TAXONOMY REGULATION\nH&M Group made an inventory of its activities in relation to activities outlined in the Climate Delegated Regulation1 with the aim to identify potential activities eligible under the reporting obligation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation2. The EU Taxonomy Climate Delegated Regulation is currently targeting sectors in which H&M Group does not operate. Based on the inventory performed 0 percent of H&M Group\u2019s turnover is considered to be associated with Taxonomy eligible economic activities. Given that H&M Group has not identified any of the economic activities within the Group to be eligible, no capital expenditures (hereinafter \u201cCAPEX\u201d) or operational expenditures (hereinafter \u201cOPEX\u201d) can be associated with such activities. While there are ongoing measures in order to make H&M activities low-carbon and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, CAPEX and OPEX associated with such measures are not considered material in relation to the total OPEX and CAPEX of the H&M group. Hence the proportion of taxonomy eligible CAPEX and OPEX, rounded to the nearest percentage, is 0 percent.\n\nWe continuously follow and engage in the dialogue with the European Union institutions for the upcoming delegated acts which are expected to address our industry. H&M Group has a number of sustainable projects and activities that are currently outside of the reporting obligation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. These are disclosed in more detail in this annual and sustainability report and its appendix, the Sustainability Disclosure.\n\nSOCIAL: CONDITIONS, EMPLOYMENT AND HUMAN RIGHTS\nRisks and opportunities\nRisks to people and human rights across our value chain are primarily linked to working conditions, inclusion, diversity, and impacts on communities connected to environmental degradation. For detail on our Salient Human Rights Issues analysis see hmgroup.com/sustainability. See also pages 56\u201358 for further detail on our operational risks.\n\nOur commitment to respect and advance internationally recognised human rights is the foundation for everything we do. We base our approach on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) and communicate our commitment via our Human Rights Policy \u2013 available at hmgroup.com. Our human rights due diligence is risk-based and applies across our operations, entire value chain and the communities where we operate.\n\nBy upholding human rights, working to ensure fair and decent jobs, and promote inclusion and diversity across our value chain, we realise the potential of individuals, while attracting and retaining talent. Diverse, inclusive teams are also key to creating a relevant and relatable customer offering. By contributing to the vision of the future of work in a circular fashion industry, we can develop the relationships needed for resilience in our supply chain and business activities.\n\nStrategy and policies\nWe inspire and engage billions of people around the globe, working to build meaningful relationships with our customers, employees and communities. We want to grow together, listen to and learn from each other, as we work to accelerate positive impacts and inclusion and equality for all those impacted by our business and value chain.\n\nWe focus our proactive strategies on the issues with greatest risk of negative impacts on people: our salient human rights issues. As these issues are primarily related to labour rights and the unequal treatment of people, our key strategies are Fair jobs for all and Inclusion and diversity (see below). Our supply chain management programme is an important foundation for continuously assessing and remedying human rights issues because many of these risks are inherent in the garment sector. Equally, the company acknowledges the role of the fashion industry in providing millions of entry-level jobs and contributing to economic development in emerging and evolving communities, especially for women. We recognise the importance of responsible business conduct by our industry to advance human rights.\n\nWe report in line with regulatory frameworks such as the Modern Slavery Act; see the company\u2019s statement at hmgroup.com/sustainability.\nBuilding on our human rights risk management, we have developed specific strategies on key issues:\n\n- **Fair jobs for all.** We support decent, meaningful jobs with fair compensation and benefits in safe, secure workplaces free from discrimination, where everyone has the right to freedom of association. Our approach is informed by the International Labour Organization\u2019s definition of decent work. We focus on employees in our own operations and workers in our supply chain. Our tier 1 and 2 production supply chain alone contributes to the employment of around one and a half million people. We are responsible to uphold the rights of these workers, which includes securing good working conditions, proper representation, improved wages and development opportunities, and promoting inclusion and diversity. As our business model evolves in response to digitalisation, circularity and growing online sales, we are adjusting our due diligence to increase focus on logistics (warehouses and transportation). We are also assessing the impacts of what a shift to a more digital, circular value chain with a climate positive approach will mean for the future of work.\n\n- **Inclusion and diversity.** We work to enable inclusive, diverse and equitable workplaces. We promote diversity and equality through products and communication, and we work to advance inclusion in our communities. By 2025, we aim for our workplaces to be more inclusive and diverse, to leverage our diversity for better business, and to use our business to advance inclusion in our communities. In 2021, we clarified our aim to be transparent and communicate more on our inclusion and diversity performance.\n\nFind detail on our Fair & Equal strategy in our Sustainability Disclosure at hmgroup.com/sustainability. For detail on related policies and standards, visit hmgroup.com.\n\n---\n\n**Human rights due diligence**\n\nWe carry out due diligence across our operations and value chain, paying special attention to vulnerable groups such as migrant workers and children \u2013 we do not accept forced labour or child labour. Any human rights risks in our value chain are identified and managed through the following steps:\n\n- **Due diligence.** Systematic use of due diligence to identify human rights risks and impacts and to prevent, mitigate and remedy issues in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs).\n- **Grievance mechanisms and incident management.** Management of grievances as close to the issue as possible. The company\u2019s Internal Grievance Policy outlines our internal process, and it is expected that business partners have similar operational-level grievance mechanisms in place. Employees and business partners can raise and escalate concerns using our Speak Up Channel.\u00b9\n- **Policy development.** Development and application of relevant human rights policies and standards for daily business operations, including internal social policies and the Sustainability Commitment for suppliers.\n- **Stakeholder engagement.** Engagement with stakeholders at every step, including workers, employees, customers, employers, unions, human rights experts and civil society.\n- **Training.** Provision of human rights training across the company, tailored to different functions and roles. This includes a basic introduction to human rights, an outline of the company\u2019s responsibilities in line with the UNGPs, and an explanation of due diligence and management processes. It also includes topic-specific training for parts of the organisation, such as awareness raising of forced labour and fair recruitment of migrant workers.\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 https://speakup.hmgroup.com\n\u00b2 Read about how we define fair wages at hmgroup.com/sustainability/fair-and-equal/wages/\n\u00b3 https://www.ilo.org/global/topics/decent-work/lang--en/index.htm\nFAIR & EQUAL KPIs\n\n| KPI | GOAL | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|-----|------|------|------|------|\n| Own operations: % of employees agreeing with the statement \u201cI am treated with respect and dignity\u201d | Annual increase | 83 | 80 | 82 |\n| Own operations: % of female employees, in management positions and on the board of directors | | | | |\n| Own operations: % of employees that have received our Layers inclusion and diversity training | | | | |\n| Supply chain: % of tier 1 supplier factories that have trade union representation | | 37 | 32 | \u2013 |\n| Supply chain: % of tier 1 supplier factories that have collective bargaining agreements in place | | 27 | 18 | \u2013 |\n| Supply chain: % of female workers, supervisors, and worker representatives in our tier 1 production supply chain | See footnote 5 | | | |\n| Community investment initiatives: total number of beneficiaries and total value of contributions | | 368,000 | | SEK 180.4 million |\n\n1. In 2021, the company updated the selection of KPIs reported in this statutory report to provide a more meaningful overview of our key human rights and social focus areas. We continue to report additional KPIs and data in our Sustainability Disclosure at hmgroup.com/sustainability.\n2. New since 2019, replacing our previous KPI % of employees agreeing with the statement \u201cpeople here are treated fairly regardless of age, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, disabilities\u201d, as we made a shift to a new engagement survey platform.\n3. New KPIs introduced in 2021. See footnote 1. From 2021, we will report the % of employees across brands, function, and markets participating in Layers training. This gives a more detailed breakdown of performance than was reported in previous years, where we provided by a single figure for the total number of employees trained.\n4. New KPIs introduced in 2020 due to the strategic decision to track progress in the group\u2019s global production supply chain for apparel and footwear.\n5. Increasing the share of female supervisors and worker representatives is an ambition in the group\u2019s Women\u2019s Empowerment Strategy for the production supply chain. The baseline was established in 2020 and the aim is for yearly increases.\n6. New KPI introduced in 2021. See footnote 1. The value of contributions includes in-kind donations and related community investment initiative management costs.\n\nPerformance\n\nThe Fair & Equal KPI table (left) features indicators selected to offer an overview of our performance. Here, we share additional detail:\n\n- We strengthened our responsible purchasing practices:\n  - Currently, 68 percent of in scope orders are placed using the fact-based costing tool that enables us to ring-fence labour costs. Find detailed data on wages and workers in our production supply chain in our Sustainability Disclosure at hmgroup.com/sustainability.\n  - 98 percent of suppliers regard the company as a fair business partner.\n- To assist suppliers to maintain financial liquidity, we began offering the option to receive payment in approximately three days after sending an invoice to H&M Group. The supplier pays a financing cost to the bank to receive early payment, which is usually significantly lower than the cost of borrowing.\n- We continued collaborating with suppliers to support open and meaningful workplace dialogue and equitable, inclusive workplaces:\n  - Analysis of collecting bargaining agreements (CBAs) in our supply chain showed that, even within the same country, some CBAs deliver increased benefits while others uphold local law. We will work to train suppliers in countries where the positive impact of CBAs is lower, and our National Monitoring Committees are creating their annual plans for 2022 based on the learnings from this analysis along with our other priorities under our Global Framework Agreement.\n  - We analysed the impact of our workplace dialogue (WPD) programme, focusing on democratic elections for worker representatives. Although results vary from country to country, we tend to see more grievances recorded in WPD programme factories, suggesting WPD programmes increase workers\u2019 access to remedy. In Turkey, for example, we also see on average 10 percent more female worker representatives in WPD programme factories, which suggests that women can be more engaged when a transparent, democratic election process is implemented.\n- We focused on providing inclusive, diverse and equitable workplaces for employees. The company set aims to improve diversity across the business. We are developing and piloting a tool to help us better understand our inclusion, equity and diversity performance. Our goal is for the tool to help monitor our progress and inform future actions.\n\nFor detail on these KPIs as well as performance against other areas of the company\u2019s social strategy, see our Sustainability Disclosure at hmgroup.com/sustainability.\nANTI-CORRUPTION AND BRIBERY\nRisks and opportunities\nActing with respect, integrity, transparency and honesty is essential for the company\u2019s business and deeply rooted in our corporate values. There is a risk of corruption in many of the markets in which the company and its suppliers operate.\n\nThe company identifies risks by mapping corruption risk across its operations, performing annual risk assessments and audits, and identifying the greatest risks based on location or type of operation. Through our risk assessment process, we first identify and document the risk, before assessing the risk and deciding our response. The company then puts appropriate follow-up actions in place and sets a timeframe for when the risk will be reviewed. We also identify risks through analysis of violations of our Code of Ethics Policy and concerns submitted via the H&M Group Speak Up Channel, which is available to our employees, business partners and third parties. This analysis is supplemented by insights from additional metrics such as Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perceptions Index and from global risk consultancies.\n\nOur strong anti-corruption work also leads to benefits by strengthening our business ethics and corporate culture and enhancing our reputation with stakeholders.\n\nStrategy and policies\nOur Code of Ethics details the company\u2019s expectations of employees and business partners when conducting business for and on behalf of the group. It outlines our zero-tolerance policy on bribery and corruption, applying to all business dealings in all countries in which the company and its partners operate.\n\nThe company mitigates risks through its strong Ethics & Compliance and Anti-Corruption programme, which includes:\n\n- **Code of Ethics Policy.** It is mandatory that all employees in contact with business partners and our business partners sign and comply with the Code of Ethics. Within the Code of Ethics Policy for employees, the Speak Up Channel, Conflict of Interest, Confidential Information and Intellectual Property Rights sections were updated during 2021. Within the Code of Ethics Policy for business partners, the Speak Up Channel section was added.\n\n- **Training and awareness.** Employees and business partners receive training and awareness sessions on our Code of Ethics. Trainings were conducted digitally during 2021, due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Employees can access the company\u2019s Code of Ethics training, Speak Up Channel and policies through our Ethics Portal new in 2021. Business partners will be able to access Code of Ethics e-learning on the Ethics Portal from 2022.\n\n- **Reporting concerns.** Employees, business partners and any third parties are encouraged to report concerns or potential violations of the group\u2019s policies and/or relevant law through the company\u2019s Speak Up Channel. We updated all our H&M Group policies in 2021 to include our new Speak Up Channel, which was introduced in compliance with the EU Whistleblowing Protection Directive.\n\n- **Due diligence.** Corruption risk assessment is part of the due diligence process for all new business partners, with assessment of risk level by country, industry and position/function. Once the risk level is determined, the company sets short- and long-term goals to help mitigate risk. H&M Group continues to explore use of third-party risk management tools that could automate our due diligence process for business partners and other third parties.\n\n- **Follow-up procedures.** All reported Code of Ethics cases are assessed and investigated internally. Investigations may lead to terminations of business relationships or employment. The number of violations is tracked and reported annually to the CEO, CFO, board of directors and externally, and the group conducts internal audits to ensure compliance.\n\nFor detail on our policies visit hmgroup.com.\nPerformance\n\nThe key data table (left) features indicators selected to offer an overview of our performance.

All company risks are reviewed by the board at least once per year. The board monitors implementation of the sustainability strategy and initiates changes and updates where needed. These procedures and governance mechanisms enable the board to maintain close oversight of the company\u2019s sustainability and climate-related performance, and ensure sufficient management focus and resource allocation. Implementation of the company\u2019s sustainability strategy, including our climate strategy, is the responsibility of the head of sustainability together with the executive management team. The head of sustainability reports directly to the CEO and shares biannual updates on our sustainability key performance indicators (KPIs) to the board of directors and quarterly KPI updates to the CEO and CFO. See also the Corporate Governance Report, and read more about our risk management processes on page 39.\n\nStrategy\nWe have performed a risk analysis following the Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosure (TCFD) recommendations. We focused predominantly on two scenarios:\n- The rapid transition scenario (RCP 2.6, mostly short- and medium-term). In this scenario the world manages to drastically reduce CO\u2082e emissions through several far-reaching measures, such as legislation, global carbon taxes, and major shifts in consumption patterns and lifestyles. This would limit the average temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C.\n- The accelerating temperature increase scenario (RCP 8.5, mostly long-term). In this scenario the world fails to curb rising CO\u2082e emissions. In the long term (to 2100), this results in a global average temperature increase of at least 3-4\u00b0C. Legislation and carbon taxes are expected to play a less significant role in this scenario. Impacts from extreme weather events are assumed to grow in magnitude.\n\nIn our scenarios, we analysed possible impacts in the short term (1-3 years), medium term (in around 10 years) and long term (in around 30 years). The risk analysis was performed by mapping our value chain, before conducting a number of workshops to evaluate and rank scenario risks in all parts of the value chain. The main areas analysed were raw material sourcing, production, logistics, sales, and customers including more general transition risks such as taxes and legislation. Business opportunities related to climate change were also discussed and evaluated at the workshops. The results of the risk analysis are summarised in the following tables.\n\nThe rapid transition scenario\nRCP2.6, mostly short- and medium-term risks\n\n| RISK RANKING | RISK DESCRIPTION | MITIGATION MEASURES |\n|--------------|------------------|---------------------|\n| Changes in customer attitudes and purchasing patterns | Growing awareness of climate change is expected to impact customer preferences, with an increased preference for products and services with low climate impact from trusted companies that are seen as leaders in sustainability. This could also include reputational risks related to brand perception. | H&M Group has an ambitious sustainability strategy in place. The group aims to achieve net-zero (as defined by the Science Based Targets initiative\u2019s Net-Zero Standard) GHG emissions in our supply chain and to become a circular business. For example, this means sourcing raw materials that are recycled or more sustainably sourced and scaling up circular business models. Our sustainability strategy will allow us to build trust in our brands and provide an offering that has a lower environmental impact than our competitors\u2019 offerings. |\n| Transition to low carbon production and or low emission technologies | Fossil fuels remain a significant source of energy in many H&M Group production countries. Climate-related legislation is expected to increase significantly. In response, H&M Group would gradually strengthen requirements for suppliers, as part of the company\u2019s ambition to take a leadership position in reducing climate impact. The group would provide financial support that assists suppliers to phase out coal and other fossil fuels. The expected overall result is increased production costs. Investments are also needed to develop more sustainable materials for use in our garments. | Together with our suppliers, H&M Group will make significant investments in our supply chain to phase our coal and other fossil fuels, facilitated by our newly formed green investment team and financed by our sustainability-linked bond. We have developed an internal tool \u2013 the Climate Positive Roadmap tool \u2013 to help us better understand the most cost-effective paths towards reducing our climate impact. We will collaborate with peers to amplify support for suppliers to phase out fossil fuels. |\n| Introduction of global or regional carbon taxes | Taxes on CO\u2082e or import tariffs on garments produced in one region e.g. Asia but exported to another e.g. the European Union may influence total production costs. This could be both a risk and an opportunity depending on the ability of H&M Group to phase out fossil fuels in our supply chain. | We have set ambitious targets to reduce CO\u2082e emissions throughout our value chain, reducing our vulnerability to possible carbon taxes. Our sourcing strategy is flexible and we are constantly evaluating the direct and indirect costs of each region to allocate our production in the most efficient way. |\n### The accelerating temperature increase scenario\n\n**RCP 8.5, mostly long-term risks**\n\n| RISK RANKING | RISK DESCRIPTION | MITIGATION MEASURES |\n|--------------|------------------|---------------------|\n| **MEDIUM**   | Raw material availability and price | H&M Group is heavily dependent on cotton as a raw material. Higher temperatures and water shortages will affect the possibility to grow cotton in many regions. In the long term, the company believes that this will affect the availability and price of cotton. Price increases for other raw materials are also expected. |\n| **MEDIUM**   | Increased energy and water costs | In a warmer world, demand for energy (e.g. for cooling purposes) is likely to increase. We also expect legislation and higher prices for water in certain regions. These increases may impact production and logistics costs. |\n| **MEDIUM**   | Water scarcity or extreme weather events that create disturbances in production or logistics | Climate change will increasingly impact access to freshwater in certain regions, with consequences for where and how garments can be produced. Extreme weather events may also cause disruptions to production and distribution in some countries. |\n\n### Overview of business opportunities\n\n| OPPORTUNITY | DESCRIPTION | MEASURES TO REALISE THE OPPORTUNITY |\n|-------------|-------------|------------------------------------|\n| Building a more sustainable business and attracting more customers | Increasing awareness of the climate crisis may impact customer preferences for products or services with a low climate impact, from companies that customers trust and that share their values. There is an opportunity for H&M Group to attract more customers by providing a more sustainable and transparent offering. | Delivering H&M Group\u2019s ambitious sustainability strategy and meeting climate-related customer expectations could lead to a bigger market share. |\n| Developing new circular business models | Increasing awareness of the climate crisis may change consumer behaviour as customers are incentivised to switch to new ways of enjoying fashion without the climate impact associated with garment production. This shift will reduce H&M Group\u2019s climate impact and offer the company new revenue streams that complement the traditional business model. | H&M Group is continuously developing new business models and new revenue streams, such as on-demand production, resell, rental, garment care, and repair services. |\n| Decarbonisation of garment production to reduce the impact of carbon taxes and higher energy prices | By reducing our CO\u2082e emissions, optimising production and transitioning away from fossil fuels, we will reduce our exposure to future legislation and taxes on fossil fuel or CO\u2082e emissions. This could also result in reduced production costs and create competitive advantages versus our competitors. | H&M Group will make significant investments in our supply chain to phase out fossil fuels facilitated by our newly formed green investment team. |\n| Creation of new business to business revenue streams | Increasing awareness of the climate crisis may put pressure on our competitors\u2019 sustainability strategies. This, combined with the decarbonisation of H&M Group\u2019s production, will increase opportunities to expand our current business-to-business service offering. By further investing in reverse supply chain initiatives, H&M Group can introduce potential new revenue streams that complement the traditional business model. | H&M Group continuously develops new business models and revenue streams, such as collecting, sorting and recycling garments, and offering supply chain management services. This also includes constantly investigating external innovations and ideas. |\nImpact on business strategy & financial planning\nClimate-related risks have a major impact on H&M Group\u2019s business strategy. We have set a very ambitious goal of halving our supply chain emissions every decade (read more on pages 34\u201335).\n\nIt\u2019s our strong belief that we must reduce our climate impact in line with what science demands. We believe that this is something that our customers will expect from us and that our strategy will positively impact our sales in the long term. From a cost perspective, we believe that this is a sound business decision \u2014 we expect to see higher energy prices, strengthened climate legislation and increased introduction of climate-related taxes or tolls. Decarbonising our supply chain will therefore be a competitive advantage for H&M Group. The following are examples of how our business is impacted:\n\n- Growth of circular business models, such as resell, rental, re-make, care and repair solutions for customers (read more on page 24). This will significantly reduce our climate impact.\n- Use of a new way to secure finance for climate-related investments through the issue of a sustainability-linked bond (with a value of EUR 500 million).\n- A comprehensive program to step-by-step decarbonize our supply chain with a budget for 2022 of around SEK 3 billion, including investments to phase out coal, increasing the share of more sustainable materials etc.\n- Formation of Climate and Circular cross-functional teams, reporting directly to the management team, with the mission to accelerate and drive decarbonisation of our value chain.\n- Regular review of performance towards set targets by the board of directors and the executive management team, ensuring sufficient resource allocation and progress.\n- Incentive programmes for key executives connected to sustainability performance (including climate).\n\nThe resilience of our strategy\nWe are convinced that our ambitious climate strategy alongside the measures described above offer a resilient business strategy. We have analysed the possible consequences in the following two scenarios:\n\n- **The rapid transition scenario RCP 2.6.** By 2030, H&M Group will have halved supply chain CO\u2082e emissions in absolute terms, independent of business growth. This means we will be very well prepared for developments such as strengthened climate-related legislation and/or the introduction of carbon taxes. The most significant risk to the company, as well as business opportunity, is lost or increased customer trust that impacts the willingness of customers to enjoy products from H&M Group.\n\n- **The accelerating temperature increase scenario RCP 8.5.** The most significant consequence for our business in this scenario is the possible impact on raw material availability and price, especially for cotton. We are limiting the possible business impact of this by reducing our dependency on cotton and other virgin raw materials. In this scenario, our work to create business contingency plans for all parts of our supply chain will help us prevent negative business impacts resulting from extreme weather events. As H&M Group has a limited amount of company-owned assets, we see minimal climate-related risks beyond disruptions to sales and increased raw materials prices.\n\nTCFD disclosures index\n\n| GOVERNANCE | The board\u2019s oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities | Page 72 |\n| STRATEGY | The climate-related risks and opportunities that the organisation has identified over the short, medium and long term | Pages 72-73 |\n| RISK MANAGEMENT | The organisation\u2019s processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks | Page 72 |\n| METRICS AND TARGETS | The metrics used by the organisation to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process | Page 66 |\n\nP.74\n### Group income statement\n\n|                      | 2021   | 2020   |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|\n| Net sales, note 3, 4 | 198,967| 187,031|\n| Cost of goods sold, note 6, 7, 9 | -93,961| -93,487|\n| **GROSS PROFIT**     | 105,006| 93,544 |\n| Selling expenses, note 6, 7, 9 | -80,535| -81,425|\n| Administrative expenses, note 6, 7, 9, 10 | -9,216| -9,020|\n| **OPERATING PROFIT** | 15,255| 3,099  |\n| Interest income and similar items | 203    | 252    |\n| Interest expense and similar items | -1,158| -1,299 |\n| **PROFIT AFTER FINANCIAL ITEMS** | 14,300| 2,052  |\n| Tax, note 11         | -3,290 | -809   |\n| **PROFIT FOR THE YEAR** | 11,010| 1,243  |\n\nAll profit for the year is attributable to the shareholders of the parent company H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB.\n\nEarnings per share, SEK\\(^1\\) | 6.65 | 0.75 |\nNumber of shares, thousands\\(^1\\) | 1,655,072 | 1,655,072 |\n\n---\n\n### Consolidated statement of comprehensive income\n\n|                      | 2021   | 2020   |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|\n| **PROFIT FOR THE YEAR** | 11,010| 1,243  |\n\n**Other comprehensive income**\n\n- **Items that are or may be reclassified to profit or loss**\n  - Translation differences | 1,430 | -3,673 |\n  - Change in hedging reserves, note 21 | -101 | 92 |\n  - Tax attributable to change in hedging reserves | 26 | -21 |\n\n- **Items that will not be reclassified to profit or loss**\n  - Remeasurement of defined benefit pension plans, note 20 | 187 | -113 |\n  - Tax related to the above remeasurement | -43 | 26 |\n  - Remeasurement of financial assets | 3,644 | - |\n\n**OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME** | 5,143 | -3,689 |\n\n**TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME FOR THE YEAR** | 16,153| 2,446 |\n\nAll comprehensive income is attributable to the shareholders of the parent company H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB.\nCOMMENTS ON THE GROUP INCOME STATEMENT\n\nDespite continued restrictions and negative consequences of the pandemic, in the last quarter of the year the H&M group\u2019s sales in local currencies were back at the same level as in 2019. The year ended with around 115 stores temporarily closed in a few markets due to the pandemic. Net sales for the full 2020/2021 financial year increased by 6 percent to SEK 198,967 m (187,031). In local currencies, sales increased by 12 percent. Gross profit increased to SEK 105,006 m (93,544). This corresponds to a gross margin of 52.8 percent (50.0).\n\nThe gross profit and gross margin are a result of many different factors, internal as well as external, and are mostly affected by the decisions that the H&M group takes in line with its strategy to always have the best customer offering in each individual market \u2013 based on the combination of fashion, quality, price and sustainability.\n\nThe measures taken within all parts of the business during the previous year to manage the Covid-19 situation and its negative effects, for example in respect of product purchasing, investments, rents, staffing and financing, continued to bear fruit during the year. Selling and administrative expenses decreased by 1 percent to SEK 89,751 m (90,445). In local currencies, expenses increased by 3 percent. Government support associated with the pandemic decreased expenses by around SEK 1.5 billion (around 2 billion), which must be seen in the light of the substantial negative sales impact of the pandemic and the unpredictable situation brought about by its development in numerous markets.\n\nProfit after financial items amounted to SEK 14,300 m (2,052). Excluding the effects of IFRS 16, profit after financial items amounted to SEK 14,043 m (1,691).\n\nTAX\n\nThe H&M group\u2019s tax rate for the 2020/2021 financial year was 23.0 percent (39.4). The final tax rate for the year depends on the results of the group\u2019s various companies and the corporate tax rates in each country. The historically high tax rate last year was Covid-19 related, since the proportion of non-deductible expenses has a greater percentage impact on the tax rate when earnings before tax decrease so substantially compared with a normal year; for the financial year the situation has therefore normalised.\n\n| Net sales | Gross profit and gross margin | Selling and administrative expenses | Profit after financial items |\n|-----------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| SEK M     | %                             | SEK M                               | SEK M                       |\n| 187,031   | +6%                           | 50.0%                               | 90,445                      |\n| 198,967   |                               | 52.8%                               | 89,751                      |\n| 93,544    |                               |                                     | 105,006                     |\n| 2020      | 2021                          | 2020                                | 2021                        |\n| 90,445    | 89,751                        | 14,300                              | 2,052                       |\n| 2020      | 2021                          | 2020                                | 2021                        |\n### Group balance sheet\n\n| ASSETS | 30 NOVEMBER | 2021 | 2020 |\n|--------|-------------|------|------|\n| **NON-CURRENT ASSETS** | | | |\n| Intangible non-current assets | | | |\n| Leasehold and similar rights, note 12 | 224 | 191 |\n| Capitalised development expenditure, note 12 | 9,268 | 10,177 |\n| Goodwill, note 12 | 64 | 64 |\n| **Total Intangible non-current assets** | 9,556 | 10,432 |\n| Property, plant and equipment | | | |\n| Buildings and land, note 13 | 724 | 745 |\n| Equipment, tools, fixture and fittings, note 13 | 25,852 | 30,894 |\n| Right-of-use assets, note 15 | 53,086 | 59,535 |\n| **Total Property, plant and equipment** | 79,662 | 91,174 |\n| **Non-current financial assets** | | | |\n| Interests in associates, note 14 | 686 | 247 |\n| Other shares and interests | 4,405 | 539 |\n| **Total Non-current financial assets** | 5,091 | 786 |\n| **Other non-current assets** | | | |\n| Long-term receivables | 860 | 907 |\n| Deferred tax assets, note 11 | 5,626 | 5,714 |\n| **Total Other non-current assets** | 6,486 | 6,621 |\n| **TOTAL NON-CURRENT ASSETS** | 100,795 | 109,013 |\n\n| CURRENT ASSETS | 30 NOVEMBER | 2021 | 2020 |\n|----------------|-------------|------|------|\n| Stock-in-trade, note 16 | | 37,306 | 38,209 |\n| **Current receivables** | | | |\n| Accounts receivable, note 21 | | 3,059 | 3,086 |\n| Tax assets, note 11 | | 2,834 | 1,686 |\n| Other receivables | | 3,509 | 2,397 |\n| Prepaid expenses, note 17 | | 4,807 | 3,440 |\n| **Total Current receivables** | | 14,209 | 10,609 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents, note 18 | | 27,471 | 16,540 |\n| **Total CURRENT ASSETS** | | 78,986 | 65,358 |\n| **TOTAL ASSETS** | | 179,781 | 174,371 |\n\n| EQUITY AND LIABILITIES | 30 NOVEMBER | 2021 | 2020 |\n|------------------------|-------------|------|------|\n| **EQUITY** | | | |\n| Share capital, note 19 | | 207 | 207 |\n| Reserves | | 2,345 | 990 |\n| Retained earnings | | 57,466 | 53,426 |\n| **Total EQUITY** | | 60,018 | 54,623 |\n| **LIABILITIES** | | | |\n| Long-term liabilities | | | |\n| Provisions for pensions, note 20 | | 428 | 612 |\n| Deferred tax liabilities, note 11 | | 3,601 | 3,988 |\n| Liabilities to credit institutions, note 24 | | 9,178 | 8,433 |\n| Other interest-bearing liabilities, note 15, 24 | | 45,379 | 50,458 |\n| **Total Long-term liabilities** | | 58,586 | 63,491 |\n| Current liabilities | | | |\n| Accounts payable | | 20,382 | 9,511 |\n| Tax liabilities, note 11 | | 1,441 | 1,708 |\n| Liabilities to credit institutions, note 24 | | 436 | 7,899 |\n| Other interest-bearing liabilities, note 15, 24 | | 11,698 | 13,275 |\n| Other liabilities | | 5,149 | 3,983 |\n| Accrued expenses and deferred income, note 22 | | 22,071 | 19,881 |\n| **Total Current liabilities** | | 61,177 | 56,257 |\n| **TOTAL LIABILITIES** | | 119,763 | 119,748 |\n| **TOTAL EQUITY AND LIABILITIES** | | 179,781 | 174,371 |\nCOMMENTS ON THE GROUP BALANCE SHEET\n\nThe H&M group is in a strong financial position. The group\u2019s equity/assets ratio was 33.4 percent (31.3). The share of risk-bearing capital was 35.4 percent (33.6). Equity apportioned on the outstanding 1,655,072,000 (1,655,072,000) shares as of 30 November 2020 was SEK 36.26 (33.00).\n\nStock-in-trade\n\nThe carrying amount of the stock-in-trade decreased by 2 percent in SEK compared with the same point in time last year and amounted to SEK 37,306 m (38,209). Currency adjusted the stock-in-trade was at the same level as in the previous year. The book value of stock-in-trade in SEK represented 18.7 percent (20.4) of sales.\n\nFinancing\n\nAs of 30 November 2021 the group had interest-bearing liabilities, excluding lease liabilities and provisions for pensions, of SEK 9,614 m (16,332) in the form of commercial paper, bonds and loans from credit institutions. In addition, the group has undrawn credit facilities of SEK 15,178 m (30,055). The average maturity of interest-bearing liabilities and undrawn credit facilities was 5.6 (2.1) years; the increased average maturity is primarily due to the sustainability-linked bond that matures in 2029 which was issued during the year. A maturity analysis of outstanding interest-bearing liabilities and undrawn credit facilities is given in the table in note 2.\n\nThe H&M group\u2019s liquidity is very good. As of 30 November 2021, cash and cash equivalents amounted to SEK 27,471 m (16,540). Together, cash and cash equivalents and undrawn credit facilities totalled SEK 42,649 m (46,595).\n\nEfforts to improve the H&M group\u2019s working capital continued during the year. Among other things, around SEK 10 billion was freed up by improved payment processes for product invoices, with the banks offering H&M Group product suppliers the opportunity to be paid earlier than the invoice due date. This arrangement is being offered to all H&M Group product suppliers and has been well received in the markets where it has been implemented to date. Most suppliers have chosen to take part. This could improve the working capital of both the H&M group and the product suppliers. Classification of the payables included in the arrangement is not affected; these amounts continue to be reported as accounts payable.\n\nThe group aims to secure financial flexibility and freedom of action on the best possible terms. The following significant financing activities were completed during the financial year:\n\nTo secure access to the bond market on the best possible terms, a credit rating from Standard & Poor\u2019s was obtained. The rating is BBB with a stable outlook.\n\nThe H&M group issued its first sustainability-linked bond. The amount was EUR 500 m with a term of 8.5 years and an annual coupon rate of 0.25 percent. The bond generated great interest and was 7.6 times oversubscribed.\n\nThe revolving credit facility opened in April 2020 for EUR 980 m was closed.\n\nThe H&M group advocates a conservative leverage ratio, aiming for a strong capital structure with good liquidity and financial flexibility.

Received interest for the parent company amounts to SEK 10 m (291), note 28.\nNotes to the financial statements\n\nCORPORATE INFORMATION\nThe parent company H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) is a limited company domiciled in Stockholm, Sweden. The parent company\u2019s corporate identity number is 556042-7220. The company\u2019s shares are listed on the Stockholm stock exchange, Nasdaq Stockholm. The group\u2019s business consists mainly of sales of clothing, accessories, footwear, cosmetics, home textiles and homeware to consumers. The company\u2019s financial year runs from 1 December to 30 November. The annual report was approved for publication by the board of directors on 25 March 2022 and will be submitted to the annual general meeting for approval on 4 May 2022.\n\nRamsbury Invest AB\u2019s holding of shares in H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB represents 48.3 percent of all shares and 74.9 percent of the total voting power. Ramsbury Invest AB (556423-5769) is thus formally the parent company of H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB.\n\n1. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\n\nBasis for preparation of the accounts\nThe consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the interpretations provided by the IFRS Interpretations Committee. Since the parent company is a company within the EU, only IFRS approved by the EU are applied. The consolidated accounts also contain disclosures in accordance with the Swedish Financial Reporting Board\u2019s recommendation RFR 1, Supplementary Accounting Rules for Groups.\n\nThe financial statements are based on historical cost, apart from certain financial instruments which are reported at fair value.\n\nThe parent company\u2019s functional currency is Swedish kronor, which is also the reporting currency for the parent company and for the group. Unless otherwise indicated, all amounts are reported in millions of Swedish kronor (SEK m).\n\nWhere relevant, accounting principles are described within each note.\n\nParent company\nThe parent company applies the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and the Swedish Financial Reporting Board\u2019s recommendation RFR 2, Accounting for Legal Entities, which essentially means that IFRS is applied. In accordance with RFR 2, the parent company does not apply IFRS 9 to the classification of financial instruments and does not capitalise development costs. The parent company will apply the exception in RFR 2 in respect of IFRS 16, which means that the principles of IFRS 16 will not be applied in the legal entity. Due to the link between reporting and taxation, year-end appropriations and untaxed reserves are reported in the parent company\u2019s financial statements.\n\nGroup contributions that the parent company receives from subsidiaries and provides to subsidiaries are reported under appropriations.\n\nChanges in accounting principles and disclosure requirements\nThe accounting principles and calculation methods applied in this report are unchanged from those used in the preparation of the annual report and consolidated financial statements for 2020 and which are described in note 1, Accounting principles.\n\nFuture accounting principles and disclosure requirements\nNo new standards, revisions or interpretations of existing standards affecting the group were published during the year that have not yet entered into force.\n\nPhase 2 of the amendments to IFRS 9, IFRS 7 and other standards relating to the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform came into force on 1 January 2021. In brief, the amendments enable companies to reflect the effects of moving from reference interest rates such as STIBOR to alternative risk-free interest rates without this giving rise to effects on financial reporting that would not provide useful information to users of financial reports.\n\nGovernment assistance in connection with the Covid 19 situation\nIAS 20 Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance \u2013 due to the extraordinary situation brought about by the pandemic the H&M group received government assistance in certain markets, mainly in respect of rents and staffing. The H&M group has chosen to report these grants as a reduction in the cost of the items to which the grants relate. The grants are reported in the income statement and balance sheet when it is reasonably certain that the grants will be received and any conditions for receiving the grants are fulfilled.\n\nEstimates, assumptions and assessments\nThe preparation of the annual report and consolidated accounts requires estimates and assumptions to be made, as well as judgments in the application of the accounting principles. These affect carrying amounts for assets, liabilities, income, expenses and supplementary information. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, other relevant factors and expectations of the future, and are reviewed regularly. The actual outcome may therefore deviate from the estimates and assumptions made. The sources of uncertainty that have been identified by H&M are the measurement of stock-in-trade, capitalised development expenditure, impairment testing of non-current assets, leases and the measurement of current and deferred tax; see notes 11, 12, 13, 15 and 16.\n\nIt is judged that, as of 30 November 2021, there are no estimates or assumptions in the financial statements that involve a significant risk of any material adjustment to the reported values of assets and liabilities in the forthcoming financial year, other than those mentioned above.\n\nConsolidated accounts\nBasis of consolidation\nThe consolidated accounts cover the parent company and its subsidiaries, and have been prepared according to the acquisition method. The financial reports for the parent company and the subsidiaries included in the consolidated accounts cover the same period and have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles that apply to the group. Intra-group income, expenses, receivables and liabilities, as well as unrealised gains and losses, are eliminated entirely in the preparation of the consolidated accounts. All companies in which the group owns or controls more than 50 percent of the votes, or in which the group alone has a controlling interest through an agreement or otherwise, are consolidated as subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are included in the consolidated accounts from the date of acquisition, which is the date on which the parent company gains a controlling interest, and are included in the consolidated accounts until such date as the controlling interest ends.\n\nAssociates\nAll companies in which the group has a significant but not a controlling interest \u2013 generally companies where the group holds 20 to 50 percent of the votes \u2013 are regarded as associates and reported according to the equity method.\n\nBusiness combinations\nIn business combinations the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are identified and classified, and these are then measured at fair value on the acquisition date. If the acquisition cost of the subsidiary\u2019s shares exceeds the calculated value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company at the time of acquisition, the difference is reported as goodwill upon consolidation. If the acquisition cost is less than the finally established value of the net identifiable assets, the difference is reported directly in the income statement. Non-controlling interests of less than 100 percent are determined for each transaction either as a proportionate share of the fair value of net identifiable assets or at fair value. Transaction costs associated with acquisitions are not included in the acquisition cost; instead these are expensed immediately.\n\nTranslation of foreign subsidiaries\nThe companies making up the group present their financial statements in the currency used in the economic environment in which the company concerned mainly operates, known as the functional currency. These statements form the basis of the consolidated accounts. The consolidated accounts are presented in Swedish kronor, which is the\nCont. Note 1 Accounting principles\n\nparent company\u2019s functional currency and reporting currency. Assets and liabilities in foreign subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate on the closing date, while the income statement is translated at the average exchange rate for the financial year. The translation difference arising from this, and also as a result of the fact that the net investment is translated at a different exchange rate at the end of the financial year than at the beginning of the financial year, is posted directly to equity as a translation reserve via the statement of comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign business the accumulated translation differences in the income statement are posted together with the profit or loss on disposal.\n\nForeign currency\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the closing date. Exchange rate differences arising on translation are reported in the income statement with the exception of exchange rate differences in respect of loans, which are to be regarded as net investment in a foreign operation. Exchange rate differences of this type are posted to equity as translation differences via the statement of comprehensive income. Exchange rate differences relating to loans in foreign currency taken out to hedge net investments in foreign operations are also recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nInterest income\n\nInterest income is recognised as it is earned.\n\nOther provisions\n\nProvisions are reported in the balance sheet when there is an obligation as a result of an event that has occurred and it is likely that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.\n\nCash flow statement\n\nThe cash flow statement is prepared according to the indirect method. The reported cash flow covers only transactions involving payments in or out.\n\n2. FINANCIAL RISKS\n\nThe group\u2019s financing and management of financial risk is carried out centrally within the group\u2019s finance department in accordance with a financial policy established by the board of directors. The financial policy is the most important financial control tool for the company\u2019s financial activities and establishes the framework within which the company acts. The group\u2019s accounting principles for financial instruments, including derivatives, are described in note 21.\n\nIn the course of doing business the group is exposed to risk associated with financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and loans. The group also executes transactions involving currency derivatives for the purpose of managing currency risk that arises in the course of the group\u2019s business.\n\nThe risks relating to these instruments are primarily the following:\n\n- interest rate risk associated with liabilities to credit institutions, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments;\n- currency risk associated with flows and with financial assets in foreign currencies;\n- credit risk and counterparty risk associated with financial assets and derivative positions;\n- liquidity risk and financing risk relating to liquidity and cash flow as well as financing and refinancing of the group\u2019s capital requirements.\n\nInterest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk that earnings or the fair value of assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. The group\u2019s exposure to risk from changes in interest rates relates to cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and liabilities to credit institutions and for finance leases. The original term of the investments is up to three months as of the closing date. The financial policy permits investments of up to two years. The group\u2019s cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of the closing date amounted to SEK 27,471 m (16,540). As of the closing date, loans and leases amounted to SEK 66,691 m (80,065). An interest rate increase of 1 percentage point on these amounts would increase interest income from cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments by SEK 176 m (165), and would increase interest expense for external borrowing and finance leases by SEK 450 m (906). A corresponding decrease in the interest rate would reduce interest income by the same amount and would decrease interest expense related to liabilities to credit institutions and for leases.\n\nThe group\u2019s exposure to the reform of interbank offered rates (IBOR) is limited. As of 30 November 2021 there are no drawn credit facilities that refer to IBOR.\n\nCurrency risk\n\nThere is a risk that fluctuations in exchange rates will have an adverse effect on the company\u2019s financial position, profitability and cash flow. H&M is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates via transaction exposure and translation exposure. Transaction exposure arises when sales and purchases are made in currencies other than the company\u2019s reporting currency. Translation exposure arises when subsidiaries\u2019 results, assets, liabilities and equity are translated into SEK, the group\u2019s reporting currency.\n\nCurrency exposure associated with financial instruments\n\nH&M\u2019s currency risk associated with financial instruments is mainly related to financial investments, accounts payable and derivatives. The group\u2019s accounts payable in foreign currencies are mainly handled in Sweden and are largely hedged through forward contracts. Based on this, a 10 percent change in the value of the Swedish krona in relation to other currencies would have an insignificant momentary effect on profit related to financial instrument holdings as of the closing date. A 10 percent strengthening of the Swedish krona would have a positive effect on the hedging reserve in equity of around SEK 849 m (1,903) before taking into account the tax effect, of which SEK 1,590 m (1,451) relates to EUR and SEK 2,254 m (758) to USD. The group\u2019s exposure to outstanding derivative instruments is reported in note 21.\n\nThe group\u2019s operating result for the year was affected by net exchange rate differences relating to flows of goods in the amount of SEK -120 m (-1,279).\n\nTransaction exposure associated with commercial flows\n\nPayment flows in the form of payments in foreign currencies for accounts receivable and payable expose the group to currency risk. To manage currency risk relating to changes in exchange rates, the group hedges its currency risk within the framework of the financial policy. Currency risk exposure is managed at a central level. A large share of the group\u2019s sales are made in euros, while the group\u2019s most significant purchase currencies are the US dollar and the euro. Fluctuation in the US dollar/euro exchange rate is the single largest transaction exposure within the group. To hedge the flows of goods in foreign currencies and thereby reduce the effects of future exchange rate fluctuations, the group\u2019s purchases of goods and the bulk of related forecast inflows from the sales companies are fully hedged under forward contracts on an ongoing basis. The average term of outstanding forward contracts is around three months. All derivatives have an original maturity of less than one year.\n\nTranslation exposure on consolidation of entities outside Sweden\n\nIn addition to the effects of transaction exposure, profits are also affected by translation effects as a result of changes in exchange rates for the local currencies of the various foreign subsidiaries against the Swedish krona, compared to the same period the previous year. The underlying profit/loss in a market may be unchanged in the local currency, but when converted into SEK may increase if the Swedish krona has weakened or decrease if the Swedish krona has strengthened. Translation effects also affect the group\u2019s net assets on consolidation of the foreign subsidiaries\u2019 balance sheets (translation exposure in the balance sheet). Where the remeasurement of balance sheet items affects the group\u2019s income statement, such as in the case of intragroup liabilities and short-term intragroup receivables, these are to be fully hedged. Net investment in foreign currency may be hedged in full or in part through a liability in the same currency, known as an equity hedge. As of 30 November 2021 certain portions of net investments are hedged in this way. The purpose of the hedging is to protect \u2013 in the group\u2019s consolidated accounts \u2013 the majority of the value of net investments in EUR from EUR/SEK exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nCredit risk and counterparty risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk that H&M\u2019s counterparties will be unable to meet their commitments and thus cause losses for the H&M group. Financial credit risk arises primarily as counterparty risk in the form of investments or cash and\nThe strategy for the H&M group\u2019s liquidity planning and financing is to maintain good payment capacity and to identify and cover liquidity needs arising in the group. Liquidity and financing risks are regulated in the H&M group\u2019s financial policy, which states that loans are to have an evenly distributed maturity structure and that cash and undrawn credit facilities are to cover the company\u2019s forecast short-term liquidity needs.\n\nAs of 30 November 2021 the group had interest-bearing liabilities of SEK 9,614 m (16,332) in the form of loans from credit institutions and commercial papers. In addition, the group has undrawn credit facilities of SEK 15,778 m (30,056). The average maturity of interest-bearing liabilities and undrawn credit facilities was 5.6 (2.1) years. A maturity analysis for outstanding interest-bearing liabilities and undrawn credit facilities is given below.\n\n### Climate risk\nClimate change has been identified as one of the H&M group\u2019s major risks. A climate risk analysis according to the guidelines from TCFD has been performed in which it has been concluded that climate change may influence customer attitudes and purchasing patterns, production costs as well as raw material availability and price. The H&M group is continuously developing programs for risk mitigation, where a very ambitious climate strategy and goals are major components.\n\nThe most significant financial risks resulting from climate change are connected to possible impact on sales and or product costs. Climate risks are currently not expected to have other significant impact on the financial statements in the H&M group. During 2021 climate change has not been assessed to be a significant source of uncertainty in the estimates, assumptions and assessments made in preparation of the annual report and consolidated accounts, see section Estimates, assumptions and assessments above.\n\n### 3. SEGMENT REPORTING\nThe group\u2019s business consists mainly of sales of clothing, accessories, footwear, cosmetics, home textiles and home ware to consumers. Internal follow-up is carried out on a country-by-country basis by the CEO, who is the group\u2019s chief operating decision maker. Each country is thus an operating segment. The various countries sell similar products via similar sales channels to similar customers, however. Goods purchasing is carried out collectively for the group. Some countries have similar economic characteristics, such as long-term economic results. In view of this, the countries may be combined in segment reporting in accordance with IFRS 8. The H&M group has combined countries to form the segments Asia & Oceania, Europe & Africa, and North & South America. The parent company and subsidiaries with no external sales are reported separately under Group Functions. The same accounting principles are applied to segment reporting as in the consolidated accounts. Transactions between segments take place on normal commercial terms.\n\n### 2021 2020\n\n| YEAR | COMMERCIAL PAPERS | BONDS (EMTN) | LOANS FROM CREDIT INSTITUTIONS | UNDRAWN CREDIT FACILITIES |\n|------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| 2022 | 275               | \u2013           | 161                           | \u2013                        |\n| 2023 | \u2013                 | \u2013           | 2,051                         | 8,000                    |\n| 2024 | \u2013                 | \u2013           | \u2013                             | 7,178                    |\n| 2025 | \u2013                 | \u2013           | \u2013                             | \u2013                        |\n| 2026 | \u2013                 | \u2013           | \u2013                             | \u2013                        |\n| 2027 | \u2013                 | \u2013           | \u2013                             | \u2013                        |\n| 2028 | \u2013                 | \u2013           | \u2013                             | \u2013                        |\n| 2029 | \u2013                 | 5,127       | \u2013                             | \u2013                        |\n| Total SEK m | 275 | 5,127 | 4,212 | 15,178 |\n\nAs of 30 November 2021, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were SEK 27,471 m (16,540).

NET SALES\n\nThe group\u2019s income is generated mainly by the sale of clothing, accessories, footwear, cosmetics, home textiles and homeware to consumers. The customers are mainly private individuals, with the same prices applying to all customers. Any price reductions are general and not directed to any specific individual. Sales revenues are reported as net sales in the income statement, i.e. sales revenue less value-added tax, returns and discounts. Revenue from both store and online sales is reported in conjunction with sale delivery to the customer and is based on the country in which the store is located or the online customer lives. All revenue is recognised at the time of delivery. In the case of store sales, therefore, the transaction price is due for payment immediately when the customer makes the purchase and receives the product in the store. In the case of online sales this principle means that revenue is reported at the time of delivery, which is the date on which control of the goods is transferred to the customer.\n\nThe right to return goods is, as a minimum, in accordance with the local rules in the country concerned. Based on historical data and best estimates, a returns reserve and a right of return asset are calculated which are reported as a current liability as well as a reduction in net sales in the income statement, i.e. sales revenue less Other current liabilities and Stock-in-trade.\n\nThe payment terms are the same for all customers paying in cash or by card and the amount of remuneration is not variable. In certain markets mainly online the group collaborates with an external partner to offer payment terms that allow later payment against invoice, usually after 30 days. Gift cards are offered in many countries and generally give rise to a liability in the country concerned with effect from the date of purchase. Revenue is then recognised when the card is used or expires.\n\nFranchise sales have two components: sales of goods to franchisees, which are reported on delivery of the goods, and franchise fees, which are reported when the franchisee sells goods to the consumer.\n\nThe points that members of the H&M loyalty programme can earn and in the future use in the form of discounts represent a right that they would not have without entering into this agreement. Points earned that have not been used are reported as a current liability as well as a reduction in revenue in order to correspond to the future reduction in revenue that arises when the points issued are used to obtain discounts. Revenue is recognised when the points are used or when they expire 12 months after being earned. The group applies the practical expedient not to disclose information about remaining performance obligations since these are thus part of contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less. The liability is based on fair value calculated per outstanding point.\n\nThe group\u2019s income exhibits seasonal variations. The first quarter of the financial year is normally the weakest and the last quarter the strongest.\n5. REVENUE FROM GROUP COMPANIES\n\nThe parent company\u2019s internal sales consist of royalties of SEK 3,914 m (3,502) and other income of SEK 39 m (50) from group companies.\n\n6. COSTS BY TYPE\n\nCosts for the group are allocated to three functions: cost of goods sold, selling expenses and administrative expenses. The cost of goods sold includes all costs of designing, producing and transporting the goods to distribution centres. Examples of costs included in this, other than the pure sourcing cost of the products, are shipping, customs duties, environmental levies, payroll and the cost of premises for the buying department, IT costs related to buying and logistics as well as handling costs in the distribution centres and shipping costs from warehouses to stores. Selling expenses include store expenses such as salaries and rents, marketing costs, handling costs in replenishment centres for stores, shipping costs to online customers, IT costs related to stores and sales, as well as central support functions related to sales. The item administrative expenses includes the costs of other central support functions, such as salaries, rents and IT costs for administrative systems.\n\nFor information on payroll see note 7, and for depreciation and amortisation see note 9.\n\n7.

Board fees were paid as follows:\n\n- Karl-Johan Persson, chair: SEK 1,700,000\n- Stina Bergfors: SEK 650,000\n- Anders Dahlvig: SEK 825,000\n- Lena Pattriksson Keller: SEK 650,000\n- Christian Sievert: SEK 875,000\n- Erica Wiking H\u00e4ger: SEK 825,000\n- Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m: SEK 650,000\n- Danica Kragic Jensfelt: SEK 650,000\n\nThe fees were paid as resolved at the 2020 AGM. This means that the fees related to the period until the next AGM was held, i.e. the period 7 May 2020 to 6 May 2021. The amounts were paid out after the 2021 AGM.\n\nAs of the AGM on 6 May 2021 the board consists of eight ordinary members elected by the AGM. There are also three employee representatives, with three deputies for these positions. Eight members of the board are women and six are men. Six of the 14 are employed by the company.\n\nBoard member Lena Pattriksson Keller is the majority shareholder in Pattriksson Group AB, which had business dealings with H&M during the year. The transactions took place on market terms and remuneration for 2021 amounted to SEK 6.4 m (3.0). Outstanding balances as of 30 November 2021 totalled SEK 0.3 m (0.1). Erica Wiking H\u00e4ger is a partner at the law firm Mannheimer Swartling, which had business dealings with H&M during the year. The transactions took place on market terms and remuneration for 2021 amounted to SEK 19.4 m (4.2). Outstanding balances as of 30 November 2021 totalled SEK 0.1 m (0.0).\n\nRemuneration of senior executives\n\nRemuneration of senior executives is based on guidelines adopted annually by the AGM; see the administration report on pages 59\u201367.\n\nRemuneration of the chief executive officer\n\nRemuneration paid to the CEO during the 2021 financial year in the form of salary and benefits amounted to SEK 14.2 m (12.2). In addition, the CEO received variable remuneration of SEK 7.1 m (0) in respect of the 2021 financial year that was paid and expensed in the first quarter of 2022. Pension benefits for the CEO are covered by a defined contribution plan and by the ITP plan. The combined pension expenses shall amount in total to 30 percent of the CEO\u2019s fixed salary. Pension expenses amounted to SEK 4.3 m (4.1). The retirement age for the CEO is 65.\n\nDuring the comparative year Helena Helmersson salary SEK 10.9 m, pension SEK 3.4 m; took over from Karl-Johan Persson salary SEK 13 m, pension SEK 0.7 m.\n\nThe CEO is entitled to a 12 month period of notice. In the event that the company cancels the CEO\u2019s employment contract, the CEO will also receive severance pay of a year\u2019s salary. The CEO\u2019s terms of employment are determined by the board of directors.\n\nPension for a former CEO\n\nA former CEO retired on 1 September 2009. The total pension commitments recognised as liabilities, based on the fact that for the first three years of retirement the person received a pension equivalent to 65 percent of fixed salary and thereafter receives a lifelong pension equivalent to 50 percent of the same salary, amount to SEK 125.6 m (135.4). The change in the year\u2019s pension commitments recognised as liabilities includes actuarial losses of SEK 3.2 m (actuarial gains of SEK 11.1 m). Pension costs for the former CEO are included under \u201cof which pensions to board, CEO, executive management\u201d.\n\nRemuneration of the executive management team\n\nIn addition to the CEO, as of 30 November 2021 the executive management comprised 14 (14) individuals, six of whom are women. In addition to the CEO, the executive management team consists of the CFO, the two people with responsibility for Business Ventures, the two people with responsibility for Portfolio Brands, the person with responsibility for Business Tech, the CTO and the heads of the following group functions: Expansion, Strategy & Transformation, Human Resources, Sustainability, Supply Chain, Communications and The Laboratory.\n\nRemuneration paid to members of the executive management team, other than the CEO, during the 2021 financial year in the form of salary and benefits amounted to SEK 53.7 m (68.5). In addition, members of the executive management team, other than the CEO, received variable remuneration of SEK 14.9 m (0) in respect of the 2021 financial year that was paid and expensed in the first quarter of 2022. Pension expenses relating to the executive management team during the year amounted to...\nThe contribution to HIP for a financial year is expensed in the year to which it relates. For example, if profit after tax in year 1 is 100 and profit after tax in year 2 is 130, then the contribution is 3 and will be expensed in year 2.\n\nThere is a ceiling that limits the size of the contribution when the increase in profit between two years may be deemed disproportionately large. The ceiling has been set at 2 percent of profit for the year after tax before any contribution to HIP.\n\nThe contributions to the foundation are to be invested in H&M shares. H&M has no other commitments beyond this.\n\nIn the consolidated accounts the costs of the incentive programme are recognised in accordance with the rules on short-term profit-sharing and bonus schemes set out in IAS 19. The expense is recognised when the amount has been established and an obligation exists. The amount is transferred to the foundation during the next financial year.\n\nFor 2021 a contribution of SEK 224 m was made to the incentive programme, based on the principle for contributions to HIP adopted at the 2013 AGM and described above.\n\n### 8.

TAX\n\nIncome taxes in the income statement represent current and deferred tax payable by Swedish and foreign subsidiaries. Current tax is tax that will be paid or received in respect of the current year as well as adjustments to current tax attributable to previous periods. The income tax rate in force in each country is applied.\n\nDeferred tax is calculated according to the balance sheet method based on temporary differences arising between reported and fiscal values of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is calculated using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the receivables or liabilities are settled, based on the tax rates and the tax legislation in force on the closing date. A deferred tax liability is recognised for all temporary differences unless it relates to goodwill or to an asset or a liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of acquisition, affects neither the reported nor taxable profit or loss for the period. Also, temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and associates are taken into account only to the extent it is likely that the temporary difference will be reversed in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets for temporary differences and loss carryforwards are recognised only to the extent it is likely that these will be able to be utilised.\n\nThe carrying amounts of deferred tax assets are tested as of each closing date and reduced where it is no longer deemed likely that they will be able to be utilised.\n\nGlobal companies such as H&M are sometimes involved in tax proceedings of varying extent and at different stages. The H&M group continually evaluates tax proceedings in progress. Where it is likely that additional tax will have to be paid and the outcome can be reasonably estimated, the necessary reserve is made. As of the closing date, tax proceedings relating to internal pricing are in progress in some countries. The H&M group has made an assessment of the likely outcome and reserved the tax expense concerned. As of the closing date, this reserve totalled SEK 513 m (378). This assessment took account of aspects such as whether agreements on double taxation exist and whether there are differences between the tax rates in different countries.\nRecognised deferred tax assets relate to:\n\n|                        | GROUP 2021 | GROUP 2020 | PARENT COMPANY 2021 | PARENT COMPANY 2020 |\n|------------------------|------------|------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Stock-in-trade         | 363        | 194        | -                    | -                    |\n| Loss carryforwards in subsidiaries | 73         | 995        | -                    | -                    |\n| Pension provisions     | 112        | 153        | 86                   | 80                   |\n| Intangible non-current assets | 182       | 193        | -                    | -                    |\n| Property, plant and equipment | 1,185     | 694        | -                    | -                    |\n| Rent-related provisions | 1,906      | 2,046      | -                    | -                    |\n| Hedging reserves       | 144        | -          | -                    | -                    |\n| Other temporary differences | 1,661     | 1,438      | -                    | -                    |\n| **Total**              | 5,626      | 5,713      | 86                   | 80                   |\n\nRecognised deferred tax liabilities relate to:\n\n|                        | GROUP 2021 | GROUP 2020 | PARENT COMPANY 2021 | PARENT COMPANY 2020 |\n|------------------------|------------|------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Stock-in-trade         | 172        | 177        | -                    | -                    |\n| Intangible non-current assets | 1,178     | 1,382      | -                    | -                    |\n| Property, plant and equipment | 1,853     | 2,030      | -                    | -                    |\n| Rent-related provisions | 112        | 97         | -                    | -                    |\n| Hedging reserves       | 119        | 76         | -                    | -                    |\n| Other temporary differences | 167       | 226        | -                    | -                    |\n| **Total**              | 3,601      | 3,988      | -                    | -                    |\n\nAs of the closing date, the group has no loss carryforwards that are not represented by recognised deferred tax assets. The portion of loss carryforwards with a limited utilisation period is not material.\n12. INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nIntangible assets with a finite useful life are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment. Amortisation is distributed on a straight-line basis over the assets\u2019 expected useful life.\n\nDevelopment expenditure is capitalised to the extent that it is judged that the company will derive future financial benefits and if the cost can be reliably calculated. The carrying amount includes direct costs for acquired services, costs for payroll and materials as well as indirect costs attributable to the asset. Other development costs, as well as maintenance and training initiatives, are recognised as expenses in the income statement as they arise.\n\nGoodwill is the amount by which the cost of the subsidiary\u2019s shares exceeds the estimated value of the subsidiary\u2019s net identifiable assets upon acquisition. Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is reported as an intangible asset. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, including goodwill, are tested for impairment annually or more often if there is an indication of a decline in value. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the recoverable amount the higher of the net realisable value and the value in use, an impairment loss is applied for the necessary amount. Any impairment is recognised in profit or loss.\n\nCapitalised development expenditure refers mainly to IT-related investments. Amortisation has commenced for those parts that were taken into use during 2013\u20132021, corresponding to around 96 percent of the capitalised development expenditure. Those projects that are not yet ready for use are tested for impairment annually and no impairment has been identified. Systems that are no longer in use with an original cost of SEK 25 m (1,283) have been written off entirely.\n\nGoodwill arose through the acquisition in 2008 of the company Fabricon Scandinavien AB, which is a cash-generating unit. H&M acquired the remaining 40 percent of the shares in Fabricon Scandinavien AB at the end of November 2010.\n\nA goodwill impairment test was carried out at the end of 2021. Significant assumptions used when testing goodwill for impairment are sales development and gross margin. The impairment test is based on a calculation of value in use. The value in use has been calculated based on discounted cash flows according to forecasts for the next five years and with an annual growth rate of 2 percent (2) in subsequent years. A discount rate of 11.5 percent (14) before tax was used. The cash flows are based on H&M\u2019s business plan. The growth rate of 2 percent (2) is based on H&M\u2019s assessment of the opportunities and risks associated with the business. The discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital that is estimated to be on a par with the external requirements that the market imposes for similar companies. No impairment was identified and in H&M\u2019s judgment, reasonably possible changes in the variables above would not have such a significant impact that the recoverable amount would be reduced to a lower amount than the carrying amount.\nExpenditure relating to property, plant and equipment are reported in the balance sheet if it is likely that the company will derive future financial benefits associated with the asset and if the asset\u2019s cost can be reliably calculated. Other expenditure as well as expenditure relating to ongoing maintenance and repair are reported as an expense in the period in which they arise. Property, plant and equipment are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment. Depreciation is distributed on a straight-line basis over the assets\u2019 expected useful life. No depreciation is applied to land. The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment is tested when there is an indication of possible impairment. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the recoverable amount (the higher of the net realisable value and the value in use), an impairment loss is applied for the necessary amount. Any impairment is recognised in profit/loss, mainly as selling expenses. The general approach is that each store represents a cash-generating unit for impairment testing purposes. Impairment of non-current assets as a result of impairment testing for 2021 amounts to SEK 115 m (263). In addition to this, impairment of non-current assets as a result of future store closures amounts to SEK 305 m (118).\n\nFor right-of-use assets relating to leases, see note 15.\n\n|                      | GROUP | PARENT COMPANY |\n|----------------------|-------|----------------|\n|                      | 2021  | 2020  | 2021  | 2020  |\n| **Buildings**        |       |       |       |       |\n| Opening cost         | 1,134 | 1,179 | 235   | 235   |\n| Acquisitions during the year | -     | -     | -     | -     |\n| Sales/disposals      | 0     | 19    | -     | -     |\n| Translation effects  | 22    | -26   | -     | -     |\n| Closing cost         | 1,156 | 1,134 | 235   | 235   |\n| Opening depreciation | -539  | -521  | -110  | -103  |\n| Sales/disposals      | -     | 6     | -     | -     |\n| Depreciation for the year | -33   | -36   | -6    | -7    |\n| Translation effects  | -14   | 12    | -     | -     |\n| Closing accumulated depreciation | -586  | -539  | -116  | -110  |\n| Closing book value   | 570   | 595   | 119   | 125   |\n| **Land**             |       |       |       |       |\n| Opening cost         | 150   | 154   | 7     | 7     |\n| Acquisitions during the year | -     | -     | -     | -     |\n| Sales/disposals      | -     | -     | -     | -     |\n| Translation effects  | 4     | -4    | -     | -     |\n| Closing cost         | 154   | 150   | 7     | 7     |\n### 14.

LEASES\n\nBackground and scope\nUnder IFRS 16, a lease is an agreement that controls the right to use an identifiable asset during a given period against payment. The majority of the contracts that H&M classifies as leases in accordance with IFRS 16 are leases for store premises where the group runs its own operations. Contracts for offices and warehouses used by the group are also classified as leases. In accordance with IFRS 16, a lease liability and a right-of-use asset are calculated for the contracts included. The lease liability is measured initially at the present value of the future lease payments discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, and in subsequent periods by increasing the liability to reflect the effect of interest and reducing it to reflect the effect of lease payments made. The right-of-use asset is measured initially at the value of the lease liability and in subsequent periods at cost less depreciation and impairment. Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the estimated lease term. In accordance with the standard, the lease liability is calculated based on fixed lease payments. Variable lease payments, such as sales-based rent, are not included in the lease liability. Property tax is a variable expense and is therefore also not included in the lease liability. The group has decided to apply the option to exclude leases of low value and leases with a term of less than 12 months. These will therefore not be included in the lease liability but instead will continue to be reported as rental costs, expensed on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. The company has no sale and leaseback transactions.\n\nSome leases contain clauses concerning restoration of the premises; the effect of this is not material for the group.\n\nThe H&M group has around 4,800 stores as well as multiple offices and warehouses all around the world. Applying the standard has required estimates and assumptions, such as establishing the term of the lease and an interest rate for borrowing. The assumption that has the greatest effect on the size of the lease liability is the assessment of the lease term. On the expiry of the lease term the lease may be terminated entirely, renegotiated or extended depending on the provisions in the contract. In certain circumstances, a right to terminate the contract during the lease term may reduce the lease term used for the calculation. The option to extend is taken into account if it is reasonably certain that the lessee will exercise this option. It is rare for a lease to be terminated before the lease term has expired. To facilitate assessment of the lease term used to calculate the lease obligation according to IFRS 16, the assumptions are based on the type of contract. The assumptions used to establish the lease term for each type of contract are based on the best possible assessment and on historical data, as well as the current market situation. The group\u2019s assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis taking into account changes in the industry. The discount rate used for the calculation corresponds to the H&M group\u2019s incremental borrowing rate, taking into account aspects such as country and length of the respective leases. The rate is updated annually.\n\nCovid-19\nThe H&M group has chosen not to apply the amendment to IFRS 16 that allows for rent concessions attributable to Covid-19.\n\nImpact on the financial statements\nThe introduction of IFRS 16 has had significant effects on the financial statements. The introduction of IFRS 16 increased operating profit, since a portion of the lease expenses are instead recognised as interest expense on lease liabilities and depreciation of right-of-use assets. Interest expense and depreciation have therefore increased. The cash flow effect to which this contributes is an increase in cash flow from operating activities, while cash flow from financing activities has decreased by a corresponding amount because the repayment portion of the lease payments is reported as an outgoing payment in financing activities. The group is reporting a cash outflow for leases of SEK 12,279 m (14,174) for the 2021 financial year.\n\nThe amounts attributable to leasing activities that were recognised in the income statement during the year are presented below:\n\n| GROUP | SEK M |\n|-------|-------|\n| 2021  | 2020  |\n| Depreciation of right-of-use assets | 12,044 | 13,941 |\n| Interest expense for lease liabilities | 779 | 951 |\n| Expense for variable lease payments | 5,605 | 5,326 |\n| Lease terminations, effect on results | 2,078 | 1,993 |\n| Total expense attributable to leasing activities | 20,507 | 22,211 |\n\nCosts relating to short-term leases and leases where the underlying asset is of low value are not included in the presentation above since these do not amount to a material sum for the group.\n\nRight-of-use assets and lease liability under IFRS 16\nThe group divides its leases into three classes of right-of-use asset: Stores, Warehouses and Offices. The table below presents the closing balances for right-of-use assets and lease liabilities along with changes during the year.\n\n| RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS | WAREHOUSES | STORES | OFFICES | TOTAL | LEASE LIABILITY |\n|---------------------|------------|--------|---------|-------|----------------|\n| Opening balance 1 Dec 2020 | 52,541 | 3,645 | 3,349 | 59,534 | 63,733 |\n| Leases added | 2,991 | 803 | -40 | 3,754 | 4,319 |\n| Depreciation of right-of-use assets | 10,666 | 600 | -778 | 12,044 |\n| Translation of differences | 1,616 | 125 | 100 | 1,841 | 2,033 |\n| Interest expense for lease liability | | | | 779 |\n| Lease payments | | | | -13,788 |\n| Closing balance 30 Nov 2021 | 46,481 | 3,973 | 2,631 | 53,085 | 57,076 |\n\nA maturity analysis of the group\u2019s lease liabilities included in IFRS 16 as of 30 November 2021 is presented below:\n\n| RENTAL COMMITMENTS SEK M | 2021 | 2020 |\n|--------------------------|------|------|\n| In next 12 months | 11,698 | 13,275 |\n| In next one to three years | 15,308 | 17,660 |\n| In next three to five years | 8,298 | 9,461 |\n| More than five years ahead | 21,768 | 23,337 |\n| Total | 57,072 | 63,733 |\n16. STOCK IN TRADE\n\nThe stock-in-trade, which consists of merchandise, is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost refers to the company\u2019s expenses for acquiring the goods including customs duties and shipping. The net realisable value is the estimated market value less calculated selling expenses. From the moment the goods are transferred from the supplier to the transport service provider appointed by H&M, the goods are owned according to civil law by H&M and become part of H&M\u2019s reported stock-in-trade. Goods that have not yet arrived at a store are valued at their actual purchase cost including the estimated cost of customs duties and shipping.\n\nFor the majority of the group\u2019s goods, cost is calculated as weighted average prices; for other stock accounting, the carrying amount is calculated as the selling price less the estimated gross margin (the retail method). The group is continuing to gradually move across to calculating cost as weighted average prices, but this change has no material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nStock-in-trade amounted to SEK 37,306 m (38,209), a 2.4 percent decrease in SEK compared with the same point in time last year. In local currencies there was a 2.5 percent decrease.\n\nSignificant write-downs are rare. There were no material write-downs in the current financial year or the previous financial year. Only an insignificant part of the stock-in-trade is valued at net realisable value. The group\u2019s asset for rights of return does not increase stock-in-trade by a material amount. There is deemed to be no material obsolescence in the stock-in-trade.\n\nThe stock-in-trade amounted to 20.8 percent (21.9) of net sales.\n\n17. PREPAID EXPENSES\n\n|                      | GROUP 2021 | GROUP 2020 | PARENT COMPANY 2021 | PARENT COMPANY 2020 |\n|----------------------|------------|------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Prepaid rent         | 2,884      | 2,232      |                      |                      |\n| Other items          | 1,923      | 1,208      | 90                   | 57                   |\n| **Total**            | **4,807**  | **3,440**  | **90**               | **57**               |\n\n18. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash and bank balances as well as short-term investments with a maximum term of three months from the date of acquisition. These investments carry no significant risk of changes in value.\n\n|                      | GROUP 2021 | GROUP 2020 | PARENT COMPANY 2021 | PARENT COMPANY 2020 |\n|----------------------|------------|------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Cash and bank balances | 24,836     | 15,580     |                      |                      |\n| Short-term investments | 2,635      | 960        |                      |                      |\n| 0\u20133 months           |            |            |                      |                      |\n| **Total**            | **27,471** | **16,540** |                      |                      |\n\nInvestments are made on market terms and the interest rates are between 0.6 and 16.4 percent. The difference in interest rate depends mainly on the currency in which the funds are invested.\n\n19. SHARE CAPITAL\n\nThe share capital is divided between 194,400,000 class A shares (10 votes per share) and 1,460,672,000 class B shares (one vote per share). There are no other differences between the rights associated with the shares. The total number of shares is 1,655,072,000. In the 2021 financial year a dividend of SEK 10,757,968,000 was distributed.\n\nThe group\u2019s managed capital consists of shareholders\u2019 equity. The group\u2019s goal with respect to managing the capital is to enable good growth to continue and to be prepared to exploit business opportunities. The board of directors\u2019 intention is to continue to provide shareholders with a good direct return while ensuring that, as in the past, expansion and investments in the business can proceed with a continued strong financial position and freedom of action. Based on this, the board of directors has established a dividend policy stating that the dividend is to exceed 50 percent of profit after tax, but taking into consideration the capital structure target. The dividend will be split into two instalments, one paid in the spring and one in the autumn.\n\n20. PROVISIONS FOR PENSIONS\n\nThe H&M group has several different plans for benefits after employment has ended. The plans are either defined benefit or defined contribution plans. Defined contribution plans are reported as an expense in the period when the employee performs the service to which the benefit relates. Defined benefit plans are assessed separately for each plan based on the benefits earned during the previous and current periods. The defined benefit obligations less the fair value of any managed assets are reported under the heading Provisions for pensions. In the case of the Swedish entities, the actuarial calculations also cover future payments of special payroll tax. Defined benefit plans are primarily found in Sweden, but also in the UK, Norway, Switzerland, Spain and Germany. Pension obligations are assessed annually with the help of independent actuaries according to the Projected Unit Credit Method. The assessment is made using actuarial assumptions. These assumptions include such things as the discount rate, mortality, anticipated salary and pension increases as well as the expected return on managed assets. Changes in the actuarial assumptions and outcomes that deviate from the assumptions give rise to actuarial gains or losses. The actuarial gains and losses arising are mainly due to the financial assumptions, such as changes in the discount rate. Such gains or losses are recognised in other comprehensive income in the year they arise.\n\nFor salaried employees in Sweden, the H&M group applies the ITP plan through insurance policies with Alecta and Collectum, i.e. ITP 2 and ITP 1. According to statement UFR 10 from the Swedish Financial Reporting Board, the ITP 2 plan is a defined benefit plan that covers a number of employers. The plan will be reported as a defined contribution plan until the company gains access to information that allows this plan to be reported according to the rules for defined benefit plans. The ITP 1 plan is a defined contribution plan. See also note 7 for information on pension to a former CEO.\n\nAlecta\u2019s surplus cannot be allocated to the insured employer and/or the insured employees. As of 30 September 2021, Alecta\u2019s consolidation ratio was 169 percent (144). The consolidation ratio is calculated as the fair value of managed assets as a percentage of the obligations calculated in accordance with Alecta\u2019s actuarial assumptions. This calculation is not in line with IAS 19.\nCont.

On the liabilities side are accounts payable, liabilities to credit institutions and derivatives. Financial instruments are reported in the balance sheet when the group becomes party to the contractual terms of the instrument. Financial assets are removed from the balance sheet when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset cease. Financial liabilities are removed from the balance sheet when the obligation is met, cancelled or ends. For lease liabilities see note 15.\n\nFinancial instruments are measured based on inputs classified in accordance with IFRS 13:\n\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, such as shares or bonds listed on a stock exchange.\n\nLevel 2: Inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly such as quoted prices or indirectly (obtained from quoted prices), such as currency forwards or interest rate swaps.\n\nLevel 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not entirely based on observable market data.\n\nClassification and subsequent recognition\n\nAt the date of acquisition the financial instruments are classified in the categories below.\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nIn view of the strategic nature of the interests, assets in this category \u2013 mainly Klarna and Renewcell \u2013 are revalued in other comprehensive income as well as in financial assets in the balance sheet. The valuation of Renewcell is based on the share price as of 30 November 2021 level 1. The valuation of Klarna is based on the latest performed funding round in Klarna level 3.\n\nFinancial assets measured at amortised cost\n\nAssets in this category are measured at amortised cost less any provision for impairment. This category primarily covers cash and bank balances as well as accounts receivable. Cash and bank balances are measured at amortised cost. The group\u2019s own credit operations were wound up during the year and are now managed through collaboration with an external party. Bad debts during the year from accounts receivable were insignificant. This category also includes assets with payment flows that are fixed or that can be established in advance and with a fixed term which the group has the express intention and capacity to hold until maturity. These assets are measured at amortised cost, with the effective interest rate being used to calculate the value. As of the closing date, all of the group\u2019s short-term investments fell into this category.\n\nFinancial liabilities measured at amortised cost\n\nThis category includes financial liabilities that are not held for trading. These are initially recognised at fair value, net after transaction costs, and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method, which means that the estimated change in value (the effective interest) is recognised as interest income or interest expense in the income statement. Accounts payable fall into this category. These have a short expected term and are recognised at the nominal amount with no discounting. Liabilities to credit institutions are measured at amortised cost. All of the liabilities stated below under financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost and do not deviate significantly from the fair values.\n\nHedging instruments\n\nCurrency derivatives are measured at fair value based on Level 2 inputs in the IFRS 13 hierarchy. As of 30 November 2021, forward contracts with a positive market value amount to SEK 1,422 m (992), which is reported under other current receivables. Forward contracts with a negative market value amount to SEK 1,015 m (590), which is reported under other current liabilities. Other financial assets and liabilities have short terms. The fair values of these financial instruments are assessed to be approximately equal to their book values.\n\nReporting of derivatives used for hedging purposes\n\nAll derivatives are reported initially and subsequently at fair value in the balance sheet.\n\nThe group\u2019s policy is for derivatives to be held for hedging purposes only. Derivatives comprise forward currency contracts used to hedge the risk of exchange rate fluctuations for internal and external flows of goods.\n\nTo meet the requirements of hedge accounting there must be a clear link to the hedged item. In addition, the hedge must effectively protect the hedged item, hedge documentation must have been prepared and the effectiveness must be measurable.\n\nIn hedge accounting, derivatives are classified as cash flow hedging or as fair value hedging. In the past financial year and the previous financial year all were categorised as cash flow hedging or hedging of net investments in foreign operations. How these hedging transactions are reported is described below.\n\nHedging of forecast currency flows \u2013 cash flow hedging\n\nDerivatives that hedge the forecast flow are reported in the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in value are reported in equity as a hedging reserve, through other comprehensive income.\nincome, until such time as the hedged flow is recognised in operating profit, at which time the hedging instrument\u2019s accumulated changes in value are transferred to the income statement where they then correspond to the profit/loss effects of the hedged transaction. The effectiveness of cash flow hedges for hedging forecast currency flows is measured monthly by comparing the hedged item with the hedging instrument.\n\nMeasurement of the category hedging derivatives at fair value is based on observable data; in other words, in accordance with Level 2 in the measurement hierarchy established in IFRS 13. The fair value of forward exchange contracts is calculated by discounting the difference between the agreed forward rate and the forward rate that can be obtained on the closing date for the remaining contract term. Contracts are discounted to a risk-free rate based on government bonds.\n\nHedging of net investments in foreign operations\nDerivatives intended for hedging net investments in foreign operations are recognised in equity through other comprehensive income. The effectiveness of hedging of net investments in foreign operations is measured quarterly by comparing the hedged item with the hedging instrument.\n\nThe fair value of all financial assets and liabilities essentially corresponds to the book value. Assets and liabilities that are recognised at amortised cost have short remaining terms, making the difference between book value and fair value negligible.\n\nForward contracts\nAll changes in the value of derivatives are recognised initially in equity as a hedging reserve through other comprehensive income. Through other comprehensive income, the fair value is transferred from the hedging reserve to the income statement in conjunction with a hedged transaction taking place.\n\nThe following table shows the outstanding forward contracts for cash flow hedging reported in the hedging reserve as of the closing date.\n\n| SELL/BUY | BOOK VALUE AND FAIR VALUE, SEK | NOMINAL AMOUNT, SEK | AVERAGE REMAINING TERM IN MONTHS |\n|----------|--------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|\n|          | 2021  | 2020  | 2021  | 2020  | 2021  | 2020  |\n| NOK/SEK  | 1     | 2     | 942   | 568   | 3     | 3     |\n| GBP/SEK  | -57   | 35    | 3,570 | 3,048 | 3     | 3     |\n| DKK/SEK  | -13   | 15    | 1,025 | 854   | 3     | 3     |\n| CHF/SEK  | -40   | 21    | 987   | 885   | 4     | 3     |\n| EUR/SEK  | 220   | 314   | 17,391| 15,934| 4     | 3     |\n| PLN/SEK  | 7     | 29    | 1,370 | 1,364 | 4     | 3     |\n| USD/SEK  | 261   | 148   | 6,015 | 4,309 | 3     | 3     |\n| CAD/SEK  | -27   | 12    | 1,227 | 624   | 4     | 3     |\n| JPY/SEK  | -23   | 19    | 793   | 824   | 4     | 3     |\n| HKD/SEK  | -4    | 3     | 86    | 104   | 3     | 3     |\n| RON/SEK  | -8    | 9     | 509   | 450   | 4     | 3     |\n| CZK/SEK  | -3    | 0     | 373   | 254   | 3     | 3     |\n| HUF/SEK  | 5     | 10    | 404   | 322   | 4     | 3     |\n| AUD/SEK  | -4    | 3     | 435   | 289   | 3     | 3     |\n| CNH/SEK  | -38   | -2    | 617   | 797   | 3     | 3     |\n| RUB/SEK  | -22   | 23    | 952   | 626   | 3     | 3     |\n| TRY/SEK  | 54    | 7     | 217   | 157   | 3     | 3     |\n| MXN/SEK  | 14    | -21   | 929   | 563   | 3     | 3     |\n| SEK/USD  | 1,175 | -427  | 27,615| 12,166| 3     | 3     |\n| SEK/EUR  | 21    | -23   | 1,669 | 1,118 | 4     | 2     |\n\nSubtotal 558 177 67,126 45,256\n\n| SELL/BUY | BOOK VALUE AND FAIR VALUE, SEK | NOMINAL AMOUNT, USD | AVERAGE REMAINING TERM IN MONTHS |\n|----------|--------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|\n|          | 2021  | 2020  | 2021  | 2020  | 2021  | 2020  |\n| KRW/USD  | 2     | 7     | 31    | 32    | 3     | 3     |\n| CLP/USD  | 15    | -1    | 15    | 21    | 3     | 3     |\n| PEN/USD  | 0     | 1     | 5     | 8     | 2     | 2     |\n\nSubtotal 17 7 51 61\n\nTotal 575 170\n\nAt the closing date, forward contracts with a positive market value amount to SEK 1,422 m (992), which is reported under other current receivables.

The annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the company are included on pages 54-105 in this document.\n\nIn our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the parent company as of 30 November 2021 and its financial performance and cash flow for the year then ended in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act. The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the group as of 30 November 2021 and their financial performance and cash flow for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU, and the Annual Accounts Act. The statutory administration report is consistent with the other parts of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts.\n\nWe therefore recommend that the general meeting of shareholders adopts the income statement and balance sheet for the parent company and the group.\n\nOur opinions in this report on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts are consistent with the content of the additional report that has been submitted to the parent company\u2019s audit committee in accordance with the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 11.\n\nBasis for opinions\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA) and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor\u2019s Responsibilities section. We are independent of the parent company and the group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. This includes that, based on the best of our knowledge and belief, no prohibited services referred to in the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 5.1 have been provided to the audited company or, where applicable, its parent company or its controlled companies within the EU.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions.\n\nOther matter\nThe audit of the report for the financial year 2019-12-01-2020-11-30 has been performed by another auditor, who has issued an auditor\u2019s report dated 25 February 2021, with unqualified opinions in the Report of annual accounts and consolidated accounts.\n\nKey Audit Matters\nKey Audit Matters of the audit are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of, and in forming our opinion thereon, the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a whole, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nCapitalized IT investments\nCapitalized expenditure amounts to SEK 9,268 m as of November 30, 2021 and constitutes mainly of IT-related investments. The Group continues to run a number of long-term IT programmes of high importance to develop the operating model and to support the strategic direction of the business. Development expenditure is capitalised to the extent that it is estimated that it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the Group and that the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. The carrying amount includes direct expenditure on services, payroll and materials as well as indirect costs attributable to the asset. Other development costs, as well as maintenance and training initiatives, are expensed when incurred. Capitalization of IT investments requires clear policies, consistency and is subject to management\u2019s estimates. Key estimates and assumptions include the distinction between development expenditures and maintenance and the useful life of the asset capitalized. A change in management estimates may have a material effect on the financial statements and consequently capitalized IT investments is considered a key audit matter.\n\nDisclosures related to accounting for capitalized expenditure can be found in note 12 (Intangible assets).\nOur audit procedures\n\nOur audit procedures included, but were not limited to:\n\n- Assessing the group\u2019s accounting principles for capitalization of IT investments in compliance with IFRS with the support of accounting specialists,\n- Obtaining an understanding of the internal control environment regarding capitalized IT investments and test identified manual key controls for design and implementation\n- Assessing the appropriateness of management estimates related to the distinction between development expenditures and maintenance, and\n- On a sample basis testing capitalized IT investment including the estimates made by management related to useful life applied\n- Evaluating the appropriateness of disclosures made in the financial statements.\n\nImpairment of store assets\n\nAs of November 30, 2021, the Group held SEK 79 662 m of property, plant and equipment consisting mainly of equipment, tools, fixture and fittings (SEK 25,852 m) and right of use assets (SEK 53 086 m). In accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of assets, the Group is required to complete an annual assessment of indicators of impairment of its store portfolio. An impairment charge of mainly of equipment, tools, fixture and fittings (SEK 25,852 m) and right of use assets (SEK 53 086 m) and note 15 (Leases).\n\nAccounting principles and disclosures related to accounting for impairment of store assets can be found in note 1 (Accounting principles), note 13 (Buildings, land and equipment) and note 15 (Leases).\n\nOur audit procedures\n\nOur audit procedures included, but were not limited to:\n\n- Assessing the group\u2019s accounting principles for impairment of store assets in compliance with IFRS with the support of accounting specialists,\n- Obtaining an understanding of the store impairment process as well as the forecasting process\n- Evaluating and challenging management\u2019s range of impairment indicators\n- Evaluating and challenging management\u2019s assessment of cash generating units and the supporting documentation\n- Evaluating and challenging the key assumptions utilised in the cash flow forecasts with reference to historical trading performance, impacts of Covid-19, anticipated changes in customer behaviour and our understanding of the Group\u2019s strategic initiatives\n- Reviewing the accuracy of past forecasts of growth rates and future cash flows to assess the level of accuracy of the forecasting process\n- Assessing the appropriateness of the discount rates applied with the involvement of our internal valuations specialists, and\n- Assessing the mechanical accuracy of the impairment models and the methodology applied by management for consistency with the requirements of IAS 36, Impairment of assets, and\n- Evaluating the appropriateness of disclosures made in the financial statements.\n\nAccounting for leases\n\nThe Group has entered into a large number of lease contracts including approximately 5,000 store premises, multiple offices and warehouses globally. The right of use asset amounts to SEK 53 086 m as of November 2021 and constitutes 30% of the Group\u2019s total assets. Accounting for leases is complex and requires a high level of estimations and assumptions made by management such as establishing the term of the lease and an interest rate of borrowing. The Group is working actively with the store portfolio meaning contracts are changed, terminated, and renewed continuously. Accounting for leases requires a well-functioning process and a clear policy. Changes in estimates, assumptions and assessments made by management may have a material effect on the financial statements and consequently accounting for leases are considered a key audit matter.\n\nAccounting principles and disclosures related to accounting for leases can be found in note 1 (Accounting principles) and note 15 (Leases).\n\nOur audit procedures\n\nOur audit procedures included, but were not limited to:\n\n- Assessing the group\u2019s accounting principles for leases in compliance with IFRS with the support of accounting specialists,\n- Obtaining an understanding of the internal control environment regarding leases and test identified key controls for design and implementation including related IT systems\n- Evaluating management\u2019s assessment of lease terms including renewals and extensions\n- Evaluating the methodology related to determining the incremental borrowing rate and on a sample basis testing the rate applied,\n- Assessing the right of use asset for impairment\n- Verifying the accuracy of the underlying lease data by agreeing a representative sample of leases to original contract or other supporting information, and check the integrity and mechanical accuracy of the lease calculations through recalculation of the expected accounting for leases, and\n\u2013 Evaluating the appropriateness of disclosures made in the financial statements.\n\nValuation of stock-in-trade\nThe Group carries a material level of stock-in-trade held by central warehouses and stores spread over a large amount of countries globally. As of November 30, 2021, stock-in-trade amounts to SEK 37,306 m corresponding to 21% of the Group\u2019s total assets. Stock-in-trade is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Valuation of stock-in-trade requires clear policies and is subject to management\u2019s estimates are required including calculating the cost of custom duties and freight and estimating a provision for obsolescence and sales returns. The Covid-19 pandemic have increased the uncertainty and customer behaviour is rapidly changing within the retail industry impacting the need to revisit and evaluate the model and method in use continuously. The processes for valuation of stock-in-trade and making appropriate provisions constitute a key audit matter in our audit.\n\nAccounting principles and disclosures related to stock-in-trade can be found in note 1 (Accounting principles) and note 16 (Stock-in-trade).\n\nOur audit procedures\nOur audit procedures included, but were not limited to:\n\u2013 Assessing the group\u2019s accounting principles for inventory in compliance with IFRS.\n\u2013 Obtaining an understanding of the internal control environment regarding valuation of inventory and test identified key controls for design and implementation including related IT systems.\n\u2013 Observing a sample of physical inventory counts in stores and warehouses.\n\u2013 On a sample basis testing valuation of inventory, and\n\u2013 Evaluating management\u2019s estimates related to provisions for obsolescence and sales return\n\u2013 Evaluating the appropriateness of disclosures made in the financial statements.\n\nOther Information than the annual accounts and consolidated accounts\nOther information consists of the remuneration report and pages 2-53 and 111-116. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for this other information.\n\nOur opinion on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts does not cover this other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion regarding this other information.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, our responsibility is to read the information identified above and consider whether the information is materially inconsistent with the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. In this procedure we also take into account our knowledge otherwise obtained in the audit and assess whether the information otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf we, based on the work performed concerning this information, conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\nResponsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director\nThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the preparation of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts and that they give a fair presentation in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and, concerning the consolidated accounts, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of annual accounts and consolidated accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, the Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the assessment of the company\u2019s and the group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. They disclose, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis of accounting is however not applied if the Board of Directors and the Managing Director intends to liquidate the company, to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Audit Committee shall, without prejudice to the Board of Director\u2019s responsibilities and tasks in general, among other things oversee the company\u2019s financial reporting process.\n\nAuditor\u2019s responsibility\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor\u2019s report that includes our opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these annual accounts and consolidated accounts.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\u2013 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n\u2013 Obtain an understanding of the company\u2019s internal control relevant to our audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in\nthe circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company\u2019s internal control.\n\n\u2013 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors and the Managing Director.\n\n\u2013 Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors\u2019 and the Managing Director\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. We also draw a conclusion, based on the audit evidence obtained, as to whether any material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company\u2019s and the group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to the related disclosures in the annual accounts and consolidated accounts or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion about the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause a company and a group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\n\u2013 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, including the disclosures, and whether the annual accounts and consolidated accounts represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n\u2013 Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated accounts. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our opinions.\n\nWe must inform the Board of Directors of, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit. We must also inform of significant audit findings during our audit, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identified.\n\nWe must also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, including the most important assessed risks for material misstatement, and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in the auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes disclosure about the matter.\n\nReport on other legal and regulatory requirements\n\nOpinions\nIn addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, we have also audited the administration of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director of H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) for the financial year 2020-12-01\u20132021-11-30 and the proposed appropriations of the company\u2019s profit or loss.\n\nWe recommend to the general meeting of shareholders that the profit to be appropriated in accordance with the proposal in the statutory administration report and that the members of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director be discharged from liability for the financial year.\n\nA separate list of loans and collateral has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act.\n\nBasis for Opinions\nWe conducted the audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor\u2019s Responsibilities section. We are independent of the parent company and the group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions.\n\nResponsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the proposal for appropriations of the company\u2019s profit or loss. At the proposal of a dividend, this includes an assessment of whether the dividend is justifiable considering the requirements which the company\u2019s and the group\u2019s type of operations, size and risks place on the size of the parent company\u2019s and the group\u2019s equity, consolidation requirements, liquidity and position in general.\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the company\u2019s organization and the administration of the company\u2019s affairs. This includes among other things continuous assessment of the company\u2019s and the group\u2019s financial situation and ensuring that the company\u2019s organization is designed so that the accounting, management of assets and the company\u2019s financial affairs otherwise are controlled in a reassuring manner. The Managing Director shall manage the ongoing administration according to the Board of Directors\u2019 guidelines and instructions and among other matters take measures that are necessary to fulfill the company\u2019s accounting in accordance with law and handle the management of assets in a reassuring manner.\n\nAuditor\u2019s responsibility\nOur objective concerning the audit of the administration, and thereby our opinion about discharge from liability, is to obtain audit evidence to assess with a reasonable degree of assurance whether any member of the Board of Directors or the Managing Director in any material respect:\n\n\u2013 has undertaken any action or been guilty of any omission which can give rise to liability to the company, or\n\n\u2013 in any other way has acted in contravention of the Articles of Association.\nOur objective concerning the audit of the proposed appropriations of the company\u2019s profit or loss, and thereby our opinion about this, is to assess with reasonable degree of assurance whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect actions or omissions that can give rise to liability to the company, or that the proposed appropriations of the company\u2019s profit or loss are not in accordance with the Companies Act.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. The examination of the administration and the proposed appropriations of the company\u2019s profit or loss is based primarily on the audit of the accounts. Additional audit procedures performed are based on our professional judgment with starting point in risk and materiality. This means that we focus the examination on such actions, areas and relationships that are material for the operations and where deviations and violations would have particular importance for the company\u2019s situation. We examine and test decisions undertaken, support for decisions, actions taken and other circumstances that are relevant to our opinion concerning discharge from liability. As a basis for our opinion on the Board of Directors\u2019 proposed appropriations of the company\u2019s profit or loss we examined the Board of Directors\u2019 reasoned statement and a selection of supporting evidence in order to be able to assess whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act.\n\nThe auditor\u2019s opinion regarding the statutory sustainability report\nThe board of directors is responsible for the statutory sustainability report on pages 63-74, and that it is prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act.\n\nOur examination has been conducted in accordance with FAR\u2019s auditing standard RevR 12 The auditor\u2019s opinion regarding the statutory sustainability report. This means that our examination of the statutory sustainability report is different and substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. We believe that the examination has provided us with sufficient basis for our opinion.\n\nA statutory sustainability report has been prepared.\n\nDeloitte AB, was appointed auditors of H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB [publ] by the general meeting of the shareholders on the 2021-05-06 and has been the company\u2019s auditor since 2021-05-06.\n\nStockholm, 25 March 2022\nDeloitte AB\n\nDidrik Roos\nAuthorised Public Accountant\nKey financial performance measures\n\nThis report contains key financial performance measures in accordance with the framework for financial reporting applied by the H&M group, which is based on IFRS.
