At the same time, the damaging effects of racial discrimination and a prevalent digital divide have become strikingly clear, while the importance of tackling climate change continues to grow.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of these unprecedented times, it is no surprise that consumer behavior has changed, with priorities shifting to focus on areas such as health, safety, and sustainability. Expectations also continue to grow on corporations for sustainable business practices and operations.\n\nAs a \u2018sustainable, centennial company\u2019, we need to grow together with society to ensure we create a lasting legacy for future generations to come. We have worked hard at every level to help our various stakeholders, supporting local communities and employees overcome challenges and adapt to the new environment as we return to our daily lives in a post-pandemic world.\n\nWe provided financial support to suppliers struggling from the COVID-19 situation to help them stabilize their operations. We provided medical staff and those particularly vulnerable to the crisis with medical and relief supplies as well as financial support. We contributed to accelerating COVID-19 testing and vaccine roll-outs by sharing our expertise and knowledge with small and medium-sized enterprises producing test kits and low dead space (LDS) syringes.\n\nIn addition, under the CSR vision of \u201cTogether for Tomorrow! Enabling People\u201d, we donated tools and equipment, such as tablet PCs, to support young students with their studies online, aiming to lessen the digital divide among students around the globe.\n\nThe pandemic has also served to remind us of the severe environmental issues we face. Notably, as the new climate regime has been implemented since 2021 in accordance with the Paris Agreement, the international community is now at a watershed moment in the fight against climate change.\n\nAs a responsible global company, we are engaged in numerous initiatives to minimize our environmental footprint, from product development to production and, finally, disposal.\n\nAs part of our efforts to tackle climate change, we are proud to report that from 2020, all of our worksites in the United States, Europe, and China were 100% powered by renewable energy sources. We plan to build on this success by expanding our renewable energy use in other regions.\n\nMeanwhile, we continue to drive a circular economy through technological innovations and the development of high-efficiency products with greater durability. Our new programs, such as Galaxy Upcycling and Eco-Package, encourage consumers to participate in efforts to build a sustainable future in their day to day lives.\n\nWe are deeply aware of the fact that compliance and integrity management are at the foundation of sustainability management. We have updated our Global Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery Policy to cultivate a deeply rooted compliance culture, and work with the external Samsung Compliance Committee to strictly monitor and manage any compliance risks, throughout the company.\n\nThe unprecedented crisis has brought about rapid changes in the way people live their daily lives. Guided by our management philosophy which states, \u201cwe will devote our human resources and technology to create superior products and services, thereby contributing to a better global society,\u201d and capitalizing on our technological advances and knowledge gained through many years of experience, we will continue to work with our stakeholders and society as a whole to allow a smooth and successful return to normalcy.\n\nThank you.\nCompany Overview\n\nOur goal is to devote our human resources and technology to create superior products and services and contribute to a better global society. To this end, we have used the five Samsung business principles to create detailed action plans, establishing the Samsung Electronics Global Code of Conduct to guide our employees. Our thoughts and actions reflect these core values as we continue our growth and build on our contribution to society.\n\nBusiness Areas\n\nSamsung Electronics consists of business divisions that are distinguished by product categories \u2013 Consumer Electronics (CE), Information Technology & Mobile Communications (IM), and Device Solutions (DS) \u2013 which operate independently. The CE division is responsible for the production and sales of TVs, monitors, refrigerators, washing machines, and air conditioners. The IM division focuses on the production and sales of smartphones, network systems and computers, among other products. The DS division, which includes the semiconductor business, produces and sells products such as DRAMs, NAND Flash, and mobile AP.\n\nIn addition to the main Korean headquarters, there are nine regional offices for CE and IM divisions and five regional offices for the DS division, responsible for production and sales.\n\nMain product by category\n\n| Category   | Main Products                                      |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| CE Division| TVs, monitors, refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners |\n| IM Division| HHP, networks system, computers, etc.              |\n| DS Division| DRAM, NAND Flash, Mobile AP, etc.                  |\n\nSamsung Electronics\u2019 Core Businesses\n\n| SAMSUNG | CE Division | IM Division | DS Division |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|------------|\n|         | Visual Display Business | Mobile Communications Business | Memory Business |\n|         | Digital Appliances Business | Networks Business | System LSI Business |\n|         | Health & Medical Equipment Business | | Foundry Business |\n\n| Sales   | Sales       | Sales       |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|\n| KRW 48,173.3 billion | KRW 99,587.5 billion | KRW 72,857.8 billion |\n\n| Operating Profit | Operating Profit | Operating Profit |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| KRW 3,561.5 billion | KRW 11,472.7 billion | KRW 18,805.0 billion |\n\n*Sales and operating profit exclude the display business (DS division) and Harman division.\nAt the end of 2020, we had approximately 230 worldwide operating hubs, including our headquarters in Suwon, South Korea, manufacturing subsidiaries, sales subsidiaries, design centers and R&D Centers, while operating 15 Regional Offices in South Korea, North America, Europe, Southeast Asia, Africa and other regions of the world.\n\n| Category | Regional Office | Sales Office | Production Site | R&D Center | Design Center | Others |\n|----------|----------------|--------------|-----------------|------------|---------------|--------|\n| Total    | 15             | 53           | 36              | 39         | 7             | 83     |\n\n1) Regional classification is based on Samsung Electronics\u2019 internal management criteria\n2) Sales Branches, Service Centers, Distribution Bases, etc.\nCorporate Governance\n\nUnder the principle of transparent and responsible business practices, our Board of Directors operates to support our management to lead the company in an innovative and proactive manner. The Board of Directors assists management in decision making by reviewing and resolving matters stipulated by law or the Articles of Incorporation, matters delegated by a general meeting of shareholders, and important matters related to our fundamental business policies and operations as a part of its supervision of management\u2019s actions. The composition and operation of the Board of Directors are determined by our Articles of Incorporation and the Regulations of the Board of Directors, which are stricter than the standards stipulated by the Commercial Act of South Korea. This enables us to enhance the independence, transparency, expertise, and diversity of the Board.\n\nBoard Composition\n\nThe Board of Directors can be composed of three to fourteen members in accordance with Article 24 of the Articles of Incorporation. Although Article 383 of the Commercial Act stipulates that the Board only needs three or more members, we allow up to fourteen members considering the scale of our business, and the need to increase the efficiency of operations and decision making. As of March 31, 2021, our Board of Directors consists of eleven members, six of whom are Independent Directors, in accordance with Article 542-8 of the Commercial Act, which requires a company to have at least three Independent Directors who constitute more than half of the total number of Directors.\n\nIndependence and Transparency of the Board\n\nSince 2018, the position of CEO and Chairman of the Board have been separated in order to ensure stronger independence and transparency. In 2020, we appointed an Independent Director as Chairman of the Board to reinforce responsible management centered around the Board of Directors and to further improve our corporate governance. The Chairman of the Board listens to the opinions of the Executive Directors and the Independent Directors and functions as a mediator so that the company\u2019s management may be overseen and supervised more objectively. The Independent Directors hold separate meetings where they can freely exchange their opinions on a wide range of business matters, including on how to enhance value for shareholders.\n\nAppointment and Terms of Directors\n\nDirectors are appointed by a resolution of a general meeting of shareholders in accordance with Article 382 of the Commercial Act. According to Article 542-8 of the Commercial Act, Executive Directors are elected among the candidates recommended by the Board, while Independent Directors are named among the candidates endorsed by the Independent Director Recommendation Committee. According to the same Article, the majority of the Independent Director Recommendation Committee must be composed of Independent Directors. Following the Article, our Independent Director Recommendation Committee consists entirely of Independent Directors and nominates candidates through fair procedures. The term of a Director\u2019s appointment is three years, and a Director can be reappointed by the vote of a general meeting of shareholders at the expiration of the term. However, the total term is limited to six years by the Commercial Act.\n\nExpertise and Diversity of the Board\n\nWe believe a Board with a diverse array of skills and expertise is a powerful enabler in making important strategic decisions in a rapidly changing business environment. Our three main business divisions - Consumer Electronics (CE), IT & Mobile Communications (IM), and Device Solutions (DS) - are run by our best experts in the field, who participate in the Board\u2019s activities as both CEOs and Executive Directors to practice responsible management. We seek to form the Board of Directors by considering racial, gender, religious, regional, and national diversities. Our Independent Directors are appointed from various fields, including finance, law, engineering, IT, public administration, and EHS. They are chosen regardless of their nationality or gender. This composition ensures the Directors can discuss the Board\u2019s agenda from a variety of perspectives and to supervise and advise the management both objectively and professionally.\n\nCharacteristics of the Board\n\nIndependence\n\nThose who are full-time employees, affiliated with the company\u2019s largest shareholder, have important interests linked to the company itself, or have recently worked at the company within the past two years are prohibited from serving as Independent Directors.\n\nTransparency\n\nAll Directors are appointed by a resolution of a general meeting of shareholders.\n\nExpertise\n\nIndependent Directors are appointed from a pool of individuals with extensive knowledge and experience in the fields of management, economics, finance, accounting, legal, technology, sustainability, etc.\n\nDiversity\n\nCandidates for the Board of Directors are not discriminated against based on religion, race, gender, nationality, or field of expertise.\nBoard Operation\nThe Board holds seven to eight regular meetings each year to address matters, such as approving quarterly financial statements and convening the Annual General Meeting (AGM) and calls extraordinary meetings when deemed necessary.\n\nBoard Meetings\nThe Board meeting is called by the Chairman, who notifies all Directors of the date, time, location, and agenda at least 24 hours prior to the meeting, as required by Article 30 of the Articles of Incorporation and Article 8 of the Board of Directors Regulations. Each Director has the authority to request the Chairman to convene a meeting for reasons deemed necessary after sharing the agenda item and the reason behind the request. If the Chairman rejects a request for a meeting without a valid reason, the Director who made the request may convene a meeting directly.\n\nBoard Decisions\nPursuant to Article 31 of the Articles of Incorporation and Article 9 of the Regulations of the Board of Directors, a resolution of the Board is approved by a majority vote cast by the Directors present at the meeting, with more than half of all the Directors present, unless otherwise stated in the relevant laws. In accordance with Article 391 of the Commercial Act, the Board of Directors may hold a meeting by using a remote communications device that allows simultaneous transmission and reception of the voices of all Directors. To avoid any potential conflicts of interest, we restrict the voting rights of any Director who has a personal interest in any agenda items under Article 9 of the Board of Directors Regulations.\n\nBoard Committees\nThe Board of Directors delegates specific responsibilities to six committees to ensure efficient operation in accordance with Article 28-2 of the Articles of Incorporation and Article 11-2 of the Regulations of the Board of Directors. The six committees are the Management Committee, Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Governance Committee, Independent Director Recommendation Committee, and Related Party Transactions Committee.\n\nThe Management Committee is composed of five Executive Directors, to whom the Board of Directors has delegated authorities for the purpose of making prompt decisions on business matters. The other five committees are composed entirely of Independent Directors in order to ensure their independence. The organization, operation, and authority of each committee are set forth in the Regulations of the Committees approved by the Board.\n\nAll Directors are notified about any agenda passed by a Board Committee in two days. Any Director may call on the Chairman to hold another Board meeting to put an approved item to another vote, when deemed necessary. However, items approved by the Audit Committee are excluded from revoting to ensure its independence.\n\nDuties and Composition of the Board Committees\n\n| Committee                          | Duties                                                                 | Composition                        |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Management Committee               | Deliberates and decides on matters related to business management and finance, and other matters delegated by the Board of Directors | Composed of five Executive Directors |\n| Audit Committee                    | Oversees matters concerning the overall management including the company\u2019s financial status | Composed of three Independent Directors |\n| Compensation Committee             | Ensures the objectivity and transparency of decisions related to Directors\u2019 compensation | Composed of three Independent Directors |\n| Governance Committee               | Ensures that the company fulfills its corporate social responsibility and enhances the shareholder value | Composed of six Independent Directors |\n| Independent Director Recommendation Committee | Recommends candidates for independent directorship by assessing their independence, diversity and capabilities | Composed of three Independent Directors |\n| Related Party Transactions Committee | Enhances the transparency of our business management by voluntarily complying with fair transaction regulations | Composed of three Independent Directors |\n\n\"As sustainability management has emerged as an important agenda, the role of the Board of Directors has become more important than ever. Key sustainability issues are reported to the Board, and the Board gathers opinions from a wide spectrum of stakeholders on important topics, including human rights, compliance culture, carbon neutrality, supporting of local communities. The Board gives serious consideration to how these matters should be addressed to enhance corporate value over the long term.\"  \n\nJae-Wan Bahk, Chairman of the Board\nCompliance & Ethics\n\nCompliance Management\n\nAt Samsung Electronics, compliance with laws and ethical standards is the top priority among our business principles. As a leading global company, we strive to conduct our business in strict compliance with all applicable laws and regulations to practice ethical management.\n\nWe continually work to establish and strengthen compliance management across the organization. We also have dedicated teams at each business division and regional offices across the globe to manage specific compliance issues in each respective business sector and region. Furthermore, relevant departments work together in various fields, including fair trade, intellectual property rights, personal information and privacy, labor and human rights, and environmental safety, to support compliance activities and manage potential risks.\n\nSamsung Electronics operates the three-step compliance management process, consisting of prevention, detection, and response, which we work to continually improve. We have also implemented the Compliance Program Management System (CPMS), an IT system that enables efficient management of compliance tasks.\n\nAt the prevention stage, we provide employees with detailed compliance policies and guidelines via CPMS for reference when performing their tasks. We evaluate regulatory trends to reduce legal risks and provide training programs for employees based on our findings. If employees have questions or require assistance determining the legality of specific matters based on the guidelines, they can seek one-on-one consultation with experts at the help desk on CPMS.\n\nAt the detection phase, we conduct annual compliance audits and report the results to the Board of Directors at least once a year. Furthermore, we have established a whistle-blowing system through which violations of law can be reported, and in accordance with our compliance control standard, we protect whistleblowers\u2019 identities and prohibit any unfair treatment of whistleblowers.\n\nAt the response phase, we devise ways to prevent recurrences of compliance violations by improving the process based on our analysis of the compliance audit results as well as the reporting and response results. In case of any violations, we undertake corrective measures including disciplinary measures or education according to our internal rules.\n\nWe continually update our compliance management by regular legal risk assessments. We also evaluate the validity of our compliance control system, including the procedures involved, and report the results to the Board of Directors once a year.\n\nFocus Areas of Compliance Management\n\nCompliance Management System by Field\n\n| Field                  | System                                      | Key Functions                                                                 | Responsible Units                  |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Compliance             | Compliance Program Management System (CPMS) | Provision of manuals and guidelines, reporting of compliance violations, one-on-one inquiry | Compliance Team                    |\n| Ethical Management     | Ethical management System                   | Posting of management principles, reporting of wrongful practices             | Corporate Auditing Team            |\n| Protection of Personal Information | Privacy Legal Management System (PLMS) | Protection and management of personal information in products and services | Global Privacy Office              |\n| Intellectual Property Rights | IT4U                                      | Prohibition of illegal software use                                           | Corporate IT Strategy Group        |\n| Labor and Human Rights | GHRP Portal                                 | Compliance with labor standards and provision of regulations on human resources management | Corporate HR Team                  |\n| Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) | Global-EHS (G-EHS) | Ensuring environmental safety of worksites and products | Global EHS Center                  |\n| Others                 | Global Policies & Procedure Manuals (GPPM) | Standardization of global business process                                    | Corporate Management Team          |\n|                        | Contract Management System                  | Ensuring compliance with terms of contracts and monitoring the contract implementation and management | Corporate Legal Office             |\n\nFurthermore, we have established a whistle-blowing system through which violations of law can be reported, and in accordance with our compliance control standard, we protect whistleblowers\u2019 identities and prohibit any unfair treatment of whistleblowers.\n\nAt the response phase, we devise ways to prevent recurrences of compliance violations by improving the process based on our analysis of the compliance audit results as well as the reporting and response results.

We also evaluate the validity of our compliance control system, including the procedures involved, and report the results to the Board of Directors once a year.\nSteps Taken to Strengthen Compliance in 2020\n\n1. Strengthened the Compliance Officer\u2019s Independence and Authority\nThe Compliance Team, which previously reported to the Corporate Legal Office, is now directly overseen by the CEO, and the compliance control standard has been updated to strengthen the Compliance Officer\u2019s independence and authority. The standard requires that a specific reason be cited when terminating the Compliance Officer in order to prevent any unfair disadvantage in personnel matters for reasons related to performing duties. Additionally, when conducting compliance activities, the Compliance Team has the authority to request resources from relevant teams, including personnel support as well as financial resources. The Compliance Officer has the right to attend all Board meetings, right to make a statement, and the right to call for a Board meeting, strengthening all authority related to Board meetings. Accordingly, the Compliance Officer attends all Board meetings and the Management Committee\u2019s meetings to ensure lawful decision-making in compliance with the regulations.\n\n2. Reinforced Reporting Violation of Law\nIn 2020, in addition to the in-house reporting system in CPMS, we created a new reporting channel that accepts anonymous reports about violation of law from external stakeholders and disclosed the e-mail address, phone number, and fax number for reporting, which has enhanced the effectiveness of the reporting system.\n\n3. Intensified Compliance Management for Anti-Corruption\n\nUpdating the Anti-Corruption Policy and Detailed Guidelines\nWe updated our \u2018Global Anti-Corruption and Bribery Policy\u2019 in 2020, reflecting our commitment to complying with all domestic and foreign anti-corruption laws as well as conducting our business practices in an ethical manner. The updated policy has been shared with all employees, and the detailed guidelines on the policy implementation have been posted on CPMS.\n\nSummary Table of Global Anti-Corruption and Bribery Policy\n\n| Reporting Violation of Law | Phone | Fax | E-mail |\n|---------------------------|-------|-----|--------|\n| In-house Reporting System (CPMS) | (+82-2-1811-6341) | (+82-31-277-1166) | cp.wb.sec@samsung.com |\n| Violation of Law Reporting System (https://sec-compliance.net) | | |\n\n\u203b Some channels are only available in South Korea.\n\nEnhancing Anti-Corruption Controls\nWe have strengthened the review process for external sponsorship expenditures in order to prevent potential corruption. External Sponsorship Council, formed in 2017, conducts prior review of external sponsorships of KRW 10 million or above and reports the findings to the Audit Committee under the Board of Directors, and the Board\u2019s approval is required for external sponsorships of KRW 1 billion or above. In 2020, we further strengthened the system by appointing the Compliance Officer as the Chairman of the External Sponsorship Council and also extending the review scope to include overseas subsidiaries. The review results are now submitted to Samsung Compliance Committee for review. We have augmented our system to mitigate corruption risk, such as establishing anti-corruption review procedures when registering new vendors or signing contracts, as well as inspecting external sponsorship expenditures after review process.\n\nStrengthening Anti-Corruption Training\nAnti-corruption training is included as part of mandatory employee compliance education which takes place annually. In 2020, contents focused on the improved anti-corruption policy and internal control processes. We also increased the education requirement for team compliance officers from one training session to two sessions per year, and expanded the anti-corruption training to senior executive education and top management development curriculum. Our anti-corruption training introduces the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) enforcement cases and South Korea\u2019s Improper Solicitation and Graft Act.\n\nCompletion of Mandatory Compliance Training (Unit: No. of Employees)\n\n| Year | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 |\n|------|------|------|------|\n|      | 83,368 | 81,634 | 88,150 |\nEthical Management\n\nWe provide the Samsung Business Principles to external stakeholders, including suppliers and customers, while operating a channel to report any violation of the Principles. Furthermore, we post \u201cEmployee Business Conduct Guidelines\u201d on our intranet to encourage employees to maintain integrity in practice. The Samsung Business Principles, violation reporting channel, and the Employee Business Conduct Guidelines are all available in 15 different languages, including English and Korean.\n\nIn 2020, among 728 reports collected through channels around the globe, consumer complaints accounted for 28% of the cases, while issues related to corruption accounted for 11%. All reports related to corruption are fact-checked through inspections and dealt with according to the severity of each case. The results are reported to the Audit Committee twice a year.\n\nWe provide anti-corruption training in various formats to all employees at least once a year. In addition, we promote transparent business practices through efforts such as asking suppliers to post \u201cSamsung Electronics Business Guidelines\u201d on their websites, which lay out major prohibitions when conducting business, including corruption and fraudulent conducts.\n\nSamsung Compliance Committee\n\nPurpose and Composition\n\nSamsung Compliance Committee (the \u201cCommittee\u201d) was officially launched on February 5, 2020, with the purpose of implementing Integrity Management, a core value of Samsung, by strengthening the compliance and control functions of Samsung\u2019s seven affiliated companies.1)\n\nThe Committee was established as an independent organization separate from Samsung Electronics to ensure independence and autonomy. The Committee consists of six external members including the Chairman and one internal member, and is led by Chairman Ji-Hyung Kim, a former Supreme Court Justice. The external members of the Committee were appointed based on their fields of expertise and experience in law, accounting, economics, administration, and other professional fields in corporate compliance.\n\nKey Activities of the Committee\n\nThe Committee holds monthly regular meetings with compliance officers of Samsung\u2019s affiliated companies as well as additional meetings if necessary. The Committee reviews the affiliated companies\u2019 external sponsorship expenditures and internal transactions and provides independent opinions. In addition, the Committee reviews report submissions on affiliated companies\u2019 compliance violations by whistleblowers through mail, e-mail, and external agencies. On its homepage, the Committee discloses the meeting contents and its statements on the relevant discussions.\n\nThe Committee also engages in activities and events, including roundtable discussion with the top management including affiliated companies\u2019 CEOs (January 2021), workshops to strengthen compliance management for companies\u2019 compliance officers (July 2020), roundtable discussion on the corporate governance structure with external experts (November 2020 and January 2021), and labor-management advisory group (April 2021).\n\nImplementation of the Committee\u2019s Recommendations and Suggestions\n\nBased on the Committee\u2019s recommendations and suggestions on further improvements to our compliance management, we devise and instigate action plans.\n\nWe formed a labor-management advisory group under the Board of Directors and revised the policies to guarantee the three labor rights.

Management Governance\n\nThe Board of Directors, the highest decision-making body, oversees our sustainability management. The Governance Committee is tasked by the Board to consider sustainability related matters and items that are of interest to various stakeholders in order for us to fulfill our responsibility as a responsible global company. The Committee provides suggestions and opinions on defining our sustainability management strategy.\n\nIn 2020, the Sustainability Council was further strengthened at the executive level. The Sustainability Council is led by our Head of Corporate Management Office, and if necessary, the head of each division participates as well, discussing various issues with those responsible for relevant businesses.\n\nIn 2020, we also promoted the Sustainability Management Office to Corporate Sustainability Center, as a direct organization under the CEO to ensure more systematic and professional sustainable management. To reinforce execution of sustainability on our business (product & service planning, R&D, Marketing, and CS), we also established the Sustainability Management Office in main business divisions. The Corporate Sustainability Center is responsible for establishing broad direction of sustainability efforts, performance monitoring, external cooperation, and communication. In order to do so, they work in collaboration with various internal councils or relevant teams in diverse domains, including environment, labor and human rights, health and safety, and supply chain responsibility. The Sustainability Management Offices in each division establish individual sustainability strategies and support execution, considering specialties and conditions at each of the businesses.\n\nReflect Sustainability Achievements in Performance Evaluations and Compensation\n\nFrom 2021, we have added sustainability KPIs to the performance evaluation and compensation of executives, encouraging them to consider sustainability management in all parts of the business. The performance indicator reflects appropriate and relevant sustainability items matching the specialties and conditions of each business division and department. This will be supplemented with further development of the performance evaluation and compensation.\nWe view our sustainability efforts as an investment for the future.\n\nSustainability management is a fundamental part of our company growth in a rapidly changing business environment. A positive approach benefits our competitiveness and lays the foundation for a better, long-term future for us all.\n\nWe view our efforts in this area as an investment in the future and there is not one part of our world-wide operations that is not influenced by our approach to sustainability.\n\n\u201cWe created Sustainability Management Offices in each division to ensure that sustainability practices are executed in all parts of our business.\u201d\n\nWe continue to enhance our approach to sustainability. In 2020, we promoted the Sustainability Management Office to Corporate Sustainability Center, as a direct organization under the CEO.\n\nAt the same time, to incorporate sustainability throughout all phases of our products \u2013 planning, designing, producing, and selling \u2013 we established Sustainability Management Offices in each business division.\n\nThrough our Sustainability Council, we discuss key strategies and activities in each business division as well as across the organization. Any important decision is reported to the Board of Directors, reinforcing Integrity Management with the Board at the center. Further, to build a strong compliance culture, which is foundational to sustainability management, we are putting forth our utmost efforts, including establishing of an external body, the Samsung Compliance Committee. We have also incorporated sustainability management criteria into employee evaluations, so that our ethical, social, and environmental values become integral parts of our business. Additionally, we have implemented a mandatory sustainability education program for employees. Based on our sustainability governance, we will strongly pursue sustainability management.\n\n\u201cWe will enable our customers in proactively contributing towards a sustainable society and environment through innovative products and we seek to achieve mutual growth with our stakeholders.\u201d\n\nAs well as considering our impact on the environment and society at large, we seek mutual growth with stakeholders to build trust and continue to carry out our business.\n\nTo that end, we help consumers with sustainability initiatives in their daily lives, through our products and innovations.\n\nWe will have aggressive targets for sustainability management and while continuously working towards our goal, and continue to engage in transparent communication with our stakeholders on our progress.\n\nListening to MZ Generation Employees\n\nTo better understand concerns of our MZ (Millennial and Gen Z) Generation the future leaders \u2013 and incorporate their insights into our sustainability efforts, we encourage them to share their honest opinions to the management.\n\n[South Korea] Offline interview with employees in each business division\n[Europe] Written interview with person in charge of sales, marketing, and sustainability related businesses\n[North America] Written interview with NGL (Next Generation Leaders)\n\nKey Opinions\n\n\u201cMZ Generation can focus on issues that may be overlooked by older generations. This is important because these issues can quickly spread out and gain support when going viral on social media.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see the future of a company that considers their social and environmental responsibilities. What would they be like in 5 years?

Montenegro, Digital Sector Lead, World Benchmarking Alliance\nSustainability in the Pandemic Era\n\nAfter the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, the world faced a social and economic crisis. We are dedicated to ensuring the safety of our employees, suppliers, customers, as well as local communities, in the pandemic situation. Despite the economic difficulties, we have contributed to the economic stability of our local community, by continuously hiring new talents and investing in R&D.\n\nCOVID-19 Response System\n\nIn January 2020, we formed a taskforce comprising members from across the business, including the Global EHS Center, Corporate Human Resources Team and Corporate Communications Team. The taskforce monitors the COVID-19 status and measures, while sharing real-time updates with the management and employees.\n\nPrevention of Employee Infection\n\nTo prevent COVID-19 infection, we conduct a mobile questionnaire for employees that helps sort out high-risk, multi-facility visitors and those with symptoms. In addition, we installed thermal imaging cameras and automatic temperature measuring devices at the entrances to the worksites. We are also the first company in Korea to establish an in-house screening clinic to offer prompt examinations for both our own employees and those of our suppliers. There are currently a total of three in-house screening clinics, each located in Hwaseong, Suwon and Gumi.\n\nProviding Hygiene Products for Employees\n\nTo ensure employee safety, we provide hygiene products including two masks per person per week and place hand sanitizers in offices and meeting rooms. Some worksites provided quarantine kits (masks, mask straps, and pouches) for employees during national holidays.\n\nEmployee Guidance and Call Center Operation\n\nWe provide employees with the latest information on our COVID-19 policies, details of the confirmed cases, and the quarantine guidelines. In addition, we have a COVID-19 call center in place that actively responds to employee inquiries about COVID-19 cases, including guidelines regarding symptoms and testing, and procedures for returning to the workplace after quarantine.\n\nCOVID-19 Quarantine and Special Inspection on Quarantine Compliance\n\nWe conduct disinfection three times a week at a total of 2,888 facilities in business sites in South Korea. In the case of office spaces, disinfection is conducted at night for the convenience of employees. In winter, common facilities are disinfected five times a week to better cope with higher indoor population density.\n\nEmployee Worksite Entrance Process\n\nTo prevent the inflow and spread of COVID-19, we daily monitor whether mask-wearing, social distancing, and the provision of hygiene products are well put in place in each business site. We also carry out weekly inspections by dividing all facilities in our worksites, such as internal cafes, banks, public spaces, meeting rooms, education centers, offices, and dormitories, into 26 categories.\n\nCOVID-19 Vaccination Support\n\nAs COVID-19 vaccination became available to employees in 2021, Samsung Electronics has offered \u2018vaccination leave days\u2019 so that employees can take ample time off for safe vaccination and rest.

In addition, we operate a video consultation service that allows call center consultants to see the products and provide consultations.\n\nSupport for Local Communities\n\nInfrastructure Support for Online Education\nWe donated 1,000 Galaxy Tabs to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) for refugee camp youths in Africa, whose educational environment has worsened due to COVID-19. The Tabs were delivered to 15 schools and community centers at the refugee camps in Kakuma and Dadaab in Kenya, and are used for the Instant Network School, an online education program for refugee youths operated by the UN Refugee Agency.\n\nMedical Support\nIn March 2020, we converted the Yeongdeok Center, one of our employee training centers, into a residential treatment center for the Yeongdeok community. The center helped address a shortage of beds in local hospitals and treat patients with no or mild symptom, allowing medical staff to focus on treating severely ill ones. Volunteer medical staff from three Samsung hospitals - Samsung Seoul Hospital, Gangbuk Samsung Hospital, and Samsung Changwon Hospital - were dispatched to the Yeongdeok Center, where a joint support group was formed in cooperation with local governments, military, police, firefighters, and volunteers to take care of the COVID-19 patients.\n\nIn addition, we provided household necessities, hand sanitizers, and disinfectant tissues for the disadvantaged and those who were in quarantine. We also provided relief supplies such as immunity-strengthening health supplements for the medical staff and made a donation of KRW 23 billion to the Korea Disaster Relief Association.\n\nSupport for Small and Medium Enterprises Producing Disinfection Products\nThrough the Smart Factory Support Program, we shared technological expertise with companies manufacturing masks, diagnostic kits and vaccine syringes.\n\nSupport for Companies Producing Diagnostic Kits\nIn April 2020, 16 of our experts were dispatched to help Kogene Biotech, which specializes in genetic analysis, and they identified 40 points of improvement and provided solutions for productivity enhancement. Kogene Biotech increased its capping speed from 33 kits to 125 kits per hour by implementing a jig into the capping (clogging) work that was previously done by hand. In addition, we helped the company with the logistics optimization and the introduction of automated facilities. As a result, an output increased from 5,600 kits to 10,000 kits per week, with a 79% increase in productivity in about one month.\n\nSupport for Vaccine Syringe Development and Mass Production\nIn 2020, 30 experts were sent to Poonglim Pharmatech to support with the development of low dead space (LDS) syringes, production of prototypes, preparation for mass production, and the establishment of the production line. As a result, Poonglim set up a mass production system capable of producing more than 10 million syringes every month. According to the Korean National Medical Center, one bottle of vaccine can inoculate five people with a general syringe, and six people with an LDS syringe. Poonglim Pharmatech\u2019s LDS syringe can inoculate up to seven people, achieving the same effect as increasing vaccine production by 20~40%.\nEnvironment\n\nWe adhere to the philosophy of green management, designing and delivering eco-conscious products to pave the way to a cleaner future for all.\n\nPlanetFirst \u2013 Earth is our foremost priority\n\n\"We strive to minimize our products\u2019 environmental footprint throughout their lifecycle.\"\n\nChanhoon Park\nExecutive Vice President, Head of Global Infra Technology (DS Division)\n\nGoals in 2020 \u2192 Accomplishments in 2020 \u2192 Future Plans\n\nUse of Renewable Energy\n100% (US, Europe, China)\n\nUse of Renewable Energy\n100% (US, Europe, China)\n\nContinue to Expand the Use of Renewable Energy\n\nReduction in CO\u2082e Emissions in the Product Use Phase\n250 million tonnes (cumulative from 2009)\n\nReduction in CO\u2082e Emissions in the Product Use Phase\n301 million tonnes (cumulative from 2009)\n\nContinue to Reduce the Power Consumption in Key Products.\n\nWaste from manufacturing sites\n95% recycled\n\nWaste from manufacturing sites\n95% recycled\n\nAcquire Zero Waste to Landfill Certification for All Manufacturing Sites\n\nCollected E-waste\n3.8 million tonnes (cumulative from 2009)\n\nCollected E-waste\n4.54 million tonnes (cumulative from 2009)\n\nCollected E-waste by 2030\n7.5 million tonnes (cumulative from 2009)\nEco-conscious Activities Along the Value Chain\n\nWe have introduced programs throughout the product lifecycle, to minimize the environmental impact at every phase of the value chain, including product development, raw material procurement, production, manufacturing, distribution, usage, and waste disposal. We conduct research into potential risks and opportunities, and implement proactive measures to combat climate change, which requires an immediate global response. For our part, we have launched a number of Reduce \u00b7 Reuse \u00b7 Recycle initiatives to help support the circular economy.\nClimate Actions\n\nGovernance\nClimate change is a priority area for Samsung Electronics as climate risks directly impact our business operations and financial performance. The Board of Directors, as the company\u2019s highest decision-making body, receives regular reports on any important agenda related to climate change.\n\nOur Head of Corporate Management Office is responsible for outlining Samsung Electronics\u2019 climate change policies, identifying climate related targets, and executing investments. The Head of Corporate Management Office also chairs the company-wide Sustainability Council which is composed of executives from the main pillars of ESG. Environment-related councils are overseen by our Head of Corporate Management Office along with executives from environment-related fields, establishing plans for combating climate change and evaluating progress.\n\nThe EHS Council in each business area keeps track of climate change concerns and our progress toward our GHG reduction goals and plans. Meanwhile, the Eco Council is in charge of developing strategies for eco-conscious products, including energy efficient products.\n\nRisk Management\nSamsung Electronics continuously tracks various threats, including those related to climate change, at our worksite locations around the world in accordance with our risk management process and manuals for a variety of topics, including environmental protection, energy use, and policy enforcement. The manager at each worksite reports any issue that may arise to headquarters. Through the company-wide Sustainability Council and the EHS Council, we regularly check climate change issues and discuss further actions to be taken before relaying decisions to the related departments.\n\nClimate Change Risk Management Process\nWe analyze risks and opportunities in the context of climate change and identify priority issues based on each issue\u2019s importance and impact on business, reflecting on them in our decision-making process.\n\nOur Responses to Climate Change\nClimate change risks and opportunities affect almost every aspect of our business, from our products and services to manufacturing processes, supply chain, research and development, and other sales activities. As a result, we have developed energy-efficient products while working hard to reduce GHG emissions. We take into account various climate change scenarios to understand the impacts of climate change and establish our response.\n\nIn the short term, we consider carbon prices (prices of carbon credit), extreme weather, and adoption of highly-efficient technology as potential issues, while we see securing carbon credit and saving energy cost as opportunities. In the mid term, we expect changes in consumption patterns and an increase in the use of renewable energy to be opportunities while we perceive physical changes such as the rise in temperature as a long-term risk.\n\nOur Responses to Climate Change by Stage\n\n| GHG reduction in worksites | - F-gas reduction facility operation in semiconductor production process\n| - Implementation of GHG reduction Projects\n| - Expansion of renewable energy use\n| GHG reduction during product use | - Reduction of GHG emissions in the product use phase by developing highly energy-efficient products\n| - Development of low-power semiconductors with power efficiency min. 10% higher than the previous generation products\n| GHG reduction in other stages of the value chain | - Management of GHG emissions from suppliers, logistics operations, employees\u2019 business trips, and electric vehicles\n| Reduction of external GHG emission | - Acquisition of carbon credits through external emissions-reduction projects including CDM\n\n1) Scenarios based on the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fifth assessment report (AR5), the International Energy Agency (IEA) Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP), and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in accordance with the Paris Agreement.\n\n1) Fluorinated gas\n2) Clean Development Mechanism\n## Risk and Opportunity Analysis\n\n### Risk and Opportunity Factors Related to Climate Change\n\n| Risk Factor | Transition Risks & Opportunities | Physical Risks & Opportunities |\n|-------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| 1.

We have improved the efficiency of our manufacturing and processing, maximizing reduction in GHG emissions. Each worksite estimates its GHG emissions each year, defines GHG mitigation tasks specific to its manufacturing processes, and develops and promotes appropriate action plans.\n\nIn 2020, we implemented a total of 540 GHG reduction projects, including enhancing the efficiency of F-gases processing facilities, upgrading to high-efficiency equipment, and streamlining the manufacturing process. As a result, we reduced GHG emissions by a total of 7,091 thousand tonnes compared to the expected emission amount. This is an increase of 39% compared to the amount of GHG reduction achieved in 2019.\n\nWe plan to continue reducing GHG emissions at our worksites by carrying out additional projects, such as reducing process gas usage while improving their treatment rate, expanding renewable energy use, and attaining more efficient product processing.\n\nAchievements in GHG Emission Reduction at Worksites\n\n| Year | GHG reduction amount (Unit: 1,000 tonnes of CO2e) | The average reduction amount per each GHG reduction project (Unit: 1,000 tonnes of CO2e/project) |\n|------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2018 | 2,931                                         | 5.4                                                                              |\n| 2019 | 5,098                                         | 10.2                                                                             |\n| 2020 | 7,091                                         | 13.1                                                                             |\n\nReduction of Process Gas from Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nReduction of Process Gas Usage. We optimize processing time, processing phase, and clean recipe for manufacturing and processing to reduce the input amount of process gases. As a result of such efforts, we have reduced around 90 thousand tonnes of GHG emissions.\n\nImprovement of Efficiency in Process Gas Treatment. We added metals to the Regenerative Catalytic System equipment to improve the efficiency of the process gas treatment facilities. As a result, the successful process gas treatment rate increased from 87% to 90%.\n\nDevelopment of Alternative Gases. We are creating process gases with lower global warming potential. Notably, we have developed an alternative gas to replace PFCs which are used in the four major semiconductor processing steps \u2013 etching, diffusion, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and metal. 23% of PFCs have been replaced in processing steps of some products since 2018. Samsung Electronics Semiconductor R&D Center continues to research and develop alternative gases.\n\n1) PFCs: Perfluorocarbons\n\nEnergy Reduction in Manufacturing Process\n\nTo minimize energy consumption, each manufacturing site plans and implements projects that are specific to its circumstances and characteristics. The key energy-saving activities include:\n\n- Optimizing the capacity utilization rate of equipment such as HVAC systems, freezers, air compressors, and pumps.\n- Blocking airflow in-between clean room doors, and adjusting the supply of air from outside to maintain the positive pressure.\n- Installing self-cleaning condensers to improve the efficiency of freezers.\n- Adjusting the expanded polystyrene (EPS) shape molding machine\u2019s steam pressure.\n\nApplication of IoT Technology to Infrastructure Equipment\n\nWe monitor energy use at our worksites and strive to increase efficiency. To that end, we have applied IoT solutions and technologies to key HVAC systems. HVAC systems consume a lot of energy, particularly in hot climates, so they need to be operated and controlled efficiently. We have extended the use of IoT technologies to our infrastructure facilities around the world, starting with our worksites in South Korea and Vietnam to those in North America, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. We plan to create an IoT-based remote control system that will be used on worksites in other parts of the world, including Southwest Asia.\n\nEnergy Reduction in Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nTo reduce our electricity consumption, we make efforts to streamline manufacturing and optimize the operation of equipment. We also work to reduce the time for testing main equipment, optimizing the temperature in auxiliary facilities, using high-efficiency equipment, and wet scrubbers to remove contaminants from gas streams. Furthermore, we are reducing LNG usage by using cooling water systems and heat exchangers to recapture wasted heat and adjust the air temperature and flow rate within the outdoor air handling units (OHUs).\nExpanding the Use of Renewable Energy\n\nIn 2018, we made a commitment to source 100% renewable energy at all our worksites in the United States, Europe, and China by 2020. In South Korea, we also pledged to install solar and geothermal facilities in our parking lots, roofs, and new buildings to expand renewable energy use in our worksites.\n\nFor the past three years, we created and implemented action plans tailored to the needs of each region. The actions included installing solar power generation equipment, purchasing Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), signing Power Purchasing Agreements (PPAs), and joining the Green Pricing system for renewable power sources. These efforts led to a three-fold increase of renewable energy usage in 2020 compared to 2018, and all action plans have been successfully implemented.\n\nWe are looking for more opportunities to expand usage in regions with the necessary systems and conditions. Recently, the conditions surrounding renewable energy use have improved in each country, enabling us to expect that our renewable energy usage will continue to grow.\n\nUS, Europe, and China In 2020, 100% of the energy used in our worksites in the United States, Europe, and China was generated from renewable energy sources. Our short-term efforts currently include installation of solar power generation equipment, purchase of RECs, and taking part in the Green Pricing system. In the mid to long term, we seek to gradually expand the scope and number of PPAs.\n\nSouth Korea We successfully installed solar power generation facilities at our Suwon and Giheung worksites at scales of 1.9 MW and 1.5 MW, respectively. We have added the solar power generation capacity of 0.4 MW and the geothermal power capacity of 200RT in our Pyeongtaek site. In addition, we seek to further expand our renewable energy use by utilizing the Green Premium Pricing launched in 2021.\n\nLatin America Our worksites in Brazil signed PPAs with wind power and hydropower generators, aiming to shift 100% of their energy usage to renewable energy. Our worksites in Mexico have signed a series of power supply agreements including the purchase of RECs, making constant efforts to increase their renewable energy usage. Considering local conditions, we expect that these worksites will be able to achieve 100% renewable energy by 2025.\n\nSouthwest Asia In India, we signed a renewable energy supply contract with wind power and biomass power generators, increasing our renewable energy usage. We also installed solar power generation equipment of 1.8 MW capacity on building rooftops and parking lots in the worksites in India. We aim to make the transition to 100% renewable energy by 2025, focusing on expanding usage through PPA.\n\nCase: Expanding the Use of Renewable Energy in the United States\n\nOur US subsidiaries expanded the use of renewable energy by not only tapping into wind power as an energy source, but also installing solar power generation facilities, and purchasing RECs. Meanwhile, in November 2019, Samsung Austin Semiconductor, in partnership with Apple, eBay and Sprint, agreed to purchase 75 MW of renewable energy produced by a large-scale wind farm, and is in the process of further increasing the number of PPAs.\n\nRecognizing our success in expanding renewable energy use, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) presented Samsung Electronics America, Inc., Samsung Austin Semiconductor, LLC, and Samsung Semiconductor, Inc. with the 2019 Green Power Leadership Award for Excellence in Green Power Use. Furthermore, as of May of 2021, we rank 11th among over 700 companies that participated in the EPA\u2019s Green Power Partnership Program and rank 7th in the Tech & Telecom industry group.\n\n1) 2019 Green Power Leadership Award for Excellence in Green Power Use\nProduct Energy Efficiency\n\nIn collaboration with the Eco Council and working group for each business, our environmental experts monitor developments in energy-saving technology and environmental legislation and work to apply energy efficient strategies to our new products.\n\nIn 2020, we enhanced the performance of our TV backlight technology and implemented the high-efficiency refrigerator compressor. As a result, relative to 2008, we were able to reduce annual energy usage by an average of 32% and for the past three years we have been continuously decreasing the amount of GHG emissions during product use phase.\n\n| Year | Accumulated GHG Emissions Reduced in the Product Use Phase (Unit: Million tonnes of CO\u2082e) |\n|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2018 | 243                                                                                      |\n| 2019 | 270                                                                                      |\n| 2020 | 301                                                                                      |\n\n- Amount decreased in the calendar year\n- Cumulative decreased amount in previous years\n\n1) Cumulative from 2009\n\nDisplay\n\nOur 2021 QLED TVs come with a new solar cell-powered remote control that can be charged through sunlight or indoor lighting. The remote control is charged using the embedded solar cell panels without requiring single-use batteries. This innovation will help prevent the wastage of around 99 million AA batteries.\n\nMobile\n\nWe are committed to using eco-conscious materials when it comes to manufacturing smartphones and tablet PC products. Our Galaxy S21 smartphone, for example, won a \u201cReducing CO\u2082\u201d certificate from Carbon Trust, an organization that recognized the Galaxy S21 model\u2019s reduction of GHG relative to previous models by reducing packaging and changing the materials used in the product lifecycle. Polyketone was applied to the model\u2019s side key internal brackets, which has obtained Green Technology Certifications due to contribution to reducing GHG. Further, we are working to reduce energy consumption with high efficiency battery chargers.\n\nSemiconductors\n\nStarting with the Green Memory Campaign established in 2009, we have introduced memory solutions with maximized low-power features every year. Our aim is to help protect the environment using IT innovation.\n\nIn 2020, nine of Samsung\u2019s leading memory products \u2013 four DRAM solutions, three solid state drives (SSDs), and two embedded storage (eStorage) devices \u2013 earned Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) labels from the UK-based Carbon Trust. The 512GB eUFS 3.1, one of our smartphone storage memory products, was the first in the industry to be certified as a product for reducing CO\u2082.\n\nGreen Technology Certification\n\nWe continuously enhance energy efficiency in our products through technological developments, obtaining green technology certifications accredited by the South Korean government. Over the past decade, starting 2010, we have obtained 10 green technology certifications. A total of 202 models have earned a Confirmation of Green Technology Product, a certification given to commercial products using green technology.\n\nCase: Monitor Standby Power Saving Technology\n\nSamsung T45F Series monitor alleviated the loss from power transition by applying the \u201cSelf Wake-up\u201d feature on the power circuit. This application made the monitor\u2019s standby power decrease to 0.000W-0.005W, the industry\u2019s lowest levels. Users can minimize the electric power consumption without having to unplug the power cable even when they are away from the monitor for many hours.\nReducing GHG Emission from Other Areas\n\nManaging and Supporting Suppliers\nWe have been part of the CDP Supply Chain Program since 2019, to closely monitoring GHG emissions from our primary suppliers, encouraging them to use more renewable energy.\n\n1) CDP: Carbon Disclosure Project\n\nOptimizing Logistics Efficiency\nWe pursue various efficiency-related goals throughout our product delivery process, such as optimizing delivery routes, improving load efficiency, and streamlining delivery management. In 2020, despite the surge in delivery loads, we managed to reduce a total of 6.68 million tonnes of GHG, a 19% decreased from that of 2019.\n\nMinimizing Business Trips and Encouraging Video Conference\nIn 2020, business trips of our employees were restricted due to the pandemic. Naturally, GHG emissions from business trips decreased by about 87% compared to 2019. Meanwhile, we encouraged the use of video conference systems. During 2020, about 200,000 video conference meetings an average of 559 video conference meetings per day were held. This was an increase of about 9% from the number of video conferences held in 2019. We will continue to improve accessibility and convenience of video conference meetings.\n\nAccelerating the Transition to Electric Vehicles\nBy taking part in the K-EV100 campaign by the Ministry of Environment of South Korea, our plan is to ensure our entire fleet of corporate vehicles in Korean worksites is electric by 2030. The vehicles to be replaced include corporate sedans, shuttle buses, and cargo trucks. In addition, we plan to increase the number of electric vehicle charging stations at our worksites.\n\nCollaborative Response to Climate Change\n\nDelivering Low-carbon, Eco-conscious Cookstoves\nSince 2017, we have supplied low-carbon, eco-conscious cookstoves to the Mombasa region and the UN Refugee Agency\u2019s (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) Kakuma camp in Kenya. Bioethanol, produced by fermenting sugar waste from the sugar production process, is used to fuel cookstoves as it is six times more energy efficient compared to charcoal. As a result, it decreases a substantial amount of GHG emission.\n\nAcquiring Carbon Credits\nOur bioethanol cookstove activity in Kenya has registered as a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project managed by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) thereby earning carbon credits issued in proportion to the amount of GHG reduction. As of 2020, we delivered more than 10,000 cookstoves to Kenya, securing carbon credits for about 200 thousand tonnes of CO\u2082e. In South Korea, we acquire carbon credits by processing landfill gases emitted from large-scale waste landfills and reducing N\u2082O generated in external production processes.\n\nGHG Emissions\nOur GHG emission target for 2020 was 1.55 tonnes of CO\u2082e/KRW 100 million, which was a 70% reduction from 5.17 tonnes of CO\u2082e/KRW 100 million in 2008.\n\nIn 2020, we saw an increase in GHG emissions compared to 2019, as we expanded the operation of our new semiconductor production line and product output. Naturally our GHG emissions, relative to our sales revenue, recorded 3.2 tonnes of CO\u2082e/KRW 100 million, a 5.1% increase from 2019.\n\nWe will continue to put our efforts into reducing GHG emissions through a systematic approach such as increasing the use of renewable energy, enhancing the efficiency of process gas treatment, developing alternative gases, and replacing existing equipment with high-efficiency equipment.\n\nCase: Industry-wide Collaboration for \u201cCarbon Neutrality\u201d\nWe participated in the Semiconductor & Display Carbon Neutrality Commission alongside other companies in the semiconductor and visual display industries such as SK Hynix, Samsung Display, and LG Display. Together we pledged to lead the change towards a carbon neutral future by focusing on increasing renewable energy use, speeding up the transition to electric cars, and achieving energy efficiency innovation. The Commission will continue discussions on joint goals such as the development of GHG emission control technologies and eco-conscious process gas. In addition, we joined major electronics and power companies such as LG Electronics, Samsung Electro-Mechanics, LG Innotek, Samsung SDI, and LG Energy Solution, in announcing the joint declaration for carbon neutrality, reaffirming our commitment to achieve carbon neutrality goals. To work towards carbon neutrality, we will be engaging in joint projects and increase mutual cooperation.\n\nAnnual GHG Emissions (Unit: 1,000 tonnes of CO\u2082e)\n\n| Year | Direct Emissions (Scope 1) | Indirect Emissions (Scope 2) |\n|------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 2018 | 10,296                    | 4,855                       |\n| 2019 | 8,733                     | 5,067                       |\n| 2020 | 9,079                     | 5,726                       |\n\n1) GHG emissions calculated by measuring the total amount of renewable energy used (market-based)\nCircular Economy\n\nProtecting the world\u2019s natural resources is our priority. That is why we actively support a Circular Economy to increase the use of re-used and recycled materials, instead of a Linear Economy, which is based on one-time consumption. As such, we have established Circular Economy Principles to promote various activities that can be applied to the entire product life cycle, including developing re-use/recyclable products, enhancing repair mechanism, and taking back e-waste.\n\nCircular Economy Principles\n\nEfficient Use of Resources\n\nRenewable or Recycled Materials\n\nWe use recycled plastics in various product lines ranging from refrigerators to washing machines, air conditioners, TVs, monitors, and mobile chargers. We use more than 30,000 tonnes of recycled plastics annually, including Post Consumer Materials (PCM) - plastics recycled from e-waste. In 2020, we used approximately 31,000 tonnes of recycled plastic, bringing the total amount of recycled plastics used in product manufacturing to 276,000 tonnes since 2009. We plan to use a total of 250,000 tonnes of recycled plastics from 2021 to 2030 by continuously increasing the use of recycled plastics.\n\nEco-Package\n\nTo reduce the environmental effect of packaging, we are replacing product packaging with paper and recycled materials from plastics and vinyl. We are also making efforts to reduce GHG generated during transport processes through smaller and lighter packaging materials. For paper packaging, we use FSC certified paper and recycled paper.\n\nWe applied the concept of upcycling for TV and home appliances product packaging materials, enabling customers to use boxes to make various items, such as pet products and small furniture. By scanning the QR code printed on the boxes, customers can check for instructions on making various products. Thanks to the application of a dot matrix design on each side of the cardboard packaging boxes, customers can cut the boxes more easily and assemble them into their preferred shapes.\n\nFor all Galaxy smartphones, 100% of the papers used for product packaging are made from either recycled papers or papers certified by the Forest Stewardship Council for sustainable sourcing. Galaxy S21 packaging is only 4% plastic by weight, and by reducing the weight of the packaging to just 51% of Galaxy S7 packaging, we have reduced the costs associated with production of packaging materials and transportation.\n\nWe aim to improve the structure of packaging materials in semiconductors to make them easier to recycle and re-use, and to replace packaging materials in all products with sustainable materials. In 2020, all plastic packaging materials for portable SSDs were replaced with paper, and by 2022, all packaging materials for consumer SSDs will be converted to paper or recycled biomaterials.\n\nModular Design\n\nThe BESPOKE refrigerator, which incorporates a modular design, allows customers to create new designs simply by replacing door panels without having to replace the entire refrigerator, thereby reducing unnecessary resource waste. The Wind-Free Cube Air Purifier, our separable and combinable modular air purifier, enables users to configure units in line with their desired capacity. Additional units may be purchased if necessary, enabling a more efficient use of resource.\n\nExtending Product Lifespan\n\nDurability\n\nDuring the product development stage, we conduct a very rigorous durability tests that meet international requirements. These tests assess resilience, drop resistance, waterproof capability, and lifespan so that our customers can continue to enjoy the same level of performance for a long time. We also conduct our own durability tests, such as free-fall tests, against various types of floor materials from various angles and various waterproof conditions.\n\nReparability\n\nReparability is one of the basic factors that we consider when manufacturing products. We conduct research to develop products that are easy to disassemble, cost-effective for repair, and are comprised of easily recycled parts.\n\nCase: Obtaining the Highest Rating in France\u2019s Reparability Index\n\nStarting January 2021, all electronic devices sold in France are labeled with the reparability rating according to the reparability index (Indice de r\u00e9parabilit\u00e9). Various smartphone models, such as the Galaxy S21, and all drum washing machine models have obtained the highly coveted dark green badge. Going forward, we plan to provide more information, such as repair manuals, to all of our consumers in the future, and continue our efforts to provide reasonably priced materials and facilitate the seamless supply of parts.\n\nSoftware Update\n\nIn August 2020, we announced plans to expand support for up to three generations of Android OS upgrades on Galaxy mobile devices. For example, the Galaxy S20 lineup powered by Android 10 will be supported with three OS upgrades starting with Android 11. With the extended support, we expect our customers to enjoy Galaxy mobile devices more reliably for an extended period of time.\nRepair Service\nAn accurate product diagnosis followed by a speedy repair all add up to prolonging a product\u2019s lifespan and improving its performance, which subsequently enhances resource efficiency. We are increasing consumer accessibility to our services by operating both global and region-optimized distribution networks, as well as enhancing customer convenience by offering digital services.\n\nGlobally-operated Service Channel \u2013 Service Centers\nIn 2020, we operated 12,386 service centers in 183 countries to increase customer convenience worldwide. Managers and repair engineers provide optimized services to customers in accordance with our service process guide. In addition to product maintenance, we provide training programs such as product usage instructions and the implementation of new product features to our customers.\n\nRegion-optimized Service Channel\nExtended Service Hours During Ramadan in the Middle East\nWe offer customized services that take into account the lifestyles of our customers in the Middle East during Ramadan, one of the biggest celebrations in the Islamic Calendar. While fasting during daytime, we deliver repaired products to our customers so that they do not have to wait. We also extend our service hours until midnight considering that activities begin in the evening.\n\nSmart Service Booth during Lebaran in Indonesia\nIn response to heavy traffic during Lebaran, one of Indonesia\u2019s major national holidays, we set up smart service booths at airports and rest areas along highways where customers could have their devices tested and software upgraded.\n\nDifferentiated Services\nVideo Consulting\nIn 2019, we began operating video consulting services where our contact center agents directly observe products used by customers as well as the environment in which they are used. Customers can receive assistance through a link via SMS without having to install an additional application. The agents provide immediate assistance or initiate a repair process, saving our customers repair time and cost. In 2020, we provided this service in 40 countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Spain, India and Brazil.\n\nVisible ARS\nWe provide visible ARS service to enable our customers to access the service on their smartphone screens after calling our service call centers. Through this, we expect to increase convenience for elderly customers or users with hearing loss. In 2020, this service operated in South Korea, Australia and Thailand, and we plan to expand service areas in the future.\n\nChatbots for Automated Consulting\nWe run a chatbot service that provides timely assistance 24 hours a day, throughout the week. Established in 2017 by Samsung Research, the AI-powered chatbot service is available in six countries, including South Korea, the United States, and the United Kingdom as of 2020.\n\nSign Language Service\nWe provide sign language services for customers with hearing disabilities. Ever since the launch in Turkey in 2015, this service is currently available in six countries as of 2020.\n\nService Quality Management\nStandardized Service Operation and On-site Audit\nFor service centers and contact centers, we provide streamlined services with defined work standards and process guidelines. Each subsidiary offers customized training based on a localized version of the global guideline, and we share the manuals through the Customer Service Portal, our system for sharing information concerning customer service. In addition, we conduct periodic on-site assessments to check if services are provided in line with the standardized process and make necessary improvements.\n\nService Skills Training\nWe offer training programs to our service center managers and repair engineers on new product repair techniques and customer response, as well as country-specific or product-specific remote video or collective training sessions. Managers and repair engineers can check for what they need by accessing training clips and technical materials any time.\nTake-back and E-waste recycling\n\nWe support the circular economy by promoting take-back and recycling of e-waste and run diverse recycling programs in 55 countries, including South Korea. Since we opened the Asan Recycling Center, South Korea\u2019s first comprehensive recycling center for e-waste, in 1998, we established e-waste take-back systems in regional logistics centers. Outside South Korea, we promote take back and e-waste recycling, taking into account regional characteristics when partnering with recycling associations and recycling companies.\n\nThe collected e-waste is used as raw materials for metals, plastics, etc., through processes such as sorting, pre-treatment and crushing. Some of the raw materials, such as plastic, are used in manufacturing new products. We have also established guidance in Samsung Requirements for Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Managing, which includes matters concerning compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, satisfaction with requirements for suppliers and prohibition of illegal export of waste.\n\nTake-back and Recycle Achievements\n\nFrom 2009 to 2020, we collected a total of 4.54 million tonnes of e-waste and the amount has increased continuously for the past three years. Our Asan Recycling Center in South Korea, gathered 29,435 tonnes of valuable resources in 2019, including copper, aluminum, steel, and plastic.\n\nWe reused some 3,366 tonnes of recycled plastics collected from e-waste in product manufacturing. Through these efforts, we have reduced the amount of plastic waste and the use of petrochemical raw materials needed to manufacture new products.\n\nCumulated Amount of Collected E-waste\n\n| Year | Amount (Unit: 10,000 tonnes) |\n|------|-----------------------------|\n| 2018 | 355                         |\n| 2019 | 403                         |\n| 2020 | 454                         |\n\n1) Cumulative from 2009  \u25cf Take-back in the calendar year  \u25cf Cumulative take-back\nWaste\nWe are continuously improving the manufacturing and product design process to minimize waste. All our global worksites monitor the amount of waste generated and recycled every month. If a target is not fully met, we focus on improving the recycling rate by analyzing ways to process waste. In 2020, we achieved 95% of waste recycling rate. We will make continuous efforts to receive Zero-Waste to Landfill certification for all of our global manufacturing worksites.\n\nDevelopment of Waste Treatment Technology and Process Innovation\nTo promote a resource circulation system towards zero waste to landfill, we strive to develop waste processing technologies and increase waste separation.\n\nReduction of Landfill Waste\nWe have applied recycling technology to produce crude copper (97%) by extracting copper from wastewater sludge that was previously disposed in a landfill. Furthermore, we are currently developing technology to extract tungsten from dust extracted in clean rooms. We also developed technology to recycle crushed Epoxy Molding Compound (EMC), which is created during the semiconductor packing process, as a plastic raw material to help us improve our efforts in waste recycling.\n\nReduction of Incinerated Waste\nTo reduce waste incineration, we have increased waste separation and disposal of waste synthetic resin and recycled it as solid fuel. As a result, we have recycled approximately 1,650 tonnes of waste synthetic resin annually.\n\nIncreasing Added Value of Waste\nDuring the semiconductor manufacturing process, wastewater sludge is constantly generated. We recycle all wastewater sludge as raw material for cement manufacturing.\n\nCase: All Semiconductor Worksites Certified with Zero-Waste to Landfill\nAll of our semiconductor worksites achieved more than a 97% rate of recycled waste and received Zero-Waste to Landfill certification from Underwriters Laboratories (UL), a global safety certification company. In particular, the Samsung DSR building in Hwaseong, is validated for Zero-Waste to Landfill at the Platinum level, which is the highest level, for reaching a 100% rate of recycled waste. Furthermore, our Gumi worksite which manufactures smartphones also achieved Zero-Waste to Landfill certification and is the first workplace in South Korea that manufactures finished products to earn Zero-Waste to Landfill certification.\n\nTo increase the value of waste, we are developing a new recycling technology using fluorine components in sludge as auxiliary raw materials for the steel making process. We plan to complete the development of this technology and put into mass production by 2021. Additionally, we are developing technology to recycle waste liquid from the semiconductor manufacturing process as cement plaster or cement remover.\n\nWater Resource\nWater resources are critical for the production of our products and the operation of our worksites, but they are also linked to natural disasters such as floods and droughts. The use and treatment of water resources can affect local biodiversity of worksites, which is why cooperation with the local communities is a necessity. We discuss the water resource related agenda in our EHS Council held by each worksite on a regular basis, and we escalate the agenda to the Sustainability Council if action is needed.\n\nWater Resource Policy\n\nWater-Risk Assessment\nEvery year, we assess whether our locations are in water-stressed or water-risk areas, and separate water-risks at each location to develop and enforce countermeasures. We use water management tools developed by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) to identify water-stressed or water-risk regions. We also use the tools developed by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF) and World Resource Institute (WRI) to identify water-stress of water basins near our worksites and water-risks every ten years. Furthermore, we also use CDP\u2019s Water Guidance to respond with risk-specific strategies.\n\nStrategy to Tackle Water-risk by Region\n\nStatus of Worksites with Water-risk (as of 2020) (Unit: 1,000 tonnes)\n\n| No. of Worksites | Amount of Water Intake | Amount of Water Discharged |\n|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Total            | 36                     | 142,294                   | 109,201                   |\n| Water-risk regions | 14^1                  | 107,382                   | 84,101                    |\n\n1) Number of worksites by water-risk region: South Korea (10), India (2), Egypt (1), South Africa (1)\n\nCDP Water Report\n**Water Management Process**\n\nWe minimize water consumption while increasing the rate of water re-use by wastewater purification. To increase water re-use in the manufacturing process, we first classify water resources into four categories: sewage, wastewater, industrial water, and ultra-pure water. Each worksite tracks the amount of water reused in each category, and manages the status through the Global Environment, Health & Safety System (G-EHS system) every month.\n\nWe also installed underground water pollution prevention facilities, and safely processed discharged water through internal and external facilities. When discharging used water directly into a stream through our in-house treatment facilities, we apply internal requirements that go beyond required legal standards.\n\n**Water Use Reduction Activities**\n\nWe strive to maximize water reuse rates through everyday reduction efforts, such as optimizing our worksites, replacing old valves, and improving operation standards. We also pursue structural improvements, such as improving our manufacturing processes and establishing recycling systems.\n\nAt our semiconductor plants with high water usage, we changed the process of control values, switched wastewater treatment methods and optimized operations. Due to these efforts, we reduced an average of 4,953 tonnes of water each day. In 2020, we reused 70,181 thousand tonnes of water, a 1.2% increase compared to that of last year.\n\n---\n\n**Case:** Samsung Semiconductor Site in Hwaseong Earned Reducing Water Year on Year Certification\n\nOur DS division was recognized for its unwavering efforts to efficiently manage water resources with an award for \u201cReducing Water Year on Year\u201d in 2020 \u2013 the first in the global semiconductor industry. Samsung Hwaseong Campus, which houses the company\u2019s semiconductor manufacturing and R&D facilities, has been awarded the \u201cReducing Water Year on Year\u201d certification by the UK\u2019s Carbon Trust. The certification recognizes organizations with the best approach for using water in worksites for three years as well as each water resource management system. Our Hwaseong Campus reduced its water usage from an average of 50.15 million tonnes during the years between 2017 and 2018 to about 49.11 million tonnes in 2019. This was a decrease of about 1.04 million tonnes of water. The reduction amount is equivalent to the amount of water that about 200,000 people can use for a month.\n\n---\n\n**Case:** Improving the Ecological Environment \u2013 Reviving Osan Stream\n\nOsan Stream, which flows for 15km from Yongin to Pyeongtaek, was once a degraded stretch river, with dwindling supplies of fresh water. Local communities, environmental groups, and Samsung Electronics have gathered to save Osan Stream, and since 2007, we have purified water used in the semiconductor manufacturing process more strictly than the water quality standards guided by the government. We have released an average of 45,000 tonnes of water into Osan Stream per day, and as a result, the ecological environment of Osan Stream was greatly improved to the extent that rare otters, wild animals that only inhabit clean rivers, were found.\nRiver Biodiversity Conservation Activities\nOur worksites in South Korea periodically measure water quality indicators, such as chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and acidity (pH scale), to monitor ecological effects in surrounding streams of worksites.\n\nChemical Management\nTo protect our consumers and employees, we are committed to minimizing the harmful chemical substances that may be used in our manufacturing lines or included in our products.\n\nEcological Impact Analysis on Nearby Streams\n\n| Measurement Authority | Kyung Hee University |\n|-----------------------|----------------------|\n| Key Findings          |                      |\n|                       | Fish found: 1,493 individuals of 12 species (carp 88%, mudskipper 5%) |\n|                       | Ecosystem benthic invertebrates were observed (insects 45%, dominant species: Ophra 40%) |\n|                       | Ecotoxicity: The effluent water had no impact on the stream studied |\n\n| Measurement Authority | Korea Eco Environment Institute (KEEI) |\n|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Key Findings          |                                      |\n|                       | Fish found: 169 individuals of 14 species (crucian carp 36%, carp 16%) |\n|                       | Ecosystem benthic invertebrates were observed (insects 64%, dominant species: Cheumatopsyche 12%) |\n|                       | Ecotoxicity: The effluent water had no impact on the stream studied |\n\n| Measurement Authority | Pyeongtaek University |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Key Findings          |                       |\n|                       | Fish found: 195 individuals of 10 species (dominant species: crucian carp; subdominant species: carp) |\n|                       | Ecosystem benthic invertebrates were observed (dominant species: red midge; subdominant species: tubifex) |\n|                       | Ecotoxicity: The effluent water had no impact on the stream studied |\n\nWe incorporate international environmental regulations, including the EU\u2019s Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive and the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) when setting company-wide standards to ensure the highest level of control and regulations on chemical substances.\n\nChemical Substances in Products\nWe perform comprehensive pre-inspection and follow-up management for parts and raw materials in order to strictly manage chemical substances that may be included in our products. We ensure the highest level of control through the Standards for Control of Substances used in Products, which incorporates international environmental regulations. In addition, we are committed to reducing the use of substances of concern, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC), brominated flame retardants (BFRs), and allergic dyes. We also operate the Environment Chemicals Integrated Management System (e-CIMS), designed to detect any restricted substances in the components and products of our suppliers so that we can ensure the safety of our products.\n\nEco-Life Lab for Environmental Analysis\nWe have been operating an environmental analysis laboratory that can analyze RoHS regulations (on the six substances) since 2004 and increased the number of monitored materials that may be of risk, ensuring they are not included in our products. In order to renew our focus on analyzing microorganisms that may cause odors, we have reorganized the laboratory and established an Eco-Life Lab in 2020. The laboratory has expanded the research scope to determine the root causes of odors from our products and devise solutions to these problems. Eco-Life Lab has been certified by T\u00dcV Rheinland, an international product testing institute and Germany\u2019s Federal Institute for Materials and Testing (BAM).\n\nChemical Substances in Manufacturing Processes\nAccording to the laws and regulations of each country and our company-wide list of regulated substances, the use of chemical substances is strictly regulated at all worksites. In addition, we support a range of activities to ensure our suppliers and partner companies use chemicals in safe working conditions, such as regular on-site inspections and working environment improvement efforts. To ensure the safe management of chemical substances, we conduct regular training for those who handle chemicals and inspect chemical storage and handling facilities. In addition, we formulate protective measures to be enforced in chemical handling facilities based on diagnoses provided by environmental safety experts. Furthermore, we have a three-step management strategy to minimize the use of chemical substances: creating substitute substances, decreasing chemical concentration levels, and eliminating the use of chemical substances where possible.\n\nChemical Management Process\nWe systematically manage every stage of our chemical use from purchase to disposal. Employees who deal with chemicals at each of our worksites are required to request a preliminary evaluation to the expert group prior to purchase. We purchase and use chemicals only after they have been assessed as adequate for use. In 2020, we carried out a total of 7,829 preliminary evaluations.\n\nAfter chemical substances enter our inventory, we track the entire process from checking exact use amounts and stockpiles to disposing of chemical waste. After use, we ensure that chemical waste is disposed safely through separate chemical waste disposal procedures.\n\nStrengthened Control of Chemical Substances in Semiconductor Worksites\nTo minimize the damage in case of a chemical accident, we have applied more stringent guidelines on chemical substances in all buildings on our semiconductor worksites. We improved the process by requiring in-depth inspection of each piece of equipment and implemented a system to detect and escalate chemical leakage incidents. We also applied stricter physical steps such as automating chemical injection and deploying disaster prevention and fire extinguishing equipment.\n\nWe also improved a system that detects chemical leakage at multiple locations from inside and outside of buildings, rainwater downpipes, and outer fences around worksites. With the strengthened detection and response system, we were able to minimize the danger posed by potential chemical accidents.\n\nStandards for Control of Substances used in Products\nREACH SVHC (Substances of Very High Concern) Declaration\nList of Regulated Substances in Manufacturing Processes\nEmpowering Communities\n\nWe play an active role in our commitment to corporate social responsibility and welcome our duty to improve the livelihood of local communities and to contribute to a better future for all.

In July 2020, we delivered a remote AI ethics training program to all Samsung Cambridge AI Center (SAIC-Cambridge). Based on the success of this training, we plan to establish an AI ethics curriculum and provide training to our employees in other regions.\n\nPartnership on AI Ethics\n\nWe collaborate with various stakeholders to enhance our understanding of AI\u2019s social impact and ensure it is used in socially responsible ways. By joining Partnership on AI (PAI), an international initiative on AI ethics in 2018, we regularly participate in discussions with subject-specific expert groups, preparing for responsible AI implementation and establishing best practices. We are also a member of the Public-Private Council on User Protection in Intelligent Information Society in South Korea. This tackles user protection in the domestic intelligent information society, and we engage with users, experts, and related companies about the use of intelligent information services such as AI.\n\nSamsung Electronics Obtains \"AI+\" Certification for Home Appliances\n\nOur JetBot AI-powered robotic vacuum, BESPOKE Family Hub refrigerator, Grande AI washer and dryer, our wall-mounted and floor-standing AI Wind-Free air conditioner have all received the AI+ certification from the Korean Standards Association.\n\nAI+ certification was created by the Korea Standards Association with reference to international standards of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) to verify the quality of products that incorporated AI technology. This recognition is a verification from KSA, a reliable third-party entity, that our products have been evaluated on whether the AI algorithm application functions properly and went through a sufficient review process. This is significant in a sense that it demonstrates one of the important elements in AI ethics, technical robustness and safety.\n\nCase: AI Ethics Applied to Bixby Service\n\nBixby, our virtual assistant that makes it easier to use your phone, is designed and operated with AI ethics in mind. We take caution in providing the service so that it does not create or intensify any unfair bias. Taking into account the laws and regulations in each country as well as societal ethics and consumer sentiments, we have established and put into practice our Sensitive Language Processing Policy and developed a Sensitive Language Database and a Sensitive Language Recognition Engine applied to our services. In addition, we continuously monitor social trends and issues and reflect any relevant changes in the database. Through this process, we work to ensure that Bixby provides both an ethically and socially responsible service to our users.\nAccessibility\n\nAll our products, content, and services are built around a human-centered philosophy that recognizes and embraces diversity and inclusion. We seek technological innovation to allow equal and convenient access to our products and services by all consumers. We apply the 4C Accessibility Design Principles when developing our products and services. With these principles, we created the \"Accessibility User Experience (UX) Design Guidelines\" and monitor how the accessibility principles are implemented.\n\nSamsung\u2019s 4C Accessibility Design Principles\n\n| Consideration | Comprehensiveness | Coherence | Co-creation |\n|---------------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|\n| Empathetically designed with attention to detail for all our users | Balanced and equally designed for all | Consistent design experience for all products | Designed together |\n\nAccessibility UX Design Guidelines\n\n| Vision | Hearing | Dexterity/ Mobility | Cognition |\n|--------|---------|---------------------|-----------|\n| - Provide for basic accessibility in device use | - Enable smooth communication and full expression of feelings | - Allow for one-handed operation | - Enable smooth communication and full expression of feelings |\n| - Improve voice feedback | - Facilitate communication through text messages | - Ensure clear and easy operation methods | - Allow for diminished attention and concentration capacities |\n| - Ensure features enhance users\u2019 awareness of their surroundings while walking | - Ensure features that enhance users\u2019 awareness of surroundings | - Enable accurate interaction | - Enable smooth communication and full expression of feelings |\n| - Allow users to enjoy pleasant experiences such as movies, music, and games | - Provide feedback for accessing information devices | - | |\n\nAccessibility Considerations During Product Development\n\nDuring the entire process of product and service development, we strive to enhance accessibility in various ways. Not only do we check inconveniences and apply solutions, but we also reflect regional restrictions, and accessibility standards on our products. We also continuously check to see if the products are aligned with our internally developed UX design guide and checklist. We work together with disability associations as well as our employees with disabilities, to support the development of accessibility features on our products. To provide better products and services for all, we will continue to look for comprehensive ways to improve accessibility by considering the entire life cycle of our products and services.\nAccessibility Highlights\n\n**TV**\n\n**Features**\n- **\u201cSeeColors\u201d application** immediately optimizes screen color for those who have difficulty in detecting color\n- **Enlarge sign language screen** automatically searches for a sign language with AI technology and allows users to enlarge the sign language screen by up to 200%\n- **Multi-Output Audio Functionality** allows family members with hearing difficulties to watch the TV together by differentiating volume output from the TV speaker and a Bluetooth device\n- **Relocate subtitle** allows viewers to relocate subtitles according to their needs\n- **Color inversion** inverts the colors of the text and background displayed on the TV screen for improved legibility\n\n**Activities, certifications, awards**\n- Received 5 awards for Accessibility by CES (2015-2018, 2021)\n- Received 2 Best of Innovation Awards for TV Accessibility features by CES (2016, 2021)\n- Our Smart TV was the first TV product to receive \u201cTried and Tested Accreditation\u201d from the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) in August 2020\n- In October 2020, we signed a business agreement with the Korea Blind Union to enhance accessibility of TV products\n- The Korea Communications Commission nominated Samsung Electronics as the supplier of the TV supply business for people with visual and auditory disabilities (2020-2021)\n\n**Home Appliances**\n\n**Features**\n- **Braille Labels and tactile point** were applied to buttons of major features so that they are easy to locate.

Not only does technology allow us to acquire knowledge but it also enhances communication, increasing work productivity and improving the quality of life. But, at the same time, there has been increased concerns about the increasing dependency on digital devices such as using mobile devices for many hours. As such, we have developed various digital well-being features to help users enjoy a healthy and well-balanced digital lifestyle.\n\nFour Values of Digital Wellbeing and the Corresponding Functions\n\n1. Digital detox\n   - Focus on the present\n   - Focus Mode: Pause or silence notifications\n     Focus Mode allows users to temporarily pause or silence notifications from selected applications when there is a need to focus on conversations with loved ones, a break from daily routines, or learning opportunities.\n     To help users focus and enhance productivity, this feature blocks notifications from certain applications. This is particularly useful when there is a need to concentrate, including reading, studying or even when enjoying some down time.\n\n2. Balance\n   - Well-balanced Usage Pattern\n   - Weekly Report: Provides analysis of application usage pattern\n   - Bedtime Mode: Pause all notifications that disturb users from sound sleep\n     Our devices provide a weekly report based on the accumulated application usage data. Users can check their sleeping patterns through sleep mode and block any notifications that keep them awake. In addition, the feature can adjust the screen to black and white and curb users from accessing their devices when the set sleep time approaches.\n\n3. Safety\n   - Recommendations for Safe and Healthy Enjoyment of Digital Devices\n   - Blue Light Filter, Volume Monitoring: Settings for comfortable vision and hearing\n   - Weekly Report: Provides analysis on digital usage pattern while driving\n     Blue light filter adjusts the light on the screen to avoid straining vision. Similarly, volume monitoring protects users from harming their hearing with the data that flags unusually loud volume. The weekly report allows users to check undetected dangerous habits such as using their cellphones while driving.\n\n4. Guard\n   - Healthy Digital Habit for Kids\n   - Samsung Kids: Only allows access to safe content and limits screen time\n     Users can easily activate the service by tapping on the Samsung Kids button on the quick panel. Once activated, children will be able to enjoy a wide variety of content, from creative games to help and inspiration in drawing pictures. Parents can also limit the time children spend on the device and protect them from harmful content.\n\nCase: Samsung\u2019s NEO QLED TVs wins Industry-First \u2018Eye Care\u2019 Certification from VDE\n\nSamsung\u2019s 2021 QLED TV lineup including the 2021 Neo QLED1 received the first-of-its-kind Eye Care certification from Verband Deutscher Elektrotechniker (VDE).\n\nEye Care certification is a comprehensive assessment that includes Safety for eyes, gentle to the eyes, flicker level, uniformity and color fidelity. Safety for eyes certification is assigned to products with the levels of emission of blue light, ultraviolet rays, and infrared rays that fall into the Exempt Group according to classification of emission limits set by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).\n\nThrough the certification, Samsung\u2019s QLED TVs have also been recognized for meeting the standards of picture quality uniformity and color fidelity, both elements of which evaluate content delivery performance.\n\n1) Models that have completed testing: QN900, QN800, QN95, QN90, QN85, Q80, Q70, Q60.\nOur Employees\n\nGuided by our management philosophy of \u201cPeople First,\u201d we uphold the values of human rights, diversity, and inclusion. Putting our values into action, we underpin our proactive approach that could violate human rights at our work sites by preemptively addressing tackling issues, and by our unwavering support for developing the skills and capabilities of our employees. We conduct an annual employee satisfaction survey to better understand the needs of our employees and to boost engagement and enhance our corporate culture. We also make various efforts to ensure safety in our workplaces, such as assessing our safety-first corporate culture, improving our work environment, and strengthening chemical substance management.\n\n\u201cSamsung Electronics puts human rights and the safety of our employees first. Samsung spares no support in helping our employees strike a healthy balance between work and life, so they can strengthen their capabilities to the fullest.\u201d\n\nKihong Na\nExecutive Vice President,\nHead of Corporate Human Resources Team\n\n6th in Corporate Human Rights Benchmark Rankings (in ICT Sector)\n1) The World Benchmarking Alliance, an international non-profit organization, assesses corporations\u2019 compliance with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n\nGrowth in Female Leadership:\n5-fold increase in female executives\n2-fold increase in female managers (compared to the numbers in 2010)\n\nThe Employee Satisfaction Score of 80% or above for 3 consecutive years (2018-2020)\nLabor & Human Rights\n\nWe respect the freedom and human rights to which all people are entitled. Based on the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), we have established our own framework to identify, prevent, mitigate and account for any adverse human rights impacts across our business activities. We expect our partners and suppliers to take the same approach to the rights of those with whom they work.\n\nLabor and Human Rights Policies\n\nWe work continuously on strengthening our labor and human rights management system. In June 2020, we amended our \u2018Child Labor Prohibition Policy\u2019 and \u2018Migrant Worker Policy\u2019, while stipulating the freedom of association in our Global Code of Conduct.\n\nChild Labor Prohibition Policy\n\nIn 2014, we collaborated with The Centre for Child Rights and Business to develop a child labor prohibition policy and a juvenile workers policy that would apply to our Chinese worksites. We partnered with The Centre again in 2020 to integrate the policies as well as amend and extend it to all of our worksites around the world, making explicit what was already practice.\n\nWe have a zero-tolerance policy for the use of child labor at all worksites and across our entire supply chain. To support the implementation of the policy, we have developed the \u2018Remediation for Child Labor\u2019 guidelines in collaboration with The Centre providing guidance in taking corrective measures if child labor is found to be working at any of our worksites or within our supply chain.\n\nMigrant Worker Policy\n\nIn 2016, we collaborated with BSR, a global non-profit organization specializing in human rights, to develop our Migrant Worker Policy. Since then, we\u2019ve updated the policy to reflect recent developments in international standards relating to migrant workers such as the International Labour Organization Definition of Recruitment Fees and Related Cost, as specified in the RBA-\u201cDefinition of Fees\u201d. We have a zero-tolerance policy towards workers paying fees for their employment and are committed to banning participation in or imposition of any form of forced labor. In addition, the provisions related to the prohibition of forced labor in the policy have already been applied not only to migrant workers, but also to all of our employees, expanding the scope of the provisions on forced labor to all employees.\n\nGlobal Code of Conduct\n\nIn 2020, to reinforce our policy on respecting the worker\u2019s rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining, we added a new clause to our Global Code of Conduct: \u201cThe Company will respect the rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining in accordance with the local labor laws where our worksites operate in order to maintain and develop our cooperative labor-management relations based on mutual trust and integrity.\u201d\n\nLabor and Human Rights Training\n\nEvery year, we provide labor and human rights training customized to the needs and characteristics of each worksite, with the goal of raising employee awareness on labor and human rights and to ensure compliance with our policies.\n\nTraining in Progress\n\nOur in-house human rights experts, in collaboration with BSR, developed a labor and human rights training course for all employees in 2020. The training contains different content according to employee job position and function, but all programs aim to address all labor and human rights topics including what labor and human rights employees naturally have, why labor and human rights matter to business, what our company\u2019s and employees\u2019 responsibilities are with regard to respecting labor and human rights, and how to bring labor and human rights into practice.\n\nDue to the COVID 19 pandemic, we concentrated on offering the course at all South Korean workplaces as well as overseas sales offices and R&D centers where online education was possible. As a result, 100% of employees in South Korea and 95% of employees in sales and R&D centers outside of Korea completed the labor and human rights training.\n\nIn 2021, the labor and human rights training for our overseas production sites resumed in compliance with the strict COVID-19 safety guidelines of respective countries and worksites, which were previously postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHuman Rights Due Diligence\n\nWe actively pursue additional ways to conduct due diligence. This includes online audits to maintain a sustainable and efficient due diligence system that reflects changes in social, geopolitical, and environmental issues, including COVID-19.\n\nThird-Party RBA Audits\n\nIn 2020, restrictions as a result of COVID-19 lockdowns and border closures challenged due diligence activities. Despite that, we conducted RBA VAP at five sites in Korea and four overseas sites after carefully considering the COVID-19 situation in each country, the feasibility of third-party audit firms approved by RBA and the safety of our employees. As a result, a total of five sites including those in Indonesia, Thailand, China, and Korea (two sites) received RBA platinum recognition by attaining the full score of 200 points, three sites received gold recognition, and one site achieved silver recognition.\n\n1) Validated Assessment Program\n\n* Check the RBA VAP assessment standards\n\nWe conducted audits of the four regional subsidiaries that hire migrant workers \u2013 Malaysia, Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland \u2013 to assess their compliance with the guidelines. All complied with the applicable policies and guidelines without exception. We will continue to perform audits to assess the adherence of these internal guidelines for our Migrant Worker Policy and to identify potential gaps and work towards closure of those gaps.\n\nHuman Rights Champions 50\n\nIn 2020, we selected more than 50 employees, most of whom are HR (Human Resource), ER (Employee Relations), and LND (learning and development) staff at our overseas subsidiaries to cultivate them as Human Rights Champions. After certification through completing the Human Rights Champion Course co-designed by Samsung Electronics and BSR and passing the final exam in 2020, the Champions have become certified lecturers on human rights at each of their worksites. They are empowered to identify potential human rights-related risks at their worksites, engage with their peers and provide a human rights lens to their respective functions and relevant advice, where needed. Our global human rights experts recruited from outside conduct regular webinars to further educate them on priority human rights topics, helping the Champions in fulfilling their positions as human rights champions for their respective subsidiaries.\n\nHuman Rights Champion Interviews\n\nLan Phuong Bui, Corporate Affairs, Samsung Vietnam Manufacturing Complex\n\nChristina Shepherd, Talent Development Team, Samsung Austin Semiconductor, USA\n\nJesse Estevam Derzi Da Silva, Education Development Team, Samsung Electronics Brazil \u2013 Manaus\n\nWhat makes the Human Rights Champion community unique is that we learn and grow together in our efforts to understand the different realities, being more vigilant to potential and new forms of violations, to reflect on and provide human rights lens to operational issues, to bring in good practices from externally, to provide confidence, guidance and motivation to our colleagues to do better.\n\nThe results can either be immediate in our everyday operation or it may take longer time to see bigger changes, but this is a very inspiring learning process for individual members and for the company. We are committed to doing so through nurturing a healthy communication and \u2018sharing is caring\u2019 culture across the functions of our business.\n\nHuman rights are the foundational element of any diversity and inclusion initiative, which is a key focus area for our subsidiary. The Human Rights Champion program has allowed me insight into the full range of issues affecting Samsung subsidiaries globally. Communicating not only our local practices but also increasing awareness of Samsung\u2019s global focus is important for both employees and prospective hires. By serving as a Human Rights Champion, I can help communicate the company\u2019s commitment to worker\u2019s rights and responsible sourcing. I can show how Samsung is acting upon its values of People, Integrity and Co-Prosperity, which builds employee pride and engagement.\n\nBeing a Human Rights Champion is a great opportunity and responsibility. We received deep knowledge through training given by our internal human rights experts and BSR as well as regular, on-going deep dive sessions. We have the mission of contributing to strengthen relationships characterized by trust within the company and in the construction of a more ethical and inclusive workplace. As Human Rights Champion, I have in a team-effort trained our factory workers on human rights and look forward to train employees further to better support them in understanding their rights, thereby increasing the engagement and retention of talents. I also hope to contribute to the advancement of our business, the creation of new opportunities and the positive strengthening of the brand.\n\nEstablishing the Internal Guide for \u201cMigrant Worker Policy\u201d and Self-Assessment\n\nAfter amending the Migrant Worker Policy, Samsung Electronics developed internal guidelines providing detailed steps towards the effective implementation of international principles outlined in the policy, related examples and guidelines for HR team members and managers at recruiting agencies who are responsible for hiring and handling migrant workers at our workplaces. Those guidelines are built on recommendations such as from the RBA, BSR, and IHRB. Starting from hiring and ending with the termination of the employment contract, the guidelines cover a total of 14 phases.\n\n1) IHRB (Institute for Human Rights and Business): An international think tank on business and human rights.\n\nThe ethical hiring process in the internal guide for migrant worker policy\n\nWe conducted audits of the four regional subsidiaries that hire migrant workers \u2013 Malaysia, Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland \u2013 to assess their compliance with the guidelines. All complied with the applicable policies and guidelines without exception. We will continue to perform audits to assess the adherence of these internal guideline for our Migrant Worker Policy and to identify potential gaps and work towards closure of those gaps.\nStakeholder Engagement\n\nWe engage with stakeholders through various channels, addressing our position on their interests as well as our major activities. We also communicate with our employees to ensure that we respect employees\u2019 rights and improve employees\u2019 working conditions.\n\nMulti-Stakeholder Forum\n\nSince 2018, it has become a tradition to host the annual multi-stakeholder forum in Vietnam with the aim to proactively engage with key stakeholders as well as to explore synergies on collaboration prospects. In 2020, we co-hosted the third \u201cSamsung Multi-Stakeholder Forum\u201d with the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI) and the Vietnam General Confederation of Labour (VGCL).\n\nTo accommodate COVID-19-related restrictions, the panel discussions were held in a studio and live-streamed online. A total of 270 diverse stakeholders from the government, NGOs, corporations, labor groups and media attended the 2020 forum.\n\nThe 2020 forum discussed the following themes, \u201cResponsible crisis management & resilient leadership in time of crisis: lessons learned from COVID-19 pandemic\u201d, \u201cManpower for resilience, post-crisis recovery and rebuild\u201d and \u201cTechnology for resilience, post-crisis recovery & rebuild\u201d. The themes were based on stakeholder feedback. Prior to the gathering, the forum collected stakeholder questions for panelists, resulting in increased attention and more active participation.\n\nThe forum also featured the videos of Samsung Electronics\u2019 efforts for the COVID-19 prevention, our employees\u2019 voices wishing for the end of the pandemic, and Samsung Electronics Vietnam (SEV)\u2019s choir titled \u201cThank you, Vietnam\u201d. These videos sent a clear message to stakeholders outside the company that we put a top priority on our employees\u2019 health and safety in the COVID-19 situation.\n\nMany external stakeholders appreciated the forum saying, \u201cThe consistent between the forum\u2019s theme and sessions and the panelists\u2019 expertise were outstanding, and the diverse voices and professional views were of great help to all participants.\u201d As we prepare for the 2021 forum, we will chose the forum\u2019s theme by gathering input from various stakeholders and enhance our engagement.\n\nAssessing the Effectiveness of Grievance Resolution Procedures\n\nThe grievance resolution process of SEV was evaluated from August to December in 2020 as a follow-up action to the Human Rights Impact Assessment conducted with BSR in 2018. The effectiveness assessment was carried out by an external organization, CSR Europe, to ensure objectivity of the evaluation.\n\nSEV received high evaluation scores in most areas which were assessed based on the eight effectiveness criteria of non-judicial grievance mechanisms specified in Clause 31 of the UNGPs. SEV was recognized in particular for providing a variety of grievance reporting platforms, for raising awareness among employees and providing transparency throughout the process as well as considering workers preferences when remediating cases. Grievance mechanisms have furthermore been found to allow for open dialogue with employees and provide clearly defined roles and responsibilities for grievance handling. SEV is continuing to make efforts such as developing social networking platforms for grievance reporting, further strengthening the hotline infrastructure and reinforcing the promotion of the grievance reporting channels to allow for a more accessible dialogue with its employees.\n\nCommunication with Global Investors\n\nBy hosting the ESG roadshows, we have been showcasing our key activities, such as the development of human rights related policies and our Human Rights Impact Assessment, and accounting for how we address human rights issues to our global investors.\n\nWe held a Q&A session in 2020 to discuss the human rights risk management across our supply chain and the audit results of our partners and suppliers as well as to share our plan for future activities. We will reflect investor feedback received into our strategies and activities for our long-term management and will continue to improve the engagement with our key investors by using a variety of communication channels.\n\nCommunication with Employees\u2019 Committee\n\nLabor Unions\n\nWe have a total of 32 labor unions formed at our worksites around the world. We negotiate working conditions with the labor unions and sign collective agreements on agreed items in accordance with the laws and regulations of the respective countries.\n\nWorks Councils\n\nA total of 36 worksites around the world operate works councils according to the laws of respective countries and the requirements of each worksite. Employees elect their representatives under the principles of direct and anonymous voting.\nGrievance Resolution\nWe recognize that a grievance, understood as a perceived injustice evoking an individual\u2019s or a group\u2019s sense of entitlement according to UNGPs, can be any kind of proposal or claim raised by our employees, including complaints about their working environment.\n\nGrievance Resolution Channels and Status\nWe operate various grievance channels depending on the characteristics of each worksite, including hotline, online, offline, and employee committees. An employee with a grievance can file a report anonymously. In addition, worksites employing migrant workers provide information on grievance resolution channels in their native languages to enhance employee accessibility and grievance channel effectiveness.\n\nAlthough offline grievance submissions decreased in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual channels such as online channels and hotline calls increased. Furthermore, we have seen a rise in complaints about occupational health and safety, such as requests to increase disease prevention activities at our workplaces and improving our working environment to comply with social distancing restrictions.\n\nCase: Grievance Resolution in Brazil\nIn 2020, the number of domestic violence reports sent through the hotline of Samsung Electronics Da Amazonia in Campinas, Brazil increased by 50% compared to the previous year. We became aware that many female workers were having trouble performing their duties due to domestic violence and we took steps to protect and support them. When a domestic violence grievance is reported to us, we appoint a female person-in-charge to counsel the victim and provide advice relevant to the circumstances. We take various support measures, including providing leave for emotional recovery, changing the work shift, and, if possible and desired by the grievant, reporting the matter to the police or other official authorities. In addition, grievances are handled with utmost care towards non-disclosure and data privacy.\n\nActivities to Uphold the Fundamental Labor Rights1) (South Korea only)\nWe uphold the fundamental labor rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the Republic of Korea.\n\n1) Fundamental Labor Rights refer rights of association, collective bargaining, and collective action as prescribed in the Constitution of Korea.\n\nLabor-Management Advisory Committee\nIn order to promote constructive labor-management relations, we established the labor-management advisory committee in August 2020 under the Board of Directors and appointed four external advisors to the group. The advisors conduct meetings with management and HR executives and listen to and reviews the company\u2019s labor-management issues and makes suggestions for the improvement of mid- to long-term labor-management relations.\n\nConducting training to uphold the fundamental Labor Rights\nWe have provided a training course titled \u2018To Guarantee the fundamental Labor Rights and Prevent Unfair Labor Practices\u2019 to all employees, including the senior management, to raise their awareness on the fundamental labor rights and uphold these rights.\n\nIn particular, in order to hear the improvement of our labor-management relations from an external perspective and suggestions for establishing constructive labor-management relations, the labor expert from outside the company was invited to give our top management a special lecture, creating the foundation for promoting labor-management harmony.\n\nIn addition, for executives, heads and personnel in charge, we invited external experts including labor and academic personnel and civic activists to conduct a enhanced compliance education, learning the relevant systems and laws and sharing examples of external unfair labor actions and implications to prevent unfair labor practices that may occur in the field, such as organization management and personnel management.\n\nCommunication with Labor Unions\nIn order to build a mutually cooperative relationship between management and employees based on trust, we hold regular meetings with each labor union from time to time, listening to the suggestions made by the labor unions and discussing improvement items.\n\nLinks to each labor union\u2019s official website have now been added to our intranet main page, providing the necessary infrastructure to support labor unions\u2019 public relations activities to employees.\n\nProgress in Collective Bargaining\nIn August 2020, four labor unions formed one joint collective bargaining group and requested negotiations for a collective agreement. In response to the call, the company has been holding regular collective bargaining meetings with the joint collective bargaining group. In addition, prior to the commencement of collective bargaining for constructive negotiations, a union office was provided to the joint collective bargaining group and union members were guaranteed the necessary time for bargaining in accordance with the basic labor-management agreement.\nDiversity and Inclusion\n\n\u201cBe yourself. We build a better tomorrow.\u201d\n\nIn every organization, diversities such as sexual diversity, racial diversity, and people with disabilities exist. At the same time, diversities also exist in people\u2019s values, experiences, views, working styles, and preferences. Embracing diversity means not only acknowledging differences but also respecting others as they are. Samsung Electronics aims to create an inclusive corporate culture in which everyone respects the differences in experiences and opinions, providing emotional support so that everyone can achieve their full potential.\n\nCertifications and Recognitions\n\nIn recognition of our efforts to embrace diversity and encourage inclusion, the Korean Ministry of Gender Equality and Family has certified Samsung Electronics as a family-friendly company for eight consecutive years since 2013. In 2020, we were designated as the \u2018Top Employer for Young People\u2019 in Canada. Our US subsidiary is recognized for its inclusive practices for LGBTQ+ employees, earning top marks in the Corporate Equality Index assessment by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation for two consecutive years.\n\nPrinciples on Prevention of Discriminations\n\nBy going beyond compliance with social and legal standards to prohibit discrimination, we aim to strengthen our core capabilities and drive our competitiveness by embracing diversity as a driver to success.\n\nOur Global Code of Conduct and the Guidelines on Prevention of Harassment reflects our principles on preventing discrimination and form part of our credentials as a leader in positive corporate responsibility.\n\nPolicies and Programs\n\nWe believe that true innovation and growth are built on a culture that respects diversity and inclusion. We aim to create a culture in which people with diverse backgrounds and ways of thinking can have equal opportunities and maximize their potential. We have created a global strategy to support our vision around diversity and inclusion. Under the ethos \u2018Be yourself. We build a better tomorrow\u2019, we have developed various events and campaigns to raise awareness of diversity and inclusion among global employees.\n\nThrough the worldwide network among regional D&I managers, best practices are shared and adopted. We remain committed to seeking opinions and insights on diversity and inclusion from all stakeholders, including our employees, consumers, and investors.\n\nCase: Gender Pay Gap\n\nWe published details of our gender pay gap in the UK in 2020, which shows a steady reduction in the disparity of pay between male and female employees. With a focus on supporting women\u2019s employment, cultivating the female talents, and expanding the female leadership, we have successfully closed the gap by 10% over the past three years.\n\nWomen\n\nWork Support\n\nWe are committed to creating a culture that enables talented women to realize their full potential as leaders and role models for future generations. To assist female workers in continuing their careers, we have developed numerous policies and facilities related to childbirth and childcare. In South Korea, we were among the first companies to introduce parental leave, subfertility leave, and extended childcare leave. We continuously strive to go beyond our legal obligations to provide benefits to fulfill our vision. As of 2020, we had 16 in-house daycare centers for up to 3,300 children, and our teacher-to-student ratios were higher than mandated by the relevant laws. We require all our production sites overseas to provide rest areas to protect the health of pregnant women and their babies, and offer a place for breastfeeding.

Our activities to foster a robust safety culture at work includes using our company-wide safety management index, regularly evaluating our safety procedures, assessing the working environment, and enhancing safety capabilities.\n\nHealth and Safety Management System Certification\nAll of our worksites are being managed based on the Health and Safety Management System. After the application of ISO 45001, an international standard for an Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S) management framework, to our business in 2018, our worksites around the world, beginning with those in South Korea, have converted their current OHSAS 18001 certification to ISO 45001. As of end of 2020, all of our manufacturing worksites had acquired ISO 45001 and implemented an OH&S management framework that meets the latest ISO 45001 specifications.\n\nOur OH&S Management System Certifications\n\nSafety Culture Evaluation\nTo sustain an advanced safety-first culture in our worksites, we evaluate the level of our safety culture on an annual basis. The safety culture evaluation assesses the management\u2019s commitment, roles and responsibilities, risk management, communication and participation, environment and safety capabilities, compliance, cause analysis and corrective measures, monitoring and performance management. In 2020, we conducted a comprehensive survey of 26 sites to pinpoint any potential flaws in our approach to safety. The questions were aimed at safety-related performance management and accident prevention and management. Based on the survey results, we have identified several significant challenges and are working on making improvements. To evaluate the safety culture of our semiconductor business, we employed specialist external agencies. As a result, our semiconductor worksites were found to have a Level 3 safety culture among the four assessment levels. This ensures that workers engage in safety prevention efforts willingly. We will continue to enhance our practices to provide a world-class safety culture throughout the business.\n\nCreating a Safe Work Environment\nWe make constant efforts to identify risk factors such as aging equipment, non-compliance with the safety regulations, and the lack of management and control at worksites and devise ways to address such risk factors.\n\nInfrastructure Facilities Management System\nTo prevent risks related to factory facilities at our worksites, we established a Facility Life Management System (FLMS) to facilitate the entire process of procurement, repair, replacement, and disposal of equipment. The FLMS system manages the whole infrastructure management process: from registration of the information about infrastructure and material to operational steps of devising the maintenance plan for equipment and recording inspection results, and analysis of malfunction types based on big data. In addition, we periodically examine the status of the on-site management system and conduct training on compliance with the safety regulations and responses devised for each accident type.\n\nEliminating Risk Factors in Facilities\nSince 2018, we have used drones to conduct inspections on locations and facilities that are difficult to access or can be dangerous to examine in proximity. We introduced drones to our worksites in Vietnam in 2019 to check corrosions, produced drones to our worksites in Vietnam in 2019 to check corrosions, and cracks in our facilities. In addition, we also developed a technology that can automatically collect and analyze the conditions of facilities and applied it to the Semiconductor Division\u2019s worksites in South Korea.\n\nCreating a Safe Work Environment\nWe make constant efforts to identify risk factors such as aging equipment, non-compliance with the safety regulations, and the lack of management and control at worksites and devise ways to address such risk factors.\n\nInfrastructure Facilities Management System\nTo prevent risks related to factory facilities at our worksites, we established a Facility Life Management System (FLMS) to facilitate the entire process of procurement, repair, replacement, and disposal of equipment.

We implemented a selective working hour system and allow the employees to plan out their annual leaves so they can set flexible work hours, strengthening the level of empowerment and accountability to create a Corporate Culture.\n\nWe have implemented a work-from-home policy to improve Work-Life Balance and to navigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the end of 2020, 66% of Samsung employees in sales and research positions overseas were working safely from home. A survey of employees working from home, found communication was more efficient as employees and their supervisors were corresponding more frequently using emails, messenger and video conferencing. It also showed performance was evaluated more objectively, and work efficiency and satisfaction also improved.\n\nIn South Korea, we have designated the payday of each month as a \u2018family day,\u2019 encouraging workers to leave the workplace by 5 p.m. to spend time with their families at home. In certain divisions, family day is now a weekly or bi-weekly practice. When COVID-19 broke out in 2020, we encouraged employees with young children to freely use the \u2018family care leave\u2019 which was well utilized by around 8,200 employees in Korea (8.2% of all employees).\n\nAside from parental leave, employees can also receive a leave of absence and medical expenses to receive fertility treatments. We also prioritize the health and wellbeing of pregnant employees and have created a lounge with a lactation room for mothers. We also operate in-house daycare centers to help employees with the burden of child rearing, so they can better manage their work-life balance.\n\nOur worksites are equipped with various sport facilities where employees can exercise and enjoy sports activities, including soccer, baseball, basketball, ping-pong, squash and swimming. We also sponsor various hobby clubs among employees so they can further develop their creativity and skills in their pursued activities.\nSamsung Culture Index (SCI)\n\nWe conduct an annual employee survey to identify our strengths and areas for improvement in our organizational culture. The Samsung Culture Index (SCI survey) asks questions about the core values of our company: Work Smart, Think Hard, and Build Trust. In 2020, approximately 170,000 employees across 135 locations took part in the survey, although COVID-19 prevented manufacturing employees from participating.\n\nSince the SCI was adopted in 2012, the scores have increased every year, and in 2020, the total score was 84 (excluding employees in manufacturing), which indicates that 84% of the employees are satisfied with the company.\n\nIn 2020, we sought to empower our employees by adopting family care leave (additional support), expanding our work from home policy and promoting health and wellbeing initiatives. This helped contribute to the higher SCI score. In addition, we held online events such as the online fundraising bazaar, virtual team dinner, and online gaming competitions, such as At-home Fitness Challenge and Thank you Card Contest.\n\nRethinking the Way We Work. Re:Work TF\n\nStarting with the Development Teams in 2017, we initiated the Re:Work TF project with the aim of identifying any inefficiencies in our work practices and processes and improving our work environment. The Re:Work T/F tasks have been introduced on a yearly basis in several teams, including marketing, sales, and procurement. With the three goals of \u2018Efficiency, Engagement, and Energy,\u2019 the Re:Work TF sheds light on inefficient practices by listening to employees\u2019 opinions, reviewing the work processes, and carrying out on-site audits, and improves our work efficiency by tackling inefficiencies found.\n\nThe Life Coaching Center\n\nTo support mental wellbeing, we have 14 specialized counseling centers and 10 mental health clinics in South Korea, as well as 11 counseling centers in 20 manufacturing branches around the world. The centers are run by certified specialists and full-time psychiatrists work at the mental health clinics, providing one-on-one counseling and care to workers dealing with a range of issues, including relationships, marriage, family affairs, or stress management.\n\nEach counseling center located in our worksites has a meditation room where programs such as muscle relaxation, meditation, color therapy, and pain relief are offered. We also provide medical prescriptions and psychotherapy sessions to prevent and treat mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety, panic attacks, mood dysregulation disorder, and insomnia.\n\nIn line with the counselors\u2019 code of ethics and the Medical Service Law, individual counseling and treatment information are protected and remain confidential.\nSustainable Supply Chain\n\nWe work in partnership with our suppliers and create an environmentally sustainable and responsible supply chain. In doing so, we consider not only the suppliers\u2019 competitiveness, but also labor and human rights, the environment, and health and safety. We also support our suppliers to grow in the global marketplace through various support programs and we continue our efforts to address the societal and environmental issues of mining minerals.\n\n\u201cWe strive to build an ethical supply chain ecosystem by managing the various risks along the chain and collaborating with suppliers to achieve mutual prosperity.\u201d\n\nEarn-key Joo\nExecutive Vice President, Head of Partner Collaboration Center\n\nSupplier Evaluation\n73% (suppliers given \u201cExcellent\u201d rating)\n* Evaluated once a year based on the overall competitiveness of the first tier suppliers in the supply chain\n\nWin-Win Index\n9 Consecutive years (highest index rating)\n* Rating of conglomerates by the Korean government based on measurement of support provided to small and medium-sized enterprises and surveys\n\nSupply Chain Labor and Human Rights Benchmark\n2nd highest score (KnowTheChain, ICT Sector)\n* Global project to check and evaluate human rights performance along the supply chain\n\nConflict Minerals Sourcing\n100% (RMAP\u00ae Certified Smelters)\n* Assure that minerals used in the supply chain are sourced in ways that are respectful to human rights, the environment and comply with social responsibilities.\n\n1) Responsible Minerals Assurance Process\nSupply Chain Management Enabling Mutual Growth\n\nBased on our vision for purchasing, \u201cWe Buy Value, We Pay Trust,\u201d we strive to share growth within the entire supply chain, taking into account the sustainability of our suppliers.

We also provide our Supplier Code of Conduct Guide for the effective implementation of the Code and to put compliance management processes into practice.\n\nSupplier Code of Conduct\nSupplier Code of Conduct Guide\n\nWork Environment Management Process\n\nSelf-Assessment\n\nWe have developed a self-assessment tool using 85 items based on the RBA Code of Conduct and have distributed it to all our suppliers. Using this tool, suppliers conduct a self-assessment once a year. We also advise suppliers to obtain international certifications such as SA8000, encouraging suppliers to develop and apply socially responsible practices in the workplace and we have incorporated such certification as a self-assessment category.\n\nOn-Site Audit\n\nOn-site supplier audits are conducted by a dedicated team at Samsung Electronics. To enable thorough inspection of the working environment of suppliers, we collect and examine the opinions of suppliers\u2019 employees and identify issues that need improvements. We upload these findings in the G-SRM system and let suppliers submit corrective action plans and implement. We require suppliers to take immediate measures whenever possible, and conduct subsequent audits to determine whether necessary steps have been taken within three months after issues have been flagged. For matters that require substantial time and financial resources, such as investments in facilities and certifications, we check the progress and monitor the improvements based on the corrective actions plans developed by the suppliers.\n\nIn 2020, we conducted on-site audits on 376 suppliers considered to be of high risk. The RBA standards were applied to on-site audits and corrective action plans were implemented, resulting in an average compliance rate of 95%.\n\n1) Criteria for determining high-risk suppliers: Companies in countries with geopolitical risks related to labor and human rights or highly influential suppliers (based on business volume and ratio in their transactions with Samsung Electronics, low rank in self-assessment, or mentioned in the context of work environment issues raised by stakeholders such as NGOs)\n\nWe enforce immediate corrective measures for serious violations such as child labor or forced labor, and impose penalties including business volume reduction based on the supplier evaluation score.\n\nSpecial Audit on Child Labor\n\nWe hold a zero-tolerance policy against suppliers that use child labor, which is why we conduct annual special audits for child labor prohibition. From the audit results of 177 suppliers in 2020, we found that there was no supplier that hired children, but we requested improvements to some suppliers with insufficient controls in their hiring process, such as lack of ID verification, and ensured they addressed the issues.\n\nCase: Special Audit on Child Labor\n\nWe hold a zero-tolerance policy against suppliers that use child labor, which is why we conduct annual special audits for child labor prohibition.

Verify the correction through Closure Audits\nThird Party Audit\nAlthough COVID-19 posed considerable challenges in conducting audits in 2020, third-party audit results have found that suppliers\u2019 compliance rate in 2020 was similar to that of last year and that efforts to improve the working environment were well in progress.\n\nCompliance Rate by Category (Unit: %)\n\n| Year | Labor and Human Rights | Health & Safety | Environment | Ethics | Management Systems |\n|------|------------------------|----------------|-------------|--------|--------------------|\n| 2018 | 95%                    | 96%            | 96%         | 96%    | 96%                |\n| 2019 | 93%                    | 97%            | 98%         | 96%    | 92%                |\n| 2020 | 92%                    | 95%            | 99%         | 98%    | 94%                |\n\n* Compliance rate after closure audit\n\nManaging Ongoing Improvements We require suppliers to provide detailed action plans to address the findings during the initial third-party audit and follow up on the status of required improvements and complete the closure audit. In cases where improvement measures on key areas take a prolonged period of time, we continually collaborate with suppliers to ensure that the necessary corrections are made.\n\nImprovement Rate by Category\n\n| Category                  | Improvement Rate | Examples of Violations |\n|---------------------------|------------------|------------------------|\n| Labor and human rights    | 64%              | Work hours             |\n| Health and Safety         | 84%              | Contingency scenario   |\n| Environment               | 89%              | Waste storage management|\n| Ethics                    | 72%              | Monitoring process     |\n| Management System         | 80%              | Internal audit review   |\n| Total                     | 77%              |                        |\n\n* Improvement rate: (# of findings at initial audit - # of findings at closure audit) / # of findings at initial audit\n\nSupporting Compliance Improvement Efforts\n\nCompliance Education\nSince 2015, Samsung Electronics has been hosting annual compliance management workshops for the management and working-level staff at suppliers. At these workshops, we share our Supplier Code of Conduct and updates on global and local laws and regulations, the supplier audit results and notable cases of improvements, as well as EHS trends in various regions. Furthermore, we provide specialized training for handling chemical substances and also award notable suppliers in the fields of labor and human rights and EHS. In 2020, we conducted these workshops across 321 global companies, and have encouraged suppliers to further share these training contents to sub-contractors based on the principles outlined in Samsung Electronics\u2019 Supplier Code of Conduct.\n\nLabor and Human Rights Education\nIn 2020, we provided labor and human rights education covering various topics including mutual respect, humane treatment, and anti-discrimination to our global suppliers. A total of 583 suppliers and 977 supplier HR staff were trained in face-to-face or online sessions. We plan to enhance our educational efforts and expand participants by developing additional curricula and strengthening the contents, including video materials, and taking a more systematic approach to the operation.\n\nFair Trade Education in Korea\nIn 2020, we rolled out training to 408 suppliers in order to prevent unfair business practices. The training covered Korean regulation regarding fair business transactions in subcontracting and mutual cooperation with small and medium enterprises.\n\nCompliance Special Audit\nWe strive to enhance the compliance level in Malaysia where issues regarding work environments such as migrant workers were raised. After the special audit on forced labor in 2019, from January to April 2020, we visited 26 local suppliers to address the areas of vulnerabilities, and provided customized consulting.\n\nGrievance Resolution\nWe support suppliers in establishing and operating an internal grievance resolution process to facilitate communication between the management and employees. As an extension of this effort, we have been operating a direct hotline for all suppliers since 2013 to receive reports on suppliers\u2019 work environment or workers\u2019 rights issues. In local languages at workplaces, reports are submitted via landline, email, or mobile phone. Posters in local languages are also displayed including offices, hallways, manufacturing sites, dormitories, and cafeterias to provide guidance on the hotline. All grievances are inspected within seven days, and we give feedback to the grievant and track the status of corrective measures.\n\nIn 2020, the most frequently reported complaints were regarding employees\u2019 managers and wages, which we swiftly addressed through appropriate training and reinforcement of communication with suppliers. We have confirmed that improvements were made. In particular, we resolved an unpaid wage claim by a resigned employee, paying out the correct amount owed. This confirmed the effectiveness of our hotlines in addressing grievances and showed that it was an effective channel through which even resigned workers could easily access support.\n\nIn addition, in order to establish a more reliable grievance process, we collected opinions regarding improvement of the hotline from suppliers and conducted informant satisfactory surveys. The results found that the necessary measures were applied to all reports and they were handled while protecting the identity of the grievants. We will continue to further improve this system by working with suppliers.\n\nHotline Reports Status (Unit: No. of reports)\n\n| Year | Complaints related to managers | Wages | EHS | Benefits | Work hours | Others |\n|------|--------------------------------|-------|-----|----------|------------|--------|\n| 2018 | 8                              | 6     | 5   | 1        | 1          | 1      |\n| 2019 | 11                             | 5     | 4   | 3        | 1          | 1      |\n| 2020 | 13                             | 10    | 2   | 4        | 2          | 2      |\nEnvironmentally Responsible Supply Chain\n\nWe work in collaboration with suppliers to highlight their responsibility in ensuring the clean production of eco-conscious products. We advise on a range of topics, including reducing environmental impact, reducing hazardous chemicals, and improving workplace health and safety. We plan to further expand support in this regard moving forward.\n\nEnvironment, Health and Safety (EHS) Improvement Support\n\nConsulting and Training\n\nSamsung Electronics has formed a separate organization to support suppliers\u2019 EHS management, and we operate programs to elevate the level of supplier\u2019s EHS performance, provide EHS consulting, and assist with hazardous chemical handling where needed. In 2020, we conducted regular EHS inspections for a total of 511 key suppliers and provided on-site consulting to suppliers in need of improvements. We provided one-on-one customized consulting to 36 suppliers in urgent need of improvements to raise the level of EHS management. Through this, we raised the level of EHS by implementing 373 specific improvement projects including regular training, risk assessment, and pollutant management.\n\nThe DS division\u2019s \u201cEHS Academy for Suppliers\u201d offers specialized training courses, which were attended by 230,000 employees of suppliers received in 2020.\n\n| Categories                  | No. of classes | Educational Content                                                                 |\n|-----------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Legal Education             | 2              | Establish mandatory safety training, required prior to entering semiconductor business sites |\n| Certification Education     | 7              | Foster qualified managers at suppliers by assessing on-site skills and with question bank method |\n| Skills Improvement Education| 15             | Operate curriculum, including safety and health manager courses, safety leadership courses for employees and managers at suppliers |\n\nEstablishing EHS Management System\n\nWe encourage our suppliers to acquire international EHS certifications, including for environmental management (ISO 14001) and occupational health and safety management (ISO 45001), and take these certifications into account for supplier evaluation.\n\nIn the semiconductor business, we have supported 129 companies over the past seven years to acquire a safety and health management system (KOSHA 18001) certification from the Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency. This helps them build more robust safety and health management systems.\n\nStrengthening Safety Culture\n\nIn 2020, we began the \u201cPacemaker\u201d program to select and cultivate five suppliers with excellent EHS management in semiconductor manufacturing process and support the suppliers to elevate the safety culture through industry benchmarking.

We also support improvements of facilities, such as the local exhaust ventilation systems, chemical storage facilities, and chemical leakage prevention.\n\nIn 2020, as a result of these programs, 13 suppliers replaced hazardous chemicals with safer substances, and 7 suppliers improved the local exhaust ventilation systems.\n\nChemicals in Products\n\nWe operate the \u201cEco-Partner Certification\u201d program for all suppliers to look at both products and the components carefully. Qualifications are granted by reviewing the compliance with the Standards for Control of Substances used in products and the environmental quality management systems of the suppliers.\n\nSuppliers submit to Samsung Electronics the data received from raw materials vendors as well as a warranty letter certifying that the information on hazardous substances is true, and Samsung Electronics visits the supplier\u2019s manufacturing site to accurately verify the documents.\n\nSuppliers must undergo an audit every two years in order to maintain the Eco-Partner certification, and companies that do not pass the audit are restricted from further business with Samsung Electronics.\n\nReducing Suppliers\u2019 Environmental Impact\n\nGHG Emission Reduction\n\nWe have joined the CDP Supply Chain program since 2019 to reduce environmental impacts by our suppliers. We provide incentives, such as additional points for supplier evaluation to those who submit information in accordance with CDP standards, and have set goals for greenhouse gas reduction, and we also host regular seminars for our suppliers in collaboration with CDP.\n\nIn the survey of the CDP supply chain conducted in 2020, 163 suppliers participated, indicating a response rate of about 71%. The number of suppliers that obtain the higher levels on the CDP rating is also increasing.\n\nWe plan to expand education so that more suppliers can participate in the CDP supply chain program. In addition, we will focus on programs to increase the use of renewable energy.\nResponsible Minerals Sourcing\n\nSamsung Electronics is dedicated to minimizing the negative societal and environmental impacts in the process of mining minerals, including human rights abuse, child labor exploitation, and sexual violence, as well as environmental degradation. Recognizing the gravity of the problems of human rights abuse and environmental degradation caused by mineral mining in conflict-affected and high-risk areas, we manage responsible minerals\\(^1\\) sourcing in accordance with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance\\(^2\\).\n\n1) Minerals mined through a process which respects human rights as well as the environment, lives up to societal responsibilities and denounces financing of conflicts.\n2) OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas\n\nManagement Process for Responsible Minerals\n\nWe comply with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance and abide by the 5-step procedures. We work to raise awareness from all our suppliers and conduct reviews of responsible mineral sourcing practice, and preliminary verification and early improvement measures on risk factors. We block any minerals that do not meet the standards from being brought in at our purchasing phase.\n\nWe regularly disclose updates on our responsible mineral management through our website and the sustainability report. We also publish our annual Responsible Minerals Report to ensure full transparency for all stakeholders.\n\nAll suppliers that conduct business with Samsung Electronics comply with the requirements of our responsible minerals policy, and we only use minerals supplied by smelters that have obtained the RMAP\\(^1\\) certification.\n\nWe do not use any minerals illegally mined from conflict-affected areas, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nWe have strengthened our internal management standards, disposing of any wastes containing minerals only to RMAP-certified smelters. We are encouraging urban mines that refine, smelt, and recover types of metals to participate in RMAP as well.\n\n1) Responsible Minerals Assurance Process\n\nExternal Cooperation\n\nIn order to source minerals responsibly and minimize the negative social and environmental impacts in mineral sourcing, we work jointly with our global stakeholders and participate in global organizations such as the RMI\\(^1\\) and EPRM\\(^2\\).\n\nWe support sustainable cobalt mining and are part of the \u201cCobalt for Development\u201d, a project in cooperation with German International Cooperation Corporation (GIZ), Samsung SDI, BMW Group, and BASF in order to contribute to resolving the human rights and environmental issues arising from mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Our goal in this project is to improve the work environment and the living conditions of the surrounding communities impacted by artisanal mining.\n\nIn 2020, Volkswagen joined as a new partner in the project, and together we opened a school for local children and have reached over 2,000 residents with our agricultural and financial education workshops.\n\n1) Responsible Minerals Initiative\n2) European Partnership for Responsible Minerals\n\n| RMAP certified smelters (Conflict Minerals) (Unit: No. of smelters) |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 2018                        | 258 (100%)                  |\n| 2019                        | 261 (100%)                  |\n| 2020                        | 240 (100%)                  |\n\n* Cobalt (Co) Smelters: 27 smelters (as of 2020)\n\n| On-site inspection overview (Unit: No. of suppliers) |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 2018                        | 244                         |\n| 2019                        | 225                         |\n| 2020                        | 427                         |\n\n* In 2020, due to COVID-19, inspections were conducted via evidential data review\n\n---\n\n**Samsung Electronics Responsible Minerals Management**\n\n- **G-SRM System**\n  - Inspect the Use of Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Minerals along the Supply Chain\n  - Conduct Reasonable Due Diligence and Verification on Inspection Outcomes\n  - Verify and Assess Risk Factors within the Supply Chain\n  - Develop Improvement Plans for Risk and Report Relevant Data\n\n- **Sub-Contractors Smelters**\n- **Suppliers**\n  - Raise Suppliers\u2019 Awareness\n  - Inspect the Use of Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Minerals along the Supply Chain\n- **Customers, External Stakeholders**\n\n---\n\n**Responsible Minerals Report**\n\n---\n\n**Seminar for local residents**\n\n**Education for local residents**\nSustainability Foundation\nWe identify sustainability issues that impact our business and actively respond as needed, sharing our progress with stakeholders in a transparent manner through our sustainability report.\n\nWe pool and review all relevant issues based on media reports, peer benchmarking, global standards and initiatives in sustainability management, and expert opinions.

We do not provide any assurance on the achievability of the objectives, targets, and expectations of Samsung Electronics.\n\nThe scope of our engagement conforms to the KPMG Sustainability Assurance Manual\u2122 (KSAM\u2122), including the aspect of \u2018materiality\u2019. With regards to financial data, our procedures were limited to verifying that they were correctly derived from audited financial statements. To obtain a thorough understanding of Samsung Electronics\u2019 financial results and position, the audited financial statements produced on March 09, 2021 should be referred to.\n\nResponsibilities\nAs stated in the \u2018Reporting Principles and Standard\u2019, Samsung Electronics is responsible for all content within the Report in respect of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards. It is the responsibility of Samsung Electronics\u2019 management to establish and maintain appropriate performance management and internal control systems from which the reported sustainability information is derived.\n\nOur responsibility is to perform a limited assurance engagement and to express a conclusion based on the work performed.\n\nIndependence\nIn conducting our engagement, we have complied with the requirements of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants. We do not engage in any and all activities that may influence our independence from Samsung Electronics. KPMG has systems and processes in place to monitor compliance with the Code, and to prevent conflicts regarding independence.\n\nAssurance Standards\nWe conducted our engagement based on the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board, and also AA1000AS. The standards require that we comply with applicable ethical requirements, including independence requirements, and that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the Report is free from material misstatement.\n\nLimitations\nA limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement, and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance on all significant matters that we may become aware of in a reasonable assurance engagement. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance conclusion.\n\nThis report has been prepared solely for Samsung Electronics in accordance with the terms of our engagement. We do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than Samsung Electronics for our work, or for the conclusions we have reached in the assurance report.\n\nMain Assurance Procedures\nOur engagement was designed to provide limited assurance on whether the Report is presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the reporting criteria. Procedures performed to obtain a limited level of assurance on a sustainability report consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for the preparation of information presented in the integrated report, and applying analytical and other evidence gathering procedures, as appropriate.

(hereinafter the \u2018Company\u2019) to independently verify its 2020 Greenhouse Gas Emission Report of domestic corporations and 26 overseas subsidiaries. It is the responsibility of the Company to compile the Greenhouse Gas Emission Report according to the \u2018Guidelines for GHG emission reporting and certification of GHG emission trading scheme (Notification No. 2018-78 of Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy), GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance\u2019 and \u2018ISO 14064-1:2006\u2019 and KFQ has responsibility to conduct verification based on \u2018ISO 14064-3:2006\u2019 to provide verification opinion on compliance of the Report against verification criteria.\n\nVerification Scope\nThrough the verification process according to the \u2018ISO 14064-3:2006\u2019 KFQ could obtain reasonable basis to express following conclusion on the Greenhouse Gas Emission Report.\n\nVerification Opinion\nThrough the verification process according to the \u2018ISO 14064-3:2006\u2019, KFQ could obtain reasonable basis to express following conclusion on the Greenhouse Gas Emission Report.\n\n1) 2020 Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Greenhouse Gas Emission Report was prepared against Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Greenhouse Gas Inventory Guideline\u2019 developed based on the \u2018Guidelines for GHG emission reporting and certification of GHG emission trading scheme\u2019, GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance\u2019 and \u2018ISO 14064-1:2006\u2019.\n2) As a result of materiality assessment on 2020 domestic Greenhouse Gas Emission, material discrepancy is less than the criteria of 2.0% for the organization which emits more than 5,000,000 tCO2-eq/year in accordance with the requirements of the \u2018Guidelines of verification for Greenhouse gas emission trading scheme\u2019.\n3) For the 26 overseas subsidiaries, document review was conducted for entire 26 subsidiaries as well as Company self-assessment. The result of material discrepancy is less than 2.0%.\n4) As reported Greenhouse Gas Emission purchased electricity, process emission by fluorinated gas use and LNG co-combustion take more than 99% of total emission. Activity data of these emission sources were checked through the objective evidence provided by supplier therefore KFQ could confirm that these activity data is valid itself.\n5) The efficiency of process emission reduction technology that affects the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions has to reflect the values guaranteed by the government and third parties. However, the efficiency was calculated based on the Company\u2019s own methodology, and errors are not included in the verification opinion.\n6) For the overseas subsidiaries, each national net caloric value and electricity emission factor were preferentially used but net caloric value and IEA or CDM electricity emission factor were adopted from IPCC Guidelines or Korean Energy Law Enforcement Regulation in any change of these parameters or factors. Also, in case of buying credits(RECs) in the market, the offset credit is applied to evaluate the emission and record separately in market base section.\n7) Except unconsidered emission source in the \u2018Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, Greenhouse Gas Inventory Guideline\u2019, material error, omission or insignificant issues was not found in 2020 Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, Greenhouse Gas Emission Report.\n\nJune 16th, 2021\n\nPresident & CEO Korean Foundation for Quality\n\nJi Young Song\n\nJi Young Song\n## GRI Index\n\n### GRI Standards\n\n| GRI Standards | Status | Page | Comments
