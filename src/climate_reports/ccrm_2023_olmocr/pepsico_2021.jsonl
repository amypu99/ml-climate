(Be & Cheery), BFY Brands, Inc. (BFY), Pioneer Food Group Ltd. (Pioneer Foods), Rockstar Energy Beverages (Rockstar) and SodaStream International Ltd. (SodaStream) is included herein.\n\nTargets apply to PepsiCo\u2019s operations as well as our value chain (e.g., franchise bottlers, joint ventures where PepsiCo has operational control, co-manufacturers, etc.) unless otherwise noted.\nWhat does it mean to be a truly sustainable company?\n\nFor a long time in the business world, \u201csustainability\u201d was a buzzword. A term often applied with little consistency and less intention to various disparate initiatives. In some ways, sustainability used to be a side project or a distraction: a drain on precious resources and a potential drag on the bottom line.\n\nThose days are over. Our stakeholders \u2014 consumers, customers, investors, communities, governments, and NGOs \u2014 demand action. They want a more focused, more integrated approach \u2014 that places sustainability at the heart of business operations.\n\nAt PepsiCo, we recognize that the futures of our company, communities, and planet are all inextricably linked. That reality has been driven home again and again in recent years, first by the COVID-19 pandemic, then the deadly conflict in Ukraine. Through it all, climate change has continued to increase its impact on our fragile ecosystems, leading to extreme weather, crop failures, and changes in the range and abundance of certain plants and animals. All of these issues have resulted in a collision of food shortages, supply chain bottlenecks, and a refugee crisis unlike anything Europe has seen since World War II.\n\nIn this context, we have been thinking hard about what it means to be a truly sustainable company, one that creates growth and value for all of our stakeholders. We know that to be successful five years, 10 years, 20 years from now, we need to create more resilience in our business. And that means we need to change what we do and how we do it.\n\nIn September 2021 we launched a strategic, end-to-end transformation of our business. We put sustainability and human capital at the center of how we will create growth and value, by operating within planetary boundaries and inspiring positive change for the planet and people. We call this approach PepsiCo Positive (pep+), reflecting a new reality where consumers, customers, our associates, investors, regulators, and many other stakeholders are becoming more interested in the future of the planet and society. From sourcing ingredients to making and selling our products more sustainably, pep+ connects the future of our business with the future of our planet.\n\nMessage from the CEO, Ramon Laguarta\n\nWe know that to be successful five years, 10 years, 20 years from now, we need to create more resilience in our business.\u201d\nThe launch of pep+ is a turning point for PepsiCo.\n\nWe have an opportunity to use our scale to help build a more sustainable food system:\n\n- 200+ countries and territories where our products are sold\n- 25+ crops sourced from over 7 million acres in more than 30 different countries\n- >1 billion interactions with consumers each day\n\nBy advancing our pep+ goals, we believe we will be a consistent top market performer and a force for good by doing what\u2019s right for people and the planet.\n\nAs we evolve our approach to sustainability, how we report our progress and success will also evolve.\n\nThis year marks our first-ever Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Summary. The Summary includes how we\u2019re leveraging our brands, people, and scale to create positive change, and illustrates progress with the latest real-life examples. The revamped digital format seamlessly directs stakeholders to the most relevant information, sitting atop a wealth of detailed data, updated regularly on our time-stamped ESG Topics A-Z resource.\n\nIt\u2019s a significant change for us, but we are starting from a position of strength, as Corporate Secretary has recognized us for best ESG reporting for the second year. I am confident that our reporting will only improve as we work toward a fully integrated structure, where we publish our Annual ESG Summary alongside our Annual Report.\nThis inaugural Summary features information on our strategy, goals, and progress with pep+ and its three pillars:\n\nPositive Agriculture\nPositive Agriculture is about our aspiration to source crops and ingredients in a way that restores the earth, makes the soil healthier, sequesters carbon, and eliminates deforestation whilst also strengthening farming communities.\n\nLearn more \u2192\n\nPositive Value Chain\nPositive Value Chain is our focus on making products that build a circular and inclusive economy, including goals for reaching net-zero emissions, becoming net water positive, introducing more sustainable packaging, continuing our Racial Equality Journey, among others.\n\nLearn more \u2192\n\nPositive Choices\nPositive Choices is about using our brands to inspire people to make better choices for themselves and the planet.\n\nLearn more \u2192\nPepsiCo remains committed to taking a leadership role in the creation of a more sustainable food system that preserves the planet and positively impacts people and communities across the world. With the ongoing volatility around the globe, our pep+ agenda continues to be the right path for our planet and our business.\n\nJim Andrew\nChief Sustainability Officer\n\nThe investments we have made in pep+ aim to ensure the sustainability of our business and the hundreds of thousands of jobs we support across our global supply chains \u2013 creating growth and value within planetary boundaries while inspiring positive change for people and the planet.\n\nHugh Johnston\nVice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer\n\nTo illustrate how pep+ looks in practice, take how we envision the transformation of products like our iconic Lay\u2019s potato chip. Lay\u2019s is already the world\u2019s largest food brand. To maintain that position, we need to continue to work toward our goals and take decisive and sustainable actions. That means the chip you love will start with a sustainably grown potato on a regenerative field. Then the chip will be made and delivered from a Net-Zero and Net Water Positive supply chain, sold in a beautiful bio-compostable bag, and be the best tasting product with the lowest sodium levels in the market. That\u2019s the future of the #1 potato chip. That is the future of our company.\n\nWith the current uncertainty in the world, there might be a temptation to slow down our investments in pep+. I don\u2019t believe we should do that. In fact, we should, and will, do the opposite. As leaders, we should continue investing in sustainable packaging and regenerative agriculture, making our supply chains more sustainable and ensuring our brands innovate in positive spaces.\n\nBy becoming better ourselves, we not only meet the needs of our stakeholders but position ourselves for long-term growth. We can help define for the world what it means to be a truly sustainable company, and build a stronger, more resilient future for us all.\n\nRamon LaGuarta\nPepsiCo Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer\nAbout PepsiCo\n\nOur vision is to Be the Global Leader in Beverages and Convenient Foods by Winning with PepsiCo Positive (pep+).\n\npep+ is our strategic end-to-end transformation that puts sustainability and human capital at the center of how we will create value and growth.\n\n>1 billion\ntimes each day PepsiCo products are enjoyed around the world\n\n200+\ncountries and territories where our products are sold\n\n300,000+\nemployees\n\n>$79 billion\nnet revenue in 2021\npep+ pillars\n\nWe\u2019re charting a new course to drive positive action for the planet and people. A better food system means better outcomes for the earth, and all of us.\n\nBy becoming better ourselves, we can help build a stronger, more sustainable future for us all. pep+ will guide our business \u2013 how we operate within planetary boundaries and inspire positive change for the planet and people.\n\nWe\u2019re evolving how we source our ingredients and make and sell our products, and how we inspire people through our brands.\n\nPositive Agriculture\nWe\u2019re working to source our crops and ingredients in ways that restore the earth and strengthen farming communities.\n\nPositive Value Chain\nWe\u2019re helping to build a circular and inclusive value chain.\n\nPositive Choices\nWe\u2019re inspiring people through our brands to make choices that create more smiles for them and the planet.\nOur value chain\n\nAcross our value chain, PepsiCo is using our global reach and expertise to drive solutions at scale.\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s sustainability strategy targets every stage of our complex value chain to use resources more efficiently, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, replenish water, improve our products and recapture packaging materials.\n\nInvestments in our circular and inclusive value chain will help accelerate the systemic change needed to address major global challenges.\n\n1. Agricultural Sourcing\n   PepsiCo sources crops from more than 30 countries and supports more than 100,000 jobs throughout our agricultural supply chain. The standards we apply and promote can help improve the environmental, social and economic health of agricultural communities around the world.\n\n2. R&D and Manufacturing\n   We spent >$750 million on R&D in 2021 as part of our continued investment in developing quality and innovative beverages and convenient foods. Our 294 manufacturing facilities bring together innovators and operations teams who work to use water, energy and ingredients efficiently to create our beverages and convenient foods. In 2021, we produced more than 90 million metric tons of beverages and convenient foods.\n\n3. Distribution\n   PepsiCo products are sold in over 200 countries and territories. In 2021, our company-owned fleet traveled approximately 1.2 billion miles worldwide to bring PepsiCo products to customers. We are working to reduce the impact of those miles by continuing to adopt more efficient vehicles and practices.\n\n4. Consumption\n   PepsiCo products are enjoyed by consumers more than 1 billion times a day. We\u2019re responding to changing consumer preferences by transforming our product portfolio and reformulating many of our beverages and convenient foods to reduce added sugars, sodium and saturated fat.\n\n5. Post-Consumer\n   PepsiCo\u2019s sustainable packaging vision is to help build a world where packaging never becomes waste by driving the shift from a linear economy to a circular economy. We continue to grow our portfolio of Beyond the Bottle offerings, innovate to develop sustainable packaging and work to improve recycling infrastructure.\nOur sustainability journey\n\nIn 2006, PepsiCo started on a journey to transform the way we do business so that we can deliver strong financial returns in a way that is responsive to the needs of the world around us.\n\n2006\nLaunch of Performance with Purpose, integrating sustainability into our daily business operations\n\n2009\nNaked Juice first U.S. brand to transition to 100% rPET bottles\n\n2010\nOur first all-electric delivery trucks hit the road\n\n2012\nPepsiCo wins prestigious Stockholm Industry Water Award\n\n2013\nSustainable Farming Program (SFP) launches; as of 2021, more than 90% of grower-sourced crops are sustainably sourced worldwide through SFP\n\n2017\n1st demonstration farm opens in India; in 2021, 72 farms are testing and sharing best practices around the world\n\n2018\nPepsiCo acquires SodaStream, #1 sparkling water brand in the world by volume, with the potential to avoid 200 billion single-use plastic bottles by 2030\n\n2019\nPepsiCo receives Climate Leadership Award\n\n2020\nPepsiCo achieves shift to 100% renewable electricity in U.S. direct operations\n\n2020\nPepsiCo exceeds safe water access goal 5 years early, delivering access to safe water to more than 55 million people to date since 2006\n\n2021\nPepsiCo announces a 2030 goal to spread regenerative agriculture practices across 7 million acres, estimated to eliminate at least 3 million tons of GHGs\n\n2021\nPepsiCo sets an ambitious new target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040, one decade earlier than called for in the Paris Agreement\n\n2021\nPepsiCo\u2019s Net Water Positive vision sets a new standard in water stewardship\n\n2021\npep+ (PepsiCo Positive) is introduced\n\n2021\nPepsiCo is recognized with the inaugural Terra Carta Seal awarded by His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales and Sustainable Markets Initiative for demonstrating commitment to, and driving momentum towards, the creation of genuinely sustainable markets\nOur reporting strategy\n\nOur reporting is the primary way that PepsiCo informs key stakeholders about our sustainability ambitions and progress. Our stakeholders include investors, potential and current employees, customers and consumers, suppliers, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), regulators and others.\n\nUnderstanding that stakeholder needs differ, we publish a suite of reporting elements, targeted at different stakeholder groups. We combine disclosure of strategy, policy, data and case studies, according to our understanding of stakeholder interest. Our reporting suite comprises:\n\n- **This ESG Summary**: An evolution from our prior Sustainability Report, our digital ESG Summary provides a high level overview of our pep+ agenda and progress made during the year. It aims to demonstrate the integration between ESG and our business, and is designed to link seamlessly with ESG Topics A-Z for more detail and the latest updates. Users can also use the \u2018Report Builder\u2019 functionality to download a version tailored to their interests.\n\n- **ESG Performance Metrics**: Time-series data for our key sustainability goals, intended to support ESG analysis, primarily for financial stakeholders, ESG raters and NGOs.\n\n- **Indices and framework responses and other topic-specific disclosures**: These map our reporting to specific metrics established by key reporting frameworks including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Sustainable Accounting Standards Board (SASB), the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) climate, water and forest responses. It also includes specialized reporting, such as our annual Green Bond Reports.\n\n- **ESG Topics A-Z**: An evergreen deep-dive on around 50 sustainability-related topics designed to provide accessible, consistent information for those looking for greater depth on PepsiCo\u2019s ESG strategy, management, policies, progress and partnerships.\n\nWe are constantly evaluating our goals and progress, assessing the technical and regulatory challenges we face in achieving our ambitious objectives, and innovating new ways to keep moving forward. As frameworks and regulations continue to expand in the U.S., Europe and beyond, and as we encounter new challenges and opportunities, our commitment to transparency in reporting our strategy, goals, initiatives and progress on ESG topics will remain steadfast.\nOur agricultural footprint covers approximately 7 million acres, and our supply chain supports more than 100,000 agricultural jobs worldwide. We work with tens of thousands of farmers to source more than 25 crops and ingredients from more than 30 countries around the world. The goal is a sustainable food system that respects natural resources and makes a positive impact on the people and communities we work with and serve. It\u2019s better for people, better for the planet and better for our business.\n\nWe are taking a landscape approach to advancing regenerative agriculture, marked by collaboration between stakeholders within a designated region \u2013 often spanning multiple crops, sectors and land uses \u2013 to advance shared sustainability goals while reconciling and optimizing multiple social, economic and environmental objectives. And because real change requires long-term, consistent effort, we have launched several initiatives tackling some of our key commodities with this approach in the Midwest U.S., Mexico and Southeast Asia, and plan to expand into new priority landscapes as we progress on our Positive Agriculture journey.\nAgriculture\n\nClimate-related impacts like excessive heat, drought or flooding can impact farm yield and productivity. So we\u2019ve taken steps designed to source our crops in ways that respect natural resources, strengthen farming communities and ensure a secure supply of ingredients for our products.\n\nWe\u2019re supporting regenerative agricultural practices that aim to make soil healthier, sequester carbon, improve watershed health and biodiversity, and strengthen farmer livelihoods. We\u2019re working closely with our farmers and intermediary suppliers to embed these practices throughout our agricultural supply chain.\n\nOur footprint\n\nWe\u2019re using our scale, influence and expertise to do more than just reduce our own impact. Our strategy prioritizes investment, innovation and collaboration with our farming partners and suppliers to deliver positive impact around the world.\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s business relies on a steady, sustainable supply of crops delivered by thousands of agricultural workers:\n\n- ~7 million acres of farmland make up our agricultural footprint\n- 100,000+ agricultural jobs supported\n- Tens of thousands of farmers in our network\n- 25+ key ingredients and crops sourced from more than 30 different countries\n- 90+% of our grower-sourced crops are sustainably sourced globally\n- 345,000+ acres farmed with regenerative farming practices toward goal of 7 million by 2030\n- We are using our scale, influence and agricultural expertise to help build a sustainable food system.\n\n1 Globally, more than 90% of grower-sourced crops were sustainably sourced through our Sustainable Farming Program (SFP), up from 87% in 2020. For grower-sourced crops, sustainable sourcing refers to meeting the independently verified environmental, social and economic principles of PepsiCo\u2019s Sustainable Farming Program.\n\n2 Regenerative acres reported for 2021 include U.S. and Canada only. Regenerative acres demonstrate measured improvement in sequestering carbon to reduce GHG emissions AND at least one other of the following: improved soil health, improved watershed health, improved biodiversity or improved livelihoods.\nSource our crops and ingredients in ways that restore the earth and strengthen farming communities.\n\nRegenerative agriculture goal\n\nSpread the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices across 7 million acres, approximately equal to 100% of the land used around the world to grow our crops and ingredients for our products.\n\n2030 Goal\n7 million acres\n\n2021\n>345,000 acres to date\n\nApproach\n\nWe define regenerative agriculture as a set of farming principles and practices that improve and restore ecosystems while building resilience. Our approach is outcome-oriented, and to some extent, we are practice agnostic. That\u2019s because every farming community is different, with different needs. We\u2019re tracking how soil health, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction and carbon sequestration, watershed management, biodiversity and the livelihoods of agricultural workers are improving. There are some practice categories we\u2019ve identified that help drive those results, and we are working on scaling them.\n\nRegenerative techniques not only protect against soil erosion and water depletion, but they can also help farmers grow more food on the same amount of land. These techniques typically require fewer inputs, so they can also lead to higher margins and greater profitability for our farmers.\n\nIn 2021, we launched an internal co-investment fund to incentivize our local teams to design and scale innovative solutions that contribute to our Positive Agriculture agenda. Now in its second year, the Positive Agriculture Outcomes Fund provides a unique mechanism that reduces the risk and cost of projects with long-term sustainable business potential. To date, nearly $2 million has been granted through the Fund.\n\nIn addition, we understand societal concerns around pesticides and are actively seeking continuous improvements in agricultural practices that minimize pesticide and other agrochemical use. We established a cross-functional Global Pesticide Council composed of senior leaders across key functions to evaluate pesticide issues and direct the Company\u2019s policies and programs. The Council has developed a five-year strategic plan with clear deliverables, including industry benchmarking, and centralized global scientific and regulatory tracking. We also engage with multi-stakeholder groups, peer companies and NGOs to develop, promote and adopt best practices related to responsible use of pesticides.\n\n1 Regenerative acres reported for 2021 include U.S. and Canada only. Regenerative acres demonstrate measured improvement in sequestering carbon to reduce GHG emissions AND at least one other of the following: improved soil health, improved watershed health, improved biodiversity or improved livelihoods.\n\n2 PepsiCo introduced \u2014 and began to measure \u2014 its new regenerative agriculture metric in 2021. Progress presented here reflects our first year tracking this metric and builds on years of partnership and investment in sustainable agriculture.\n\n3 Definitions of regenerative agriculture vary and we\u2019re working across stakeholder groups to align on a standard definition.\n\n4 In the U.S., we helped farmers plant cover crops on over 85,000 acres, an example of how using this regenerative agriculture practice can result in up to a 38% net reduction in on-farm greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including soil carbon sequestration.\nWhat is regenerative agriculture?\n\nOur 72 demonstration farms show the benefits of regenerative farming techniques.\n\nWhat we do\n\nBuild soil health and fertility\n- Rebuild organic matter\n- Train farmers for on-field agronomy\n- Use resource-efficient/compost fertilizers\n- Plant multiple crops in same field\n\nReduce and sequester CO\u2082\n- Plant cover crops to sequester CO\u2082 underground\n- Promote reduced and no-till cultivation for minimal soil disturbance\n- Systemic crop and livestock rotation\n\nIntroduce water efficiency techniques\n- Help farmers access more efficient irrigation equipment\n- Support best practices for scheduling and maintenance\n- Transition from flood irrigation to more efficient methods (i.e., drip irrigation and \u201cfertigation\u201d)\n\nProtect and enhance biodiversity\n- Commitment to no deforestation\n- Pollinator strips on farms\n- Soil microbe breeding\n- Use of natural pesticides\n\nImprove farmer livelihoods\n- Teach most vulnerable farms in supply chain\n- Support women farmers economically\n- Source directly from growers whenever possible\n- Protect workers\u2019 rights\n\nHow it helps\n\nImprove and restore natural ecosystems\n\nIncrease crop yields by growing more food on the same amount of land\n\nFeed more people with fewer inputs\n\nImprove farmer livelihoods through higher sales margins and greater profitability\n\nNet reduction of on-farm GHG emissions\nIn collaboration with our internal experts, industry peers and cross-sector partners, we have developed a practice bank of those activities and practices that contribute to our Regenerative Agriculture goals, a database that we introduced in May 2022 to our farmers and suppliers.\n\nAlongside organizations such as CIAT (International Center for Tropical Agriculture), GIZ, Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research, U.S. Farmers and Ranchers Alliance, World Farmers\u2019 Organization, AgroScout and others, we are supporting farmers to implement adaptive practices, reduce GHG emissions in agriculture and strengthen their field knowledge and management to respond quickly in a targeted way so we can all continue driving the pep+ agenda forward.\n\nWe actively support farmers in our supply chain with programs to make it easier for them to adopt regenerative practices. In the U.S., we helped farmers plant cover crops on over 85,000 acres, resulting in up to a 38% net reduction in on-farm GHG emissions, including soil carbon sequestration1 and provided support to more than 600 farmers in North American farmland by the end of 2021.\n\nOur demonstration farms program showcases practices that are leading to the commercialization of innovative ag-tech and the scaling of proven practices that lead to regenerative outcomes. The demonstration farms enable the farmers we work with to share their firsthand experiences, which encourages broader adoption. In 2021, we worked with 20 different partners to demonstrate farming best practices in areas such as nutrients, water-use efficiency and precision farming.\n\nIn 2021, our partnerships yielded value for farmers, the environment and the business (percent increases observed in a control plot vs a demonstration plot):\n\n- In 28 demonstration farms in India, we saw average yield improvements of almost 7% and reduced GHG emissions by more than 7%, resulting in farmer income increase of $55 per acre on average.\n- In Thailand, we worked with the Department of Agriculture and other partners to implement integrated pest and nutrient management and install drip irrigation systems on our demonstration farms, resulting in an average yield increase of 25% (on seven farms), a 23% carbon emissions reduction and a more than 40% reduction in water use in irrigation.\n- In Mexico, we demonstrated ways to save water through different irrigation techniques and improvements in existing irrigation systems. We reduced water use in irrigation by 36% on average while increasing potato yields by 8%.\n\nBy the end of 2021, we had 72 regenerative demonstration farms as part of the program and over 600 farmers transitioned from demonstration into broader \u201clandscape\u201d impact programs to scale up proven innovation.\n\nIn a landscape approach, farmers in a region align around shared sustainability goals and commit to specific regenerative practices. PepsiCo and our partners support work within the landscape to spread the adoption of regenerative agriculture and deliver outcomes, such as GHG emissions reduction, through funding independent advisories for farmers, facilitating coaching and peer support and financially incentivizing adoption of regenerative practices.\n\nAs we advance on our Positive Agriculture journey, and more farms learn the benefits of regenerative agriculture and adopt its practices, we expect to continue to expand into new landscapes and grow the number of regenerative farming acres we annually report toward our goal of 7 million by 2030. In 2021, we launched several landscape initiatives tackling some of our key commodities in the Midwest U.S., Mexico and Southeast Asia.\n\nClimate resilience is also a key priority to safeguard our operations for many years to come.\n\nIt\u2019s the reason why we joined forces with several strategic partners worldwide to understand the specific needs to fight climate change in every sector in which we operate.\n\n1 For PepsiCo\u2019s corporate GHG footprint, the company follows the GHG Protocol framework where any sequestration is kept separate from the three scopes of emissions.\nHealthy watershed goal\n\nAdvocate for and contribute to a measurable improvement in the health of high water-risk watersheds where we directly source our crops, including an improvement in water-use efficiency of 15% by 2025.\n\n2025 Goal\n\n15% improvement\n\n2016-2018\n\n2019-2020\n\n14%\u00b2\n\n3%\n\nApproach\n\nThrough advocacy and our own initiatives (including promoting regenerative techniques), we\u2019re working to measurably improve the health of high water-risk watersheds where we directly source our crops and aim for a more sustainable way to use this resource. At the end of 2021, we sourced approximately 40% of our grower-sourced key ingredients \u2013 the building blocks of our beverages and convenient foods \u2013 from areas of high water-risk. These efforts are designed to help ensure our continued access to the water we need for production as well as preserve water access for the communities in which we operate. We\u2019ve targeted a goal of improving water-use efficiency by 15% by 2025, compared to a 2015 baseline, throughout our operations. Progress against this goal is measured at least every three years and was last measured in 2020.\n\nAround the world, it is a common practice to use flood or trench irrigation to bring water to crops, causing farmers who use these methods to potentially lose up to 70% of the water used to runoff or evaporation. In the search for a better solution, we partnered with N-Drip, an Israeli company whose irrigation system is powered by gravity and harnesses the water-saving benefits of high-pressure drip irrigation without the need for the energy costs and water filtration associated with high-pressure drip irrigation. PepsiCo aims to scale N-Drip\u2019s technology to help improve farmer livelihoods with higher yields, reduced water consumption and reduced GHG emissions. The goal is global adoption of N-Drip water efficiency technology across 10,000 hectares (25,000 acres) by 2025. In 2022, we plan to expand N-Drip in India, South Africa and the United States as well as kick off a pilot in Greece. The N-Drip cost-share project in India was made possible as a result of a grant from the Positive Agriculture Outcomes Fund.\n\n1 15% improvement goal measured versus a 2015 baseline. The metric was previously reported in our Water section. To focus efforts on implementing sustainable practices, we currently intend to collect and publish agricultural water-use efficiency data at least every three years. High water-risk locations defined by WRI\u2019s Aqueduct tool.\n\n2 Results reflect the exclusion of Pioneer Foods, BFY Brands, Inc. (BFY) and Hangzhou Haomusi Food Co., Ltd. (Be & Cheery).\n\n3 Data for 2021 not available, as we measure this at least every three years.\nPositive Agriculture\n\nSustainable sourcing goal\n\nWe\u2019re already using sustainably sourced ingredients in many of the PepsiCo products consumers know and love. We\u2019ve established sustainable sourcing standards as a baseline expectation for our agricultural suppliers, and we\u2019re supporting farmers in making the transition to more sustainable approaches. These efforts aim to ensure a secure supply of key ingredients while helping improve the livelihoods of farmers in our supply chain.\n\nAround 50% of the volume of our key ingredients are bought directly from farmers through a grower group (\u201cgrower-sourced\u201d), while there are multiple tiers between the farmer and PepsiCo for the other approximately 50% (\u201csupplier-sourced\u201d).\n\nToward our 2030 goal of reaching 100% of sustainably sourced key ingredients, in 2021, we achieved more than 90% on grower-sourced crops as we continue to engage our main suppliers globally.\n\nApproach\n\nTo achieve our goals, we engage suppliers through two approaches:\n\n\u2022 **High-risk approach:** requires high-risk commodities (palm, cane and soy) and commodities grown in high-risk markets to be verified/certified to a sustainability standard recognized by PepsiCo.\n\n\u2022 **Low- and medium-risk approach:** consists of working with suppliers to adopt a continuous improvement model, requiring them to demonstrate active work and progress toward outcomes by 2030.\n\nThese efforts seek to ensure a secure supply of key ingredients while helping improve the livelihoods of farmers in our supply chain.\n\n---\n\n1 For grower-sourced crops, sustainable sourcing refers to meeting the independently verified environmental, social and economic principles of PepsiCo\u2019s Sustainable Farming Program. For supplier-sourced crops, sustainable sourcing is achieved through a third-party standard that has been benchmarked as equivalent to the SFP or, in limited regions, a continuous improvement program addressing the main environmental and social risks with growing the relevant crop. Percentage of volume sustainably sourced and verified by third parties, including volume of certified sustainable palm oil meeting Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) standard and volume of certified sustainable cane sugar meeting Bonsucro or equivalent standard.\n\n2 Cane sugar: Results reflect the exclusion of SodaStream and Pioneer Foods.\nWe supported farmers in making the transition to more sustainable approaches:\n\n**Mexico**\nIn 2021, in Mexico, PepsiCo partnered with a supplier to pilot the Bonsucro Smallholder Standard, which resulted in 25 smallholder producers becoming certified \u2013 among the first in the country.\n\n**Southeast Mexico**\nIn 2021, in Southeast Mexico, we launched Agrovita, a collaborative effort to strengthen the technical capabilities of 1,000+ smallholders to implement regenerative agriculture, increase women empowerment and reduce smallholder carbon footprint.\n\n**Southeast Asia:**\nIn 2021, in collaboration with leading palm oil players, we launched the Kimba Collective \u2013 the largest private sector-enabled forest conservation initiative in Southeast Asia for palm oil to deliver $1 billion for forest conservation and restoration.\n\n**Positive Ag Supplier Playbook**\nIn 2022, we launched a Positive Ag Supplier Playbook at our Supplier Summit, a public resource for buyers and suppliers to activate the goal across our entire key ingredient footprint.\nImproving livelihoods goal\n\nGoal introduced with the launch of pep+ in 2021. Progress reporting for this metric is in process.\n\nApproach\n\nPeople are the foundation of the world\u2019s food system and our business. To ensure the long-term health of both, it\u2019s essential for agricultural workers to earn a wage that enables them and their families to grow and thrive. Yet that\u2019s not always the reality in many parts of the world.\n\nWe support the advancement of farming practices to optimize crop yields, respect human rights and plan to improve the livelihoods of more than 250,000 people in our agricultural supply chain and communities by 2030. This includes economically empowering women. We\u2019ve focused our efforts on our most vulnerable farming communities, including smallholder farmers and farm workers, women and minority farmers.\n\nWomen farmers make up about 40% of the agricultural workforce in developing countries but are often denied key resources that could help them prosper. These resources include, among others, access to land, livestock, education, financial services, agricultural advisory services, technology and rural employment. If women had equivalent resources, it is estimated they could increase their yields by 20\u201330% and increase the agricultural output of their countries by up to 4%, potentially reducing the number of hungry people in the world by 100 million or more.\nOn this matter, we are drafting the livelihood measurement outcome indicators to track the number of livelihoods improved in PepsiCo\u2019s agricultural supply chains and communities. The indicators are designed to be relevant across different crops, scale of operations and geographies.\n\nPepsiCo and the PepsiCo Foundation promote greater diversity and inclusion in farm management, including support for female farmers and people of color, through partnerships with organizations like the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), CARE and the National Black Growers Council.\n\nIn 2021, we continued working with USAID on a 5-year, $20 million partnership to support women-owned and women-led enterprises among PepsiCo suppliers in rural farming communities in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. The programs will improve resiliency in these communities and show that inclusivity leads to better business results.\n\nWe launched the Next Generation Agriculture Fund with the IADB, a partnership in which we aim to test and demonstrate the impact of gender-smart solutions along our agricultural supply chains in Dominican Republic, Ecuador and Guatemala. This three-year, $2 million partnership between PepsiCo LatAm Corporate Affairs, the Global Sustainability Office\u2019s Agriculture team and the IADB includes an innovative talent acquisition and development program, as well as field activities that plot the use of inclusive and gender-smart solutions that enhance farmers\u2019 resilience and contribute to PepsiCo\u2019s Positive Agriculture goals.\n\nOur promotion of regenerative agriculture techniques and support for open-source agricultural technology and information also helps improve farmer livelihoods. Regenerative practices can help farmers increase yield, leading to higher margins and greater profitability. Our support programs, such as cost-sharing for cover crops and peer-to-peer learning at our demonstration farms, help farmers ease the transition.\n\nSupport for open-source agricultural technology and information can have a similar impact. We worked with Corteva Agriscience to sequence an entire oat genome and made it publicly available to enable the creation of more resilient, productive and profitable varieties.\n\nIn addition, we became a founding partner of AgMission, an unprecedented initiative to reduce GHG emissions in agriculture with a $5 million commitment to expand our efforts toward creating a more sustainable planet.\n\nAcross the board, we see bilateral, multilateral and pre-competitive partnerships as critical to the ongoing success of pep+, the achievement of our 2025 and 2030 goals and the overall resilience and sustainability of our key supply chains. They are instrumental in leveraging and mobilizing a wide range of technical and financial resources that support farmers as they make the transition to more regenerative and inclusive practices, ones that will contribute to improved environmental and social outcomes. We cannot achieve these ambitious sustainable business objectives without these collaborations across supply chains, geographies, industries and sectors.\npep+ pillars\n\nPositive Value Chain\n\nA value chain is the full range of activities needed to create a product or service.\n\nOurs begins with the crops grown by our farmers and suppliers, which are made into food and drinks and packaged at our manufacturing facilities, then delivered to stores where they are purchased, consumed and later recycled or collected as waste.\n\nPepsiCo is building a circular and inclusive value chain to accelerate the systemic change needed to address major global challenges.\n\nWe\u2019re taking direct action aimed to reduce impacts relating to climate, minimize water use and introduce more sustainable packaging. We are also working to increase racial equality and provide meaningful jobs and opportunities.\nPositive Value Chain: Climate\n\nOur world is already feeling the effects of climate change and faster, bolder action is needed. Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will benefit society and it\u2019s also crucial to the viability of our business, as we are experiencing the impacts of climate change directly within our own value chain.\n\nUrgent action is needed to decouple economic growth from carbon emissions. The increasingly severe impacts of climate change are affecting the quantity and quality of agricultural raw materials for our products, creating weather patterns and events that affect the operation of our facilities and supply chain and limiting the availability and quality of water.\n\nTo achieve the level of decarbonization that the world needs to avert the worst impacts of climate change will require action at every level. At PepsiCo, we\u2019re striving to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040, a decade earlier than called for in the Paris Agreement and we\u2019ve set an ambitious interim goal for reducing absolute emissions across our value chain by more than 40% by 2030, including a reduction of 75% in Scope 1 and 2 emissions (2015 baseline). These goals will not only have meaningful impact in themselves, but will also drive greater scale for systems like renewable energy and regenerative agriculture, which must become standard in our industry.\n\nOur climate action strategy\n\nReaching net-zero GHG emissions while increasing business resiliency\n\n**MITIGATION ACTIONS**\n- Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to decarbonize our supply chain\n- Reduce virgin material use, increase recycled materials like rPET and use low-carbon alternatives or renewable materials\n- Shift to renewable electricity and fuels globally\n- Continue to develop sustainable manufacturing, warehousing and distribution\n\n**RESILIENCE OPPORTUNITIES**\n- Scale sustainable agriculture\n- Enhance business continuity plans in preparation for extreme weather events\n- Plan manufacturing footprint adjustments for sea level rise/potential flooding\n- Drive regenerative agriculture and explore heat-resistant crops to address climate change effects on growing cycles\n- Increase water security through holistic watershed solutions to manage droughts\n- Decarbonize ahead of a potential carbon tax\n\n2021 PepsiCo ESG Summary\nGoals & progress\nAchieve net-zero emissions across our value chain by 2040\n\nGHG emissions reduction goal\n\nReducing total Scope 1, 2 & 3 emissions by more than 40%1,2\n\n| Year | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Goal | 3%   | 2%   | 5%   | 23%  |\n\nScope 1 and 2 emissions reduction goal\n\nReducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 75%1,2\n\n| Year | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Goal | 1%   | 4%   | 6%   | 9%   | 23%  | 25%  |\n\nScope 3 emissions reduction goal\n\nReducing Scope 3 emissions by 40%1,2\n\n| Year | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Goal | 3%   | 2%   | 3%   | (5)% |\n\n---\n\n1 Measured versus a 2015 baseline.\n2 Where 2021 actual data was not available, estimated 2021 data was used.

Our emissions target aligns to the Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C pledge and has been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative.\n\nWe\u2019re planning to transition to 100% renewable electricity through a diversified portfolio of options across all our company-owned and controlled operations globally by 2030 and across our entire franchise operations by 2040.\n\nWe are investing in zero- and near-zero emission delivery vehicles for our company-owned fleets and partnering with others to support decarbonization of the broader transport industry. We are improving energy-use efficiency and working to scale renewable fuel solutions at our manufacturing facilities.\n\nPepsiCo is proud to be among the companies that are putting substantial investment behind climate action. We issued a Green Bond in 2019, one of the first food and beverage corporations to do so, and as of the end of 2020, $858 million of the net proceeds had been allocated to investments that can make a lasting impact on our sustainability goals in packaging, decarbonization and water.\n\nWe\u2019re working to scale regenerative agriculture practices that reduce emissions and sequester CO\u2082 across the equivalent of our 7 million acre global agricultural footprint, through efforts like our demonstration farm program.\n\nWe\u2019re investing in research and development of bio-based materials, increasing recycled content in our packaging (targeting 50% across our plastic packaging by 2030) and working with peers, policymakers and innovators to develop recycling infrastructure, while advocating for smart policies and engaging consumers in our vision that packaging never becomes waste.\n\nThese global challenges will require partnership and collaboration among many companies and organizations, as well as international cooperation. We are actively engaged in and seeking out partnerships that help us further our goals.\n\nTo reach these ambitious goals, we\u2019re transforming how we operate across our entire value chain.\n\nWe\u2019re planning to transition to 100% renewable electricity through a diversified portfolio of options across all our company-owned and controlled operations globally by 2030 and across our entire franchise operations by 2040.\n\n1 Total renewable electricity as a percentage of total electricity associated with manufacturing & warehouse operations, fleet operations, offices and distribution centers.\n\n2 This metric is ranked by the EPA Green Power Partnership.\nAs a beverages and convenient foods company, PepsiCo is acutely aware of the critical role water plays in the food system, and it is our vision that wherever in the world PepsiCo operates, water resources will be in a better state because of our presence.\n\nWe were one of the first companies to acknowledge access to clean, safe water as a fundamental human right and essential for health, well-being, dignity and economic mobility. In this era of COVID-19, safe water access is more important than ever.\n\nThe PepsiCo Foundation is already more than halfway to our goal of delivering safe water access to 100 million people by 2030.\n\n### Positive Value Chain: Water\n\n**Our path to net water positive**\n\n| How is PepsiCo working to be net water positive? |\n|-----------------------------------------------|\n| **USE LESS WATER** |\n| **How** |\n| Increasing water efficiency in manufacturing: |\n| \u2022 Piloting technologies to capture, condense and clean water used in potato chip manufacturing |\n| \u2022 Adopting Alliance for Water Stewardship Standard in high water-risk manufacturing facilities |\n| \u2022 Working with franchise bottlers and third-party manufacturers to raise water efficiency standards in supply chain |\n| **REPLENISH WATER** |\n| **How** |\n| Partnering with leading NGOs to deliver nature-based solutions to strengthen and repair degraded ecosystems by: |\n| \u2022 Restoring wetlands and forests burned down by fires |\n| \u2022 Removing non-native species that negatively impact local watersheds |\n| \u2022 Using solar pumps and other sustainable land management tools to control water levels and prevent runoff |\n| **PROVIDE SAFE WATER ACCESS** |\n| **How** |\n| Investing in distribution, purification and conservation programs that: |\n| \u2022 Support the construction of water supply and sanitation facilities |\n| \u2022 Help farmers irrigate their crops by collecting, treating and reusing rainwater |\n| \u2022 Improve access to hygiene in schools and sanitation in households |\n\n**To ensure safe drinking water for communities where we operate**\n\n**To protect local watersheds**\n\n**To mitigate risks to our manufacturing water supply**\nPositive Value Chain: Water\n\nGoals & progress\n\nOperational water-use efficiency goal\n\n| Year | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Goal | 1%   | 2%   | 4%   | 9%   | 15%  | 18%  |\n\n2025 Goal: 25%\n\n2021 Results:\n- 18%\n\n2020 Results:\n- 15%\n\n2019 Results:\n- 9%\n\n2018 Results:\n- 4%\n\n2017 Results:\n- 2%\n\n2016 Results:\n- 1%\n\nNet zero water goal\n\nEnsure we have net water positive impact by achieving:\n\n- Best-in-class water-use efficiency in 100% of high water-risk manufacturing sites, PepsiCo and third-party facilities (for PepsiCo facilities, this equates to more than 50% reduction in absolute water use from 2015 baseline year)\n- World-class water-use efficiency in all other manufacturing sites, PepsiCo and third-party facilities\n\nBest-in-Class High Water-Risk Manufacturing Sites\n\n| Year | 2020 Goal | 2021 | 2030 Goal |\n|------|-----------|------|-----------|\n| Beverages (liters/liter) | 0.4 | 2.4 | 1.8 |\n| Convenient Foods (liters/kg) | 6.4 | 5.0 | 4.4 |\n\nWorld-Class Non High Water-Risk Manufacturing Sites\n\n| Year | 2020 Goal | 2021 | 2030 Goal |\n|------|-----------|------|-----------|\n| Beverages (liters/liter) | 1.8 | 1.8 | >100% |\n| Convenient Foods (liters/kg) | 6.4 | 5.0 | 4.4 |\n\nLocal watershed replenishment goal\n\nReplenishing back into the local watershed more than 100% of the water we use\n\n| Year | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Goal | 9%   | 11%  | 8%   | 10%  | 18%  | 34%  |\n\n1 25% improvement goal measured versus a 2015 baseline.

Goal ambition expanded to include third-party facilities (100%) and more than 100% for company-owned operations by 2030.\nPositive Value Chain: Water\n\nWater Stewardship Standard goal\n\nApproach\n\nAs one of the first companies of our size to acknowledge water as a human right, we have a vision to become \u201cnet water positive.\u201d We have adopted an approach to watershed management that includes improving water-use efficiency across our value chain: on farms and in manufacturing facilities; replenishing water in the local watersheds that are most at risk and where we operate; and increasing safe water access for communities that face scarcity.\n\nOur target to become net water positive in 100% of high water-risk company-owned and third-party manufacturing facilities by 2030 means achieving best-in-class water-use efficiency at company-owned facilities in high water-risk areas (a more than 50% reduction in absolute water use against a 2015 baseline), and world-class efficiency at all other manufacturing facilities.\n\nTo meet our efficiency goal, we\u2019re expanding our focus from about 100 manufacturing sites to more than 1,000 sites around the world, including 350 sites in high water-risk areas. Achieving our goal will place us among the most water-efficient food or beverage manufacturers in the world. We are also in the process of adopting the Alliance for Water Stewardship Standard at 100% of our company-owned high water-risk manufacturing sites by 2025.\n\nWe are piloting innovative manufacturing technologies, including a groundbreaking method to recover more than 50% of the water used in potato chip manufacturing by condensing and treating evaporated steam, effectively capturing and reusing the water contained in the potato that would have otherwise been \u201clost\u201d as steam. Our pilot testing showed the approach could save approximately 60 million liters of water a year.\n\nTo achieve our goal of replenishing more than 100% of the water that we use back into the local watershed by 2030, we\u2019ve established strong partnerships with leading NGOs such as The Nature Conservancy and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to deliver nature-based solutions that strengthen and repair degraded ecosystems. Last year alone we replenished more than 6.1 billion liters of water through these projects. We also serve on the corporate advisory group for water for the Science Based Targets Network (SBTN), piloting the draft methodology for setting science-based targets for water.\n\nExplore these topics in more depth\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s ESG Topics A-Z resource provides detail on strategy, data, policy, progress and more on a wide range of subjects.

Our broad-based strategy includes reducing the plastic we use, driving recycling and use of recycled materials, and reinventing our packaging to use new renewable materials or drive growth in low- or no-packaging formats.\n\nA circular economy for packaging can help ensure that the valuable materials that are used in packaging are recycled and reused, rather than becoming waste. Using renewable or recycled materials also reduces the GHG impact of our packaging, supporting our emissions reduction goals.\n\n**Positive Value Chain: Packaging**\n\nPepsiCo envisions a world where packaging never becomes waste.\n\n**Our sustainable packaging vision**\n\nHow we\u2019re working toward our vision of a world where packaging never becomes waste:\nGoals & progress\n\nVirgin plastic reduction goal\n\nCut virgin plastic from non-renewable sources per serving across our global beverages and convenient foods portfolios by 50%.\n\n2021: 5%\n2030 Goal: 50%\n\nNon-renewable virgin plastic reduction goal\n\nReducing our absolute tonnage of virgin plastic derived from non-renewable sources by 20%.\n\n2021: 5%\n2030 Goal: 20%\n\nMinimize single-use packaging materials goal\n\nScaling new business models that avoid or minimize single-use packaging materials.\n\nGoal introduced with the launch of pep+ in 2021.

We\u2019re aspiring to use our reach and influence to help change the way society makes, uses and disposes of packaging. Yet systemic change is not something we \u2013 or any single organization \u2013 can accomplish alone. We\u2019re in dialogue with policy makers and working with industry coalitions, producer responsibility organizations, trade associations and community-based organizations throughout the packaging value chain to improve infrastructure, advocate for sustainable policies and accelerate innovation.\n\nWe\u2019ve announced ambitious new goals around our aim to reduce our use of virgin plastic, use more recycled content in our plastic packaging and scale business models like SodaStream that avoid or minimize single-use plastic. These new targets complement our 2025 goal of making 100% of our packaging recyclable, compostable, biodegradable or reusable.\n\nAchieving these ambitious goals requires investment and innovation. We face challenges from the limitations of existing technology and regulations. But our commitment to continue to strive toward these goals is unwavering. That\u2019s why we\u2019re scaling new business models that avoid or minimize single-use packaging materials. These include models that reuse, refill, prepare at home or utilize concentrates like powders or drops. We\u2019re also seeking to use market-leading bio-based materials and more recycled content (50% across our plastic packaging) to reduce absolute tonnage of virgin plastic from non-renewable sources across our entire portfolio. To further reduce use of single-use plastic packaging, we plan to set a time-bound goal by the end of 2022 for a percent of volume of beverages to be delivered via strategies that avoid or minimize single-use packaging, such as reusable and refillable bottles or containers.\n\nIn 10 European markets, key Pepsi-branded1 products are expected to switch to 100% rPET2 bottles by 2022. Moving to rPET bottles is estimated to reduce GHG emissions by roughly 30% per bottle. In the U.S., we sell LIFEWTR in 100% rPET bottles and Pepsi Zero Sugar will begin to be sold in 100% rPET bottles by the end of 2022 (we plan to convert all Pepsi-branded products in the U.S. to 100% rPET bottles by 2030).\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, we launched 100% rPET beverage products in Australia, New Zealand, Vietnam and Argentina. We are transitioning several brands to 100% rPET across 22 global markets.\n\nIn early 2022, PepsiCo Europe set a new ambition to use 100% recycled or renewable plastic in all crisp and chip packets by 2030, which is expected to reduce GHG emissions from film packaging for food by up to 40%.\n\n---\n\n1 Includes Pepsi, Pepsi MAX, Pepsi MAX Lime, Pepsi MAX without caffeine, Pepsi Light, Pepsi Light without caffeine.\n2 Abbreviation for \u201crecycled PET (polyethylene terephthalate)\u201d plastic.\nPositive Value Chain: Packaging\n\nSustainable packaging goal\n\n| 2025 Goal | 100% | 87% | 87% |\n|-----------|------|-----|-----|\n| 2020      |      |     |     |\n| 2021      |      |     |     |\n\nApproach\n\nWe are exploring renewable, non-fossil-fuel-based sources for packaging materials, such as plant-based materials that are safe, efficient and have a lighter carbon footprint than fossil-fuel based plastics. We prioritize materials that avoid the use of food resources or virgin plastics, like bio-based materials, and have partnered with other organizations to develop these materials and scale new technologies.\n\nWe are a member of the NaturALL Bottle Alliance and its effort to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of beverage containers, and work with the Pulpex consortium to develop the world\u2019s first fully recyclable paper bottle that we are working to commercialize and scale.\n\nTo reduce plastics across primary, secondary and tertiary packaging, we have light-weighted our bottles, reduced thickness of our films and cut down on shipping and other packaging materials.\n\nBy investing in breakthrough food packaging technology, we are now able to introduce a commercially compostable bag made of plant-based materials. Our Frito-Lay plant-based brand Off The Eaten Path offers this commercially compostable packaging in the U.S. at Whole Foods stores. To support our goal of creating a circular food packaging system, we license this technology to other companies at no cost.\n\nWe\u2019re also continuing to scale new business models that avoid or minimize single-use packaging materials.\n\nWe expect the growth of our global SodaStream and SodaStream Professional business will help consumers avoid an estimated 200 billion plastic bottles through 2030. As part of this effort, SodaStream is bringing PepsiCo flavor options such as Pepsi Zero Sugar, Lipton and bubly and SodaStream Professional to additional markets by the end of 2022.\n\n1 Goal expanded in 2021 to include reusable packaging, updated metric not measured in prior years.\nRecycling rate goal\n\nInvest to increase recycling rates in key markets by 2025.\n\nOur actions include:\n\n- Educating and encouraging consumers to recycle\n- Partnering to increase and improve recycling infrastructure and building solutions for current and future material streams\n\nApproach\n\nSystemic change requires partnership across the packaging supply chain. PepsiCo is working with peers, policy makers and innovators to drive progress toward a circular economy. We\u2019re helping to develop infrastructure, advocating for smart policies and engaging consumers so that packaging never becomes waste. We support well-designed Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) policies and are investing resources and expertise into recycling infrastructure improvements.\n\nSince 2018, PepsiCo and the PepsiCo Foundation have announced more than $100 million to global recycling partnership initiatives to help elevate recycling rates and waste collection. In late 2021 and early 2022, we announced we will invest $15 million in the Closed Loop Partners\u2019 (CLP) Leadership Fund, a private equity fund focused on strengthening recycling infrastructure and building circular supply chains, and $35 million to help create the Closed Loop Local Recycling Fund, to advance new small-scale, modular recycling systems in communities across the U.S. We are also a founding partner of CLP\u2019s Composting Consortium, a founding member of the Closed Loop Infrastructure Fund, and have invested in the CLP Beverage Fund through American Beverage\u2019s Every Bottle Back Initiative.\n\nExplore these topics in more depth\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s ESG Topics A-Z resource provides detail on strategy, data, policy, progress and more on a wide range of subjects.

Today we are building on that history with new programs aimed at making PepsiCo an even better place to work and empowering our associates to make a greater impact on their communities.\n\nAt the same time, we are ensuring that our associates have the skills that our business needs to succeed in the future.\n\nWe have launched digital learning and development platforms on a global basis as part of our plan to digitize the employee experience and make it easier for associates to connect and collaborate regardless of location. This digitization is made possible by providing employees with new technology solutions such as occupancy sensors, a workspace reservation app, smartboards and integrated meeting technology.\n\nWe are developing new training, upskilling and advancement programs aimed at providing meaningful growth opportunities to associates at every career stage. For example, myeducation is a new debt-free program that will help more than 100,000 frontline and professional U.S.-based associates develop their capabilities and take their career in a new direction. myeducation offers access to more than 100 flexible education and upskilling programs from highly reputable schools and universities. PepsiCo will cover 100% of tuition costs, books and fees for a wide variety of education programs within the debt-free catalog.\n\nFrontline associates are the core of our workforce, and we want to make sure they can build meaningful careers. We\u2019re creating greater transparency around frontline job opportunities, reevaluating degree requirements for roles and eliminating these where possible, implementing skills-based hiring and developing pathways to salaried positions.\n\nYet a meaningful job is more than day-to-day responsibilities. Our One Smile at a Time program is a local volunteer initiative to encourage, support and empower associates with the resources and time needed to cultivate prosperity in their community. One Smile at a Time is accessible in more than 21 languages and provides a framework, resources and infrastructure for associates to access and register for volunteering opportunities through the PepsiCo Foundation, our Employee Resource Groups, Green Teams and our individual brands.\nPositive Value Chain: People\n\nGoals, progress & approach\n\nBuild a better workplace and world by advancing human rights and diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) for our people, in our business partnerships and our communities\n\nRacial Equality Journey managerial representation goals\n\n| Goal | 2020 | 2025 Goal | 2021 | 2020 |\n|------|------|----------|------|------|\n| Achieve 10% Black representation in U.S. managerial populations | 8.0% | 10% | 8.3% | 8.0% |\n| Achieve 10% Hispanic representation in U.S. managerial populations | 9.5% | 10% | 9.3% | 9.3% |\n\nIn 2020, we launched our Racial Equality Journey (REJ), a more than $570 million set of commitments with a focus on three pillars: People, Business and Communities. Within our own walls, we focused on increasing the representation of Black and Hispanic associates at PepsiCo, to mirror the workforce availability of the communities where we work, through active recruitment, education, internships and apprenticeships. Outside our walls, we\u2019re using our scale and influence across suppliers and strategic partners to increase Black and Hispanic representation and elevate diverse voices. In our communities, we\u2019re working to drive long-term change by addressing systemic barriers to economic opportunity and advancing economic empowerment for Black and Hispanic Americans.\n\nReduced inequalities goal\n\n| Goal | 2020 | 2025 Goal | 2021 | 2020 |\n|------|------|----------|------|------|\n| Continue to help address inequalities for historically marginalized people and underserved businesses and communities | | | | |\n\nWe\u2019ve expanded our supplier base and are on track to increase our spending with Black and Hispanic suppliers by more than $500 million by 2025. We launched the $50 million Juntos Crecemos platform to strengthen Hispanic-owned businesses (specifically restaurants, bodegas and meat markets), address foundational business challenges and support business growth over five years.\n\nThe PepsiCo Foundation created the IMPACTO Hispanic Business Accelerator to provide $10 million in funding to help 500 Hispanic small food and beverage business owners in 13 cities across the U.S., and launched a $10 million investment with the National Urban League (NUL) to launch the Black Restaurant Accelerator Program. Over the course of the five-year program, the PepsiCo Foundation and NUL will provide 500 Black restaurant owners in 12 cities with capital, technical assistance and mentorship services.\n\nPepsiCo and the PepsiCo Foundation created a new $40 million scholarship and professional mentoring program to support Black and Hispanic aspiring and graduating community college students. The program aims to support 4,000 students over five years.\n\n1 Goal added to pep+ vision in 2021.\nPositive Value Chain: People\n\nWomen in management goal\n\nAchieve and sustain 50% women in management roles\n\n| 2015 Goal | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|-----------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| 38%       | 39%  | 40%  | 41%  | 41%  | 43%  |      |\n\nPay equity goal\n\nAchieve and sustain pay equity for our global professional population by maintaining a comprehensive global pay equity review process.\n\nWomen and men continue to be paid within 1% of each other.\n\n1 After controlling for legitimate drivers of pay and based on base compensation; analysis excludes frontline. U.S. and U.K. included in 2016 analysis. 21 countries included in 2017 analysis. 33 countries included in 2018 analysis. 69 countries included in 2019 analysis. 71 countries included in 2020 analysis, representing more than 99% of salaried population. 72 countries included in 2021 analysis, representing more than 99% of salaried population.\n\nWe have a longstanding review process designed to promote pay equity across employee groups. We\u2019re building on that history as we strive to achieve our goal of pay equity by implementing a more comprehensive global pay equity review process. In 2021, we implemented this process in 72 countries that collectively make up more than 99% of our salaried employee population. Our results show that among this population, women and men are paid within 1% of each other (based on base compensation), after controlling for legitimate drivers of pay such as job level, geographic location and performance ratings.\n\nSupplier Code of Conduct goal\n\nExtend the principles of our Supplier Code of Conduct to all of our franchisees and joint ventures by 2025.\n\nOur actions include:\n\n- Continuing to engage directly with our franchise and joint venture partners on our key priority areas, including human rights\n- Completing expansion of our Sustainable Sourcing Program to franchise and joint venture partners in Europe and Latin America\n\nWe are committed to driving fair and safe working conditions throughout our value chain, and we have established a goal that will extend the principles of our Supplier Code of Conduct to all our franchisees and joint ventures by 2025. As part of this process, we have updated the contractual requirements for new partners to help clarify our expectations going forward and have initiated a formal program to engage our franchisees and joint ventures on our human rights agenda.\n\nWomen in management goal\n\nWe believe that ensuring that women have equal access to employment and promotion is necessary for a prosperous and sustainable society.\n\nAs part of our commitment to making actionable improvements for women, we are focused on retaining and growing diverse talent through mentoring, coaching and development programs throughout career stages. These efforts include our Women with Purpose program, a partnership with FUNDES Latin America that provides education, employment and entrepreneurship opportunities to more than 12,000 women from 2016\u20132022. We are investing approximately $1.8 million in this program.\nPositive Value Chain: People\n\nHuman rights goal\n\nOur actions include:\n\n- Revising our Global Human Rights Policy to strengthen our expectations and reflect emerging best practices in several areas, including our salient human rights issues\n- Piloting a new remote worker voice initiative with over 500 workers to gain insight into potential risks in our direct operations, and planning to further scale this initiative within other operations in 2022\n- Continuing to expand our Sustainable Sourcing Program to additional segments of our external value chain (e.g., contract labor providers) and evaluating additional areas for expansion in 2022 (e.g., transportation and logistics)\n\nAs part of this approach, we focus our efforts on our most salient human rights issues \u2013 those at risk of the most severe negative impacts through our company activities and business relationships. We identified vulnerable worker groups \u2013 including migrant workers, women, young workers and temporary/contract workers \u2013 as a salient issue for our value chain and are taking action to address the human rights impacts faced by these groups. For instance, we recently joined the Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment, a collaboration between leading companies and expert organizations to drive positive change in the way migrant workers are recruited. Through our engagement, we are collaborating with other global brands to embed the Employer Pays Principle and advocate for improved protections for migrant workers throughout the value chain.\n\nWe recognize that success can only be achieved when all our stakeholders \u2013 including farmers and growers, factory workers and community partners \u2013 are treated with dignity and respect. PepsiCo is committed to respecting the rights of all workers and communities throughout our value chain. To help ensure we are in the best position to prevent, identify and address potential impacts, we established a global human rights approach that is guided by the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs).\n\nInjury-free work environment goal\n\nOur actions include:\n\n- Continue to strive for an injury-free work environment\n\nWe are committed to respecting human rights and driving fair and safe working conditions throughout our value chain, including maintaining high safety standards and targeting an injury-free work environment.\n\nSafe water access goal\n\nOur actions include:\n\n- Reach 100 million people with safe water access\n\nAccess to clean, safe water is a fundamental human right and essential for health, well-being, dignity and economic mobility. In this era of COVID-19, safe water access is more important than ever. We\u2019ve established strong partnerships with leading NGOs to drive watershed replenishment efforts, and last year alone we replenished more than 6.1 billion liters of water into local watersheds. PepsiCo and the PepsiCo Foundation are already more than halfway to our goal of delivering safe water access to 100 million people by 2030.\n\n1 In late 2021, we initiated a strategic review of our salient human rights issues to ensure we are focusing on the rights at risk of the most severe impacts throughout our value chain. We anticipate concluding this review and providing a more detailed update in late 2022.\n\n1 Progress showcases Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR) per million hours worked. While this metric is new to our pep+ agenda, metric has been previously reported on our Environment, Health and Safety page on ESG Topics A-Z.\n\n2 2021 and 2020 results reflect the exclusion of SodaStream and Pioneer Foods. 2019 results reflect the exclusion of SodaStream.\n\n1 Metric counts the cumulative number of people provided with access to safe water since 2006. Goal increased to 100 million by 2030, having achieved more than 50 million in 2020. This metric was previously reported in our Water section.\nPositive Value Chain: People\n\nFood security goal\n\nThroughout the world, communities with better nutrition are more likely to flourish. Children are better educated, economies grow and people live healthier, better lives. PepsiCo and the PepsiCo Foundation are working to make nutritious food more accessible for underserved communities around the globe with a goal of providing nutritious food to 50 million people by 2030 (against a 2021 baseline), and providing safe water access to 100 million people (against a 2006 baseline).\n\nFor over a decade we\u2019ve been partnering with leading organizations to increase access to nutritious food for children and their families around the world through Food for Good, our global commitment to advance food security in communities where we live and work. These collaborative efforts and investments range from short-term food access to long-term solutions to hunger.\n\nWe partnered with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Baylor University Collaborative on Hunger and Poverty (BCHP) and Food for Good to ship millions of meals directly to the doorsteps of displaced children in rural communities. Meal boxes delivered by postal workers provided two weeks\u2019 worth of shelf-stable, individually packaged nutritious food that met USDA\u2019s summer food requirements.\n\n1 Initial target setting for this metric did not include Pioneer Foods, which delivered accessibility for over 20 million people in 2021. Goal introduced with launch of pep+ in 2021. Progress results include programs funded by the PepsiCo Foundation that are intended to provide nutritious meals, utilizing external standards established by the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United States (FAO).\n\nExplore these topics in more depth\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s ESG Topics A-Z resource provides detail on strategy, data, policy, progress and more on a wide range of subjects.

We intend to set a new quantifiable goal to reduce our use of single-use packaging for a percent of volume of our beverage portfolio by the end of 2022.\n\nWe work with external partners to develop more sustainable packaging solutions. We\u2019re working to scale biodegradable film resins for next-generation convenient foods packaging, and with our supply chain providers to scale compostable, renewable, bio- and paper-based and reusable packaging solutions.\n\nIn partnership with the packaging technology company Pulpex Limited, we are working to develop the world\u2019s first sustainably sourced, fully recyclable paper bottle, made from wood pulp, and our Frito-Lay brand launched commercially compostable packaging made primarily from non-food, plant-based sources for its Off The Eaten Path Veggie Crisps snacks line.\n\nWe continue to expand our portfolio of Beyond the Bottle beverages. SodaStream is bringing PepsiCo flavor options such as Pepsi Zero Sugar, Lipton and bubly and SodaStream Professional to additional markets by end of 2022. Our SodaStream Professional business is a mobile-enabled platform that allows people to customize their water away from home, including at offices, colleges and airports, with reusable bottles. SodaStream plans to switch all its flavors from virgin plastic to alternative materials including metal and rPET, which is expected to eliminate the need for nearly 200 million virgin plastic bottles by 2025 in addition to the more than 200 billion plastic bottles the brand is expected to help consumers avoid by 2030.\n\nSustainable foods packaging goal\n\nOur actions include:\n\n- Expansion of pilots with rollout of Off The Eaten Path commercially compostable packaging in Whole Foods in the United States\n\nIn our convenient foods business, we are investing in breakthrough food packaging technology and business models that offer new ways to deliver our convenient foods, including refill-on-the-go bulk dispensing models.

More and more people today are purchasing with purpose, expecting that corporations be accountable for the role and impact they have on the planet.\n\nData shows that more than half of consumers expect brands to have strong purpose and give back to society, and when consumers think a brand has a strong purpose, they are 4.5 times more likely to champion the company and recommend it to friends and family.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, our powerful brands are taking action \u2013 imagining and implementing steps toward a better future while aiming to deliver the Positive Choices our consumers want and amplify positive outcomes. This includes efforts to drive greater recycling, educating people about the planetary impacts of their buying choices and empowering consumers with transparent environmental labeling on our key products.\n\nOur good partnerships\n\nGoals & progress\n\nPlanet + People Brands goal\n\nLeverage our scaled brands to embody and amplify positive outcomes for the planet and people, including empowering consumers with transparent environmental labeling on our key products.\n\nGoal introduced with the launch of pep+ in 2021. We are in the process of establishing our reporting methodology for this metric.\nOur consumer brands have joined the pep+ planet + people agenda, launching initiatives around the environmental and societal causes where they can have the biggest impact:\n\n**Pepsi**\n\nPepsi educates consumers on the benefits of recycling (through Trash Talk activation with the NFL) and supported Black-owned and Hispanic-owned restaurants in the U.S. during the pandemic.\n\n**Quaker**\n\nQuaker is expanding their Qrece program in Latin America, a program with the PepsiCo Foundation, CARE and Un Kilo de Ayuda, which addresses the basic needs of malnourished children, beginning with a healthy meal and ending with the ingredients for a promising, fulfilling future.\n\n**Lay\u2019s**\n\nLay\u2019s supports female farmers in Egypt, Peru and Uganda and celebrates the local origin of our potatoes in our key markets, including the U.S., Mexico, Turkey and Brazil. In addition, Lay\u2019s RePlay initiative, in partnership with the UEFA Foundation for children and streetfootballworld, reuses empty chip packs to help create sustainable football pitches, uniting communities around the world through the power of football.\n\n**Doritos**\n\nDoritos supports the LGBTQ+ community across Latin America with the ambition of promoting diversity, equality and respect by continuing the Doritos Rainbows initiative. In the U.S., Doritos promotes Solid Black, an initiative that amplifies bold Black voices of strength and resilience and aims to empower and give young Black people a positive platform to showcase their identity.\nPositive Choices: Planet + people brands\n\nApproach\n\nAt PepsiCo, we are listening to consumers and taking the initiative to be more purposeful wherever we can. We're thinking about where ingredients are sourced and by whom, how much water and energy is used to make our products, how we can be more efficient and sustainable with our packaging solutions, and how our brands show up for their communities.\n\nWe know we don't have all the answers on this journey. Partnership is the key to progress, bringing expertise, complementing our capabilities and increasing trust and credibility. We're engaging with key partners with shared ambitions, including the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, The Nature Conservancy, World Wildlife Fund and Sustainable Brands.\n\nWe are working to develop industry-wide environmental labeling standards that let consumers know that buying a particular product will help build a more sustainable food system \u2013 from the way the ingredients were grown, to the way it was made, to the way it was designed to be consumed.\n\nWe're proud that our brands are leading the charge to become sustainability leaders, from Pepsi-branded products in 11 European markets transitioning to 100% rPET bottles by the end of 2022 (which is expected to eliminate over 70,000 tonnes of conventional virgin plastic per year and reduce GHG emissions per bottle by roughly 30%) to the effort of Frito-Lay\u2019s Off The Eaten Path to reduce GHG emissions by offering commercially compostable packaging made with 85% plant-based materials.\n\nExplore these topics in more depth\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s ESG Topics A-Z resource provides detail on strategy, data, policy, progress and more on a wide range of subjects.

This document reflects progress against our sustainability goals, as they were structured in 2021. For detail on how we measure performance against these goals, see the Calculation Methodology on ESG Topics A-Z.\n\n### About our evolving ambitions\n\nThe introduction of pep+ (PepsiCo Positive) in 2021 gave PepsiCo the opportunity to re-evaluate its sustainability goals. For some of these, we made the decision \u2013 based on our latest understanding of needs and opportunities \u2013 to extend the scope and/or level of ambition. In most of these cases, we are now striving to achieve results by 2030 in line with our broader pep+ agenda.\n\nWe have also introduced 17 new goals that align with our pep+ vision to operate within planetary boundaries and inspire positive change for the planet and people.\n\nThroughout this ESG Performance Metrics Sheet, we have indicated these new and evolved goals with the symbols indicated in the key below. Detail on specific goals is provided in the \u201cComments\u201d column throughout.\n\n---\n\n### POSITIVE AGRICULTURE\n\n| Target Metrics | Status | 2030 Target | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | Comments |\n|----------------|--------|-------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|----------|\n| Spread the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices across 7 million acres, approximately equal to 100% of the land used around the world to grow our crops and ingredients for our products | + | 7 million acres | >345,000 acres | Goal introduced with the launch of pep+ in 2021.
